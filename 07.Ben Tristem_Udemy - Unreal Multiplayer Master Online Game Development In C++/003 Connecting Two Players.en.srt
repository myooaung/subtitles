1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,220
Welcome welcome welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,350
We're going to get straight stuck in with actually figuring out how to jump in and have two players

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,280
in the game look at this.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,790
I've got my first player which I'm going to be calling Harry running around in front of my other player

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,180
which I'm going to be calling Bob.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:25,840
And you can see that on Bob's screen he can see me running back and forth and not only that I can swap

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,660
into Bob's screen and move him around and Harry can see me moving around.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:37,000
And I just want to show you how easy it is with an Real's built in multiplayer support to achieve this.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,050
In fact we're going to retrieving this in one lecture the first lecture.

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,130
So you are going to be having a whale of a time.

11
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,480
Let's dive right in.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,230
Okay so we're diving right into Unreal.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,540
Out at the outset.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,070
So why want you to do right now is go and make sure you've got the latest version unreel and Visual

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,410
Studio or X code.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,960
If you are on a Mac.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,850
So here in these videos I'm going to be using four point seventeen.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,110
But these instructions should work for other videos if they don't let me know and I will fix them.

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,480
So as I said four point seventeen Let's go ahead and launch.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,710
This is the stage at which should go and pause video and get it running because for the rest of this

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,010
video we are going to be showing you you can have your hands on your lap and waiting for be unreal installed

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,780
to happen.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,660
But I'm going to show you and then at the end of the video I'm going to challenge you to do the same

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,200
thing.

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,960
So it's important that you have a real ready by then.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,940
So go ahead and pause if you haven't done so already.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,350
So that was my quick note on unreel versions and as you can see here how have forgot to update the bar

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,580
at the bottom but generally what I'm going to be doing is updating that bar to show you where we are

29
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,480
in the video.

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,660
Okay so next up we I've got four point seventeen open.

31
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,440
What we're going to do.

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,180
Well we are going to be making a puzzle platform game third puzzle puzzle platform game.

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,720
So the logical place to start is with a third person lay out so let's just have a look at that.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,520
I'm going to create the base project here.

35
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,990
So I'm going to go to the new project tab in the unreal project browser to the C++ tab and we're going

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,720
to be using that third person example which is probably quite familiar to you if you use a lot of unreel

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,870
before.

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,670
Now I'm going to exclude any starter content excluder have maximum quality do a desktop console set

39
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,720
up and what am I going to do.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,170
Well I'm going to put it.

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,090
It's already selected the folder I want to put it in and I am going to just give it a name which is

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,350
going to be puzzle platforms.

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,960
That I'm using camel case and no spaces.

44
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,910
So I'm going to go ahead and create that project obviously.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,080
You call it whatever you like put it wherever you like it.

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,960
The important thing is just that you know where it is and that you are consistent in naming and all

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,470
that source Good stuff which you should probably be familiar with at this point.

48
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,850
So we got to go ahead and just leave it to compile at this point and build the project and do all the

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,190
fiddly things that unreel likes to do.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,290
Now the whole point of diving right into Unreal here before I even told you about our course is before

51
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:21,640
I have even told you about how to go and get support and anything else about this multiplayer journey

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,560
that we're taking is because it's just so easy to get started and get a quick win with multiplayer and

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,420
real and I want to show you just how easy that is and get you diving right into one real from the get

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:31,710
go.

55
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,980
So that's what we're going to be doing we're going to be learning how we can test with multiple players

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,720
in unreel just with a very simple base project.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,580
Now as I said you can just be following along with your hands on your OF FUN real is updating where

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,770
you having to install Visual Studio vice or so on and so forth.

59
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,080
Well that is just fine or you can be following along as well.

60
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,060
It's not going to hurt if you are following along.

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,750
That's going to be the challenge later for those of you who are still downloading and stalling.

62
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,270
So here I've got visual studio has popped up.

63
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:08,020
We're also going to see that we have had our own real editor pop up here with a very common third person

64
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,720
example map.

65
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,390
Go ahead play they go.

66
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,270
Here's my third person he can run around.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,380
He can jump around and it's all very fluid and lovely and good graphics as unreel is very noted for.

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,740
So how do we go ahead and do this thing which I am saying at the bottom test with multiple players.

69
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,330
Well we just go to the drop down menu next to play.

70
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,090
It's as simple as changing the number of players we can select to players.

71
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,300
And if we go ahead and hit play you will see that we've got one player.

72
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,390
There's a second player over there and where is he.

73
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,300
Well if I go and windows tab then I'm going to see that there's another window here which is my second

74
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,710
player and I can control that second player to.

75
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,600
Again I can jump around walk around and let me just prove it to you.

76
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,280
Here's my other player he can see.

77
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,680
But the other non-plan Number two is now standing in front of me let's call him Harry this player that's

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,560
running around now.

79
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,350
And Bob as the other player that is second place.

80
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:11,800
So Bob can run in front of Harry and Harry can see that Bob has run in front of him that's all hunky

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,910
dory fantastic.

82
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,690
And if you don't believe me that it's not happening at the same time I'm just going to stick these two

83
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,760
windows right next to each other like so.

84
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,800
And I'm going to repossess.

85
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,650
So I do possess there.

86
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,010
What's going on.

87
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,820
I've not got focus.

88
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:39,010
And if I go to my windows a bit small but in this extra expand toolbar menu I can go in and hopefully

89
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:45,010
possess or a ject player so that I'm possessing and you can see that's running around.

90
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:51,890
This is Harry I believe if I move Harry around then Bob's screen can see that very same movement.

91
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,580
Okay.

92
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,960
So that's quite cool.

93
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,600
A lot's going on there under the hood.

94
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,690
In order to achieve this so let's have a little chat about what is going on under the hood in unreel

95
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,260
when you change the number of players and hit play.

96
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,610
In fact what's going on when you hit play full stop you know why we got this little character here and

97
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,640
why are we able to control him and where.

98
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,670
Why is that other dude.

99
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,150
Bob we called him.

100
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,550
Why is he spawning over there.

101
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,550
Let's find out.

102
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,150
So what's going on under the hood is that unreal is loading a map.

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,600
That's kind of.

104
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,270
And Real's central concept is the map and you have a map loaded in the editor.

105
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,590
And so when you hit play that map is the one that you're playing.

106
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,230
So there's a map simple.

107
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,430
Okay now the map specifies game mode.

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,310
You've come across game modes before.

109
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,190
Just to remind you if you go into you I think it's the blueprints menu on the toolbar.

110
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,020
Then you can see that there's a project settings and there's a game mode but you can also override the

111
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,000
game mode for a world.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,220
Now World and maps are more or less the same thing there's a little bit more information in a world.

113
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,980
But for our purposes world equals a map now.

114
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,900
Then we've got a play a controller who joins the map.

115
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,640
That's when we put two players vs. one player we create two player controllers and join them into the

116
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,270
map.

117
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,690
So that means that we've got two players essentially.

118
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:24,500
But we need a little character controls so this is where the player control and asks the game mode to

119
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,960
spawn a pawn for it.

120
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,440
Then that pawn is linked to the player controller and you can move around.

121
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,330
Now this link actually happens over the network when playing in a multiplayer game out or playing in

122
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,470
multiple screens.

123
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,320
But we will worry about the link over the network in greater detail later.

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:51,070
So no worries about that just yet so it is now time for you to do the same thing hopefully unreel has

125
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:56,710
finished downloading for you or setting up if not you may have to pause and wait around a little bit

126
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,640
but do don't go too far.

127
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,780
Don't get tempted away by things so this is a challenge slider he can tell by the pause symbol down

128
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,080
in the bottom right.

129
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,110
And in this challenge I'd like you to get set up so here is the definition of the challenge I'd like

130
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,120
you to make sure unreal as finished updating and it's all up to date installed.

131
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:24,320
I'd like you to create a third person project just like I did and test with multiple players again just

132
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,150
like I did try fiddle around try playing with three players see what happens and try using the different

133
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,230
types of play mode.

134
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:36,260
So for example I had just to hit play but there's other types of play mode such as a new editor window

135
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,790
standalone game simulate see what happens with those different types.

136
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,640
Game mode.

137
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:47,570
And then finally as a bonus for those of you who know what version control is make sure you have got

138
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,730
your version control all set up with a guess ignore and things like that.

139
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,370
If he's in gear it obviously has been or mercurial.

140
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,380
All have their own different ways of ignoring files that you don't want to be version controlling.

141
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,580
If you know about version control you already know about that.

142
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,150
I do recommend you read up on it.

143
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,080
If you've got the time and the interest case a pause video and have a go at the challenge.

144
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,860
Okay welcome back.

145
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,610
So the final part of this challenge that I haven't showed you is what happens if we do a play in editor

146
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,430
Ed a new edit window.

147
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:25,080
Very simply what we've got going on here is that we've now got two windows one for Harry and one for

148
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,630
Bob which can be quite handy especially if you've got multiple monitors to move them into two monitors

149
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,350
like I have.

150
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,380
And you can see them side by side now.

151
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,830
I'm not going to be using that feature because you guys won't be enough to see the other monitor so

152
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,910
let's just close.

153
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,670
So that's the most useful play mode.

154
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,980
The other ones will do other things such a standalone game will actually spawn it into a separate process

155
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,000
etc. etc..

156
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,630
It's not terribly important but the main one is there that you know about the new play an editor window

157
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,050
back.

158
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,750
Be quite helpful indeed.

159
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,550
Okay so with that there is just that final bonus part of the challenge which you can go ahead and skip.

160
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,160
If you're not using version control which is to set up a YOUR version control set up a kit ignore now.

161
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,350
I already have some version control running here I've got source tree in the background to those of

162
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,410
you familiar with Gimp.

163
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,650
Then this may be a tool that you're using you might be using the get command line.

164
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,490
Those are all sorts of ways.

165
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,570
If I go and have a look at my uncommitted changes we can see that I've got my puzzle platforms I made

166
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,540
it in the right directories where I already had get set up.

167
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,060
You can see that my puzzle platforms has got lots of uncommitted changes and some of which we don't

168
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,590
really want to be keeping such as these visual studio database files.

169
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,580
They are good as going to be a bit of a nuisance aren't they.

170
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,150
So let's not version control those.

171
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,990
Let's make sure we go and get a premade version control gitte Ignore.

172
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,440
And I'm going to go ahead.

173
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,230
Open up.

174
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,270
Chrome and I'm going to just search for unreel Gates.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,160
Ignore because you're going to find it very very easily on the gitte hubs.

176
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,970
Here we go.

177
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:07,940
Here's the hubs and I am going to look at the raw version of the file because this version I can right

178
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:16,160
click save a has and I am going to right click save as in to my one puzzle platforms puzzle platforms

179
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,040
directory said this is important thing is the root of the unreel project that's where we want to save

180
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,460
it.

181
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,940
And as always we want it to be called Dot gate.

182
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,470
Eg.

183
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,170
Naw exactly like that.

184
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,790
No spaces no capitalization and a dot at the beginning.

185
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,180
We go ahead save that you see downloaded and we can hop on over into source tree.

186
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,000
Maybe with an EF 5 refresh or maybe not.

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,450
Here we go.

188
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,350
It's already done it and we've got rid of all those ugly files though didn't want.

189
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,450
We can stage we can commit this.

190
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,640
I'm going to commit this off-screen because that's what I usually do and we are good to go set up with

191
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,330
version control.

192
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,250
We are golden and I'll see you in the next lecture we were going to talk a little bit more about this

193
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,590
course and how to get the most out of it.

194
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,320
See you there.
