00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,740
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,550
We are going to be dealing with the jerkiness of the authority.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:15,550
We're going to be making it so that when it goes in front of the autonomous proxy as a simulated proxy

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,390
we have got more smoothness than we were going to have previously.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,660
Bear in mind that this only getting an update once every second.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,090
And it still seems like it's basically being controlled in the same game world as our autonomous proxy

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,970
with just a little bit of glitching.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,870
So how are we going to achieve that.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,310
Well we're going to be looking at what else we can replicate.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,360
So let's dive in and find out.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,880
So at the end of the last lecture I erroneously said that would be dealing with lag in this I got a

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,210
little bit ahead of myself.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,420
In fact what were going to be dealing with is a slightly different plot problem.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:56,020
If I go ahead and play hopefully with multiple players we have two players and I am going to play them

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:03,220
in stand alone windows and you get a two window and stick them side by side like so then what we are

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,830
going to see if I drive my old Thomas is exactly what we saw at the end of the last lecture.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,210
That's all fine but what about.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,550
And he may have tried this yourself.

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:20,560
If we drive the authority and have a look at it simulated proxy over on the client's site you can see

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,420
that this juddering around everywhere because it is only getting its transform updates once every second.

21
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,920
Every time there is a network update and we can't do anything in between because it doesn't know what

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,300
the velocity of the car is it doesn't know anything about this car.

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,460
So how are we going to go ahead and fix this.

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,460
Well it's pretty straightforward.

25
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,450
We're going to be replicating the velocity.

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,980
If you feel really really comfortable with this then just go ahead and try and get this car to look

27
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,120
as me as possible.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,950
But if you're still not entirely comfortable follow along with me for the velocity and then I'm going

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,990
to say your challenge.

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:03,130
So let's go over in to Visual Studio and we're going to go in to the go cart dot h file and we are going

31
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,600
to locate our velocity and we're going to make it replicated how we're going to do that we're going

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,330
to copy the property with the replicated tag or what's it called annotation or something like that.

33
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,220
So it's going to be your property replicated close bracket.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,740
And then what we're going to do.

35
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,660
Well we know that it's not enough just to mark things as replicated you also to go into the C++ find

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:32,500
the get lifetime replicated props and you need to copy and paste this and do rep macro with the first

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,460
argument as go a go.

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,220
We know this we've done this just two lectures ago and we are going to copy in velocity as the thing

39
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,650
that we were enabling replication form we go ahead and build that.

40
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,450
So what that's going to do basically it's going to say that when we update the velocity through the

41
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:59,560
server through calls to the server which may be directly if we are a server ourselves or if we are a

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,280
client and then when we get input player input we are going to call move forward move forward is going

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,190
to set our own throttle and then call the server move forward server move forward is going to set the

44
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,050
throttle value on the server the service going to calculate things and eventually it's going to set

45
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,840
the velocity and once it's sensed the velocity it's going to get replicated down to all the simulated

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,650
proxies.

47
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,700
So the simulated proxy's between their transform updates will be able to run this tick code but with

48
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,440
a velocity set rather than a velocity just being set to zero.

49
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,790
So this is very very helpful.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,330
So we're going to see what the result is.

51
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,350
So the compile completed Let's dive in to the added turn.

52
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,890
Have a play that's hung on a stick.

53
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:53,870
My authority over on the left and my client on the right and drive the authority in front of the client

54
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,750
say go we've got something much much more smooth but you can see there's still some issues particularly

55
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,780
around rotation.

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
So what's going on here.

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,800
You can see that especially accelerating and speeding up.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,420
There are some jolts.

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,150
And we can also see that when turning round especially turning round in a complete circle you can see

60
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,250
it's just going off and what's essentially a tangent to the circle is going off in a straight line at

61
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,310
all points has no idea how to make circular motion because we're just transferring that velocity and

62
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,890
between updates it keeps going in that direction that we last told it about seeing as I'd expect it's

63
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,870
going faster and faster here but the velocity is we're just going off in these directions like so.

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,150
So it's got better.

65
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,480
It's definitely not just jolting from one place the other there is some smooth update in between.

66
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,040
But I think we might be able to make it even better.

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,660
We might be able to do better than this sort of jerky motion.

68
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,840
So I'm actually going to ask you to solve this in your challenge to make it smooth.

69
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,560
So we are going to ask the question why is the motion still jerking in fact you're going to ask yourself

70
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,730
that question.

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,460
Why is this motion jerky.

72
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,980
What could I do that could possibly improve the jerkiness of the car.

73
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,510
Then think about what else you might be able to replicate to improve the motion of the car make it smooth.

74
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,750
And then finally ask yourself once you have made it smoother.

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,570
Can I do better.

76
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:26,930
Is there anything that we can do better or have we reached a fundamental limit on how smooth this car

77
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,040
can look without being the autonomous proxy.

78
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:30,630
Okay.

79
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,300
So pause the video and have a go at the challenge.

80
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,750
Okay welcome back.

81
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,510
So the trick here if you've asked yourself the question about why it's jerky is because we're just getting

82
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:50,030
the velocity which has already been calculated from the input throw and from the steering wheel throw

83
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,760
basically.

84
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,660
So we're going to have to replicate the input to the simulated proxy the autonomous proxy already has

85
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,080
the input but the simulated proxy does not.

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,900
And that is going to allow us to get as close as possible to the automate the autonomous proxy.

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,070
Obviously we can't ever be as good as the autonomous proxy because there will always be a delay in input.

88
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,010
So will always be some way behind and will only ever get the update from the autonomous proxy once every

89
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,550
second.

90
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,300
So we can't be as smooth as the autonomous proxy we never will be.

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,650
But that's okay.

92
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,590
We are just trying to get as close as we possibly can.

93
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:33,320
So with that said let's go ahead and implement this.

94
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,580
It's really very simple.

95
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,280
You could probably do it with your eyes closed by now.

96
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,580
You can put the property replicated in front of both the throttle and the steering throw.

97
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,790
Those were the words I was groping for before.

98
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,140
And we are going to go and look for again the Wherever they gone and hidden.

99
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,770
This particular method kantner were put at the top of the bomb.

100
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,160
Now go get lifetime replicated propertys and I'm going to copy and paste both of those.

101
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:09,440
We're going to have one setting the throttle to replicate the other setting the steering throat to replicate.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,050
And with that done we can go ahead and build.

103
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,940
And just to reiterate.

104
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,820
Why are we doing this.

105
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:25,190
We're doing this because with the throttle and with the steering throw we're able to say okay the car

106
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,920
is currently going round the circle until I'm told otherwise by the server I am going to keep going

107
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,790
round in a circle.

108
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:38,230
Obviously it's not going to be right if at some point in the between the updates the autonomous player

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,070
had decided to stop going around the circle.

110
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,010
But for now it's going to be all we can do.

111
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,710
So let's go back into the unreal Ed and hit play.

112
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,990
And stick our authority on.

113
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,970
That left.

114
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:59,690
And our client on the right and drive the authority around in front of the client and you can see it's

115
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,070
definitely going round in circles.

116
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,760
It's looking a bit smoother.

117
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,050
Obviously doesn't know when I stopped going round the circle.

118
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,370
It does its best and then corrects for it.

119
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,700
So I can see when I'm just going round a circle continuously.

120
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,130
It's doing just fine.

121
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,770
When I leave the circle it sometimes goes on going in the circle a little bit longer but then corrects

122
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,220
for itself.

123
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,730
So with Gore as close as we can get right now to having the replicate controls for the simulated proxy

124
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,200
so pat yourself on the back and now in the next lecture we really will be dealing with lag.
