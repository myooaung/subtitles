00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.350
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.610
And the next a continuation lecture.

3
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.070
We are going to be working on getting a hostname so when I hit host now we get a host game menu that

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.580
allows us to enter you enter any name at all and go ahead and host that game.

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.750
And then we're going to go over to our main menu and join.

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.570
And when we join from another instance we are going to see the server name that we specified as you

7
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.610
can see here donkey instead of the random string that we were getting before.

8
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.720
And if you're using steam then the host name is actually going to be your steam username.

9
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.420
So this is all starting to make sense.

10
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.740
Now let's dive in and see how we can achieve this.

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.150
So in this letter we are investigating customer session settings.

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.860
We're going to be looking at how we can set custom session settings how we can retrieve them and how

13
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.030
we can use this fundamentally to set a server name for our specific sir.

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.050
But on steam.

15
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.860
So the customer settings are the easiest way to do this let's dive in and see first of all how we are

16
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.170
going to be setting them.

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.080
So I'm going to go in to my puzzel platforms game instance and in here.

18
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.900
Whoops I've already started typing That's all I've typed.

19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.070
As you can see from the Save is that were going to add a line to assertion just underneath where we're

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.750
setting our session settings and we are going to do a session settings dot and then we're going to do

21
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.600
a dot set and Dot set.

22
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.580
Let's have a look at the documentation for it.

23
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.680
So just looking at the documentation for f online session settings are also linked.

24
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.010
You'll notice in here we have got a set.

25
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.910
But we have no we have a get as well which is useful for getting a combination of B sessions.

26
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.030
So okay we've got session settings we can set it but what does it take.

27
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.370
There's a couple of things it takes.

28
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.780
It takes a key which is just an F name.

29
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.710
It takes a value type and it takes an E.

30
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.020
Online data advertised minute time.

31
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.730
So let's take a look at that one that's a bit more confusing than the others.

32
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.560
That tells us whether or not this session should tell other computers that are going to join whether

33
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.740
they need.

34
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.940
Well basically this data whether it should be via any online service by paying via both the safe side

35
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.720
you can use just the via online services and paying that I'll make sure that your data gets sent across.

36
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.790
And what about this other type that we had here the value type.

37
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.440
Well to get a bit more information on that actually going to need to look in the engine code.

38
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.220
So I'm going to F 12 to the sight of the definition of this which is under let's see session setting

39
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.460
c p p s few from session settings P that we could go with.

40
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:09.520
I think we want the one that ends with just the f name and value type and the E Online.

41
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.890
So the last one I believe and if we go and have a look at this then just above it in the definition

42
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.810
we have got some explicit instantiation of supported types for the set template.

43
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.520
So this tells us the types basically that we can be passing in we could have an n30 to we could have

44
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.410
a float a you 64 a double an F string a ball and an array of any of these types.

45
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.280
So that's pretty straightforward there's not many options here but there's quite enough for us to be

46
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.090
getting on with and certainly enough for us to send a name.

47
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.590
So let's begin with sending.

48
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.260
I'm just going use the text macro to build up some text.

49
00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.320
And that's going to be this going to be the f name and I'm going to call this test for now.

50
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.190
So we're sending across a test property and I am going to send create an F string.

51
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.200
Mike so we need to create it like this because otherwise it won't know which type.

52
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.010
The one you want to make.

53
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.750
And so we're explicitly creating an F string for it and then just came to.

54
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.650
Put it in Helo and then we need to do the advertisement type produce e online data advertise moment

55
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.030
type coelen COME ON consent and we don't want to select do not advertise which is the default.

56
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.730
We want to select VI online service and ping which will advertise it by steam at an overload on local

57
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.430
local networks so we can save that and that has added in a session setting.

58
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.940
Now we need the flip side of this which is where we get said sessions setting.

59
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.770
We do this in find so you should get on our on our find session complete.

60
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.230
We will be getting back these serve a search result.

61
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.420
And this service search result we can get some of the session information from.

62
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.640
So how do we do that.

63
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.760
We do search result.

64
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.990
Dot and then we get the session and then from the session we need to get the session settings like so

65
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.050
so we can do session settings Dort get Which gets us back to the social settings we put in in the first

66
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.480
place and we can put in an f name here so you can use the text macro.

67
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.560
And we said it was called test with a capital T and now this is a geter which has an out parameter.

68
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.180
So were going to have to pass it the string we wanted to populate and will need to test the boolean

69
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.380
result.

70
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.320
So what we're going to do is we are going to create the string up front which is going to be the data

71
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.320
we're going to pass that data into the getta.

72
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.560
And then we are going to do an if statement wrap the whole thing.

73
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.760
And that will tell us whether or not the get was successful.

74
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:14.510
If it was successful we are going to do a u e log we underscore log log temp warning.

75
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.710
Just for visibility.

76
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.590
And then we're going to do text and.

77
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.640
Data found in settings.

78
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.480
And I'm going to do a percent s to format the string.

79
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.620
It's going to be data which should be safe because then populated and it's going to be data so it is

80
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.450
a string so we're going to get the internal representation with a star in front of it and that should

81
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.570
do the trick.

82
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.450
Now in an else statement so if this fails I want to also know about that.

83
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:53.490
So I am going to put a log just saying that we didn't get expected data.

84
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.820
And I'm going to go ahead and remove the text from that log message and see what's up with the log message

85
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.060
we've got above.

86
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.400
Looks like I'm double using the word data because we've got the server data and then the string which

87
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:20.050
is going to be just the test setting instead we'll just use that copier in there places that we care

88
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.190
about go ahead and build and see whether this works.

89
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.640
Okay the bill succeeded so we can go ahead and launch up from the power shell.

90
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.200
So I open up my power shell I'm going to launch a couple of the game instances so they can see each

91
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.680
other and hopefully they will tell us about that information they found in the fine server.

92
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.890
So once that started up we can go ahead and host and join.

93
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.820
On the other one.

94
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.530
Going to the joining one Wait for it to come up with our server.

95
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.110
There we go.

96
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.240
There is a server.

97
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.410
And if we go to the logs for that server that's just done the find which is the other log that seems

98
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.180
and then we have data found in settings.

99
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.740
Hello.

100
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.960
So that's fantastic.

101
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.350
Our retrieve custom settings has worked.

102
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.360
So I'm going to give you a fairly sizable challenge here to actually go ahead and do the whole setting

103
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.060
the server name thing for yourself including creating all the UI.

104
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.090
So set a custom server name is the challenge you're going to model the UI from the join and you remember

105
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.440
before we had a jury many that actually took a string so it's very very similar to what we want to do

106
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.550
with our setting.

107
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:38.540
A server name you need to enter a server name into a text box and you need to send the text and value

108
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:44.060
up to create session when the okay button or create session or whatever button is pressed.

109
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.580
So pause the video and have a go at this challenge.

110
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.920
Okay welcome back.

111
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.370
Quite an open ended challenge so let's dive in here.

112
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.180
You can obviously implement it in many ways and all of them would be right.

113
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.770
So it's not necessarily that there's one correct way.

114
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:08.080
There are many correct ways so I'm going to work backwards from the way that we currently create the

115
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:09.490
session.

116
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:17.080
So we have somewhere I imagine in an interface if I remember correctly or go to my many interface dot

117
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:24.310
H in here we have a host function which doesn't take anything at the moment but were going to change

118
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:32.000
that to take an F string of let's see it's going to be the server name.

119
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:41.720
Like so and we are going to look for where that is implemented in game instance store H and copy.

120
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.290
And in fact we're going to take a copy while we're at it.

121
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.750
So copying host.

122
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.240
And going over to the game instance dot H.

123
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.870
And locating our host in here there is a host override.

124
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.550
PACE In that go over to the C++.

125
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.620
And we've got to find the host in here as well.

126
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.620
So let's just do that by searching.

127
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.290
There it is.

128
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.810
And I will change the signature for that too.

129
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.470
Mike so.

130
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:22.720
And then once we've got that done we need to go and change it where we're calling it from which is the

131
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:29.310
menu C plus plus so many c p p We are going to do host look for host.

132
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.810
It's in here somewhere.

133
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:39.860
If I don't go deleting all my files we will have house being called here in the many interface.

134
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.260
So for now I'm just going to put in a place holder name of hello.

135
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.960
That should do for the time being.

136
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:58.600
Now back to at game isn't s.p. where we are basically doing our f string server name and at the moment

137
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:02.870
we are destroying a session and creating it again.

138
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:10.270
So that's an asynchronous operation so we're going to want to set our server name or desired server

139
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.400
name at this stage so it can be used later on.

140
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.710
I'm going to create a private variable.

141
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.170
I'm going to call it.

142
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.930
It's during that server name can go down to the private section to do that.

143
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.150
I'm going to put it.

144
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.410
Let's see.

145
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.880
Just before crate session because that's where we're going to use it storing server name and I'm going

146
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.370
to call it desired.

147
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.780
Server Name.

148
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:40.580
And we're going to set that desired server name as soon as we get it in host.

149
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:49.270
So again go host desired server name equals server name because there's only one thing going on with

150
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.010
this game instance.

151
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.040
We can do this.

152
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.960
We can take a copy of that serve name.

153
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.040
Store it there for later.

154
00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:02.150
And then when we actually get to create our session we can use the string of desired server name instead.

155
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.570
In our session settings not set months ago change the name of that property to something a bit more

156
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.160
meaningful in fact we're not going to do is I'm going to create a constant f name like we've got four

157
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.090
session name.

158
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:22.220
I'm going to change it not Session name it's going to be the server name settings key.

159
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.140
Like so.

160
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.630
And the text of that is going to be server name in camel case like that.

161
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.130
Now I'm going to copy this constant this new name constant that we've got and locate the place we're

162
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:45.450
using it with the set get to replace its server name settings key and presto that looks pretty good.

163
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:51.500
So we are going to use the same over in our find wherever we're doing the fine.

164
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.190
Let me find the find or the on find session complete.

165
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.160
There we go.

166
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.970
I can do a get for an new key.

167
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
It's not going to be test setting any more.

168
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:09.820
It's actually going to be let's see server name like so good copy that through.

169
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.120
And we're not going to be logging this anymore.

170
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.820
What we're going to be doing instead is we're actually going to be setting the data's server name in

171
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.400
here.

172
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:28.890
So if it was successful we're setting it to being the server name that was populated by the get.

173
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:36.020
If it wasn't successful we're going to just use a place holder like could not get server name.

174
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.570
I could not find name something like that which we will display instead.

175
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.740
Best thing in the world.

176
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.350
But if that should happen at least we've got some default in there.

177
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.650
So let's go ahead build and see if this is all working correctly.

178
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.580
It looks like I've typed data instead of data.

179
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.500
Easy typo to make.

180
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.490
So while that's going we're going to go over to the main menu widget in the unreel editor so let's launch

181
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:13.090
that up and get our main widget and we're going to have to add a new item underneath the menu switcher.

182
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.380
So I'm actually going to copy the join menu for that I believe.

183
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.850
So let's take our join menu.

184
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.390
Copy it.

185
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.610
Click on any switcher paste it and what we've got here now is.

186
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.920
Bit of a mess actually hasn't quite come out as I expected it.

187
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.180
I wonder why it doesn't seem to.

188
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.160
Have everything stacked as I would have expected.

189
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.940
Let's undo that and see why that happened.

190
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.580
Okay.

191
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.890
Doesn't one let me undo that.

192
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:51.900
But I can take the image and vertical box that it's created extra and remove those big cars.

193
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.910
Strange indeed.

194
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.820
No it's not quite worked out at all.

195
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.460
So I'm going to remove that size box entirely.

196
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.330
Going to click on and join menu.

197
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.280
Copy it again.

198
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.000
Hopefully this time it will work.

199
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.570
Paste it.

200
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.230
Nope it hasn't worked as an x.

201
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:10.610
Weird going on here underneath the vertical box it seems to have created some sort of copy.

202
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:17.930
So I'm going to save it compile and let's see maybe if I close this blueprint editor and open it again

203
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.020
maybe it'll work.

204
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.640
As it was originally intended.

205
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.190
Something is definitely going on that's a bit odd.

206
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:30.420
Here we've got too many too many things perhaps maybe only to build this up from scratch.

207
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:37.640
I'm going to delete that size box at the root of the hierarchy and try a little bit of a simpler approach

208
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.510
of building it up from the bottom up instead.

209
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.160
It's still got a few extra things.

210
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.870
Image and vertical box still want to be there for some reason.

211
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.410
So I am going to delete them one by one.

212
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:54.430
Which still isn't working and now sure enough my editor has gone and crash so I'm not sure what kind

213
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.780
of bug we were running into here but I'm going to go and relaunch the editor.

214
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:04.030
Okay so after my editor crashing again I'm going to decide I'm actually going to leave this in so that

215
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:10.150
I can show you what we can do to work around these kinds of bugs because I can't get back to a state

216
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.840
where that blueprint is work.

217
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.520
But what we can do this is why we use version control is go and reset it in the vertical control so

218
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.350
I am going to find that file.

219
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:25.390
I am going to discard its changes and say yes I'm happy that we're discarding the main menu changes

220
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.460
and I can go and edit the you project again.

221
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:37.190
So now sure enough our main menu is back to normal so actually going to take a copy of our main menu

222
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.970
rather than join many it seems like the joy many may be too complicated.

223
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.610
So I'm going to copy from.

224
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.940
In fact I'm not going to copy at the root of that.

225
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:51.020
I'm going to copy the canvas panel just in case I've got a hunch that it might be to do with the naming

226
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.160
of these size boxes so I'm going to copy our canvas panel.

227
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.870
Paste it under the menu switcher.

228
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.510
Sure enough we've only got one root there.

229
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:04.730
If I right click it I get a wrap with and wrap it with that see what have we chosen for the other ones

230
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.390
the other ones are.

231
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.520
What type.

232
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.730
They are a size box.

233
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.980
Some are going to right click and wrap with a size box like soap.

234
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.440
And that gives us something that is an identical replica of that main menu.

235
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:24.780
So I'm going to change the text of main menu to host game like so.

236
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.910
And I'm going to change the text of the buttons to be cancelled.

237
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.760
And the other one is going to be host.

238
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.660
Set of join.

239
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.860
Like so.

240
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.700
And hopefully I can rename these size box as well.

241
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:49.240
So what size box which I'm going to rename to the.

242
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.800
Host menu.

243
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.990
Like so anticipating that we're going to need to bind it like we did before.

244
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:04.630
And also let's go down into the overlay to our vertical box and where we've got our vertical box with

245
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.900
the size box here.

246
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.090
I am going to put in a text box.

247
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.390
So let's go and look for the asset for that.

248
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.730
Text box in textbooks.

249
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.940
Common are going to put it underneath this sized box.

250
00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.540
I'm going to.

251
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.210
Let's see.

252
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.540
I got it in the right place.

253
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.040
Could put it inside that size box.

254
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.660
Like so.

255
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.210
I'm not going to mess around with the styling for now.

256
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.840
I am going to change this too.

257
00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.200
This size.

258
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.880
This box text box.

259
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.900
Editable text box to have a different name.

260
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.720
I'm going to name it.

261
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.660
Host.

262
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.610
Or rather server hostname.

263
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:58.530
Mike's so and then we're going to need to go ahead and bind this over in our C++ now because this lecture

264
00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:59.750
is getting rather long.

265
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.130
I'm going to tackle the challenge solution in the next lecture so I will see you there.
