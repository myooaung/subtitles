00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.810
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.570
We are going to be play testing this multiplayer game with other people.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.910
Now you can't tell at the moment because I don't have somebody else on the other side here but you are

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.030
going to be actually connecting to real other students on this course in this lecture over the internet

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.340
to play test your game features.

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.640
And we're going to be doing this with a piece of software called her marji which allows us to create

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.580
local networks over the Internet.

8
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.970
I'm going to be using that's great local networks with other students and playtest the game very exciting

9
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.210
stuff.

10
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.890
Let's dive in and see how that's done.

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.850
So let's take a little bit of a break.

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.460
Now for all that game play action to show off that game play action to other people over the Internet

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.630
on this course get some play testing of your game with other people simultaneously getting that feedback.

14
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.230
This is going to be really fun lecture.

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.130
So I'm really looking forward to seeing you guys working with each other to get this feedback on your

16
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.690
games.

17
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.680
That's one of the great things about multiplayer isn't it.

18
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.720
Being able to play with other people.

19
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.900
So the first thing we need to understand is why isn't it possible at the moment to connect to other

20
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.640
players outside of our local network and what is a local network anyway.

21
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.970
You keep talking about this local versus global.

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.610
What is it.

23
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.160
Let's go and have a look.

24
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.790
So we're going to be talking about the ugliness of a gnat.

25
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.030
Let's not worry about what that is just yet.

26
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.940
Let's just talk about how this whole thing works with local and global In fact how this whole internet

27
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.840
thing works.

28
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260
There are two computers that want to talk to each other.

29
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.600
You and your mate who want to play this game together how are you two connected to one another.

30
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.260
Well first of all you probably connect to a router or a modem that you've got in your house and that

31
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.230
router or modem connect up to an ISP which among themselves all connect up and eventually get you guys

32
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.930
connected.

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.150
Will blob at the top.

34
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.400
That's what we like to call the Internet and the rest.

35
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.480
Here is your local network as it's known they may have many other devices on your local network.

36
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.020
And one of the problems with that is that in order to for you to talk with your mate Bob you need to

37
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.530
have an address to send your network traffic to now these addresses in Internet speak are called IP

38
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.160
addresses Internet protocol addresses.

39
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.450
Now IP addresses Unfortunately when they designed the Internet didn't account for how popular it was

40
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.840
going to be.

41
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.270
So they didn't create enough addresses.

42
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.610
They didn't make the addresses long enough basically.

43
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.850
And so there are so many issues with it.

44
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.840
And that's the IP V4 version for addresses are basically running out and they've invented a standard

45
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.180
called ipv 6 which is supposed to fix this but hasn't really been adopted everywhere because of backwards

46
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.190
compatibility issues and so on and so on.

47
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.810
But I won't bore you with all those details because what they've done to get around the issue of ipv

48
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.000
for addresses being scarce is that you will have your ISP generally only give your router a global IP

49
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.390
address and an IP address reachable from anywhere on the internet that's what it means by being global.

50
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.710
Now that's because they're scarce and people have many devices on their networks.

51
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.770
So what happens is all these devices on your network are given a local IP address which means that they

52
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.170
are reachable only within your local network.

53
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.180
So Bob for example can't reach your smartphone on this address 1 9 2 1 6 8 4.

54
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.930
He can only reach your router and he can reply to you because the router does some clever stuff like

55
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.680
saying oh if he's said something to Bob Then Bob can say something back to him and get it hooks up the

56
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.260
reply in the right direction.

57
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.300
There's some clever stuff going on there called Network Address Translation.

58
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.990
That's what this Nat means.

59
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.420
Now that is the term for Network Address Translation and translation from global to local addresses.

60
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.930
But the main thing to remember about Nat is that it's impossible to go from the global network in to

61
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.120
one specific device that without that device having first made a connection going outwards.

62
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.360
So that's the problem.

63
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.340
And obviously Bob has got a similar network going on on his end.

64
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.700
You can see that the IP addresses for local look a little bit different to those global ones.

65
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.470
They often start with 1 9 2 1 6 8 and then some stuff going afterwards.

66
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:32.220
Okay so we know that we can play LAN multi player over these two computers or now I've just told you

67
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.380
on real if you put in the IP address of a local LAN computer then you'll be able to connect to it.

68
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.830
And in fact you could even connect to a globally accessible address if you've got a server that has

69
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.730
such an address.

70
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.830
But the problem is most of us don't.

71
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.160
Most of us have computers on these gnats and would have to do clever things like port forwarding in

72
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.500
order to be able to use one of these computers as a server when it's hidden behind a local network like

73
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.710
this.

74
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.650
So if I'm telling you all this it sounds a bit like doom and gloom you're not going to be able to.

75
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.930
Play with other people on the course.

76
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:14.860
So that's where something like a simulated LAN comes in you can use clever software like amachi to create

77
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.400
a LAN that spans across the global network.

78
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.280
So it's actually really simple it creates a virtual local network.

79
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:31.030
And what we can do here is we can go over to the amati website which is WWE VPN dot net and download

80
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.220
their virtual private network client VPN client.

81
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.120
And I'd suggest you pause video go and get started while I explain the rest.

82
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.790
Okay.

83
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.760
And what we can do with that is we will connect up with other people who we want to play games with

84
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:56.640
for example and this will give us a local IP address but one that's actually kind of spans across the

85
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.830
global network.

86
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.490
It's very clever how it works but that's the main thing you need to understand is were creating a virtual

87
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.660
local network.

88
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.280
Okay.

89
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.240
So go ahead.

90
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.220
And while her marching may be downloading go and sign yourself up for an account get it all installed

91
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.590
get it all set up and running because what we want to do is fire up a marshy client like this one and

92
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.230
you will end up with it looking pretty much in this state here that you can see with some kind of IP

93
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.140
address numbers at the top here saying off line.

94
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.770
After you've logged in.

95
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.320
Now the way this works is the first you have to power it on.

96
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.440
Go online and it'll do all its probing and logging in et cetera et cetera et cetera.

97
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.970
And we end up here with two options to create a network or join an existing network.

98
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.110
Now I'm going to first show you how we create a network then I'm going to show you how we joined.

99
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:57.030
First let's go ahead create the network and do something like I'm going to call it out at sea which

100
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:02.130
is my surname password test and I'm going to go ahead and create that network.

101
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:11.130
Now you'll notice there's a nobody on my network as it currently stands because there is no one's joined

102
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.580
yet.

103
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.260
So I could go ahead and join from another computer so I'm going to go ahead and do that.

104
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.010
And it hit the join network on my other computer.

105
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.670
A.

106
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.200
And soon you will see it pop up.

107
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.410
They go MacBook Air saying that he has joined my network and you can see I've got two out of five.

108
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.340
Five is the limit on a free private network obviously marches free.

109
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.140
Telling has to do this all with free tools.

110
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.190
Two out of five possible connections me and that MacBook Air.

111
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.000
Great.

112
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.090
So let me just show you how it works the other way round for completeness sake if you are joining that

113
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.140
network.

114
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.100
Let me go ahead and delete this network here.

115
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.980
And I'm going to join a network that's already existing.

116
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.310
So go join there's another network on that map book AIRC called potosi too.

117
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.390
And the password's test again and they go it looks very very similar except this time it is a DC 2.

118
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.630
And I can right click and you see I don't have the option to delete the option to delete the network

119
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.830
because it's not my network.

120
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:22.100
I can only leave this network as opposed to delete it like I could when I had actually created it and

121
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.570
it was my network per say.

122
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.560
Okay.

123
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:32.180
So that's how we create undelete networks and join them on her marji and they actually give us IP addresses

124
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.390
on that local network.

125
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:39.070
Now how is this used with unreel Let's go ahead and create that network again.

126
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.960
In fact let's go ahead and join that the network so I don't have to connect on the other machine.

127
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:52.310
So it's easy to test and give it any name you like really how much he doesn't particularly mind.

128
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:59.740
Now what I've got is over on my other machine I had started an unreal server for the game.

129
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.150
Now we've seen how to do that already on our local machines.

130
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.610
It's exactly the same process.

131
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:10.320
You just start the unreel server and then we need to connect a client to that server.

132
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.140
Let's go ahead and do that.

133
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.440
So I'm going to fire up a command prompt.

134
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.530
On Windows on a Mac.

135
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:25.210
It's obviously slightly different and I'm going to copy the path for my own real editor executable paste

136
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.030
that in.

137
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.720
Thanks.

138
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.400
I didn't copy the right thing.

139
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.900
Copy the paragraph.

140
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.780
Go over to command prompt and paste pasted event that got the right one this time.

141
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:44.450
Now I'm going to copy my project file path go over to the command prompt again and paste that in and

142
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.780
then finally we want to paste in the address of the computer we are trying to connect to.

143
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.400
So that is quite easy to find from her muchy.

144
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.290
You just go and find the computer in your local network so the server.

145
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.400
In my case is the MacBook Air.

146
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:09.320
I right click on it and I click copy ipv for address so I have copied my ipv for address and I go over

147
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.770
to my command prompt and I paste it in there and then finally I end off with a dash game to make a client

148
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.630
and maybe dash log just in case anything goes wrong so we can see what the error messages are.

149
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.370
I do recommend you use that.

150
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:28.370
Now if you're having trouble connecting then you may need to find the port of the server you're connecting

151
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.620
to have a amachi and include that after the address to find out how to do this.

152
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.150
Then go and have a look at the lecture that we've already done called meet the client server model if

153
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.380
you don't remember there at the end of that lecture there is an explanation of how you can find the

154
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.110
port as well as how you can enter it along with the IP address.

155
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:53.440
Go ahead and fire up the game and see whether it connects over amachi to the server running on my other

156
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.020
machine that MacBook Air.

157
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.950
K. here it comes.

158
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.560
It's loading up.

159
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.930
See if it does the right thing hasar.

160
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.650
I am the second player in this world with the server as you can tell.

161
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.250
I'm definitely the client because the platforms are moving a little bit jerkily and I was the second

162
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.010
and spawned And there's another dude over here who I can't control at the moment has I got a server

163
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.800
only instance on my MacBook Air.

164
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.950
Fantastic So that is how it connects in with unreal that's alter 4 out of here.

165
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:28.930
And the app so you can very easily use her muchI to connect to games over the network and that is going

166
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.310
to be the challenge for the lecturer to connect with another student.

167
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.500
Now this is very very important because we're here for multiplayer games.

168
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.710
I want you to actually get playing multiple your multiplayer games with other students.

169
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.760
Let's take a look at the challenge.

170
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.740
So the challenge is to find someone to play with it's now.

171
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.980
This is going to be a little bit tricky but bear with me.

172
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:53.560
Okay.

173
00:11:53.700 --> 00:12:00.110
So we are going to go ahead and create a post in the forum asking for someone to help play test our

174
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.450
game.

175
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:07.860
Now you are going to put the available times the times at which you are available to play test the game

176
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.660
with someone because it's quite important that you both there at the same time for a multi player game.

177
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:18.480
Now let me just say that the way I want you to do this is not to say I'm going to be there between nine

178
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.240
and six because there are so many times those are that students are in that's going to be completely

179
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.080
ambiguous.

180
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.940
What we're going to do is we're all going to convert our local time zone into utc.

181
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:38.100
So for example if I am available from 5:00 p.m. in my local time zone I can use this every time zone

182
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:46.690
dot com website to convert 5 p.m. over to a utc which you can see is just down here on my screen.

183
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.740
Round about the middle and it is 4:00 p.m. utc Okay.

184
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.210
So that's what I would use as my start time so I'm available till 9 p.m. then that would be 8:00 p.m.

185
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:04.440
utc So I'm available from 4 to 8 p.m. utc and that's what you need to put in your title for till 8 p.m.

186
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:11.720
utc then what everyone can do is find out where who's available and overlaps in their availabilities.

187
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.980
Because again we have loads at times out.

188
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.300
Use this lecture as a particular link because that's going to take you to the right place in the forum

189
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.730
where all the other posts asking for play testing partner are going to be.

190
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.980
Then I'd like you to include in your post a screenshot of your level as it stands that you want play

191
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:37.130
testing just to entice people in to want to play test with you and while you wait.

192
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.750
Why not go through and reply to some other people who have requested play testing so that you can help

193
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.470
them out.

194
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:49.500
Play test your game and then finally when you've coordinated decided on a time you can go ahead and

195
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.320
hop into discord and chat over discord to the person in question.

196
00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:00.360
And in fact you can even use voice chat is an option in Discordia to use voice chat and then you can

197
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:08.310
play your game over her maachis so that you both get to test out the process of connecting to someone

198
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.740
over amachi as well as getting someone else to play with you in your game and give you some feedback

199
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.210
on your level design.

200
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:20.430
Now clearly you're going to have to get your project files to the other person who's going to playtest

201
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.080
with you there are a couple of ways you can do this.

202
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.050
One way is get hard if you know how to use get hub.

203
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:31.180
But if you or your partner don't know how to use get hub then you can use this which is share drop dot

204
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:37.110
I know the cool thing about shared drop I O is when you land on it and then there's just a U.

205
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:42.870
But what you can do is you can go ahead and click Plus which creates a room and gives you a unique link

206
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:49.050
which you can give to the other person and then you can drop files to the other person like zip of your

207
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:54.030
project by just clicking and dragging on to that other person.

208
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.140
So go ahead and try that.

209
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.490
If you aren't familiar with using get hub Okay.

210
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.400
Pause video and go ahead and do that.

211
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.520
Okay welcome back.

212
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.390
So you probably haven't got to the stage of having got through all that reply and response.

213
00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:15.280
Don't worry do go ahead and do some of the next videos because they aren't going to rely on you having

214
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.040
playtest.

215
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.470
I'm just going to be adding some more gameplay features at the moment.

216
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:25.810
But do go ahead and make sure that you have got a post waiting for someone.

217
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:31.330
And also go in there and be generous and be generous with your time and help other people playtest their

218
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:31.810
game.

219
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:37.210
So at least you can get her hang of connecting over her to other people's service.

220
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.630
Okay so that's it from me.

221
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.240
I'm not going to be showing you how to do this one obviously because you have to go ahead and do it

222
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.940
yourself so I will see in the next lectures where we will be creating some more gameplay features for

223
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.740
our game.
