00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.780
Alti we are doing the refactored bit of our red green refactor loop.

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.510
And so as you can see here in our content browser.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.750
Now we have a go cart movement component C plus plus class.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.980
And if you go and have a look at it it actually does stuff it does a lot of stuff actually as you can

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.630
see here it's doing all the physics replication stuff.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.080
So we are going to be looking at pulling out all that functionality from our go kart which is now looking

7
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.190
much much cleaner.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.340
As you can see here there are tiny tiny amount of methods and fields in comparison to what it was before.

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.980
So let's dive in and see how it's done.

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.640
So let's quickly overview the refactored plan from the last lecture.

11
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.780
Now the first component we should go about building in this plan is the one with the fewest dependencies

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.190
because that means that it will work without the other compounds existing or without us having to significantly

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.730
change the way it works.

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.680
And the component that fits the bill is the movement component because the replication component uses

15
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.160
that.

16
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.890
So it would need to be there in order to use it from the replication component and the actor Well the

17
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.180
actor already exists and we're pulling parts out of it so it doesn't make sense to take it from there.

18
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.130
So the moon component is the one we are going to be working from in this lecture.

19
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.960
So let's go ahead and create this component in a real kind of dive into the real Avatar.

20
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.250
Go to and new in the content browser add a new C++ glass.

21
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.480
Then I'm going to head on down and look for the components.

22
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.440
Now there's a few types of component we can go for we can go for an active component or a scene component

23
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.360
the seam component is one that has a transformer we have no need to have a transform So I'm going to

24
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.580
go for the ACT component and go ahead hit next.

25
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.930
And we've got a Stew's name.

26
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.870
Now it's a movement component but it's specifically a moving component for the go cart so I'm going

27
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.270
to call it the go cart movement component.

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.640
No prises for initiative naming there.

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.070
Now remember I don't need to put the prefix in front of this on real somatically add the correct prefix

30
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.330
for whether it's a component or an actor or a struct and so on and so forth.

31
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.250
So we'll go ahead and let this compile into our project and I'm going to pause the video so you don't

32
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.420
have to wait for my compellation process if yours takes different about time you'll need to pause as

33
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.070
well.

34
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.180
So don't take too much longer for me.

35
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.980
If we go over into visual studio.

36
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.130
We're going to see that there is a go cart movement component.

37
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.410
H has been created.

38
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.550
And if we go and open up in the solution Explorer go to the sources go to crazy cats will see us also

39
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.920
a C plus file that didn't open up for some reason on my computer.

40
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.180
Nothing unusual there.

41
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.400
All the stuff you would usually expect.

42
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.270
So all we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and move the member declaration's across from the

43
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.460
go cart actor over to the component all the ones that we want at that.

44
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.450
By that I mean both the fields and the methods or using C++ terminology.

45
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.880
You be moving across the functions the member functions and the non static member variables or Fields

46
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.290
is a lot easier to say so let's go over to the go kart or H and the first thing were going to move across.

47
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.160
I see a method called simulate move and create move both of these to do with simulating physics and

48
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.760
movement.

49
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.230
So let's cut those out and bring those across to the head far.

50
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.070
I'm going to put them in a new private section here like so.

51
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.710
What next.

52
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.990
So go back to the go kart or h.

53
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.530
Not clear acknowledge moves but get air resistance from rolling resistance apply rotation basically

54
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.140
all the way down.

55
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.570
To the.

56
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.770
Move forward and move right.

57
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.900
We're not going to include So all the way down to line 90 on my screen.

58
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.460
I'm going to cut out and we're going to put those in to the go cart movement component.

59
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.140
Now I'm going to fix the indentation from pasting those you propertys cause they always get messed up

60
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.770
with michale Studios indentation.

61
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.510
And then we go back into the go cart to H.

62
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.730
Anything else yes.

63
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.900
Velocity.

64
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.840
That's going to come across.

65
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.840
Let's bring the velocity property across anything else yes.

66
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.960
The throttle and steering throw are to start non static member variables that we need to bring across.

67
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.440
And let's see now everything else is used to do with replication or input binding so were going to leave

68
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.630
those put.

69
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.500
So that has brought across everything.

70
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.710
We are going to want in the moon campaign.

71
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.310
I'm defaulting to them being private but we can move things across to being public if they need to be

72
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.100
accessed from other classes which they probably will be.

73
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.840
So next up going to be moving the function implementation but I'm gonna leave that as a challenge to

74
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.110
you.

75
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.670
Seeing as we've already moved the declarations you probably know which ones to move across.

76
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.060
So your chain is going to be in total to make the whole thing build and run like it did before.

77
00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.270
So where you going to do this is you're going to pull across the method implementations first.

78
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.400
You going to have to change the class name space from the a go cart to the you go cart movement component

79
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.320
can at a prefix.

80
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:17.780
Any calls to functions on the actor with get owner arrow so that we are accessing the actors function

81
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.400
instead of just calling the function on this object.

82
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.020
You need to fix any references and go cart dot c p p that referred to functions that we've now moved

83
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.680
across.

84
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.830
So you're going to have to set up the component and you're going to have to have the pointer to the

85
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.120
component somewhere in that go cart actor and then you're going to need to call functions on that component.

86
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.860
Then you need to create any access methods that you might need.

87
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.170
So getters and setters for variables that were previously just accessing But now we need to use through

88
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.730
a public interface and fix any other build errors that might crop up.

89
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.870
Suppose video and have a go at this rather sizable challenge.

90
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.260
But I'm sure quite confident you're going to be able to do it.

91
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:05.850
Okay welcome back.

92
00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.960
So let's dive right in.

93
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.260
So first off the implementations Let's go in to add go carts s.p. and look for the implementation that

94
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.120
has to pull across.

95
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.960
So first of all we're gonna leave Tich beef in how we will change that later.

96
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.580
We are going to get simulate move and create move.

97
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.230
Cut those and bring them into the go cart moon component CB P and stick them at the bottom.

98
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:38.740
Go back to the go cart c p p and we're going to grab from get air resistance all the way down.

99
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.350
K Well let's do it in chunks because my scrolling doesn't want to do all the way down so I'm going to

100
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.640
go to apply rotation.

101
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.590
Cut that out.

102
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.140
You see what I'm doing here.

103
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.890
Pretty simple stuff now.

104
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.120
Update location from velocity that also needs to go across not the player input binding.

105
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.300
That's going to stay in the actor.

106
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.030
And what else what else what else that seems to be it.

107
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.660
We have now moved across all the functions we need.

108
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.300
So that is good.

109
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.130
So it's time to start fixing those build errors.

110
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.490
Well we're going to do is first of all as I've mentioned on the slides we are going to change the class

111
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:24.620
namespace so going to go into the go cart movement component c p p and do a find for a go cart.

112
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.180
And if I hit a little arrow next to a go cart then I can do a replace with.

113
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.690
I've already got this in my clipboard you go cart movement component you can copy that if you like from

114
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.430
the tick component anywhere else in the C++ file.

115
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.560
That'll do the trick.

116
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.530
And go ahead and replace all of those instances.

117
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.010
Six were replaced six will probably be replaced for you as well.

118
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.160
Okay.

119
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.680
And then what else.

120
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.420
So we're talking about prefixing get out now.

121
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.590
Well what I'm going to do at this point is actually just try building and see what is the first error

122
00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.770
that comes up and try and fix as many errors as I can pay the bills finished that's gone have a look

123
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.150
at the output log and see what the first error is.

124
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.590
So it's saying missing type specifier.

125
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.490
And where is that type specify that is complaining about.

126
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.940
I'm not entirely clear by Am seeing something about.

127
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.480
An issue with F..

128
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.720
Go cart move.

129
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.930
And that's because it isn't included here.

130
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.970
And in fact it probably shouldn't be declared in the go cart at all because dependences if we look at

131
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.790
the dependency graph is from the go car act a hazard depending on the moving component not vice versa.

132
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.700
So we want an F go cart move to that structure.

133
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:47.150
We're going to cut it out of the head a file of a of a go cart and go into the head of go can't move

134
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.870
at component and create it there instead.

135
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:56.360
So that should help alleviate that issue I'm just going to fix up the indentation in those you propertys

136
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.340
and we will see what the next build error is.

137
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.200
So the next hour we get is this unrecognized type F go cart move which actually come in from the go

138
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.560
cart.

139
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.610
Dot H.

140
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:14.070
Which basically means that we are going to need to include that dependency member to do it above the

141
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.450
generator to H.

142
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.300
We need to include the go karts movement component or h.

143
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.430
If I can type like so and let's build again.

144
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.500
Okay back to the output now.

145
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.560
Okay lots more errors now because I think it's actually reached the C plus plus file rather than moaning

146
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.820
about the head of files.

147
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.770
So the head of files are now good.

148
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:42.260
If we go in to the first error you can see it's complaining about that get active forward vector Now

149
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.900
this is what I was talking about in the challenge slider was that the need prefix all the active functions.

150
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.910
With this get owner function.

151
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.220
So let's do that.

152
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.330
Get active forward vector needs to be prefixed with get.

153
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.120
Oh no.

154
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.180
Like so arrow.

155
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.040
Now I'm not going to do a null check here because I'm going to assume that this component is on an actor

156
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.620
and I think that's a fairly safe assumption otherwise we'd go mad with putting null checks all over

157
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.450
the place.

158
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.770
K. So what's the next such error.

159
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.450
We've got another get active forword some get a stick and get own a bear.

160
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.840
Another actor up stick in a get over there and act.

161
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.030
Add world rotation.

162
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.030
And an ad world offset.

163
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.090
So those all need to use get owner.

164
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.050
Let's go ahead and build that.

165
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:33.800
Okay.

166
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.670
Yet more errors this time.

167
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:43.040
We are in the go cart s.p. where we are making calls to create move but it's no longer a function on

168
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.820
the actor.

169
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:50.240
So we are now for fixing references in the go cart CB peak so to do this we actually need to go ahead

170
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.820
and create the component on this go cart so we have a reference and we're gonna need to store that in

171
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.670
a new property.

172
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.210
So I am going to create a new property which is going to be at anyway so we can edit the properties

173
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.820
of that component.

174
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:12.870
And it's going to be a you go cart movement component starker's give me a pointer to it and is gonna

175
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.990
call it the movement component.

176
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.530
Okay.

177
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:24.450
In our constructor we're going to create that default sub object so it's up to the constructor and we're

178
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.060
going to go for movement.

179
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.060
Components.

180
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.780
Is equal to.

181
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.220
Create should remember this by now.

182
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:42.180
Default subobject if you forgetting how to do that then the first section has lots of information about

183
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:42.710
it.

184
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:48.270
Now here we carry a passan F name or we can use the text macro grow to create ourselves automatically

185
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.270
an F name or an F string or whatever based on that type that's actually wanted.

186
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.940
And I'm going to call this just the same movement components of the copied across rather than making

187
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.860
spelling errors and create default some object doesn't know what type to create so I need to put my

188
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:08.460
angle brackets in here and make it a you go can't move a component like so and that should make sure

189
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.870
we have that component which is great and a semicolon at the end a line to stop it from complaint.

190
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.560
So now we should be in the position where we can.

191
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:23.900
Call create move but first of all we do need to check that it is not null because we might fail to create

192
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.330
a campaign for whatever reason.

193
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:34.560
So if movement component equals not point are going to do an early return and just go do it on one line.

194
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.560
Typically we don't want to ignore braces but when there's just a return like this is so much easier

195
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:47.010
to use this coding style so then we're going to do a movement component arrow create move and move a

196
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:55.640
component arrow simulate move and onwards and downwards for all the other cases where we have this problem

197
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.320
as well.

198
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.810
And remembering that we need to do an early return and any new methods we encounter.

199
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.550
So now we have this velocity in our on rep server state.

200
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:12.700
We are going to need to do an early return there as well so let's copy across earlier return code down

201
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.450
into the server state.

202
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.910
Then that we can copy across our dereferencing code of the pointer.

203
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:26.800
Ah so here we've got a private member called Velocity and we don't want to access private members directly

204
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.860
so we are going to create a set own so this is going to become a method which is set velocity.

205
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:40.560
With their sextape velocity as its argument and then simulate move we can just do as before.

206
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:47.560
So and then onwards onwards onwards we've got the throttle steering throw and assimulate move in the

207
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.160
final one.

208
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.900
So let's do some early returns caputo's early returns.

209
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.500
That need to do an early return.

210
00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.230
E in our Send move implementation and early return.

211
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:07.210
Also in our move forward and in our move right because we can't move forward a bit of right without

212
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:13.910
a movement component or it's nonsensical if we can and then add point to dereferencing we can use for.

213
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:22.010
Okay we're gonna need a get velocity here so I can implement that one in the said move implementation.

214
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.970
And how about at throttle and steering throw.

215
00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:34.170
Well it's going to become a set throttle with the value as the argument and it is going to become.

216
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.760
Also.

217
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.640
A set steering throw with the value as the argument.

218
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.340
Go ahead build that.

219
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.100
So let's take a look at those build errors.

220
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.700
We are expecting the first build error.

221
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.570
Is that the create move.

222
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.530
Can access private member so create move is private.

223
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.220
So simulate move further down.

224
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:03.990
We can see that there are probably going to be other errors such as get velocity not yet existing but

225
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.900
we're going to fix that.

226
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.410
We're going to go to the go kart moon compound H.

227
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:13.410
First thing we're going to do is we're going to move simulate move and create move to be public because

228
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.780
they're part of the public interface to this class.

229
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.630
You can always told me what component to simulate You can always tell it to create a new move.

230
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:27.260
What about other methods you're going need beginning at accessor methods now now with access is one

231
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.080
thing you can do is you can actually define them inline in the head final because they're so small.

232
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.600
So what I'm going to do here is first create the geter for an F vector So it's can be an f factor.

233
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.480
For lost he rather f vector get velocity.

234
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.350
And no arguments.

235
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.420
But it's just going to be a return.

236
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:52.530
The velocity thing and so I'm just doing all in one line because it's so short and so simple to do it

237
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.650
that way.

238
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:59.030
Next I'm going to have a void return setter So it's going to set velocity.

239
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.410
It's going to take an F vector and I'm just going to call it a vow of value for short.

240
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.660
And then we're going to have it set velocity.

241
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.260
It can be velocity equals.

242
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.710
Vow.

243
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.620
So and there we go.

244
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.990
So we've got a getter and set up for the velocity now for the throttle and steering.

245
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.320
We only use a sweater we never had to read it so I'm just going to provide setter's.

246
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:29.840
We're going to have a set and let's copy the words throttle and steering throw just for making sure

247
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.100
I don't make any.

248
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.810
Copy.

249
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.760
Any typing mistakes.

250
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:42.630
And we're going do a set throttle where the throttle equals vow and then we are going to do.

251
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.380
The same for set steering throw.

252
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.950
So just replacing the lost t with the steering throw and steering.

253
00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.790
Here now is not an F vector.

254
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.920
So let's correct that that's going to be heard the values can be afloat in both cases.

255
00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.890
Like so great.

256
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.530
So let's go ahead and build and see whether that works now.

257
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.640
Horray at last we have building code have probably done it probably fixed all the building errors.

258
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:14.170
So if we go to the play menu and make sure we are playing with one player and then a play in the selected

259
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.090
viewport.

260
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:23.940
Then what I want to do is and I want to f 8 hour here select my car and go into the details pane just

261
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.330
to check.

262
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.570
We've got our component there.

263
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.660
Yes we've got a movement component if I click on it says inherited which it should be because it's there

264
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:36.810
C++ is the parent class of the blueprint and you can see in the go cart Moven component.

265
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:43.320
We've got all those properties to do with mass and driving force and so on and so forth much more better

266
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.630
organized in the right sort of place.

267
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:52.140
And if we go and repossess mines gone into a load menu here Reaper's there's my authority you can see

268
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.480
us can still move it around.

269
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.960
So my moving component seems to be working.

270
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.360
Let's try in a multiplayer scenario.

271
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.810
So create two players and we're going to do a new editor window.

272
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.040
Let's try and have them side by side.

273
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.570
Here we go.

274
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.030
So authorities moving around.

275
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.710
And yes he is visible to the autonomous proxy.

276
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.210
What about Vice versa.

277
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.440
Tom's proxies he must be moving just fine which is nice.

278
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.810
And he's also visible to the authority.

279
00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.800
So that's wonderful I refactor has worked.

280
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.600
We pulled out the first component which is a movement component.

281
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.730
Our in next lecture.

282
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.430
Well we'll be working on that replication.
