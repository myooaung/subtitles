00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.560
Welcome in this lecture we are going to be reviving the lobby.

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.100
We are going to be getting our players to spawn into the lobby instead of into the game directly.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.510
And we're going to add in some logic into a game mode that's going to allow us to count the number of

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.700
players in the lobby so that we know when we are ready to start the game and we're going to be learning

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.670
all about the game mode why it's used where it runs and how to do that.

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.740
So let's dive in and see about this game mode and about this lobby.

7
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.530
Okay.

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.890
So one thing that we will notice now when we start a game and when we actually host using a newly created

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.760
host menu loops some reason some spawning uploads of players.

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.730
Let's stick with this one player.

11
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.750
Go to the Planum play menu and we go to host and type in whatever we want to do when we house you notice

12
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.840
that we are ending up in the game straight away without waiting for other players so we want to implement

13
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.990
a lobby mechanism and the correct place to implement a lobby mechanism is basically nowhere that we've

14
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.440
done it so far.

15
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.530
We want to do this in a game mode.

16
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.960
You may have encountered game modes before and never really realized why you would want to use one.

17
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.910
Well now we're finally going to actually override the game mode and see why it is necessary.

18
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.440
So it creates lots of rules underpinning the game but more importantly it allows us to handle certain

19
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.920
actions such as a CD player logging in.

20
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.340
So when we join we get some pre logging which allows us to reject a player who's trying to join.

21
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.940
We also get a post log in which happens after we've accepted the player and we get other things such

22
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.910
as restart player and log out which we may also be using or may not be using but basically it allows

23
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.220
us to handle people coming in and out of the game where we're going to spawn their pawns where they

24
00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.630
go when they get killed and restart all those kind of rules about the game logic go in the game mode.

25
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.790
So we're going to want that to implement a lobby game mode that will allow basically a certain number

26
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.220
of players to appear in the lobby and once all those players have appeared they will simultaneously

27
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.440
together do something called a seamless travel and move on to the next level and actually start the

28
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.800
game altogether rather than having to wait for the other people to appear.

29
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.740
So let's begin with the first and rather easy step that you can do along with me which is joining into

30
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.450
the lobby.

31
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.740
So currently we're joining right into the game.

32
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.970
Let's stop that behaviour and go to Visual Studio and open up our game instance which is where we're

33
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.220
currently spawning ourselves into the game.

34
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:50.840
Get up the game instance C++ and we are going to look for the place where we're doing the spawning which

35
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.210
should be fairly evident because there'll be a big string there.

36
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.100
There it is.

37
00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.090
It is in on Create session complete that we are then going ahead and doing a server travel to our third

38
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.130
person example map which is not where we want to be we want to be in the lobby.

39
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.310
We've created a lobby already so I'm going to go up to the puzzle platforms folder go into maps lobby

40
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.250
and then I can actually just copy from their control See on with the Lobby selected.

41
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:26.630
Go back to the C++ and just replace that game with this new string which is going to be game forward

42
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.950
slash puzzle platforms was map for life.

43
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.290
Going to remove the extraneous bits at the beginning and end such as World and Dot lobby and that gives

44
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.930
us the correct address so I can go ahead and build that.

45
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.080
And now again will launch into the lobby as we are intending now.

46
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.170
The next thing to do is go ahead and create a game mode class of our own for that lobby.

47
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.230
So let's go ahead and do that.

48
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.890
Is it a two step process here because actually we need to create the game mode and it's going to be

49
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.990
overriding app game mode that we already have.

50
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.540
We have this puzzle platforms game mode or h.

51
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.190
As you may have noticed and in that dot 8 we are setting things like the player pawn BP class.

52
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.050
So we want to keep that information in our lobby because we want to be spawning in with a third person

53
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.650
class.

54
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.180
Obviously if you wanted to change that that would be something that you would need to change.

55
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.650
So we're not going to be changing that but we are going to be overriding puzzle platforms game mode

56
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.780
to add information to the lobby class to add some extra behaviour.

57
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.940
So let's go to add new button in the content browser add new C++ class and then our class is obviously

58
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.800
not going to be here so I'm going to do show all base show all classes and it's going to be the puzzle.

59
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.980
Or if I can type it's going to be the puzzle platforms game mode that we're going after.

60
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.740
I'm going to hit next.

61
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.120
I'm just going to rename this to the lobby game mode.

62
00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.520
Call it what it is and go ahead and create that class is going to do the usual C++ compiling configure

63
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.860
rating and so on so forth.

64
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.770
And once that's done we want to go ahead and set up big game mode so that it is the default game mode

65
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.670
for our lobby.

66
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:18.920
So let's go back to our puzzle platforms folder to the maps folder and open up our lobby level and in

67
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.670
the lobby level we can go to the blueprints menu and you'll notice here we've got a project settings

68
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.870
game mode which is set to the puzzle platforms game mode that's the default game mode for the whole

69
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.330
project and by default if there's nothing set then the levels will use this game mode.

70
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.200
However in this particular level we want to go down to our world over ride and we want to change the

71
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.060
game mode based class to the lobby game mode.

72
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.550
We do that then everything should be hunky dory we should be using a new game mode.

73
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.160
If we try playing in here you'll notice that not much has changed we still got our third person character

74
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.810
which is a good sign that we do want a third person character there even though it's used in the lobby

75
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.000
game mode instead of the default game mode and that's because we are overriding from the right thing

76
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.570
were overriding from our puzzle platforms game mode in the first place.

77
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.340
So what can we actually do with a game mode.

78
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.690
What's the point of having.

79
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.420
Here.

80
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.300
Well one of the things that we can achieve.

81
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:26.180
If we can use it to handle call-backs when we get people joining in our game.

82
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:33.630
So you will see over in the game mode documentation that I have linked you to that there is a function

83
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.180
called post logging.

84
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.560
This is called After a successful log in and this is the point at which we could start counting the

85
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.080
players that are coming in say We want to have 3 players total.

86
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:50.070
Then we start counting the players that have come in via logging and when that player has reached a

87
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:56.160
when that number has reached a certain critical maxim we can actually launch the game in properly and

88
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.230
basically execute a seamless travel to the correct place.

89
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.570
So this function is very useful but we don't know quite how to call it yet here it's just very cryptically

90
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.740
told us that it's called post log in.

91
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:15.420
Well the easiest way actually to go and find out how to call this is to go and look at the code so we

92
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:22.980
can follow the hierarchy of classes from a lobby game mode up to puzzle platforms game mode C update

93
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.430
H and in that dot H far we can see that we're actually deriving from not a game mode but a game mode

94
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.110
based now in that documentation.

95
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.450
You'll see that game mode base is basically a cut down version of game mode game mode included a lot

96
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.330
of logic that we don't actually need most of the time.

97
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:45.230
Game mode base is what you will by default be using in most projects in most new projects.

98
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.810
So if we go to the file where game mode base is declared it should be game mode based on.

99
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.980
You can search for it on a Mac or you can just do F 12 in visual studio to go and find it.

100
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.770
Then we will get to this head a file that shows us what things we can be doing with this class.

101
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.150
Now a good way to know what you can do with a class when you're inheriting from it is just to search

102
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.380
through the code.

103
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.800
Whoops I appear to have zoomed out massively.

104
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:16.370
In fact it's zooming out in massive increments.

105
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:22.640
So let me just go to the bottom left corner of that pain and reset it to 100 percent so we can read

106
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.110
in fact one little bit more than a hundred percent because that's a it's small isn't it.

107
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.560
What we got were the other tabs.

108
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.960
They've all changed as well.

109
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.100
So I'm going to put it at something like maybe 100 and 50.

110
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.500
That's a bit too much maybe just one hundred and twenty then.

111
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.930
Yes that's good.

112
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:39.320
Okay.

113
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.980
So what we're going to look for is the control virtual.

114
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.560
It's done again it's gone and zoomed again just because they had control.

115
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.320
And I did the scroll wheel.

116
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.550
So we're looking for the virtual key word and this is going to highlight all the methods that we could

117
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.770
override if we wanted to.

118
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.330
Now obviously that's a lot of methods and we're just looking for one in particular which is the post

119
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.550
in method which we can just go through and look for and we will find the signature.

120
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:13.000
So I'm going to go ahead and copy this entire line and take it into my lobby game mode.

121
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.000
Dot H.

122
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.190
To implement.

123
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:25.790
Now the best practice when you are overriding virtual things is to put override at the end of your method.

124
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:33.200
Now what this does it's not necessary but when it's there it make sure that there is a function in the

125
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.470
parent class or one of the parent classes going up the chain of inheritance that matches the signature

126
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.700
that you are giving here.

127
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.980
So you know that this is definitely overriding the correct thing because if you had mistyped it and

128
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.590
you had put I don't know something like bull.

129
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.640
Something in the signature.

130
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.310
Then this would be a different method and it would no longer be overriding something in the parent class

131
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:03.070
and sure enough I get the red squiggles which tell me that override does not override a base class member

132
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.080
which is because I had that override function there if I didn't have override there what I'd be doing

133
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.940
is something perfectly valid which is creating a new virtual post log in function.

134
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.640
But it is not doing what I had intended.

135
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:21.460
So if we add override it gives us that extra level of certainty and safety to know that we are overriding

136
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.010
something from the base class.

137
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.690
The other thing to note about that is that because we are definitely overriding something from the base

138
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.180
class then this function is going to be virtual.

139
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:37.330
You can't take a function and make it on virtual somewhere down the hierarchy so we don't actually need

140
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.660
to put a virtual keyword in front of this signature.

141
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.960
It will be virtual automatically because we're already using override.

142
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.050
It's clear to the people reading it in this file that this must be a virtual function so I'm going to

143
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:56.180
leave the virtual off the front just to not need any redundant information there.

144
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:02.090
So rather than implement this I'm going to leave the implementation up to you because what I'm going

145
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:07.610
to challenge you to do is count the players in the lobby so you're going to do this by implementing

146
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.470
post log in like I've done or at least started to do.

147
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.570
And you going to do the same thing for logout you're going to find what the signature for logout is

148
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.150
and implement that as well.

149
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.140
And then using these two methods you are going to count the number of players that have arrived into

150
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:27.270
your lobby and when you reach a certain number when you reach three players log a message when you reach

151
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:34.400
three players saying that three players have been reached and that should help you identify also where

152
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.550
the game mode is.

153
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.620
Is it on the server.

154
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.480
Is it on the client or is it on both.

155
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.010
I'd like you to report that little bit of homework as well.

156
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.150
They go well and that little check item in for you to check off as well.

157
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.830
So pause a video and have a go at this challenge.

158
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.340
Okay welcome back.

159
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.200
Let's answer some of those questions.

160
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.670
So the first thing is logout I'm going to need that as well so let's go to the game.

161
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.420
Mo bass and look for log out.

162
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.290
Actually it's right amita Loggins so I barely need to look good.

163
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:07.730
Go ahead and copy that go in to our lobby game mode dot H and paste it in there.

164
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:13.430
Now I can remove virtual and I'm going to add an override just to make sure that we are overriding the

165
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.030
right thing.

166
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.800
I'm pretty sure we are.

167
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.190
But let's just make sure.

168
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:24.230
Now let's copy both those go in to the C++ and I am going to go ahead and add in some bodies.

169
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.360
Now obviously you don't need an override in the C++ that is superfluous.

170
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:33.440
I am going to need the namespace so I'm going to copy a lobby game mode from the head of file and use

171
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:42.030
that as the namespace for a post log in and for log out and I'm going to remove the override from the

172
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:48.150
logout which is not needed in the definition because signature has already defined that.

173
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.570
Okay so now we've got post log in and log out.

174
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.260
We are going to need to do some counting.

175
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.190
Where are we going to be do that.

176
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.400
Doing the counting.

177
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:02.900
Well one thing I haven't done is made sure that post log in and log out are public or private.

178
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.800
Like they are in the game mode based now.

179
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.560
If you go and look at the game base you'll see that they are public so we will set them to public as

180
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.430
well.

181
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:20.360
And then we're going to create a private section in the head a file and in the private section we are

182
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.650
going to create a variable for the number of players which I'm going to use.

183
00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.820
A You went 32 for this.

184
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.730
If I can type because it's coming out as unit 32 and I'm going to have number of players.

185
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.820
And I'm going to start that off as there's zero.

186
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.900
Okay so we've got number of players and then with this number of players we are going to increment it

187
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.790
or we've got a post log in and in a decrement it when we've got a log out.

188
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.430
So that's going to be fairly easy plus plus number of players in the post log in and minus minus number.

189
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.040
Of.

190
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.280
Players.

191
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.820
In the log out so that should do the trick.

192
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.670
We don't need to do anything beyond this now.

193
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.810
There will be somewhere that the player can transfer being stored you could go and count the play controls

194
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.070
if you wanted to.

195
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.140
But I think it's just so much easier to do our own count rather than go looking for where these player

196
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.490
controllers are stored.

197
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:29.100
So let's go on to the next bit which is and again be printing out when we have a log message with three

198
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.630
or more.

199
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.660
So we're going to do that on logging because that's the only one that could incremental.

200
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.710
And so make us have more than three players.

201
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:43.120
So in this I'm going to put an if statement that says that the number of players is greater than or

202
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.010
equal to 3.

203
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:53.230
And when this is the case then we're going to want to do a e log with log temp and I'm going to give

204
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:59.310
it a warning type and then we're going to have some text in here.

205
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:05.040
The text is simply going to say reached three players.

206
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.700
That would go.

207
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.760
And I'll put SEMICON on the end of the line even though it doesn't necessarily need it with a you log

208
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.610
and we can go ahead and build this.

209
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:18.180
So what we're going to do is we're going to open up a few instances of the game and try and join in

210
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.920
on one hosting session and see where this logs.

211
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.190
Importantly So where is the game mode running.

212
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.800
And also whether it works.

213
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:33.160
So I'm going to skip on over to the power shell and launch myself.

214
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.280
Three instances of the game so that we can get to three players by joining in.

215
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.400
It's just fire up a few of those.

216
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.810
Okay here we are.

217
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.830
So with our first one we're going to go ahead and host.

218
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.770
I'm going to give this the imaginative name of donkey as Ben always likes to do it in in honour of him.

219
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.670
Okay.

220
00:15:54.730 --> 00:16:02.720
So first thing of note is that we do appear to be not spawning in here as a third person player.

221
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.770
That's a bit weird.

222
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.550
Let's note that and carry on for now.

223
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:15.230
Now we'll go and join that session in that these other two game instances so I'm going to set off b

224
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.390
join loading for both of them and.

225
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:18.760
Okay.

226
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.170
We've got a couple of instances running here.

227
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.520
That's interesting isn't it.

228
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.190
Why have we got multiple instances running here.

229
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.700
Probably because we've still got something running in the editor.

230
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.930
Maybe maybe maybe not.

231
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.240
Doesn't look like we've got anything running in the editor so it shouldn't be that lets anyway go and

232
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.000
join donkey instance.

233
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.360
So here's me in the lobby and let's go and join with the third.

234
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.300
And here we are.

235
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.940
So we should now have a log message.

236
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.740
Let's go and check that out.

237
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.940
So we're going to have a look at a few.
