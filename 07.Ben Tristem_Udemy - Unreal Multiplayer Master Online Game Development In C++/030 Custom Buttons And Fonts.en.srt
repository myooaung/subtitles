00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,850
We are going to be making this awesome looking menu by customizing fonts by customizing the buttons

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:19,140
as you can see down here and adding in a background and making sure that while we do all of this it's

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,380
carries on scaling nicely as you can see here.

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,040
Great stuff.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,700
Let's dive in and see how we can achieve this.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,790
So at the moment we've got a menu and it's nicely laid out but a bit boring at the moment.

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,930
So what kind of things can we do to make this look less generic and more interesting.

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,190
Three things I can think of.

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,010
The first one is giving it a nice background.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,890
Second one is changing out these buttons for something a little less generic.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,720
And the third one is to change the font and the font can make a very big difference as well.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,730
So let's start off with Point number one.

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,930
Set a background to this whole thing so that we can get a theme rolling.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:07,070
Well the first thing I would suggest you go and do is head on over to Google and go to it an image search.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,430
And search for the theme that you're looking for.

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:16,610
So for me I'm looking for a sci fi wallpaper often wallpaper is a good kind of thing that we're looking

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:22,600
for are some really nice ones here but they're not all free they're all and some of them are copyrighted

19
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,030
so I'm not going to go looking for the copyrighted ones.

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:35,240
Let's go to Tools just underneath the Google search and go to the usage rights and look for labelled

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,780
for reuse how nogami modifying it so let's just look for labelled for reuse and have a little scan through

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,220
here for some.

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,100
Good photos that we could use as a background.

24
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,100
Like look at this one here with the meta yours things hitting the Earth.

25
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,600
So it looks quite cataclysmic.

26
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,550
It's got a signature down the bottom.

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,900
Let's see if that matters too much.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,300
Probably best not go with one that has got a signature on the bottom.

29
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,140
Let's have another look at maybe this one at the top with flicker one.

30
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,760
Let's go ahead and visit the page and see if we can download an original quality.

31
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,760
We've got a download button on Flicker and I'm going to go download the original Now you obviously find

32
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,960
the image that you like the look of maybe you're not going to go for a sci fi the IM at all.

33
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,580
That's just the theme that I'm deciding to go with.

34
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,800
You can choose whatever you like.

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,140
Okay so here we go.

36
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,300
We've got Jay Pegg ongoing import into unreel and the boss.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,020
Let's go to our content browser and create a new folder for images.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,440
I'm going to have a few images in a UI so let's include them at least in one place and I'm going to

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,230
drag from flicker to that image folder.

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,460
It's going to import the image for me.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,040
Okay so I've got my image now imported.

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,910
I want to set it as a background to this whole box thing.

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,290
So to create a background for this I think what I'm going to do is wrap that whole vertical box with

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,030
a.

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
Overlay.

46
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,180
So if we go over and over wrap it all with an overlay right click on the buckle box and wrap with an

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,050
overlay.

48
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,130
Then what we're going to get is the following the vertical box is too small.

49
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,160
So let's click the vertical box and set it horizontal and vertical alignments to be the full width of

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,120
the page.

51
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,790
Get an image and put that as a sibling of the vertical box and just above the vertical box so that it

52
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,890
goes behind it in terms of the z order.

53
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,110
And similarly with the image selected let's do the horizontal and vertical fill.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,640
Obviously white is not what we're going for.

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,900
So let's go to appearance and brush image and change that out for the texture that we wanted.

56
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,630
Okay.

57
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:03,360
So we've got at texture it's maybe a little bit bright so if we want to dull it down a bit then selecting

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,700
the image we can go to the tint and change the tint slightly to be just a little bit darker.

59
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,690
So we got a darker background.

60
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,980
Great start there.

61
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,920
So that has been scaling the box for backgrounds.

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,370
Let's have a look at how we can do more interesting buttons.

63
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,380
Let's click on our buttons and see what properties they have in the first place.

64
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,880
If we go to appearance that we've got the colour in a pastie in background colour and things like that.

65
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,520
But another thing is the style.

66
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,380
Now if you really want it changed how the button looks You gonna need to change the style because we've

67
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,110
got the style for the normal hovered and pressed buttons.

68
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,310
You click on the normal.

69
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,850
Then it gives you an option to include an image.

70
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,760
Let's see how this image works if we have a look at the documentation which is linked in your lecture

71
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,170
on styling.

72
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:00,390
You'll see that there is a section here called setting image States and there is a complicated graphic

73
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,470
here that for me was a little bit hard to follow.

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,910
So let's do the following.

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,760
I'm going to right click the box and save that image.

76
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:17,350
So this first image on the left say that into my downloads and I'm going to import that image in two

77
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:17,960
on.

78
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:25,340
So let's go to the content browser to the images folder and drag over to there.

79
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,640
Actually import and let's replace the image of the button.

80
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,870
With that box.

81
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,330
Example.

82
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,420
So little bit confusing at the moment.

83
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:45,740
Let's rescale it by selecting the text in our button right clicking wrap with and wrap with a size box

84
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,530
so that we can control the size that I'm going to select the size box go to the details pane and check

85
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,170
next to width and height.

86
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,440
And so I can set a width and height for this box like so I can drag it out to create a different width

87
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,610
and height.

88
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,760
Now what's going on here with this image.

89
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:11,420
Well what you'll notice is that as I'm scaling less the corners of the image are not being scaled.

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,310
So these bits with the Green Cross are not being scaled.

91
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:23,240
However if I change the height then the two sides on the left and right are being scaled just in the

92
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,110
height.

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,160
But the side on the top and bottom is not being scaled.

94
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,150
With the width it's the other way round.

95
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,910
So the top and bottom has been scaled But the Left and Right are not.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,010
And whenever I'm scaling any of these.

97
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:43,610
The centre section is always being scaled so this is what's known as a nine slice image named after

98
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,970
the fact that it is an image sliced up into nine pieces and it's very common for creating things where

99
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,660
you want to have border detail such as a button.

100
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:00,470
This is because it keeps the scaling around the edges constant and you don't end up with weirdly scaled

101
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,570
things.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,810
So it's great for doing borders of boxes and so on like that.

103
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,330
And so if we have a look at the documentation again then you'll see near the bottom there is an example

104
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,200
of these kinds of buttons you can see that they have borders round the edges which are a bit complicated

105
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,670
and you wouldn't want to scale the whole thing up without doing this kind of nine slice.

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,680
But then there's a way of naturally scaling but it's okay.

107
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,800
So another thing that we can have a look at is with buttons.

108
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,380
They have different types of display mode.

109
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:40,390
Let's select the button again and go and have a look at the style normal and draw as properties as time.

110
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,180
You can see that currently it's draw a box that's doing this nine slice behaviour.

111
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:52,490
If we saw a border it's going to cut out the middle of our box and instead just show those edges.

112
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,950
Now it's not quite working just right because our margins aren't set up exactly right just underneath

113
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,240
doran's there's a margin property and you can go and fiddle with those margins to make sure that it's

114
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,880
cutting out the right bit of the image.

115
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,760
Mike so.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,480
And then what you've got is essentially just the border done via Well essentially what's now an 8 slice

117
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,450
image rather than a 9 slice image.

118
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,450
And you can also choose the draw as option of image.

119
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,740
Now what this does is very very simple.

120
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:29,980
It just scales everything so you can see all those bits in the nine slice image all getting scaled equally.

121
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:38,680
So that is how we can do three different ways of doing buttons or customizing buttons within an unreal

122
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,300
button.

123
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,920
How about fonts.

124
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,070
Where would you go to go and get some fonts.

125
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:52,990
Well I'm recommending Google fonts which is phuntsok google dot com and here they have got a great comprehensive

126
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,750
list of all sorts of different fonts which you can use completely for free.

127
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,970
They're designed to be used on websites so it's free to download free to distribute to other people.

128
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,860
If you go and hit the little surge icon in the top right there are some filters for these fonts because

129
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,380
there are a lot of fonts it's hard to find the ones that you're looking for.

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,380
And the font the filters work as following.

131
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,070
Let's have a look at mostly at the category that's the most important thing for me.

132
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:26,440
Serif means that it has these little spiky bits on the end of the letters and that's as if it had been

133
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,300
carved out of rock Times New Roman is the classic example of a serif font.

134
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:39,330
The Sans serif font is the one without the spiky bits and sans being French for without.

135
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,470
We've then got handwriting fonts handwriting fonts are as they say on the tin.

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,020
Meant to look like handwriting.

137
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:50,650
Monospaced fonts are fixed width fonts also known as fixed width.

138
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,520
It's typically used in terminals and programming editors because it makes it really easy to see the

139
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,740
formatting and because of that constant width and some of them are really pretty cool.

140
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,550
And then finally we've got our display category which is the kind of font that you might use for headings

141
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,640
on a website.

142
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,850
Just the interesting looking fonts that you wouldn't want to be reading a huge long paragraph because

143
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:23,550
they're quite hard to read but they are very cool looking and can lead to a very interesting effect.

144
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,830
Now what you can do is select the fonts that you like the look of white as you scrolling through I like

145
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,980
the look of this audio wide ones I can click it and it has this font family selected.

146
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,750
I've gone.

147
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,770
I recently changed page didn't mean to.

148
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,430
I can just click on the font family selected and there is a download.

149
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,490
This selection here which allows you to download a zip with the font in it that will be able to import

150
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:57,270
very easily into unreel So it's time to challenge you to make your menu look pretty.

151
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,170
How are you going to do that.

152
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,670
Well that depends on you entirely.

153
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,440
Add a background just like I did and one thing that we might want to have a look at.

154
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,110
Actually with that background I dont think its fully complete yet because if I go ahead and hit play

155
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,130
with my background as it currently stands and try and scale it.

156
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:25,060
Then you will notice that it is being stretched in a bizarre way which is not very nice.

157
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,600
So let's complete that background just a second.

158
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:35,630
Now the way that we can prevent it from scaling in such a fashion is to use a container called a scale

159
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,330
box.

160
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,740
So if I right click on my image and go to wrap with and select scale box then you'll notice it has done

161
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,710
something clever already.

162
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,290
Select the image and make sure that it's at the correct image size.

163
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,250
It does look like it as go to the scale box and have a look at its properties.

164
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:59,410
It has a stretching property here and there's a couple of options for the stretching property.

165
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,260
You can scale to fit x you can scale to fit Y or you can scale to fill.

166
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,260
So scaling to fail is probably what I want to be doing.

167
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,310
And if you go ahead and scale it what you'll notice is that it automatically scaling in both x and y

168
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,070
to keep the aspect ratio but without.

169
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:27,410
Without letting anything creep in from the edges so always make sure there's plenty to see on the screen

170
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:35,080
but it will cut off bits of the crop off bits of the image just to make sure that the scaling and the

171
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,080
aspect ratio is all the same and that the image is centred in that.

172
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,590
In fact you can probably change that whether the image is Senator or not.

173
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,860
By clicking on the image and changing its alignment within this slot I think that does work indeed it

174
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,410
seems to go ahead and align it to the left.

175
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,000
Then when I scale it does indeed.

176
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,360
Just a line to the left.

177
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,560
I liked it scaling with the centre so I'm going to keep it that way.

178
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,920
Like so now you understand how to use scale boxes to make sure that backgrounds work better like that.

179
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,890
We can go on and continue with the challenge definition.

180
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,830
So add a background of your choice.

181
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,330
Do whatever you like and make those scaling work however you like it.

182
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,520
Customize the buttons and choose a custom font.

183
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,200
Now with the custom buttons I have included a pack.

184
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,040
If you can't find anything yourself it's attached to the lecture.

185
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:35,170
So because the challenge is actually quite long we're going to be completing it in the next lecture.

186
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,210
Now don't worry it's just long because there's lots of pointing and clicking.

187
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,440
Not because it's very complicated.

188
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,240
So I'll see you in the next lecture when you've attempted the challenge.
