00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,860
Welcome to this lecture on simulating air resistance here.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,610
We're going to get rid of the infinites top speed of the car.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,810
Now you can see that as I'm accelerating I've actually reached a top speed here.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,620
I'm not accelerating any further.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm not going at those crazy speeds that were completely unmanageable and believing I still got the

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,810
throttle held down.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,270
I just can't go any faster.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,790
And the way we're going to do this is by simulating air resistance in the world so that when we basically

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,500
try and accelerate too fast the air resistance will be slowing us down.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,170
Let's dive in and see how that actually works.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,670
So as I mentioned in the last video we currently have a rather unrealistic situation that we can carry

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,160
on accelerating until the cows come home.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,930
Basically there is no top speed.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,730
We just keep going until we hit something which is fun in itself maybe but a more simple way to accelerate

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,530
and get used to it is to actually be able to have a top speed.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,800
Now this does beg the question why do cars have a top speed why they not carry on accelerating for ever.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,020
And if you've been paying attention in physics you may have heard of such a thing as air resistance

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,660
or drag as it's also known.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:23,860
So let's have a look at how air is distance and drag stop us from being able to reach an infinite top

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,450
speed.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,510
Let's take a look at the car we were looking at from before.

22
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,210
We've got a porch with a driving force on it.

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,990
Now the driving force isn't the only force that we have on our porsh.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,990
In reality we also have a force due to drag or air resistance which I'm going to denote with this purple

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,400
arrow here which is pointing backwards.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,100
Now unlike the driving force it doesn't depend on our input at least not directly.

27
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,190
It doesn't depend on me putting the throttle down and so we provide more driving force through the engine.

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,620
No.

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,010
This depends on how fast we are going.

30
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,260
So you can start to see why this might imply a top speed.

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:10,660
In fact this is the way that it depends on how fast we're going so if we're going at zero speed there

32
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,840
is no drag force there's no resistance to our movement by the air that's hitting the car.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,070
That's why we get drag because air hits the car and slows us down.

34
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,090
Now if we're going at one then we're going to get a force roughly proportional to one.

35
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,780
So we're going to get one unit of force we're going at a speed of two then we're actually going to get

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,480
a force of a four.

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,720
So you can see how this is rapidly growing much faster than our speed.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,640
When we go at three we get a force of roughly nine and only go for we going at 16.

39
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,610
So you can see that what we're doing here is we're squaring the speed in order to get to the force and

40
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,940
that is how air resistance works is what's known as a square law which means that the more you increase

41
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,840
your speed the faster and the more and more force you're going to have to put in to counteract the drag

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,390
that you getting from that speed that's why cars have a top speed because they have a top force that

43
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,380
they can produce.

44
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,210
They have a search engine horsepower.

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:20,440
And once you reach a certain speed the drag equals the amount of force that your engine can create to

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,550
maintain that speed.

47
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,460
And you get stuck and can't accelerate anymore because you've got a negative force plus a positive force

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,720
which equals zero when they're equal.

49
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,590
So that's why we have drag.

50
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,850
That's why there is a top speed and this is how they're related.

51
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,020
Now let's have a look at the exact formula for that.

52
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:44,920
The formula is that the air resistance is equal to the negative of the speed squared multiplied by some

53
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,110
drag coefficient.

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,780
The drag coefficient is a constant number which we just use to help us convert between the speed and

55
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,000
the air resistance.

56
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,710
And the reason we have a drag coefficient.

57
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,130
It's because certain cars are more aerodynamic than others.

58
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:07,900
So if you had a rather large drag coefficient then that means that you have a very poor aerodynamic

59
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,170
car because your air resistance is going to be greater for the same amount of speed.

60
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,780
But still we are squaring the speed and that is the main relationship here.

61
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,400
So this is what we are going to go ahead and implement in just a second.

62
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,460
But before that I want to tell you a little bit about the difference between speed and velocity in case

63
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,030
you haven't picked up on it yet.

64
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,930
The loss of T is a vector whereas speed is a float.

65
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,330
That's basically the difference.

66
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,930
Speed tells us about the dinner not about the direction it tells you about the magnitude of the velocity

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,180
vector whereas velocity tells you both the direction and the magnitude so when you're talking about

68
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,480
speed with saying this is the air resistance that goes in the opposite direction to the direction of

69
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,970
ass beat.

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,340
That's where a direction comes into things.

71
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,630
How we get hold of speed in unreel Let's go in to Visual Studio and have a look in attic.

72
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,550
So currently we've got a velocity.

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,580
How do we get speed from velocity.

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,570
Well it's actually super super simple.

75
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:14,050
You do a velocity dot size because that gives you the magnitude or size of the vector the length of

76
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,450
that arrow and that will tell you the speed it doesn't tell you the direction of the speed but it does

77
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,510
tell you the speed.

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,050
So when we're using a negative sign here we mean that the resistance goes in the opposite direction

79
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,200
to that speed.

80
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,670
So it's time for you to have a go at implementing this in a challenge to calculate the force due to

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,030
air resistance.

82
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,920
So add the air resistance to the force that we already have.

83
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,110
You can see we've got a force here that we're calculating in our acceleration.

84
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,820
Well if we equal this out with a negative force going in the opposite direction due to air resistance

85
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,610
we want our acceleration to be nil.

86
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,310
For it to stop accelerating.

87
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,220
So you're going to have to add to this force.

88
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,130
Going to start off with this force from the driving force and then you can add some resistance forces

89
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,780
on top of that.

90
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,960
So create a function to calculate the resistance and that will make it nice and factored out.

91
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,880
Use the formula from the last slide to calculate the resistance and obviously your unreel know how an

92
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,100
F maths in all your knowledge about vectors to do that.

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,710
Which direction should it be in.

94
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,120
Remember that the resultant force has to be a vector but the formula I gave you on the last line is

95
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,420
to do with forces.

96
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,950
So you're going to have to add the direction component back in.

97
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,600
And then some of the forces on the cart so that you get a resultant force and a resultant acceleration

98
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,210
pause a video and have a go at this challenge.

99
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,410
Okay welcome back.

100
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,220
Let's dive in and give this a shot.

101
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,580
So I'm going to remove this velocity size that I was using to show you how we'd get the speed and we're

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,100
going to go ahead and create ourselves a new function over in the head of file.

103
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:54,640
We've got our plie rotation and update location from velocity above that I want to create a function

104
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,740
which returns an F vector.

105
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,380
Because that is our force.

106
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,000
And I'm going to call this get resistance.

107
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,170
Which basically says it all don't need to take any arguments because the velocity is the only thing

108
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:15,800
we need and that is on the class so we can go ahead and implement get resistance over in our C++ file.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,070
I'm going to implement right under tick get resistance and I am going to namespace that.

110
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,880
And then I am going to implement the body.

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,760
Now obviously it's going to have to return something because it is of return type f vector.

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,930
That's fairly simple so we're just going to do the returns straightaway.

113
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,650
And remember what our formula was let's go back and have a look at what the formula was its air resistance

114
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,570
equals negative speed squared multiplied by the drag coefficient.

115
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,310
We're going to need a drag coefficient that's going to be something that we can edit.

116
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,270
So I'm going to create a new you property for this are after the degrees per second.

117
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:02,700
I am going to create a new property which says drag coefficient and 90 is not going to be what we want.

118
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,420
We'll have a think about what we want in just a second.

119
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,180
But let's think of a description.

120
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,890
Just going to start with higher means more drag.

121
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,610
That's the basic description.

122
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,830
But what are going to be the units on this let's have a look.

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,690
We've got an C++.

124
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,920
We haven't written out yet but we've got a speed squared multiplied by the drag coefficient ends up

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,690
creating Newtons.

126
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,940
So that's a bit strange.

127
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,600
It doesn't actually lend itself to any particular units at all.

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,860
The drag coefficient is units less as they say.

129
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,520
Actually it does have units thanks to Bill Westlake for pointing this out.

130
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:51,320
The units are kg's per meter and I will link to the forum post where Bill actually explains why that

131
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,110
is.

132
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,490
So let's go over to our head of fire and think of what a sensible value for this drag coefficient would

133
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,210
be.

134
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,920
Well let's think about the maximum speed and the maximum force.

135
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:13,040
We've got a maximum driving force of 10000 and we want to have say a maximum speed similar to the 60

136
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:20,600
miles per hour range which is about 25 meters per second which is the unit we are using remember so

137
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:28,670
we can work out what at sensible drag coefficient is going to be um going to do this in Rome for us.

138
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,430
In fact let's bring up everybody's favourite computational knowledge engine.

139
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,230
The Wolfram Alpha website and calculate this so we've got our.

140
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,810
Maximum force which is going to be air resistance.

141
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:49,070
And then we've got our speed which is 25 meters per second and we're going to try and rearrange this.

142
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,880
So we've got a drag her fission equal to the following.

143
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,070
So let's take a look at this slide which will rearrange things for us.

144
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,770
So we've got air resistance equal to minus their speed squared multiplied by the drag coefficient we

145
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,430
can rearrange.

146
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,790
This is a little bit of algebra to be air resistance divided by speed squared equals the drag efficient.

147
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:14,120
So add drag coefficient is going to be equal to 10000 divided by 25 squared.

148
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:21,660
Let's calculate that in Wolfram Alpha 10000 divided by 25 squared which you can just do with this Carrott

149
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:27,500
notation and we'll go ahead and look at what the result is and the result is 16.

150
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,330
So add drag coefficient as a good starting point should be 16.

151
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:39,150
So I'm going to put 16 into Add drag coefficient there so now equipped with that drag coefficient we

152
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,800
can go back into the C plus plus and actually calculate that resistance so we're saying that first we

153
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,660
want to get the speed.

154
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,970
So that's velocity dot size as shown.

155
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,200
And we can go ahead and square this we can square it with F maths.

156
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,810
So do an F maths curl on coelen Square like so.

157
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,970
But I want to show you that there is another trick that you can use here because actually during the

158
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:11,620
calculation of size we have to actually calculate the size square so unreal provides you with a little

159
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:18,400
efficiency function here where instead of getting a square and size square squaring the size after it's

160
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,180
just been square rooted you can do the square size squared like that so you can actually get the size

161
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,890
squared directly so we're going to just make use of that.

162
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,670
That's quite helpful I think.

163
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,780
Okay so that's size squared.

164
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,400
We're going to multiply by our.

165
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,110
Drag coefficient like so and it's almost right except we're not returning a vector because we haven't

166
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,550
added in some direction.

167
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,650
That direction is just going to be the negative of the velocity direction.

168
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:55,100
So we're going to go for velocity dot and then we need to get the direction of the hand so we're going

169
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,160
to get the normal.

170
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:03,510
So I'm going to do a get safe normal in unreel to do that and we can multiply it by the.

171
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,090
Floats on our right to increase the magnitude of that vector.

172
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,870
And remember we need to make it negative because this force goes counter to the velocity.

173
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,550
Okay.

174
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,680
So we've got ourselves a resistance force all that needs to be done now is we to add it to the driving

175
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,750
force that's going to be fairly straightforward isn't it we can't do a force plus equals get resistance.

176
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,260
And that should do the trick.

177
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:37,030
Let's go ahead and build and see if we've got a sensible resistance and a sensible coefficient of drag.

178
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,610
So the build at least were success of all.

179
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,740
Let's go ahead and try it out see if it now works.

180
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,770
So I'm accelerating accelerating accelerating and as you can see I do appear to have stopped accelerating

181
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,330
or not going any faster than this which is quite manageable speed.

182
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:02,440
So I do think that we are now experiencing air resistance that has counted out the speed that I was

183
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,020
going at.

184
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,630
I can see I'm not going any faster.

185
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,260
That seems like a successful air resistance to me.

186
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,230
One thing I would like to see is that if I take my hand off the accelerator we start to slow down.

187
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,240
But you'll notice that we aren't actually slowing down to a stop not very easily it's going to take

188
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,170
a very very long time to slow all the way down to a stop.

189
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,270
Now the reason for that is imagine that you are playing this game here.

190
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,180
Air hockey you will remember if you ever played this game that the park in question that your batting

191
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,720
between the between you and your opponent trying to get it into their goal basically never stops.

192
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,460
And the reason it never stops is because it's only subject to air resistance very much like a car it's

193
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,530
hovering on a bed of air.

194
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,800
And so it isn't getting any resistance from the ground.

195
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:58,000
This means that when you're lost he's starting to get very close to zero your force is your drag force

196
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,410
is also getting very close to zero so it's not slowing you down any quicker.

197
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,600
In fact we're going to look at our car you can see that it's still inching its way across the ground

198
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:13,570
very slowly getting slower and slower but it's never gonna stop because that force is never going to

199
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,220
be large enough to stop it.

200
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,430
I mean eventually will not be able to tell that it's moving but we basically can't ever stop it moving

201
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,150
with a force that changes with the velocity.

202
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:30,550
So we're going to look in the next lecture and a different type of force that doesn't change with velocity.

203
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,030
In fact it's constant and that's called rolling resistance so we'll have a look about the next letter

204
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,960
and how it will bring our car to a stop.

205
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,930
I'll see you there.
