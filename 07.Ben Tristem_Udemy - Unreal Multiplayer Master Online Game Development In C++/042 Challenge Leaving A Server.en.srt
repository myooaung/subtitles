00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,050
Hello and welcome to another exciting episode.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,210
So here we are with our Big Game.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,340
And if we bring up our in-game menu now what happens is I can cancel that menu and I can also use it

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,060
to quit.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,350
Back to the main menu.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,490
And if we're in a multiplayer scenario and you are joining a server that will make you leave the server.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,750
So we are going to be doing this in fact you're going to be doing this again.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,030
Another challenge lecture.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,510
So let's dive in and see how it goes.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,340
So let's take a look at the problem.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,810
We're going to go to our first of all get our map in the third person cvp Maps third person example

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,140
map load that one up and hit play so that we can get an in game menu.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,610
I'm going to hit em get my in-game menu.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,010
And obviously the problem here is the cancell and quick but buttons are not working at all well.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,920
Easily enough.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,920
You guys know how to actually fix this.

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,530
So I'm going to make this whole challenge this whole lecture challenge.

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,970
And this was to create cancell and quit to create the behaviours for both of these.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,070
So it's quite simple.

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,600
You're going to create a function in the game instance that will handle what is need.

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,930
What needs to be handled.

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:23,730
Your update the interface to talk to that you'll then implement cancel which may not need a function

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,630
in the game instance at all.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,690
Think about that and implement the quit to main menu so I'm using quick to mean go up to the main menu

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,240
where you can then choose a quick option that'll be the subject the next lecture.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,290
But in this one just going back to the main menu will do so.

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,800
Pause the video and have a go at this.

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,440
Okay welcome back.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,780
So we've had to quiz challenge videos back to back.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,650
I hope that's okay.

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,970
Let me know what you think of that.

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,690
And we're going to dive right in and start implementing this.

33
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:58,470
First of all with hooking up that cancel button So let's dive in to visual studio as a first port of

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,200
call.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,890
And what we're going to be doing is going to be adding in a button to the in-game menu.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,580
H.

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,720
So as a starting point I'm going to be using the menu that we already have which is our menu widget

38
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,700
dot H and in the menu widget actually sorry not the menu widget but the main menu or agent or s.p. we're

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,850
the ones who want to use not the menu widgets are going to close down the many widget to avoid confusion.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,720
And in the head a file we have a bunch of private properties which are binding to you buttons.

41
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,290
So I'm going to take one of those including the private label and put it in our header file for the

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,130
in-game menu.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,540
H Okay.

44
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,640
And we're going to has changed the name because our button is called something else let's go and see

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,080
what our bundes call go to us real go into our menu system folder.

46
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,280
The main the.

47
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,410
You what's it called w.p. in game any.

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,120
That's the one I open up that widget and take a look in the hierarchy and see what I cancel buttons

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,510
called Funnily enough it's called cancel button you'd never have guessed it.

50
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:10,560
So we're going to change the name of the property to cancel button so binds properly and we can actually

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,480
go ahead and compile that right away so that it we've got a head start on getting that comp. and checking

52
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,140
that all works out.

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,350
The next thing we have to do is bind that cancel button.

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,050
So for that we need an initialised method.

55
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,950
If we go into our many do h.

56
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,100
We have got a protected method that we called initialised because we might want to override it in subclasses

57
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,620
but we definitely do not want it being called from the outside.

58
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,030
So that's why I'm going to put in my ingame many are age as well.

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,150
And let's have a look at the see hoopy for how that was implemented.

60
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,010
I remember it being a little bit tricky for how it was implemented.

61
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,260
It's obviously not compiling now that I've added in that initialise signature.

62
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,060
So we have something a little bit interesting going on here.

63
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,810
It's calling the super initialised but it's super initialised can return success or not.

64
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,340
So were returning early if super fail to initialize.

65
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,140
Fair enough.

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,610
I'm going to copy all of that into in-game menu.

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,780
Scott C. P. P..

68
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,360
Like so.

69
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,500
And I'm going to change my name spacing so the namespace should be you in-game menu.

70
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,390
Let's change that out.

71
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,550
Now Super will work just fine I'm going to close off the brackets and I'm going to make sure that the

72
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:27,900
end of our method we have a return equals true because otherwise we won't be returning after having

73
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,360
successfully set it up.

74
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:35,150
So next up we want to do the binding again binding we've done before in Maine many CPS hunger.

75
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,840
Take those as templates.

76
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,050
Take one of these lines that does our insurer of the button and then doesn't click had dynamic take

77
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,920
one of those lines paste it into the ingame NAACP and change out the button name.

78
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,760
So I'm going to take cancel button as the name and replace it both in the insurer statement and the

79
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,850
on click statement like so.

80
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,760
And now we just have to point it at a function that we want to call.

81
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,330
Now what is it that we want the cancel button to do.

82
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,390
Essentially we want it to tear down the menu.

83
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,650
For that we don't have to call out to the game instance we've got a tear down method implemented in

84
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:18,310
the superclass here so you might be tempted to go ahead and just put it in something like you in-game

85
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,420
menu.

86
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,240
Ted how.

87
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,490
And that seems sensible at first glance but it isn't going to work and the reason it's not going to

88
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,570
work is that tear down is not a you function.

89
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,380
So in order to fix this we can even make 10 hour you function then particularly fancy that shouldn't

90
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,000
really be a function.

91
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,300
However the other thing we can do is create a function here on the ingame many that then cause a tear

92
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,540
down.

93
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,880
So I'm going to do the latter option.

94
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,080
Going to go ahead and create a new function.

95
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,100
With a void return type called cancel.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Or cancel pressed and it's going to take no arguments.

97
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,660
And that should do it for the signature.

98
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,710
Let's take that signature and implement it in C++.

99
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,000
Put namespace.

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,220
But a body.

101
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,820
And then Amy here we can call.

102
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,850
Tear down to our hearts content.

103
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

104
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,100
And that means that now we want to use this cancell pressed as our call-back for the cancel button.

105
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,270
Hopefully that will work.

106
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:34,290
Let's go ahead and I see squiggly line actually before I compile that says the cancel button isn't working.

107
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:40,340
That's because an incomplete type because we need to include the head a file for the button the head

108
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:47,610
file for the button is in our main menu see if pupae which is include components for Flash button or

109
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,970
H that bring that over as well.

110
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,050
And there we go.

111
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,900
Hopefully that will bring get rid of all our warnings.

112
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,850
Let's go and Bill and see whether that's making our cancel button work now.

113
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,550
Okay so our field has succeeded.

114
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,180
Let's go back in to unreal.

115
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,570
Let's hit play in our game get our menu up.

116
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,610
Hit cancel.

117
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,930
And sure enough it turns itself down we get to carry on playing.

118
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,720
Here I am again I kept cancel and I can just pause.

119
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,710
This is not pausing the many of the game.

120
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:27,030
The game keeps running while the menu is up but I am able to cancel that menu and carry on from where

121
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,450
I was before which is much much better.

122
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,030
Okay so next up we wanted to do something for that quick button as well.

123
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,970
So let's head back into visual studio.

124
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,330
We what we want to do is now add in a click a quick button which would be very easy.

125
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,420
We can now just copy the.

126
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,440
Not that you function but our cancel button.

127
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,500
Binding.

128
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,030
And I really wish something could be done about this visual studio indent stuff.

129
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,290
It really is very annoying.

130
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,200
Okay so we're going to bind a quick button and then with this quick button we're going to need to call

131
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,720
out to something.

132
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,310
So I'm going to create a new function right away.

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,850
For quick pressed Boyd quit Prest.

134
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,040
Mike so and then with quick press we are gonna need to obviously implement it too.

135
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,240
So we're going to take that over and see.

136
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,960
Plus plast and paste in our name space.

137
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,120
And put in a body.

138
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,690
Okay.

139
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,580
So it will worry about how to implement it in just a second.

140
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,820
First off I'm going to add the binding to the quick button.

141
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:46,600
So take a quick Button's name so I don't miss type it and replace it in the Ensure and in the binding

142
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,380
line itself and change the method that we're binding to.

143
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,090
To be quick Prest.

144
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,860
Okay.

145
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,030
Now that's pretty much good except now we actually need to call something.

146
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,180
So what are we going to need to call.

147
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,250
Well is going to have to be our game instance because the game instances the thing that knows how to

148
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,110
travel to a different level it knows how to go back to the main menu.

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,670
So what we're going to need is something in the interface in a menu interface or h.

150
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
Let's open that up.

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,980
That allows us to go back to Main Menu.

152
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,640
So I'm going to create it as a virtual void load main menu.

153
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,370
Mike so it's not going to take anything and it's going to be pure virtual with a zero.

154
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,500
Now hopefully this means that when we go over to our game instance which implements our menu interface

155
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,850
we should be getting some errors from the game.

156
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,590
Essence in fact let's go ahead and build and see whether we get pay.

157
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,410
Again error.

158
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:57,930
So sure enough if I now get to my output log and have a look at the error that is showing up here it

159
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:04,020
says that it cannot instantiate the abstract class game instance which is abstract due to load main

160
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:10,470
menu being abstract basically meaning that we haven't implemented lone main menu so we can go ahead

161
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,720
and do that fairly easily.

162
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,560
I'm just going to copy the signature again from our menu interface dot H and we're going go over to

163
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,010
puzzle platforms game in Sterns and we're going to stick it in there.

164
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,200
So where am I going to put it.

165
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,270
It's not going to be public I think.

166
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,860
And it is an is it going to be private.

167
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,280
Yes I think it's got to be private.

168
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,730
Because now let's think about this.

169
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,740
Why is it private.

170
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,430
Because what I don't want to happen is for someone to grab hold of a game instance and use the lomo

171
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,550
menu or do I maybe I do maybe that's okay actually.

172
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,130
So let's put it in public.

173
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,630
And we will implement a load main menu.

174
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,450
It's okay for it to be virtual.

175
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,910
It's okay for it to be void it's not okay for it to be abstract.

176
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,910
And I want to make sure that I am correctly overriding song and put the override key word there as well.

177
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,270
Now that's something that could be said for some of the other functions in the menu interface door as

178
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,790
well in both host and join I want to make sure that they are being overridden.

179
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,710
So let's have a look at where we've done that we've got a void host and a voice join both of which could

180
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,330
do with having an override key word after them.

181
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,630
So let's do that to make sure that they are indeed being overwritten over ridden rather.

182
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,320
Now our load main menu is without an implementation so if we go into the C++ for the game instance and

183
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,780
find an appropriate place somewhere to join I believe would be a good place.

184
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,930
Then we can implement our load main menu we'd need to remove virtual We need to remove override we need

185
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,970
to add a namespace.

186
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,780
And after we've added the namespace we need to put in a body.

187
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,020
For the method.

188
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,550
Okay so I'm pretty happy that that's good.

189
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,640
Now we actually have to make load maimon you do something.

190
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,460
Fortunately we basically know how to do this.

191
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,180
We've got our server travel or client travel both of which would be helpful in this case.

192
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,960
I think Server travels what we want.

193
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,480
We just want to take ourselves all the way back to to our main menu.

194
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,220
Actually on second thoughts I think about this so we've got our server travel which would basically

195
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,430
take all of the players with it to the main menu.

196
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,290
If we are the server so that's not exactly ideal.

197
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,920
And if we're not the server it might not work at all we might not be able to use a truck travel so we're

198
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,710
better off using a client travel which will disconnect us from the current server which is what we want

199
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,950
if we're on a server and want to leave the server then we do a quit action.

200
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,360
So let's do that instead let's do a client travel for that.

201
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,200
We can use our join.

202
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,130
Add join menu.

203
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,170
Basically what we've done in join.

204
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,440
So how we're going to do this where we've got our play a controller get our player control win sure

205
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,670
it's there and then we do a client travel as do the same thing in our load main menu.

206
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,400
Except this time instead of an address we are going to give the string very similar to what we had in

207
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,150
server trowels.

208
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,300
I'm going to copy that.

209
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:25,120
And use it as the address and instead of game third person maps we are going to be going to our main

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,150
menu screen which we know to be content main menu system main menu.

211
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,380
So it's going to be menu system main menu and we don't have to put any Listen after it because we're

212
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,600
not trying to host a server here.

213
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,560
Okay travel absolute.

214
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:49,050
We'll keep that as it is and pretty much we've got an implementation there for load main menu.

215
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:56,460
Okay so now if we go in to our in-game P copy we just need to ensure that interface is there.

216
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:03,020
So again to say if menu interface is not not not not pointer.

217
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,970
Then we can go ahead.

218
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,880
And we can use the menu interface to call that function.

219
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,760
So let's do that.

220
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,980
It's going to be load main menu but not forgetting that before we load than a menu actually wants to

221
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,200
tear down the current menu.

222
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,500
So that's what we're going do.

223
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,700
We're going to call tear down as a first port of call.

224
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,780
Okay.

225
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,790
And let's go ahead and build that and see whether we have got something working let's just overview

226
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,630
what and while that's building what we have done we have created a binding to the quit button in ingame

227
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:49,000
many die each We have bound in ingame many docs keen that Quit button to quit Prest then quit Prest

228
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:54,910
We are checking whether we have a menu interface remember the menu interface is set by our superclass.

229
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,670
It's a variable on our superclass.

230
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,250
If that is set then we tear down our menu and we use the menu interface to load ourselves a main menu

231
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:10,780
that load main menu is implemented over in our game instance dot s.p. with load menu which gets our

232
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,590
first player controller and does a client travel back to the main menu.

233
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,540
Fantastic.

234
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,230
So I think that's all good.

235
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,910
Let's.

236
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,350
It's compiled successfully.

237
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:25,910
Let's go over in two and real and test it out so I'm going to go ahead hit play.

238
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,840
Get the menu hit quit.

239
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,050
And here we are back at our main menu.

240
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,790
I'm going to leave it up to you folk to test this out in a multiplayer scenario and check that the disconnection

241
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,810
happens as intended.
