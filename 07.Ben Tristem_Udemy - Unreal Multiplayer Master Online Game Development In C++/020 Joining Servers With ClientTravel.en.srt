1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,320
So I'm pretty excited about this upcoming lecture because what we're going to do is we've already got

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,280
hosting implemented and you've had that in the last lecture.

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,580
So let me go ahead and host and get this get a guy standing over here on the cube.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,880
And what are we going to implement in this letter as you might well guess is the ability to join So

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:29,240
this dude is standing around the lobby and he's been told by his friend that he's got a server.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,480
So what he's going to do is he's going to go into the console and type and join and then the address

7
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,690
on the server.

8
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:45,740
Which is this address the usual one for me and he's going to go ahead and join and boom he is in the

9
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:52,160
same room and playing with his friend without having to ever have touched the command line or the terminal

10
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,230
or command prompt or power shell.

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,700
He's just download the binaries.

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,090
So this is one step closer to being able to share this with your friends.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm really excited about it and gets us involved in the whole circle of joining and hosting.

14
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,460
So let's dive in and see how it's done.

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:14,900
So now that we've got server hosting built right into our game we want to build in also the server joining.

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,720
Now one thing before we do that is that you'll notice when launching the game by default at the moment

17
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,360
it opens up into the third person level.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,430
We would rather that it opened up into the lobby.

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,540
So that's something we didn't quite get round to doing.

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,290
Let's go to settings project settings and then within project settings we can search for the default

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,850
map.

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,450
We search for default map then you will find the there are two options the editor start up and the game

23
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,260
default.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:47,620
Now I just want to change the game default because I like it booting up the editor into the third person

25
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,260
example map that's where we're doing most of the work but it's good to be in the lobby for the game

26
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:59,170
default because then be in the lobby which is the right place to be as why we set it up right.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,300
So let's close down that project settings and move on with the first item too.

28
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,690
Understand the difference between client travel and server travel now when it was called so a trial

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,370
we may have guessed that there was maybe a client travel as well.

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,780
Well you weren't wrong.

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,410
Let's go and have a look at this so server travel as we've seen works at the world level you call it

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,290
on the world or you call it on the engine and it moves everybody with it.

33
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,070
It moves all the player controls over to the new world which are telling it about.

34
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,200
So what about client travel that operates on a player controller level.

35
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,650
And it tells the individual player controller that it should move.

36
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,480
So it does only one at a time like so.

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,470
And this can be used for connecting when you're currently connected as a player controls your own lobby

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,660
on your own machine.

39
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,570
You can use it to client travel from that lobby to a server to an actual IP address and it will connect

40
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,620
to the Internet connection.

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,090
Load up the map and place your player in the world does all that magic.

42
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,290
So let's go ahead and have a little look at the documentation for the client travel.

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,580
I have handily got a tab in the background here with the player controller client travel and as you

44
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,210
can see it's got just a handful of arguments.

45
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:24,280
It's got the u r l and it's got a travel type and then it's got a few other optional arguments like

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,000
seamless and match package good and things like that.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,830
We don't need to bother with those two.

48
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:36,580
Those are optional but we do need to provide a trowel type in R U R L So the U R L is very simply just

49
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,310
going to be the IP address that we want to go to.

50
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,550
Very very simple.

51
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,990
And the travel type.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,360
You'll notice an in and there's a couple of different options with this in some absolute partial relative.

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,800
We're going to want absolute because we want to specify the server.

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,790
We don't want to just move the map on the same server we want to actually change the server so absolutes

55
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,110
the best way to go there.

56
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,950
Okay so the reason I'm not telling you are not implementing all of this is because that's going to be

57
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,050
part of your challenge now as you can see it's a play control method so we're going to get hold of the

58
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,260
player controller in the game instance let me show you how it's go over into visual studio and go to

59
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:22,700
the game instance C++ file and the join method in there or function whichever you prefer as terminology.

60
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,490
And we're going to how to get hold of a player control in fact it's a play a controller indeed as the

61
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,940
name of the class is.

62
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
So play a controller.

63
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:38,540
Star is going to be a variable called Plek controller funnily enough.

64
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,730
And how are we going to get hold of it.

65
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,810
Well fortunately the game instance has a handy method called Get first.

66
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,850
Local.

67
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,140
Play a controller.

68
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,900
You can find that in the documentation for game instance so you can copy and paste it.

69
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,350
If you're on a Mac for example get first player controller okay.

70
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,670
That works okay.

71
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,960
And we need to check that now as always because there might not be a first player controller at some

72
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,160
point in the game.

73
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,050
Very rare but we'd like to know about that rather than having the editor crash so I'm just going to

74
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,210
put in a little bit of protection with my macro.

75
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,140
Is Gary Player controller.

76
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,160
So we ensure the player control is not null and if it is we return say that we're safe to continue in

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,930
this method.

78
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,480
Doing stuff with play controller.

79
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,340
Okay so with that said let's go ahead and use the play controller.

80
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,400
Well that is going to be your job to find how to use client travel there.

81
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,670
And that is indeed the next step to implement client track.

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,660
So as a whole you are going to be implementing join in this challenge you're going to be implementing

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,790
travelling client travelling specifically using that player controller we've got hold of a test hosting

84
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,750
with joining.

85
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,220
So are you going to be joining and hosting at the same time.

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,490
So are you going to be able to use the command line for both hosting and joining now.

87
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,240
That's the idea.

88
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,700
That's what you're implementing after all.

89
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,410
Going to have to do this in a standalone game because obviously won't be able to get two instances of

90
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,240
the editor running well you can do.

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,210
But no need really.

92
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,140
And when you got it done I wanted to celebrate get out your chair jump around again.

93
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,720
Yes.

94
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,960
And Pat yourselves on the back.

95
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,720
Okay that's an optional step if you're really introvert and I wanna do that.

96
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,680
But I do recommend stretching your legs and celebrating a little bit that we've got to.

97
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:28,660
Awesome milestone of being able to host and join a server in the game was video and have a go at this

98
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,310
challenge.

99
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,420
Okay hopefully you're all full of energy from having celebrated this challenge.

100
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,850
Let's go ahead and give it a shot.

101
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,030
So play a controller.

102
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,490
We're going to open up with an arrow to do a client travel.

103
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,430
And then what we're going to pass in more address is it gonna be why it's going to be the attract Funnily

104
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,820
enough that came in there's an argument and string here just perfect.

105
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,030
Let's go ahead and pass that in and then we can use the E travel type enaam.

106
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,690
Coal on coal on.

107
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,450
And it's going to be travel absolute.

108
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,480
I said would be the best option.

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,000
And that's the end of the method so let's go ahead and build and give this a shot.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,410
I'm going to go and open up how a shell so I can use the commands that were used previously.

111
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,460
As I said you can use command prompt or terminal on the Mac.

112
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,960
So having waited for the builder to complete which he just has I can go ahead and launch the game.

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,570
Now I notice I'm not passing in a map now because the default map will be the lobby just using the game

114
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,670
argument so it doesn't launch the editor and I'm adding a log in case anything goes wrong and I'm going

115
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,500
to spawn up two of these one of them is going to be for hosting on and the other one is going to be

116
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,550
for joining with my games are launching up.

117
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,920
Now I'm getting one black screen and hopefully there'll be another one in the background.

118
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,280
So let's have a look.

119
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,160
Yes we've got two and then I'm going to open up the console on this first one and I'm going to host

120
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,070
from here.

121
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,770
Okey dokey.

122
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,230
So it seems to have worked all right.

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
I seem to be the host.

124
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,150
I'm going to stand on this cube.

125
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,780
And if we see a character standing on his cue then we know we have Joe and joined into the correct world.

126
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,810
So go over to my other puzzle platforms game.

127
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm in my lobby at the moment I go and open up the console and I'm going to join.

128
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,050
The IP address.

129
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,810
That's just.

130
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,860
Then scroll back.

131
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,960
But I don't think I can scroll back because I haven't joined yet 1 9 2 1 6 8 1.

132
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,860
Ninety one I go join and boom.

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,140
We are in the correct place because that dude is standing on the cube the whole server host is there

134
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,480
standing on the cube.

135
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,620
Fantastic.

136
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,480
Big time to celebrate.

137
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,510
Stand up.

138
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,240
Celebrate because we are joining and hosting from all within the game.

139
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,610
This means that you're one step closer to being able to give this to maybe slightly more technical laymen

140
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,520
who don't mind typing and commands.

141
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,470
But still they don't have to open up a command prompt or terminal they can just use your game and your

142
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,480
binary So we're going to find out in the next lecture how we can create that binary and distribute it

143
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,010
over services like HBO to play with your friends.

144
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,980
Fun stuff.

145
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,240
See you in that lecture.
