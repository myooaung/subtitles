00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.300
Hello.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.960
Welcome back.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.070
In this lecture we are going back to finish the solution that we passed nearly finished over in our

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.920
previous lecture where we had started putting together this host menu sometimes things and you I take

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.820
a little bit of time.

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.640
So we're just going to do this in a second lecture.

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.380
You could have probably already done this or during the challenge because you know all the bits.

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.760
But I don't want to show I don't want to do anything offscreen so you don't know what's going on.

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.330
So we've got our host game menu.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.290
What we're doing now is we are going to make it so that when we click host instead of trying to host

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.520
it's going to pull up the host menu so to do that I'm going to go to my main menu.

12
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.570
Dot H.

13
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.710
And I'm going to bind.

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.470
Now the host menu.

15
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.190
We've got a join menu and a main menu.

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.530
Now I want to have a host menu in less binding as well.

17
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.440
So let's just fix up some of the indentation or have a host menu.

18
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.960
Okay so we've got a hosting menu and what we want to do is if we go and find our main menu.

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.030
P p.

20
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:26.800
And we go to where we have a host server clicked on click button thing what we want to do is this handler

21
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.790
should not be host server but open host menu.

22
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.980
So we are going to add a new method where we currently had host server I'm going to change it to open

23
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.620
host menu so where we have open joined many I'm going to change going to create a new you function better

24
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.690
and I'm going to call it call one of them open host menu.

25
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.080
Like so.

26
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.710
And I'm going to go ahead and implement this in the C++ as well.

27
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.940
So I'm going to do this just above an hour hosts but because they're kind of part of the same flow going

28
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.410
and namespace that function.

29
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.770
And I'm going to go ahead and in that function in our open host menu I do need to call that from the

30
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.370
button.

31
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.510
So let's hook it up to the button like so.

32
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.420
And then in this menu is where we're going to be setting a V widget.

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.070
So the way I'm going to do that is just to do a widgets with widget switch a set active widget to rather

34
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.670
than the Join me it's going to be the host menu.

35
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.330
So it gets that name from Join to host and go ahead and build that and hopefully now the button should

36
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.470
be switching over to our host menu.

37
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:55.630
Which does mean that now we should be able to bind both our text box and our host button to actually

38
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.040
go ahead and host the game.

39
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.160
So.

40
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.540
Let's start with that text box that editable text box.

41
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.320
If we select it we can see that name is server hostname and the type needs to be editable text box.

42
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.850
So let's go in to Visual Studio and go to our head of file where we can create that widget bindings

43
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.430
So we've got currently widget binding all sorts of things.

44
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.760
We've got a cancell join menu button we've got joined button quick button confirmed join menu button

45
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.990
menu switch main menu so where's going to be the best place.

46
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.160
Well I'm just going to put it underneath the binding of for a House menu.

47
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.680
So I'm going to create a new binding which is going to be for let's see what did we call the variable

48
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.000
we called it server hostname.

49
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.790
I'm going to copy that go back to Visual Studio and change the name of this variable to server host

50
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.420
name and what's got to be the type the type has got to be of you.

51
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.520
Editable.

52
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.440
Text box.

53
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.310
Mike so.

54
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.860
OK.

55
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.010
So we've got editable text box called server hostname and we are going to create one more thing which

56
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.940
is going to be the button.

57
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.270
The you button.

58
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.910
For what shall we call it.

59
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.510
Because we haven't given it a name yet.

60
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.220
Previously we've called these things confirm and join menu button.

61
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.040
I am not going to go with that.

62
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.770
I'm going to go with host.

63
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.170
Because we've already got a host button so I'm going to do confirm.

64
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.840
Host the menu.

65
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.550
Button.

66
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.480
Like we did before not just for convention.

67
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.540
So I don't have to think too hard.

68
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.090
And while we're at it let's do a council house many button.

69
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.060
I'm just going to put it above the Confirm host menu button.

70
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.700
Sarah will have cancel.

71
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.310
Host menu button.

72
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.520
Let's copy those.

73
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.660
First off the council let's select our cancel button.

74
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.790
And in that cancel button rename it to cancel host menu button.

75
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.530
And then in our host button we're going to select that.

76
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.980
And first off go and copy our confirm House menu button go back into a real and paste that text so hopefully

77
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.080
all of this once we do compile will be able to bind correctly so that's save and compile.

78
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.130
Okay.

79
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.010
So it compiled.

80
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.600
Let's go and see whether we can compile the widget.

81
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.080
Now go to compile that widget and sure enough that's compile which means that the bindings have all

82
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.570
been found which is great news.

83
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.650
So if we go ahead and play the moment we can go to our host game menu but we can't cancel or host anything

84
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.550
because and we can type but the styling is absolutely horrible will fix that soon.

85
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.500
But for now we can't.

86
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.950
What we want to deal with is the fact that cancel the House don't work so let's bind those to actually

87
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.190
do something.

88
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:09.450
So we'll go in to the main menu c p p and we're going to copy the binding actually for the cancel join

89
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:16.110
menu because this one I want to make going to put it just after our host but it meant you but it's going

90
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.540
to be the cancell host.

91
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.190
Menu button.

92
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.030
And it's going to call the same thing because we just want it to open the main menu just to cancel.

93
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.070
Go back and open the main menu.

94
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.350
Now the next thing is the confirm and just going to copy the confirm even though we're going to have

95
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.580
a different call-back because it's very very close in Maine.

96
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.630
So I can just change joined to host like this.

97
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.260
And while we're at it will change the nulled point of checks as well.

98
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:51.030
Like so and then we want that to call our you menu host server instead.

99
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.620
So this is going to cool you menu host server.

100
00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.660
And then in you menu hosts server almost there now we've got our text which is saying hello.

101
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.170
We don't want it to say hello.

102
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.580
What we wanted to do is actually get hold of the F string so f string.

103
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.330
Got a call it server name.

104
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:19.950
This string belongs or lives in the head of file what did we call our text item.

105
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.450
Got memory like a sieve.

106
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:28.630
So let's go over to the head of file and look for what we called that particular editable text box it's

107
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:36.900
the server host name or going a copy that is going to go over to the C++ file again and it's going to

108
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:44.250
be the server hostname arrow and then we want to look for something like text and it should be text

109
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.760
dot too.

110
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.060
Two string.

111
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.780
See if that does the trick.

112
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.540
And we're going to pass this server name in to host.

113
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.400
This is all revision.

114
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.640
We've done this sort of thing before.

115
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.830
So go ahead and build and see whether we are actually getting the thing that we would expect to be getting

116
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.540
from this.

117
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.740
So at least the compile succeeds.

118
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:17.560
Let's go over and make sure that we can save and compile our main menu we can and then we can go into

119
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.020
our power shell and launch a couple of instances to test this out and see whether the server name we

120
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.410
are getting is working.

121
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.570
Okay so first we're going to go ahead and host.

122
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.390
So hosting type in any kind of name that we like.

123
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.510
I'm going to go for donkey.

124
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.230
Gosh this text is really small.

125
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.040
Well hit host and it has hosted.

126
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.510
So that's a good step.

127
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:51.730
Now let's go over to our other game and see if when we go to the join menu we are getting the name that

128
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.280
was listed.

129
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.200
Okay so we've got server name donkey.

130
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.660
So it has actually worked.

131
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.640
We've got the server name to come across.

132
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.300
That's all fantastic so all we need to do now.

133
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:09.730
And if I close these games down before my fans go absolutely insane is make that just a little bit prettier

134
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.380
because at the moment we've got a really really ugly looking text box.

135
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:23.290
So we're going to get to our text box and go and have a look at the style area and have a look at our

136
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.240
background image.

137
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.020
And in this background image.

138
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.750
So we had done this all before.

139
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.720
So this is very much just repetition again.

140
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:42.390
I'm going to go for the button texture and I'm going to change not the image size but rather I'm going

141
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:50.010
to try and change the size of a text box that can be done by changing the size box I believe so we've

142
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.960
got a height here.

143
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.310
I can change the size box height a little bit.

144
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.340
I want to change some of the padding around this size box so I'm going to add some padding to the top

145
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.630
and to the bottom.

146
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.730
MIKE So that's actually added the padding.

147
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:13.650
Not that where I was thinking I didn't mean to add it to the text box but rather to the size box itself.

148
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:21.780
If we can so go to the panning and the size box add about maybe 30 and 30 of padding so that we've got

149
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.580
some white space around that box that's looking much better already.

150
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.500
And then with the text box selected if I can get it selected.

151
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:37.220
Had I get selected it's trying to select the vertical box for some reason for me host server name.

152
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.150
There we go.

153
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:47.010
And if I go back down to appearance and we are going to go and have a look at style.

154
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:53.320
There has got hovered images as well so I'm going to make sure that we've got the images of all sorts

155
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.100
in here.

156
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.240
First of all for some reason that dropped down doesn't want to work without me dragging.

157
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.510
So I'm going to go for hovered being.

158
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.560
Which button do we have.

159
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:10.430
I'm going to highlight it on hovered and focus is going to be the same as the button clicked.

160
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.650
So it gets select button click.

161
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.990
They're going to save that and play and have a look at our house menu yet that's looking better now

162
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:27.570
that we can click in there we can highlight it we can enter some text now just revision really.

163
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.610
We are going to add in some padding for that text because at the moment it looks really ugly and it

164
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.330
looks really really small and so let's have a look at the style again.

165
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.630
We're going to be looking at the font change the font size to something more reasonable.

166
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:49.540
So the font size we've used on the buttons for example as a as a guide is about 43.

167
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:56.500
So we're going to use the same thing over a year and in fact while we're at it we can copy the whole

168
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.610
font properties.

169
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:05.830
So I'm going to copy that font property from a button and go over to our house name and paste that font

170
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:06.940
property.

171
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.130
I'm going to add I'm going to just test it out so that I can type in there.

172
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.320
Yeah that's definitely a much better experience.

173
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.960
Now we need to look at the colour.

174
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:27.320
So I'm going to copy that colour and go back to our host name box and I am going to try and change the

175
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:33.050
foreground colour by pasting which has worked so I'm going to and play host type.

176
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.940
There we go.

177
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:40.010
We have got something that's resembling much better a good interface.

178
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.560
And then we're going to go ahead and what we going to add Next we can add a little bit of padding around

179
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.450
at text to do that we go up to this padding property as part of style.

180
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.600
And we're going to update the padding on the left to be probably something like that.

181
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.740
See I think 30 is probably sensible in this case.

182
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:07.790
And the top might be okay because we're centreing it and the right probably doesn't matter but will

183
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.500
make it 30 for symmetry.

184
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.280
Then were going to go ahead and save it and compile it and go hit play.

185
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.260
Get host start typing.

186
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.680
Awesome.

187
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:25.610
Now we've really got a host menu that we can be proud of and put our stamp of approval on.

188
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.910
Great.

189
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.740
That was a very long challenge solution.

190
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:33.520
But you know sometimes messing around with UI and making it look good can take a little bit of time.

191
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.980
So thank you for bearing with me.

192
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.680
Hopefully you'd already done most of that work for yourself so not too much of it was new and I'll see

193
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.130
you in the next lecture.
