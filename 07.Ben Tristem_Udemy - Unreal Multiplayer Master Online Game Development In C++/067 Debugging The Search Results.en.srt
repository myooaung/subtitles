00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,380
Hello and welcome to this lecture where we are going to be sorting out and during menus you can see

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,730
here the join menu now has a header explaining what these fields are.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,720
And it also makes sure that they don't overlap each other as you can see here the serving is rather

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,820
long but it doesn't go over the top of the hostname which is also rather long but doesn't go over the

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,290
name.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,230
The number of players in the play a fraction and we're able to select it.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,670
You can see now the players is 0 out of 2 instead of being 2 out of two.

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,300
Because there is no other player in there at that moment so I can go ahead hit join.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,820
And here I am in the game.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,710
So that's all working out really nicely.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,580
Let's go and debug what was wrong with it in the first place.

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,620
So as mentioned in The Last Lecture.

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,140
Let's try and get that search menu working without bugs.

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Now without the Those features I'm going to make them actually properly work.

15
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,540
The first one is going to be making sure that we can disable steam fully for testing so that we can

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,420
actually connect on a local machine.

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,890
We're going to get the available connections make sure that's working correctly and also caveat about

18
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:13,390
the null subsystem and then we're going to check out the padding text properly.

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,170
In fact I'm going to get you to do that.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,040
So we're going to start off with disabling steam fully and the best way to achieve this is actually

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,280
really straightforward.

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,750
What we do is we can just go in two config and default engine or any go ahead and open that up and you

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,790
don't have to remove any of the stuff that you've done here.

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,450
All you've got to do is change the.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,480
Be enabled property of the online subsystems steam from true to false.

26
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,170
And that does everything they won't need the no steam argument on the command line.

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,360
If we go and open up power shell we aren't going to open up to game instances here.

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,240
Then we should be able to see each other and see that it's not using the sub theme subsystem any more

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,250
it should be using null automatically.

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,640
Notice that with the command line option I gave it.

31
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,160
I didn't give it the no steam option there.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,240
So it works entirely without that so on one of these games I'm going to be the host and all stand on

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:15,410
the cube in my usual presenting position and I'm going to go up to find the other menu and hit join.

34
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,150
And one thing we can do is verify in the logs that we aren't using steam by going and having a look

35
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,330
and seeing it so steam API disabled and all said that it found the subsystem null and sure enough here

36
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,600
in the menu we have got the line the line that we're expecting and go ahead and join it and there is

37
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,620
my character presenting himself on the cube to me so we're going to close down these two games and that

38
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,320
has successfully disabled seams.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,550
I'm going to leave it like that.

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,940
Next up we need to look at the available connections and why they're always showing two out of two why

41
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,910
do we have two players out of two.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,120
While the hint is actually in the way of saying It's called the available connections if we go to game

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,210
instance and have a proper look then we've got our current players is being set to search results session

44
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,350
no open public connections.

45
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,760
That means the number of connections that are available not the number of connections that are being

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,240
used or number of connections as I understood it to be.

47
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,850
How many players there are.

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,140
That's not actually the case.

49
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,330
It is the inverse of that.

50
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,010
It's the number of free slots.

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,190
So the way we can work this out is fairly straightforward if we go and change the order of max players

52
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,750
and current players we can actually use the max players and subtract the number of open connections.

53
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,470
So if we have two max players and two free sessions then that means that we've got zero players basically

54
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,260
because the players are the ones occupying the connections.

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,190
So that should give us the result we want.

56
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm going to go ahead and build that make sure I've not got anything else running and that should give

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,920
us the result we want except it won't.

58
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,650
Not entirely because the nols subsystem has a bit of a weird issue where it will not properly update

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,810
the number of public connections so you're always going to get zero players.

60
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,480
That's okay while we're testing.

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,020
But you can verify for yourself that if you use this on Steam you will actually get the correct number

62
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,770
of players in a given.

63
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,800
Okay so the builder has been successful but I'm not going to go and check it out just yet.

64
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,780
Well actually I am.

65
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,410
I dont want to get you doing a challenge based on stuff that isn't working so let's open up to game

66
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,940
instances and will set one of them to hosting.

67
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,720
When I got control of her mounce Animals that the other one to join.

68
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,240
And hopefully if we can pass this line of text that comes back in just a second correctly it will now

69
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,660
say zero out of two.

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,450
Yes it does zero out of two.

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,430
Instead of saying two out of two so we've got the right sort of maths going on there but we've got a

72
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,800
bug in the subsystem which is preventing this from happening.

73
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,490
If you are interested in finding out what that bug is then you can go and search the null subsystem

74
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:05,660
implementation for the words register player and also for the just the number of open public connections

75
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,510
if you look for that then you can see that it's only happening and register for player which is a call

76
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,950
as far as I can tell isn't cold anywhere really relevant in the engine.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,850
And so is basically not getting updated for us.

78
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,040
But on Steam this doesn't happen this number of public connections and gets updated using the workflow

79
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,850
that we're using.

80
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,210
So that's going to be fine.

81
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:24,920
Okay.

82
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,290
So with steam working correctly with no available connections working correctly we want to go and set

83
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,790
up at text properties to work correctly as well.

84
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,340
So it's going to be my challenge to you you should be perfectly capable of doing this stuff by now.

85
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,700
So we are going to lay out the text in that menu in the server list menu a little bit better.

86
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,980
We don't need to get equal spacing in each row so each row lines up nicely underneath the one below

87
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,490
it.

88
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,370
We going to have no overlapping.

89
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:00,460
So the problem that we've been having when I tried to do my fill spacing and we're going to add a row

90
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,920
header as well so that anybody looking at it can see that this is the name this is the username this

91
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,590
is the number of players and so on.

92
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,480
Case so pause video and have a go at the challenge.

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,220
Okay welcome back.

94
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,670
Let's dive right into this.

95
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,850
So I've already got the server row open in unreel.

96
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,660
So what we're going to do is we're going to select and serve and name.

97
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:29,110
And we're going to enable fill again and we're going to do that for the text block and this time for

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,710
the connection.

99
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,020
Fraction as well.

100
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,920
And then with our text block we're going to enter some text that is long.

101
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,030
I'm just going to add in some random characters and see the problem of overlapping and then what we

102
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,260
can do is with this text block selected we can scroll on down to a section called clipping an ink clipping.

103
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,100
We can select the option of clip to bounds and you can see that it has truncated that text for us automatically.

104
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,120
We're going to do the same thing for the server name in case we get really wrong server names.

105
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,030
They're going to be the same thing for the fraction although that shouldn't really be a problem just

106
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,870
in case we have really long.

107
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,220
Fraction numbers.

108
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,850
And one thing that I also want to do with the fraction is I want to go out to a parents and change the

109
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,760
justification to write justification so that it's on the right over here.

110
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,730
And we're pretty much there.

111
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:23,930
I just want to actually go for equal fill between my server name my house name and the text block.

112
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,150
Maybe less for the text.

113
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,660
So I'll put that to point five.

114
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,020
But the other two are equal.

115
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,860
And we get something that looks vaguely good.

116
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,020
And then the next thing I want to do is go and open up our main menu widget.

117
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,540
And with this main menu widget we want to go and find our server list so that we can see ad join menu.

118
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,250
I want to add in a header here.

119
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,920
So to add in the header is actually really straight forward or we're going to do is we're going to add

120
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,800
in an instance of our server wrote widget which has already got all the correct spacing and I'm going

121
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,510
to add that just above our server listing basically.

122
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:10,150
And then what I want to do is I want to change its default text to describe what those fields are.

123
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,640
So my server is going to be changed to server name.

124
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,600
And obviously we can do this because we're just going to overwrite these fields in a given row then

125
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,980
this text block is going to be just the host.

126
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:33,410
And then we've got the fraction which I'm just going to call play as well.

127
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,650
So I've got server name host and players he can save that we can go and have a look at our main menu

128
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,050
which now says something that makes sense.

129
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,890
And if we go and play we'll notice that there's a bit of an issue here which is when I hover over it

130
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,210
it basically has the yellow highlighting want to disable that.

131
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,480
So what we can do is quite simply make sure I've got the money saved.

132
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:08,260
I'm going to go over to the server row and into the graph and create a new variable called is header.

133
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,210
And that is going to default to false.

134
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,860
Let's compile and check it defaults to false.

135
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,710
Yes it does.

136
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,260
And then all we can do is in the event tick we can do a branch that basically only executes if it is

137
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,680
false.

138
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,430
I'm going to break the link from true and I'm going to hook it up to his head.

139
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,370
So what we're going to say is that when it is not the header then we do all the highlighting logic.

140
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,360
Otherwise we don't bother with the highlighting logic.

141
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,940
So you can go ahead hit play.

142
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,130
See if that works and enjoy many Nat.

143
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,920
Well still highlighting.

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,090
Let's check that out.

145
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,900
We need to compile our main menu.

146
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,040
Let's hit play again.

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,470
Join now.

148
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,670
That's still an issue.

149
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:58,350
Yes because we need to select the server row and then check the property is header to be true because

150
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:04,350
we want to override it for the server row and for the header rather we go and join and now we don't

151
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,770
get anything when we hover over it so that's great.

152
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,960
So finally let's put this all together and check that it's working out once we've got everything saved

153
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,230
and compiled that if we go over to a power channel and launch up a couple of game instances that they

154
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,840
can indeed see each other and they display it or nicely and well laid out.

155
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,390
Okay.

156
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,470
So hosting on one you know the procedure by now we go to join from the other.

157
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,390
Wait for the server list to populate that's looking nice with the head is definitely much more readable.

158
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,810
And there we go we've got a server name which is a bit long.

159
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,400
Then we've got detritus which is the name of my computer and then we've got the number of players showing

160
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,250
up nicely zero of two.

161
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,630
So I'm very happy with that we can click it.

162
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,680
We can go ahead and join it.

163
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,280
Everything still works as it should do.

164
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,270
So I'm very happy that that server list is working functionally you can test it yourself over steam.

165
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,350
Little challenge to your little extra challenge.

166
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,040
But the play number is actually updating it correctly and will look at putting a more meaningful server

167
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,760
name in in the next lecture.
