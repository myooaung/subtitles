00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.300
Hello and welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.650
We are covering the topic of something called a cubic spline and in particular it's going to be a her

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.530
might cubic spline.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.320
And why are we doing this.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.870
We're doing this for interpellation.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.750
Hence the name of a lecture her mite supplying a cubic interpellation.

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.570
And we are going to be basically playing with this lovely blue curve here and figuring out how.

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.260
By manipulating different points of our interpellation data from the server we're going to be able to

9
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.090
or going to need to use this curve this her might cubic spline.

10
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.230
So let's dive in and see why.

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.710
So the problem we were experiencing at the moment is that our movement for the car is very jarring.

12
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.350
And what we'd like to be able to achieve is a much smoother movement.

13
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.260
So these are points in the x y plane you can imagine is if we're taking a top down view of the car.

14
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.880
And these are the points we get from the Servat So a few updates.

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.030
We've got a first update second update third update and we want to interpolate between these so at the

16
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.860
moment we're doing a linear interpolation a Lerp between there and this is what the path would look

17
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.210
like it's linear it's straight you go directly from the first updaters second then then do a direct

18
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.040
turn to the next one you can see.

19
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.800
This creates a nice jihad movement.

20
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.520
It's quite jarring indeed.

21
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.570
And this is even worse because we have velocity.

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.170
So if we were to incorporate velocity.

23
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.030
Would it help.

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.360
Does it make this linear interpolation even worse.

25
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.580
Well yes it does because say that these were have lost two vectors they are a bit strange and higgledy

26
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.050
piggledy and you might be thinking well what kind of crazy route is the car going through.

27
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.800
But this might well be possible if your update interval was say 10 seconds.

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.570
It's a bit crazy but if it were 10 seconds then you could be doing all sorts of crazy routes in between

29
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.610
the updates.

30
00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.930
And so that is a reason for trying to use a more broad more general type of interpolation than linear

31
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.880
that can take into account the velocity at the points because the kind of lie we'd like to draw through

32
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.630
this is something like this that incorporates that oh yeah we're kind of going this way but we must

33
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.010
have changed direction to at least be going slowly at this point in this direction and then oh yeah

34
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.450
over here we wanted to then turn around and be facing in the other direction for that velocity.

35
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.870
So this really helps.

36
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.350
For making smooth curves through these points having the velocity that even if we didn't have a loss

37
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.680
we could still have made a bit of a smoother movement through these points.

38
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.270
But with velocity we've got that extra information to incorporate.

39
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.620
So why not use it well.

40
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.560
How do we use it.

41
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.990
That is a question of tools we need some new tools here for that.

42
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.810
And I me just strip back the layers of complexity the new tool is polynomials you may have heard about

43
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.770
these in maths and I'm going to introduce you to polynomials of different degrees.

44
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.760
If you want to read more about this then Wikipedia is your friend.

45
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.990
But I'm just going to take a very high level stance on this.

46
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.350
So a first degree polynomial is what we call linnea which we've already used which means that as you

47
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.770
increase X then Y increases by a proportional amount we're familiar with these curves.

48
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.540
They are basically straight lines.

49
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.030
They go up at some angle and they cross the x axis in only one place.

50
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.710
There's no way they are going to curve back and cross the x axis again.

51
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.040
They only cross at one place.

52
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.410
Now the next level of complexity is a second degree polynomials are known as a quadratic and quadratic

53
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.700
take these kind of forms they can be like this way or the other way as well upturned.

54
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.310
Both those would be quadratic and in this case the we're moving with X squared so y equals X where do

55
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.170
the quadratic.

56
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.610
But there's obviously you can put some terms on that and so on.

57
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.410
But basically that's it.

58
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.310
This is a quadratic.

59
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.020
That's the form it takes and the interesting thing about it is that it cross the x axis in two places.

60
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.130
So this is starting to make sense.

61
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.320
Linear is a first degree and cross in one place quadratic is second degree and crosses in two places.

62
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.750
And finally we have kubic which is more complex still.

63
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.270
It's third degree and funny enough it can cross the x axis in up to three places.

64
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.150
Now with all of these they can cross the axis x axis in fewer places but they can't cross it in more

65
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.660
places.

66
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.460
So a quadratic can't cross more than twice but it can just cross once or zero times.

67
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.420
Same with linear.

68
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.500
Same with you.

69
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.140
OK so these are our polynomial tools.

70
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.520
I'm going to give you a little mini challenge here at this stage and to ask the question What is the

71
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.830
simplest curve that you can fit through these two points on the challenge slide.

72
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.220
Jot it down on a piece of paper it doesn't need to be exact just roughly.

73
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.160
These two curves with a velocity here and a velocity here and these two points.

74
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.000
What kind of curve would you fit through these two points.

75
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.500
Pause a video and have a go at drawing this on a piece of paper.

76
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.080
Okay.

77
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.610
Welcome back.

78
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.040
So hopefully you've had a go during this piece of paper.

79
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.770
The simplest curve that I could draw through without just you know just thinking about it.

80
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.840
Just looking at what would make sense with these velocities.

81
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.150
Right.

82
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.730
You'd be going in this direction initially then you must have come back on yourself to be going in that

83
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.340
direction again.

84
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.030
So what does this tell us.

85
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.970
Well quite clearly this couldn't be quadratic because if the x axis was here then it would have crossed

86
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.560
in three places so it can't be quadratic so it must be a cubic.

87
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.100
So that is the curve that we're going to be using to interpolate between the points from our server.

88
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.730
Now a little bit more information about this because it's one thing to say we're going to be using cubic

89
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.650
but cubic curves come in many forms.

90
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.920
How can we define one.

91
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.090
Well we're going to be using something called a mite kubic Strange but it's named after a French dude

92
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.800
call Charles her might or her MIT.

93
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.120
And he came up with this form of the kubic and if you're really really into your maths then I have got

94
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.250
a link here to a cube explaining that I've put together on a website called d'huez Moss dot com.

95
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.220
It's there for helping you plot out graphs.

96
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.030
And here you can manipulate this cube explosion as you like.

97
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.760
There's four points basically that you can move around.

98
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:27.130
You've got the starting point you've got the ending point and you've got essentially a velocity vector

99
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.080
that you can pull out and you can see how it affects the interpolation curve in between.

100
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.310
So that's quite fun to play with.

101
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.110
I do recommend you have a little go.

102
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:41.560
You can see how I get that kubik set up from before if I zoom out I can make it more prominent by making

103
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.520
have lost these larger.

104
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.710
You can see how that cubitt curve must cross the x axis in three places.

105
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.800
But no more.

106
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.810
And that's quite fun to play with and if you're really in to your maths and you understand your mathematical

107
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.220
notation you can have a look at the equation.

108
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.940
This one here under the her might cubic spline folder and there is this equation here which is the her

109
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.890
might cubic form and you can take a look at the Wikipedia article there for extra details on that.

110
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.410
But the interesting thing is that we're just defining the start point and end point and we're defining

111
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.760
the velocity also known as the first derivative.

112
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:27.320
And it's not really a velocity because it's rate of change over t and where T is our interpolation how

113
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.310
Lerp parameter.

114
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.950
So it's not really a velocity because it's not over time it's over this parameter t but it is still

115
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.380
the rate of change of the of the place the movement.

116
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.140
So that's what we've got here.

117
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.330
This lovely graph so do have a play around with that and read more about it if you like and in the next

118
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:52.170
lecture I'm going to show you how we can use her might cube explosions in unreel.

119
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.610
So I'll see you there.
