00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.060
You are going to be seeing just how terrible my level design skills are.

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.630
That's right.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.870
We are going to be laying out a bit of a puzzle level in this lecture as you can see.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.600
I can't even I can't even do the puzzle myself.

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.320
That's how terrible I am both at playing the games and making them.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.110
But we are going to be creating this puzzle design where you have to hop between the multiple platforms

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.190
in our game let's call what I can do this one I can do it.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.020
Yes.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.160
And we're going to use it to reach an reachable areas that are unreachable by foot.

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.290
So here's here's the first unreachable area.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.520
The second and reachable areas over there reachable by that rather slow moving platform that's coming

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.230
towards me right now.

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.960
So let's dive in and see how you can create your own puzzle layouts.

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.950
Now this lecture should be fairly short and sweet.

15
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.050
We just want to get up a basic puzzle in place.

16
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.260
And me not really being a proper game designer I'm going to do a rough and ready job at this.

17
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.860
Now if you do want to see how a proper game designer would tweak and make a puzzle level like this then

18
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.570
let me know and I will get a proper game designer like Rick Davidson to come and give you a lecture

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.160
on how to make this properly fun properly challenging and all that sort of stuff.

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.610
But for now we're going to put together a basic level.

21
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.420
Okay.

22
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.320
So the first thing that you'll notice is that jumping around is a little bit of a faff.

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.500
In fact pretty hard to get on a platform full stop because when we jump.

24
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.760
It already has all that velocity and we can adjust mid-flight so for a puzzle jumping game that sort

25
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.720
of jumping mechanic isn't going to work because I want to fine tune my landing on the platforms and

26
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.860
that's pretty hard as it currently stands.

27
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.160
So to do this I am going to go in to the movement component of the character and you can follow along

28
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.430
here.

29
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.290
So let's have a look at our third person catch from clicking on him in the world.

30
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.110
And then I can go to Edit blueprint open the blueprint editor.

31
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.790
And what I'm hoping to do here is hopefully find some properties that we can tweak about that jumping

32
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.640
movement.

33
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.800
So open up the full blueprint editor rather than just that partial one.

34
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.950
I'm going to go to the components pane and open up the character movement and then go over to the details

35
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.140
where we've got a whole section on character movement for jumping and falling.

36
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.820
So there are a few components a few properties here of note.

37
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.330
The first one I want to point out is the air control.

38
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.320
Now what the air control does is tells us how much we can control the character mid air as a proportion

39
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.230
of our maximum walking speed.

40
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.500
As you can see it's set to point to so we've got some control but not a whole heck of a lot.

41
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.400
What else is there.

42
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.590
We've got the air control boost multiplier what does not particularly relevant.

43
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.370
It does something based on a threshold of our velocity.

44
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.530
We basically just want to have full control over while we're in the air what else is there.

45
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.570
Here we've got the air control boost velocity Again not something hugely relevant in my opinion it seems

46
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.900
to be a multiplier applied to our velocity.

47
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.750
You can have a look a bit more in detail for yourself but it's not something that I want to go too much

48
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.450
into.

49
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.140
How about this breaking deceleration that we pull out in fact to see the full names of these braking

50
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.070
deceleration falling.

51
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.160
What does that say.

52
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.300
Basically it's saying that if I have a lateral deceleration when falling and not applying acceleration

53
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.460
so basically how fast am I going to slow down if I am not speeding myself up with the arrow keys.

54
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.310
So that's the first thing I want to do so that when we jump while running we basically dont have a lot

55
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.110
of momentum to deal with so I am going to stick that up really high to Bowers and see how that goes.

56
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.260
So a fairly high deceleration compile the third person character go and to play and as you can see if

57
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.650
I go and jump and while Im running and run then jump.

58
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.220
Then youll notice that I am slowing down pretty quickly.

59
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.950
Let's do let's do the test by jumping off a ledge.

60
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.600
You can see that I fall very close to the ledge so that's quite handy.

61
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.810
That's the kind of thing that we want for a kind of puzzle jumping game one thing kind of quiet kind

62
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.190
a lot.

63
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.210
Kiner Chyna.

64
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
Okay so then what else we want to be able to control our character in the air and I think that I want

65
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.490
to be able to control them at full walking speed.

66
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.580
So I'm going to put that air control up to one compile and save and then go back and test that character

67
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.950
out.

68
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.650
So I should be able to now jump off a ledge but head straight back onto the ledge.

69
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.790
Okay so that's something very non physical You can't jump off a ledge and then land back on the ledge.

70
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.360
But for a puzzle game that's exactly what we want.

71
00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.670
We want the level of control that allows us to just tweak ourselves onto the platform.

72
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:07.000
Now that worked a little bit funnily I think about my walking velocity was a little bit too fast seems

73
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.640
to be going somewhere a little bit too fast so let's see if we can tweak this just a little bit more

74
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.870
for our character movement.

75
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.320
One thing we could try to do to dampen this a little bit is increase perhaps the falling lateral friction

76
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.140
which is a friction applied while in the air and when falling.

77
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.030
So let's see if that can do anything.

78
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.390
I'm going to put a high value just to see what the effect is and hit play.

79
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.950
So we can see that it seems to be having a dampening effect on the movement which is good.

80
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.870
So let's give that a shot see if we can get onto the platform.

81
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.430
Now you can obviously do whatever you feel is necessary to get a good movement just tweak to your heart's

82
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.220
content.

83
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.670
While I'm showing you here are some basic guidelines that you can use to get that.

84
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:07.150
Working but obviously tweak it to your own content that's what's going to make it really your personalized

85
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.370
game with your own personalized movement.

86
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.280
And they can see the deceleration down a little bit actually because the eyes still seem to be in fact

87
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.260
need to be separate.

88
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.470
Quicker is what I'm saying.

89
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.770
So let's put that up to 2000 because I seem to be overshooting the target when I'm running up to it

90
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.280
so I can save and hit play and let's try and jump on the platform one more time.

91
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.260
Globally.

92
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:40.290
I wanted to do a running jump that seems to be decelerator me really quickly if I don't have the acceleration

93
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.890
there when I jump and then I have got very fine control over the whole thing.

94
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.220
And if I have my arrow key down here I still move forward so that's good.

95
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.270
I'm quite happy with that movement so we can go ahead and do the next bit of this lecture which is to

96
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.290
lay out a puzzle that we can actually use.

97
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.090
So that's going to be the challenge for you guys to set up your puzzle that should say your puzzles

98
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.750
are going to edit it live here in front of you.

99
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.820
Cause I just want to show you that the slides are there and you can always go and get them.

100
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:18.000
Remember at bitly forward slash multiplayer slides saga had present again with my newly corrected slide

101
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.920
and you'll be able to point out typos like that life because their lives like decks so set up your puzzle.

102
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.140
That's number one.

103
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.930
Number two is that you want to add multiple platforms to have an interesting puzzle platform you're

104
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.060
going to have to have multiple platforms to allow them to get you access to new areas so the player

105
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.000
will look around and see oh I can't get to that area.

106
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.700
How do I get there.

107
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.050
We need to use this platform.

108
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.190
So that's kind of fun.

109
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.250
You get access to new places and you have to get to progressively harder and harder to reach places

110
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.110
that tends to be quite a fun way to do these puzzles have at least three hops.

111
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.010
That's just a recommended level of complexity Obviously you a completely wild with platforms coming

112
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:02.610
out of your ears and just allow a few safe zones so it's fun to have a hop from one moving platform

113
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:03.860
to another moving platform.

114
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.510
It can be a little bit tough to sustain that and not have a breather.

115
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.830
So do add in some safe non-moving zones that you can get to as well.

116
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.320
Pause video and have a go at laying out your very own puzzle.

117
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.640
Okay welcome back.

118
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.930
Let's give this a shot.

119
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.780
Now I'm going to do as I said a very basic puzzle and I'm not a great level designer so this is going

120
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.070
to be just a very rough and ready job.

121
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.940
So first thing I want to do is create a platform go straight up into the air where it's going to intersect

122
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:41.850
with an R platform coming across over here and that other platform is going to allow us to reach a safe

123
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.480
zone over here.

124
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.430
So first off let's create the safe zone.

125
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.820
I'm going to create the safe zone out of one of the blocks that's just around in the environment I'm

126
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.150
going to use this block here.

127
00:08:52.160 --> 00:09:00.120
And so the copy and paste it and I'm going there go and place it up against the wall of our environment.

128
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:08.850
Like so I'm going to move it along to be more or less in line with our platform in the y axis.

129
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:14.470
I think I think it's the y axis then I'm going to copy and paste and moving platform.

130
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:21.450
And move it up to be more or less to the target location In fact let's modify the target location of

131
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:27.630
platform number one kurs I want that target location to be right above it so it's kind of acting like

132
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.890
an elevator going straight up in the air.

133
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.310
And then at other moving platform is going to be right next to its target location and see by swapping

134
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.300
between the two and its own target location.

135
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.810
I'm going to move down.

136
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.380
And along to be right next to you.

137
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:53.730
Our new zone so that we can hop onto our elevator platform and then hop onto our second platform and

138
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.370
end up in our news then.

139
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.210
Okay.

140
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.970
So in actual fact what I think I'm going to have to do is swap around the starting location and the

141
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:09.270
target location I'm going to do that by simply moving my target location then moving my platform up

142
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:17.310
against the new zone and then moving our target location to where they touch near the target location

143
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.720
of our first platform.

144
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.430
So that basically I can Choon them to arrive at more or less the same location.

145
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.890
Let's go ahead and hit play and see how that looks.

146
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.100
First of all I'd say I've got two platforms they're moving towards each other and it's about right.

147
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.960
This one goes up and down about the time the other one goes across.

148
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.320
I might just need to make.

149
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:48.490
This one the one that go these second one that goes horizontally go just a smidge slower.

150
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.000
So that's let's say 18.

151
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.890
This is really just a tweaking game I could calculate it exactly.

152
00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:05.350
But I want it to get better when we've done our second loop with the first platform which looks about

153
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.720
right now it's not exactly right but we can jump the distance can't we.

154
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.610
And you can tweak to your heart's content of course so I get up there I see that it's going up there

155
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.490
I can work out the puzzle in this time I jump onto my platform.

156
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.440
I get up to the second platform which is in the air.

157
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.330
So I have to jump onto it and my more or less tweaked my jumping right feels a little bit not perfect

158
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:31.690
but a little bit work that you guys can do there and I can use that second platform to access my unseen

159
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.700
area.

160
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.130
Great.

161
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.730
And you've got a great vantage point up there how close that.

162
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:42.790
And now finally I want to add in another hop and this hop is going to take me from this unseen area

163
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:48.970
that we currently got to one far over on the left that we could never possibly imagine getting to via

164
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.860
any of these steps and ladders that we've got in the middle.

165
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.500
So let's copy and paste that.

166
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.340
Well let's take it all the way over to the other war.

167
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.710
Like so.

168
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.490
It's good enough.

169
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:10.630
And then I'm going to copy and paste my horizontal platform and move it over to the other side of this

170
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.570
first area.

171
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:23.400
And move my target location all the way over to the final zone that we're trying to target their target

172
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.470
zone if you will.

173
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:30.570
So that's that looks good enough and because it's such a long distance I'm going to increase the speed

174
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:37.820
Cause I don't think it will move there any sensible rate at 80 so let's change that up to about 200

175
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.410
it's going to be the fastest platform.

176
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.880
Let's hit play.

177
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.560
Yeah.

178
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.860
It's moving a sensible speed it is faster than the other platforms but it does have to cover a longer

179
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.530
distance so that makes sense.

180
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:53.520
So let's hop on our first platform hop on our second platform.

181
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.450
And there's the tricky bit of hopping on moving platforms.

182
00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.430
They're very small as well and very fiddly.

183
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:05.700
We can obviously change that with a little bit more tweaking replace this cube mesh with something more

184
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.550
elegant and more interesting which we will do.

185
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.380
Kate so we're going to get over to the other first unseen area.

186
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.350
Waiting on my slightly slow platform.

187
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:23.370
And there we go I hop the rest of the way because I'm impatient and I'm gonna now wait for the final

188
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:30.150
third platform to come along and take me to the new area over there which I can see with my eyes but

189
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.330
I cannot reach with my feet.

190
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.460
That's hop on its platform and there we go.

191
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.430
It's taking me take me take me across and I'm happy.

192
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:41.920
Awesome.

193
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.100
That's almost there almost there.

194
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.120
Yes.

195
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.680
So I think that's a simplistic but successful little puzzle design.

196
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.840
So I challenge you to create your own puzzle design.

197
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.430
And don't forget I didn't put it in the challenge.

198
00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.710
But this is the perfect place.

199
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:04.350
In fact I'd really really ask you is part of the challenge to go and share what you've created your

200
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:09.360
level designer create a little video create some screenshots maybe if you dont have a way of creating

201
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.700
video and share it with the community at game dev TV.

202
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.930
So thank you very much.

203
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.580
And I will see you in the next lecture.
