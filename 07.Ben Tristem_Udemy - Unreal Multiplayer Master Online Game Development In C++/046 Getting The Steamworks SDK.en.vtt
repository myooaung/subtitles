00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.510
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.450
We are going to be steaming ahead with getting our steelworks stk set up and the steam works stk is

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.530
going to be the first step towards using steam's online services which allow us to do multi player across

4
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.070
the Internet without having to use VPN.

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.620
Like amachi.

6
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.080
So that's going to be really cool.

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.050
So the first step is going to be get access to the partner portal on Steam works getting into their

8
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:41.050
documentation downloading their SDK and we're going to have the SDK extracted in to our project into

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.370
our repository and this is what it looks like when it's extracted so by the end of the video you will

10
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.850
have all of this and understand how steam works is going to fit into unreel in the big picture.

11
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.260
So let's dive right in.

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.110
So in this lecture we are going to be doing the following introducing steam works and steam in general

13
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.430
to those of you who have never encountered it before.

14
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.650
I don't know what rock he would have been living under but we are going to be introduced again right

15
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.550
from the start.

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.210
Sorry I don't mean to imply that you've been living under a rock if you don't know what Steam is but

17
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.820
it's quite common knowledge.

18
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.160
I guess there's that and then we'll be downloading the steamboat's stk understanding what the steelworks

19
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.920
stk does for us and what stk is in the first place.

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.570
And then we are going to be going on to understand what Steam works and the unreeling online subsystem

21
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.060
is and how they work together.

22
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.380
Now this is not going to be a challenge in this video but that doesn't mean you can relax.

23
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.470
That means you gonna have to be following along with me it's more about do what I do.

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.690
Kind of video rather than a watch what I do then have a chat.

25
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.120
If that makes sense.

26
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.610
So let's plough on.

27
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.360
So the first thing is introducing steam works.

28
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.280
So I am sort of assuming that you are fairly familiar with what steam steam is an online marketplace

29
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.060
for games and beyond being an online marketplace for games.

30
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.200
They provide a lot of in tight integration with these games so you can have achievement systems and

31
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.870
even you can have multiplayer lobby's and such cool things as that.

32
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.640
Okay.

33
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.030
So the idea here is that we are going to be using steam's SDK software development kit to talk to their

34
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.630
cloud and integrate our game and provide multiplayer functionality without the need for a VPN without

35
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.850
the need for a private LAN essentially.

36
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.570
And so we're going to be doing some cool stuff with that.

37
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.240
But first off we need to go ahead and get said stk.

38
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.620
So the place you need to go for that is partner.

39
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.760
And now still be in your links as well.

40
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.290
But you can obviously just type it as well as partner dot steam games dot com.

41
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.880
If you're worried about the you or else the games as the old steam you are all okay and you're going

42
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.340
to go ahead and sign in.

43
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.080
If you've got a steam account or create a steam account if you do not now I'm using a test account here

44
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.210
to show you the process for someone who hasn't signed up to steam works before so I'm going to go ahead

45
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.250
and sign in.

46
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.400
And what we're going to get is all I've got to verify my email so I'm going to do that quickly just

47
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.010
off.

48
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.840
So here is the email I got in another tab basically saying just that you need to do an email verification

49
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.650
for this account.

50
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.460
Click here to verify your email et cetera et cetera.

51
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.400
So this is just because it's a brand new account you probably won't have to do this.

52
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.990
Okay so that's successful.

53
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.500
So I can go ahead and log in now.

54
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.110
Okay.

55
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.190
It's asking me if I want to save my password.

56
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.900
I'm not going to get my password.

57
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.690
And this is the portal that we are presented with as a quote unquote partner.

58
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.260
Now at this point you're not really a partner because you can't download the SDK as you can see here

59
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.780
it's saying get access and view inside the access agree stk Access agreement so you're going to have

60
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.970
to do that in order to get the stk Basic case essentially covered by a nondisclosure agreement which

61
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.110
is this one here which you're going to have to sign which basically means you can't redistribute it

62
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.100
as such.

63
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.740
When I'm putting this in my repository it's actually encrypted so you aren't going to be able to download

64
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.240
it from get.

65
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.210
Like you usually would my other code.

66
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.900
But you will be able to download all the real projects.

67
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.630
It is only for these first few lectures that the code will be inaccessible to you.

68
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.350
But I'm still going to be putting it in get in a way to keep track so that you can see that all the

69
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.480
changes I'm making in the lectures are the changes that are happening and get to be able to see what

70
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.080
changes are happening but not the code.

71
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.890
If that makes sense.

72
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.210
Okay so let's plough on.

73
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.440
Now we can go ahead and download that stk.

74
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:47.320
So remember the stk is the software development kit and the SDK allows us to do cool stuff with with

75
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.770
steam's cloud and let's go a bit more into detail.

76
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.860
But in before I do that I want to show you around the partner website.

77
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.460
The main thing of the partner portal is its documentation.

78
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.230
You can go to the top tab where there's documentation help and click on View documentation.

79
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.490
Okay.

80
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.190
And under your documentation you have got basically everything about how steam works works and how you

81
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.870
can click on this steam works stk and it tells you more about what's in the SDK you can click on the

82
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.300
web APIs and all other stuff that is involved round steelworks so that's cool.

83
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.070
But we've got our SDK zip here now.

84
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.760
I'm going to go ahead and extract the zip in that to my project folder and open over on another window

85
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.610
helpfully.

86
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.770
So here is my stk zip.

87
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:44.360
I'm going to get it extract all and I'm going to browse to my project directory which is let's see under

88
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.400
steam multiplayer section and I'm going to be putting in the encrypted folder just to be absolutely

89
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.120
clear.

90
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.050
And it's that folder extracted there.

91
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.490
And it's going to extract my stk in two said folder.

92
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.660
Okay will let it do its extracting job and while it's extracting I'm going to tell you a little bit

93
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.390
about Steam works and how it fits into Unreal.

94
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.490
It's called the online subsystem.

95
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.960
So for that I'm going to head over to my slide deck.

96
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.130
Here is the slide.

97
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.830
And real and steam.

98
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.380
So as I've mentioned we've got steam with some cloud services or it's popped up a window.

99
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.630
That means extraction is complete but it's close.

100
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.340
Okay so we've got steam and we.

101
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.500
It's a cloud service which allows us to do things like multi player without a VPN and to talk to the

102
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.900
hat.

103
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.410
We dont talk to the service directly using any kind of web protocols we talk to it via the steam works

104
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.540
stk which we have just downloaded and that sits as a layer on your computer as a piece of software on

105
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.320
your computer as a library that your code can call into.

106
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.900
In order to play on steam now that's fine if you're building a standalone game but we are building in

107
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.750
unreel we could use the raw stk like this but steam actually provides steam and real provides us a nice

108
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.790
city called the online subsystem.

109
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.470
The online subsystem is a generalization around API.

110
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:12.990
Like steam works that allow us to swap them in and out so you can have things like the I O S subsystem

111
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:19.080
or the Android subsystem all of which can allow you to do things like achievements a lot and achievements

112
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.210
and have leaderboards and have user profiles and things like that which steam works stk provides as

113
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.270
well and x box and 3.

114
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:33.030
And the idea here being that you develop one game which sits on top with the unreal engine on top of

115
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.220
the online subsystem it talks to the online subsystem So does that then real engine and you can choose

116
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.820
to swap out a different online subsystem so you could be using steam.

117
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.140
You could be using Android but the point is you don't have to change your code when you develop for

118
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.700
these different platforms you can use the same online subsystem and that's what we're going to be doing

119
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.530
we're going to be driving steam through the online subsystem.

120
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.150
Now the reason that we're downloading the steam stk Now is not because we need it.

121
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.050
It's actually included in unreal.

122
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.450
The reason we are including it at this stage is because we want to check that it works that everything

123
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.450
with raw steam works fine because then any problems that we might have we know are in the online subsystem

124
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.960
integration because it's what I call a leaky abstraction.

125
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:23.820
It is the kind of encapsulation around the stk that sometimes needs you to understand a bit more about

126
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.250
the details of what's going on under the hood.

127
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.100
So we need to be a little bit mechanics and be able to open it up and understand what the steam works

128
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.660
stk is providing and how the online subsystem is wrapping that it is still beneficial to use the online

129
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.130
subsystem because it integrates more tightly with and real.

130
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.650
Okay so with that out the way you should now have a clearer knowledge of why we were using the steelworks

131
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.140
stk what Steam works is what Steam is and how it fits into Unreal architecture.

132
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.050
With the online subsystem So the next video we are going to be looking at building the example project

133
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.390
in the steam works stk and I'll see you there.
