Hi would you like to make an online multiplayer game using real engine.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,380
My name's Ben tristam one of your team's top instructors and I've teamed up with Sam and I say the University

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,740
of Cambridge I studied computer science and I'm also an experienced developer so I'm real is insanely

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,200
powerful.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,340
However if you've ever tried to make a multiplayer game with it you'll find it pretty difficult to even

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,200
get started.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,390
Lots of technical challenges to solve.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,880
Not very good documentation.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,070
That's where we step in.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,160
We're going to take it step by step and make it very easy for you.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,210
But are you ready for the course.

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,950
So this course isn't for beginners like a lot of our courses it actually requires that you have experience

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,080
making a couple of games with unreel and C plus plus.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,800
Now that said you don't have to be an expert at all by any means just a couple of games to know your

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,210
way around the engine and know a little bit of C++ will be sufficient and then you're ready you can

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,080
dive in and take this course.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,330
And if that sounds like you were going to take you step by step through the entire process through the

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,910
course we're going to teach you the fundamentals of multiplayer gaming and how the whole the whole gamut

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,180
works from state synchronization and lagon latency.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,430
All that stuff would be in there.

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,580
But we're going to build this syllabus through a series of projects the first project is going to be

22
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,920
a simple landing game we're going to use a land locally and it work via a VPN virtual private network

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,670
so you can connect to somebody over the other side of the world but without any of the complexities

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,570
involved that you will see later from there.

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,610
What do we do then.

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,740
Next up we are going to be building a pretty looking you like this that will help you in the future

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,210
multiplayer games to get your players connected and you can give it to your grandma basically and she

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,520
can play with you across across the network.

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,860
And then we're going to go and use services like steam to allow us to very easily again for your grandma

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,820
connect with each other and your friends over a network without having to use a VPN and then we'll go

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,520
onto the advanced topics of understanding state synchronization unreel wonderful social happy grandma

32
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,140
and the ability to make online multiplayer games with unreel.

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,610
And please take this course now.
