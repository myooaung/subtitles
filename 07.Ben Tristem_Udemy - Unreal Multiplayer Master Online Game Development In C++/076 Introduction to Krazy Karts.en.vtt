Welcome to this section on advanced synchronizations So this is the section that I personally have been

2
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.640
waiting for this entire course.

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.750
We've got you started with some fun easy multiplayer summarisation but now it's into the nitty gritty

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.180
of how unreel actually does that state synchronization in the first section.

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.120
We showed you how you could use it how you can use it in the first person character.

6
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.510
A lot of that has been implemented for you and it's been implanted really well.

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.690
But in this section we break that down to a minimum and we're going to have a fun racing game.

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.050
So it's going to be a different type of movements we're going to have to start from scratch.

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.700
And we are going to build up all the layers about steps synchronization from how we have an authoritative

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.740
serve how that authoritative server replicates the state to everyone.

11
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.640
We're going to do cheap protection.

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.820
We are going to find out how we can do lag compensation.

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.600
And we are going to be doing lots lots more all the things necessary essentially to be able to have

14
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.150
a fun game play experience with all the challenges of having a network in the mix and different computers

15
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.290
doing different simulations over different timescales.

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.840
So let's dive in and see how we're going to achieve that.
