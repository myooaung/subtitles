00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.970
Hey guys.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.340
Welcome to the beginning of the course then for getting started.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.440
So what is the overview of this course going to be then.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.290
So in summary I'm designing this course.

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.000
How how do we get you into multiplayer.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.180
Well the first thing really is just using Unity's Bill unreel was rather built in facilities just running

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.250
two instances of the game on the same machine.

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.310
Just connect two instances together.

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.260
But the easiest way to do that is over a network.

10
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.630
So how we manage to do that and yet still allow the students to operate over the Internet.

11
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.190
Yes so in this section we are going to be talking all about how to get connected on the same machine

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.800
and then we're going to be using a service called amachi which basically extends a local network beyond

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.940
your own local network to other uses computers.

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.430
So Section 1 VPN connect to somebody else.

15
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.350
Good fun but only suitable for a local network so that sets up the pain that we need to be thinking

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.620
about connecting over the Internet if we're going to connect to somebody over the Internet a little

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.800
bit more anonymously.

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.270
You're going to need a lot more affordance a lot more information about how you're getting on making

19
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.720
that connection which means that it puts a lot of pressure on you.

20
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.400
So in Section 2 we focus on you.

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.440
What's an overview of the U.S..

22
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.990
So in the i.s. we're just going to be looking at how we can implement complex you guys with submenus

23
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.200
in C++.

24
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.510
So previously we've done it all in blue print and now we're going to have a C++ underpinning and we

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.510
teach you how that can tie in with the useful bits of blueprint of data reboot on your eyes are essential

26
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.860
for knowing where you are in trying to connect to somebody over the web.

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.590
Then in section 3 we've chosen steam as our first platform to show you how to connect to somebody over

28
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.890
the web.

29
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.060
We look to all sorts of different options and we have to take into account the fact that we want to

30
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.510
make sure that you can get access to this thing without having to pay too much money and a whole load

31
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.540
of other factors and we've come down to steelmaker run a fantastic facility.

32
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.830
So in section 3 we'll show you how to connect to somebody else.

33
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.200
Exactly exactly.

34
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.830
So yeah let's get started in this section where we're going to be once again connecting between instances

35
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.960
on the same machine or on the local network and getting a general overview of how the multiplayer space

36
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.510
looks with real.
