00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,290
Welcome to another exciting new instalment of unreal multiplayer in this exciting instalment of an real

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,830
marketplace.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,990
We are actually going to be getting the steam works example working over the network with another member

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,060
of the course.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,700
So we're gonna be learning about a little thing called steam lobby.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,280
So let me exit to the main menu where you can go ahead and find lobby's to join other people's lobbies

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:34,640
and you can play games with other people either on the course with you or just on the web.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,920
So let's go ahead and dive in and see how that all works.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,530
So before we even begin we're gonna need to find a test partner in order to test out the servers and

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,660
the lobbies.

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,710
In this example projects that's going to be the first part the straightaway.

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,600
The first thing you need to be doing is this challenge to find a test partner as very much similar to

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,690
how you've done it in previous sections.

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,610
2 you can first of all check in with your previous partner if you think that they might be in the same

15
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,440
stage of the course then you can see if they're available again if you got on well then you might want

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,300
to use them again as a sounding board for this example project then you.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,560
If that fails you can write a post on the forum.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,770
Now go to the post link from this lecture and create a new post there.

19
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:29,220
Again with the title of the availability times or including your availability times in the title in

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,790
the utc time zone so that everyone can compare.

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,720
No matter what time zone they're in and then the important thing is to respond to other people's posts

22
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,310
because obviously if you just write a post then and everybody did that then nobody is going to get any

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,570
responses so make sure you respond as well as writing your own post.

24
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,760
Okay so pause video and go and get that first and then we'll show you what you going to be doing with

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,750
your test partner.

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,200
Okay welcome back I hope you have gone and at least start the search for a test partner.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,940
Don't forget that discord is a good place.

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,140
This channel is a good place to go and find people who might be available right now to be testing partners.

29
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,080
Do try and be available for people even if you're not at this stage in the course as you get later on

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,870
in the course.

31
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,520
Do try and stay available for others to help them out and testing as they get to this stage in the course.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,910
It all is very very helpful if you do that.

33
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,660
So let's see what we're going to be doing well the first step is going to be testing service.

34
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,230
I'll show you what I mean in just a second.

35
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,330
So let's launch up our steam game.

36
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,000
The steam works example Spacewar.

37
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,270
We're going to launch it up and you can see here right away that we have got a couple of things.

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,620
Quite a few menu items really we've got the start server find LAN servers find Internet servers and

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,230
create a lot of it so for this first part I'm interested in having a look at these first three entries

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,320
the start new server find land serves and find Internet site.

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,760
So if I go to start new server let me just show you what that does.

42
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,350
And basically what I want you to be doing with your partner is testing out that all of this works as

43
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,330
it does here in my lecture.

44
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,820
So here I am I am starting a new server but obviously nobody is there to join me so I'm going to show

45
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,440
you what happens if on my other computer I start the service I'm going to exit back to the main menu

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,040
scape.

47
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,930
Go back to the main menu and on another computer.

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm going to launch up a server.

49
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,450
Okay so I have a server running on my other computer.

50
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,370
And here we've got find LAN servers.

51
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,550
Let's see that first of all they go you can see Sam's game and if I go and join it then I get to connect

52
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,560
into that server and let's just see if this works out.

53
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,620
They waited for the round to finish on the other computer and.

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,030
And now I've got Echo.

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,030
So let's see if I can get a little less erico.

56
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,220
So as you can see here I am playing against the server.

57
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,870
There's actually some voice chat going on.

58
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,550
In this example application as well.

59
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,020
That should help you communicate with the person you are testing with.

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,290
That should be quite good as long as you've both got microphones.

61
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,100
Yes I'm going to exit back to the menu at this stage.

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,970
The service still running on the other computer I can demonstrate that to you.

63
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,250
By going to find land servers then you can see that the server is still there.

64
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,520
So going to return to the main menu as click.

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,750
Find Internet servers.

66
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,980
Is this server going to be an Internet server.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,490
Well no it's not.

68
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,480
And I think you'll find that you also struggle for it to be an Internet server or you'll struggle to

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,510
find it with your partner.

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,680
Now I'm not entirely sure what the reason for this is but it seems like Internet servers are a different

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,640
thing and probably not available to the free tier on Steam work now.

72
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:41,440
The thing is you are using the free tier because there is a special case for Spacewar for the Spacewar

73
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,850
app.

74
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,570
If there is a special case in steam and it allows you to use it for free as long as you are not using

75
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,680
things like achievements and leaderboards you can just use it to connect with.

76
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,080
I think up to five players for free over their network so that's quite cool.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,020
But you can't use anything like Internet servers and other other things that I mentioned like leaderboards

78
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,210
and so on.

79
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,730
So that's enough said about servers.

80
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,100
I think we also haven't yet managed to connect it to our friendly peer over the Internet.

81
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,080
You've so far could have done this all on your land so if you want to in the meantime while you're waiting

82
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,880
for somebody to pass a test with you then you can try this out on a LAN if you've got more than one

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,350
computer if not then you're going to have to use a VPN with the peer that you want to test with.

84
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,820
You can use amati like we did in the first section you can revise that by going back to the section

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,130
to the lectures on her marji in those in that section.

86
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,760
Okay so let's return back to the main menu because the next thing we want to test here is the lobby

87
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,810
system.

88
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,890
Okay so lobbies are a way that you are going to be able to connect over the Internet and hopefully this

89
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:47,410
will actually work.

90
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,120
So lets go and create a lobby here.

91
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,170
Go created Sam patooties lobby and I can do things like set myself as ready as some.

92
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,470
Lobby state and as the lobby creator I am able to start the game wherever I like.

93
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,500
Probably when enough people are in the game.

94
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,700
So let's go ahead and on the other computer.

95
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,180
Im going to go and join this lobby.

96
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,010
But I am having problems finding it.

97
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,520
Lets try it the other way round.

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,980
So I am going to go and start a lobby on the other computer.

99
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,750
Just doing exact same thing create lobby.

100
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,610
Then I am returning to the main menu here and we are going to find a lobby and I actually it seems like

101
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,270
a long list.

102
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,730
But even if you were to scroll down all the way you wouldn't find anything.

103
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,130
Typically the lobbies that you just started will appear near the top you shouldn't have too many issues

104
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,370
with that so we cant find the lobby.

105
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,180
Whats going on here.

106
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,230
You might run into the same issue well a little.

107
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,870
One word of warning word of caution is that in steam you're going to have to be in the same download

108
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,170
region and you can easily do this by deciding on a down road load reading between you and changing your

109
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,350
settings or one of you change the settings in esteem for them to match.

110
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,300
Let me show you what I mean.

111
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,720
If I go to my steam settings it's in a slightly different place on the Mac.

112
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,150
But I'm sure you'll be able to find it then in the steam settings.

113
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,410
There is a download section and there we have a download region as you can see I have deliberately set

114
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,560
mine to Ukraine so that we can see this issue.

115
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:18,160
But if I switch it to UK London which is the region that my other computer is on my other STEAM account

116
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,600
is on remember you'll need to steam accounts to be able to do this if you're doing this on two computers

117
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,470
yourself.

118
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,530
Then we can go ahead and click okay it's going to ask me to restart steam.

119
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,000
Going to ask me to shut down Spacewar which I think we already did and that steam is going to launch

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,330
and back up again and once it has launched back up again we can start our visual studio and it wait

121
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,740
for it to finish loading and I believe it has just finished loading because it's telling me how many

122
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,230
items I've got in my mentary.

123
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,390
So let's go ahead and debug.

124
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,360
Start with debugging start up the game and now we're going to go and find lobbies.

125
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,450
Once it has finished loading I'm going to go find lobby's and hopefully find my other computer.

126
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,720
There it is right at the top of the list so that's where you should be expecting that the other person's

127
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,710
lobby is going to be very near the top of the list such as mine is.

128
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,430
I go to Sam's lobby now.

129
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,940
Both of us are called Sam I can set myself as ready.

130
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,560
He can set himself as ready as well and it comes up on my list and because he's the host.

131
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,090
You can go ahead and start the game whenever he likes and I just have to wait around and then when he

132
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:28,580
starts the game will be connecting to server like so and then boom we are in the same room he started

133
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,620
side before me so gets the first round on his own for some reason and he should be able to voice chat

134
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,510
like before.

135
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,110
So this is fantastic.

136
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,500
We have got lobbies lobbies are going to be the way forward with steam.

137
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,650
That's what we're going to be using in our unreal game.

138
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,990
I just want to make sure that you've got this all working across the Internet with steam works before

139
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,210
we dive into one real one.

140
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,940
Eke out any problems that might be around your network.

141
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,410
That might be around the download regions as we just saw and make sure those are all cleared out the

142
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,470
way before we add another layer on top with the open source.

143
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,970
In the online subsystem that's the one I'm looking for.

144
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,210
The online search subsystem in real.

145
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,380
Then we will add in some other complexities that will deal with so we're going to be looking at that

146
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,810
in the next few videos.

147
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,710
I'll see you there.
