1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,370
And know and welcome to this last lecture on physics.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,860
Here we are going to be learning about turning circles and why vehicles steer.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,040
And we're going to use it to implement a turning circle for our very own vehicles.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,120
You can see here I am now rotating in a circle no matter how fast I go so maybe I'll make it clearer

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,390
by going really slowly you can see that my steering also goes really slowly when I go slowly.

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,120
And also when I stop I can no longer stay on the spot like I used to be able to.

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,210
And when I reverse I am now reversing in the direction that I'm holding down so I've got the right key

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,120
held down now left key held down now and it is steering exactly as I expect so that when I go forward

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:54,420
and backwards while holding down the left key I am steering within my turning circle.

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,350
Great stuff.

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,260
Let's see how it's implemented.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,300
So it's quite clear at this point that our steering feels pretty Noddy.

13
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,230
If we go ahead and play it you can see that we can rotate on the spot.

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,740
And also when we reverse the rotation is reversed to what we would actually expect in a real car you'd

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,800
expect in a real car.

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,310
If we're turning this way when we're going forward and we start to reverse that we would be turning

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,760
in the other direction but that's not happening.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,450
It keeps turning around in the same way.

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,140
Now the reason for this is because we hadn't really done a proper model of how a car actually steers.

20
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,280
So to do that we have to understand steering and why we get the notion of a turning circle.

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,540
You may have heard of cars having a certain size turning circle.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,490
Well we're going to understand what makes that the case.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,550
This is the whole reason that cars stay on this diagram here.

24
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,660
It's very concise.

25
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,870
So will pick it apart bit by bit.

26
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:02,940
But it is exactly why a cast is as you can see with a tyre it's you have a rotation around a central

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,730
axis and that's the only way you can move you can only move in line with these tyres.

28
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:14,830
You can't very easily slip the tyre and make it move against its axle.

29
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,910
It's meant to be moving always along the tyre.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,740
So what we've done here in this diagram is we've drawn parallel lines through the axles of all the tyres

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,630
on the diagram.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,910
As you can see they meet in a point here.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
Over on the left.

34
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,980
That's because we're steering.

35
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:41,340
Now what this tells us is that all these tyres will move in a circle around this point because that

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,050
is the only way in which they will all not be slipping along any of their axes.

37
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,440
So this is actually to be precise this diagram comes from the Wikipedia article on ackerman's steering

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,300
and you can see that there's some interesting linkage going in here because these two tyres can't have

39
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,970
the same the same angle and you'll actually find this in real cars you'll find some degree of ackmann

40
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,810
linking.

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,870
And the reason for that is because one axle is closer to the centre of the circle than the other.

42
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,450
So they need to create a different angle in order for them to meet at the centre of the circle.

43
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,020
They didn't meet at the centre of the circle.

44
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,780
Then one of them would have to be slipping slightly on its axle.

45
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,140
Anyway that is why we get a turning circle.

46
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,570
And as you can see it doesn't matter what speed these tyres are going at.

47
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,640
They're going to go round in the same size circle.

48
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,470
That's why we always define a turning circle for a car not a range of turning circles we don't say oh

49
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,640
if you're going really slowly it will be able to turn in one meter and if you go any faster we'll be

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,750
able to turn in 10.

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,640
No it's always one circle.

52
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,100
And if we go and have a look at our car currently when we're going at zero at turning circle is infinitely

53
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,090
small So something is clearly wrong here.

54
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,760
And also when we're going really fast the turning circle becomes really massive and we can't really

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,910
turn around in nearly the same space.

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,800
In fact becomes twenty's of meters perhaps.

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,860
So we want to have it so that the turning circle always stays the same in our car just like in a real

58
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,480
car due to how the wheels and the axles work in a real car.

59
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,500
How do we achieve that.

60
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,100
Well here is a diagram on the turning circle.

61
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,480
Let's.

62
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,300
It's a bit dense.

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,460
Let's break it down in bits so we'll just start off with the car and it's turning circle.

64
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,390
This is the turning circle.

65
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,710
It will turn in no matter how fast you're going going.

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,070
At no point no not one meters per second you'll just very slowly make your way round this turning circle.

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,570
Bear in mind that this is at full steering lock.

68
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,220
That's what we're assuming with the full steering turned on.

69
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,530
That's what the previous diagram showed this was full steering.

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,690
Obviously you can have different degrees of steering and these angles will point further out which means

71
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,350
that your turning circle will simply be larger.

72
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,810
But we're not going to be dealing with that right now.

73
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,590
What we want to be dealing with is the full lock case the smallest turning circle that you can possibly

74
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,330
get.

75
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,530
Okay so how do we do this.

76
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,260
Well let's consider how far this car would move in one given second.

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:11,900
So we take essentially the velocity out of the equation and say how far will this move in one given

78
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,540
second.

79
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,270
What is the d x in this equation.

80
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:22,160
OK so we calculate that we've got the D X and you can see that this gives us a certain fraction of the

81
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,540
circle which is this angle in the middle which we're going to call devita.

82
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,290
We often use that Greek letter meter to denote angles.

83
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,410
So this is the change in foetor.

84
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,820
This is the change in rotation of our car.

85
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,350
Also the amount we go round this circle.

86
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,010
Okay so we've got D X and Deth Peter.

87
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,200
How are these two quantities related to one another.

88
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:53,930
How can we work out the angle we need to rotate the velocity and the car by in order to move the X around.

89
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,330
Turning circle.

90
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,390
Well it's actually quite easy when you're using radians like we are using in the equations in our code.

91
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,100
Let's go and have a look at where it is in the code.

92
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,650
In actual fact in our supply rotation you can see that we're taking this f quat Delta rotation and we're

93
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,620
having to convert our degrees to radians.

94
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,500
Well this is very helpful in this given situation because then the equation becomes really really simple.

95
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,150
It's simply that the x is equal to defeat but multiplied by it are where are is the radius of the turning

96
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,970
circle.

97
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,320
So it's really really that simple.

98
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:36,620
Now what we've got to do is actually calculate our rotation geometry we need to calculate the defeater

99
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,870
here to put in to this rotation Delta.

100
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,280
And we need to do that from our rotor.

101
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,970
Our turning circle.

102
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,200
Radius.

103
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,670
So that's going to be the configurable thing not this degrees per second.

104
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,920
That was a bit bogus.

105
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,950
We actually want to have the turning circle radius use the speed to calculate the.

106
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,000
Angle that we need to rotate in this given frame.

107
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:08,160
And you can do this all with this formula but I'm going to leave it as an exercise up to you to add

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,300
the turning circle so make the circle radius configurable as a you property calculate the angle from

109
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,790
the speed and the radius.

110
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,460
And what should happen when you are moving.

111
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,380
See if we can get the right behaviour when you're not moving anywhere when you're moving slowly when

112
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,320
you moving quickly.

113
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,250
See how it behaves and also see about reversing.

114
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,750
Can you make reversing behave in the correct way to.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,910
Okay pause a video and have a go.

116
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,580
Okay welcome back.

117
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,990
Let's get this turning circle moving.

118
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,160
So first things first this Max degrees per second.

119
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,770
Don't need it.

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,530
Let's go and get rid of it.

121
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,200
In fact Max degrees per second you're gone.

122
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,960
We're going to copy it and paste it because we're going to be using something like it but we are getting

123
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,210
rid of Max degrees per second.

124
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,090
And what we are going to use is I could have just left it can I.

125
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:10,310
Anyway so we are going to be using something else which is going to be the minimum turning radius.

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,610
That's what we're going to need.

127
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,680
Now what is a sensible minimum turning radius.

128
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,440
Well a lot of cars have a turning radius of about 10 meters.

129
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,090
So that's where I'm going to start at.

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,820
And I'm going to.

131
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,700
Change our comment here so I'll call it the minimum the radius of the car turning circle at full lock.

132
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,680
Very descriptive.

133
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,050
And I put in brackets that there units are meeteetse Okay.

134
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,960
So we've got a configuration for Eminem turning circle Let's go to the C++ and see if we can actually

135
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,990
calculate our rotation angle.

136
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:48,950
So the first thing we're going to need is to calculate x adx as we know by now is the speed multiplied

137
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,910
by Delta time so speed is not velocity.

138
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,030
Remember the loss he is a vector we're trying to get a float out here so this isn't going to work.

139
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,800
As you can see there's no suitable conversion to float.

140
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,270
So we got to do a velocity dot size.

141
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:10,250
Like so multiplied by Delta time is going to give us the D X. So let's pull that out as a float Delta.

142
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,720
Location is equal to this like so.

143
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:22,160
And then we've got our Delta location which we are going to multiply by let's leave the steering throw

144
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,640
out of this for now Delta location multiplied by.

145
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,320
And what was it that it needs must be multiplied by let's have a look need to be multiplied by the radius

146
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,840
so it's going to be the turning minimum turning radius.

147
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,390
That's the one now it's the minimum turning radius because what can happen is we could have less than

148
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,680
the turning radius.

149
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,610
So we have to multiply by the throttle for that.

150
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,270
No not the throttle but the throw.

151
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,730
So it should be steering.

152
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,720
Throw.

153
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,550
There we go.

154
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,200
Okay.

155
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,690
So if you have less you might double the turning radius by having a smaller throw.

156
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,740
Hang on a second.

157
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,680
Does that work.

158
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,580
If I multiply my steering throw by a turning radius if I had 10 meters and I had half the row then I'm

159
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,020
going to have five meters so that doesn't quite work.

160
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,190
So if I go back and look at the equation again of course the problem is that I'm trying to get to Deth

161
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,750
Peter but I have multiplied by are in actual fact if I want to take R over to the other side of the

162
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,940
equation then it's going to be D X divided by.

163
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,770
Ah so we've got Delta location and we're going to have to divide through by R which is the main turning

164
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,580
radius and then we're multiply by at the stirrup and throw.

165
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:43,430
Which makes sense because now if we halve the steering fro it's essentially like doubling the radius.

166
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,450
I'll leave that one for you to have a little ponder about.

167
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,460
Okay so we've got our rotation angle.

168
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,690
Now we don't need to convert it from degrees to radians anymore because as we've said we are calculating

169
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,330
it in radians already using that equation.

170
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,420
So let's go ahead and build this and see how it works so that build a successful.

171
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,720
Let's go over and test it out.

172
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,690
Go and play.

173
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,120
Now if I try rotating on the spot you can see I can't just turn around randomly on the spot without

174
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,500
having any velocity.

175
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,040
Now if I had a small small velocity you can see that I'm moving in a turning circle.

176
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,460
And the faster I go that turning circle doesn't change.

177
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,250
So I now as I go faster and faster and faster I actually get really responsive steering just like in

178
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,680
reality when you are driving down a motorway you have got a very responsive steering and we only have

179
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:40,130
to try make a tiny change to the rotation of your steering wheel to actually send you flying off the

180
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,080
motorway so that is very good.

181
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,890
That is very much how we wanted it to be simulated But let's have a look at reverse by reverse.

182
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,240
I'm still getting the reversing in the wrong way if I turn right.

183
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,330
I am going off to the left if I turn left.

184
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:58,370
I'm going off to the right which is not what we want with our steering and the reason for this if we

185
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,380
go and have a look at our diagram is that we've been looking at d x in the positive direction round

186
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,810
this turning circle.

187
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,460
But what happens when we have velocity.

188
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,930
What size is there even when we were reversing in the opposite direction round this circle.

189
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,170
We've got a positive desex when really it should be negative.

190
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,970
How do we make it such that it will be positive when going forward and negative when we are going backward.

191
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,950
Well for that one there's a fairly easy fix.

192
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:33,800
Instead of taking our velocity size we can take the dot product of the velocity with the forward.

193
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,240
Vector.

194
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,910
Now what this does is essentially say what amount of the velocity is going forward.

195
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,280
And ideally it should be all of it because we're keeping our car rotated with our velocity vector.

196
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,880
But sometimes it will be negative because we're basically all against the forward direction.

197
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,040
Let me show you what I mean.

198
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:01,660
We can do an F vector colon colon dot product and then we take the dot product with the get.

199
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,400
Forward.

200
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,820
Get active forward vector.

201
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,070
And then we also give it the velocity and this will return a float.

202
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,400
It basically says what proportion of the velocity vector is in the forward direction.

203
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,590
And obviously if it's in the negative forward direction it gives a negative number.

204
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,700
So let's go ahead and build that and see if it gives us the effect we want.

205
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,370
For those of you not very comfortable with the dot product then I have linked in the resources to an

206
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,460
in-depth explanation of why we do the dot product and how it's useful particularly look at this section

207
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,340
on why.

208
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,920
Cause foetor because it will tell you why.

209
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:48,460
We basically are using it like this in order to get hold of the part of the vector that is a in a certain

210
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,940
direction.

211
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,560
You can see it very nicely with this torture analogy.

212
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,240
You can go and have a read of this as extra reading.

213
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,320
If you aren't entirely sure why we use the dot product here.

214
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,050
So let's go over to crazy carts and have a little play.

215
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,470
So now I want to test out my reverse.

216
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,690
I'm starting to reverse.

217
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,200
And sure enough when I go left I go left.

218
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,330
When I go right I go right and what I should be getting is that when I go forward and backwards I'm

219
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,420
staying in the same circle is not reversing the circle somehow.

220
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,250
I am going to stay in the same circle whether I am going forward or whether I am not going forward and

221
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,740
instead going backwards like I am here.

222
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,120
Okay fantastic.

223
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,840
You can obviously tweak your turning circles to your liking.

224
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,150
You may even want to put some non-linearity on the steering so that when we going faster the steering

225
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:43,420
is slightly lighter because often that's what cars do to allow you to tweak your steering on the motorway

226
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,220
a bit easier.

227
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,770
Obviously this will be much easier to steer with.

228
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,960
If you have got a joystick because it will give you non integer amounts of steering.

229
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,120
For me it's just kind of rapidly steering left and right and I'm having to just pulse the button to

230
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,860
get the right amount of steering but that is the problem with limited input controls through keyboards.

231
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,460
Okay so that's great.

232
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,630
We've got ourselves a fully simulated car that I'm pretty happy with that we can move forward from this

233
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,220
point and we can actually have a go at replicating it in the next lectures.

234
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,690
You have long been awaiting this.

235
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,990
And finally we're going to be looking at how to replicate it.
