00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,110
Welcome.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:11,770
In this lecture we are going to be talking a little bit about what the types of multiplayer game are

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,160
outearning that journey that we're going to take in this course through the multiplayer space and sharing

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,450
our personal ambitions for what types of game we would like to make.

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,270
All this is going to give us a really good grounding.

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,060
Let me just take a second to say well done for getting this far already and having actually dived right

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,720
into the course.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,860
Now keep that up and keep making steps forward a bit of time so that you don't stall and find yourself

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,430
in a very dissatisfying place of having given up and if you have given up then just jump right back

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,920
in and maybe take a few of the previous lectures case of warmed up and build up that momentum again.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,400
But basically what I'm saying is keep that great momentum that you've got and keep it going.

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,530
So you've been introduced to the community and you are itching to go and get building some stuff but

13
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,410
you don't quite know what kind of game should you build.

14
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,850
Multiplayer is a huge space and we've got to break it down.

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,220
And in this course we are going to break it down into bite sized chunks for you to digest.

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,400
And I'm going to go over in this lecture.

17
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,000
What types of games we can make with multi players in what is the map of this space and also how we

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,110
are going to traverse it.

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,050
What is our journey.

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,970
Can I be.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,040
So let's start off with the overview of multiplayer game types.

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,410
The first were the three main types of game that we are going to be bucketing out.

23
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,790
Obviously it's going to be very broad and very hard going to be loads of games that don't fit into these

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,850
buckets exactly but have some elements of all of that.

25
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,600
But I'm going to start off with talking about turn based games.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,500
That is the kind of thing like a like a card game or a chess game.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,620
In fact many board games are turn based and they have some properties which we'll be seeing about in

28
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,370
the second.

29
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,830
Then there are real time in session based games real time session based games.

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,480
These are things like your classic first person shooter where you would go in and join a game and you

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,850
would boom headshot your friends and things like that and have a lot of laughs.

32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,980
Now the m0 and persistent world they I bracketed them together is kind of persistent world an enemy

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,460
as a subtype of that.

34
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,970
And the idea there is that there is not a game that you join.

35
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,530
There is a world that you join that world is there whether you're playing or not it's not has not come

36
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,720
into existence for your benefit.

37
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,580
So let's have a look at these.

38
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,690
On the idea of synchronicity is that coming from the Greek of course.

39
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,560
Soon kronos which soon means together and Chronos means time.

40
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,580
So when we say something synchronous we mean that they happen at the same time.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,120
And in games typically synchronicity as it is known is that the quality of a game meaning that you have

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,940
to both be sitting at the computer at the same time in order to benefit.

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,060
So we can say that a turn based game is not synchronous also known as a synchronous.

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,120
And what we mean by that is that I could play one move in chess and then you could.

45
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,020
Reply a day later and it would still be okay.

46
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,230
In fact these games could often be played via email or by letter correspondence back in the bad old

47
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,720
days.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,070
So that is the idea of a term based synchronicity.

49
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,450
Now real time and m0 are both a synchronous if you want to shoot someone's head off.

50
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,690
You have to know they're there.

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,670
They need to give them the opportunity to duck.

52
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,520
So you need to be pretty much there in exactly the same time.

53
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,520
Now the session length is another important factor and it can identify the differences between these

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,950
games.

55
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,210
So the session length for a turn based game can be variable.

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,600
It really depends on how long you want to be playing chess for or how long you want to be playing cards

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,270
or whatever whether the game is.

58
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,790
It might depend very largely on the game play real time sessions tend to be much shorter because they

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,490
require people to come in sit down and all be there together.

60
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,440
Again that synchronous aspect for a limited time game that has just been created for those people sitting

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,260
down together.

62
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,480
So typically your butt starts to get numb around the one hour mark.

63
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,260
Some of you may have better padded chairs than me and may be able to sit down for much longer.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,460
But then you're typically playing multiple games rather than just one very long game because not everyone

65
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,310
has a comfortable chair and then the NATO and persistent world we've got potentially infinite session

66
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,070
length because people can pop in and pop out and the world can carry on without them being there because

67
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,280
they're so large and because they just continue to persist.

68
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,110
When you're not there.

69
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,110
Then this metric is a bit of an interesting one the in the suitability I have kind of hacked together

70
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,560
here.

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,420
The idea being how good from a business point of view would it be for you as an indie developer to create

72
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,340
one of these games now for turn based It's excellent because you don't have to have a very large user

73
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,840
base to start having a fun game to play with other people.

74
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,570
You can have just a couple of users and it would already be great because they can be in different time

75
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,240
zones.

76
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,350
They can be not very hard core players but you can still have an enjoyable game.

77
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,830
Now real time session based is okay.

78
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,970
It's a bit harder.

79
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,840
So here you've got to have people there at the same time but you don't have the server costs necessarily

80
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,890
because you can have.

81
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,270
Players hosting the servers for each other they can be friends so you need a little bit more.

82
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,240
A critical mass of people in order to have multiple people online at the same time unless of course

83
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,760
you have a single player aspect to your game as well.

84
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,900
Because obviously if they're going out a fire up your game find that nobody's online they're going to

85
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,100
instantly close it back down again and not have had any fun.

86
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,980
And so he'll never open up your game again.

87
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,070
And that just means that your users are going to never take off because you never reached that network

88
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,530
effect.

89
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,280
But enough about network effect.

90
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,610
What about persistent world Emma.

91
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,510
Moe Well this is poor for a different reason.

92
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,780
Again for the same reason of the synchronicity being a little bit tough you need to reach a critical

93
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:23,700
mass to have some fun in the world with other characters but harder still is the technical aspect where

94
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,740
persistent world typically requires large teams of engineers.

95
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,900
In an indie studio you don't have that budget.

96
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,690
You also don't have the money to pay for all the servers that it takes.

97
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,700
So this can be quite poor suitability for indes.

98
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:44,240
And then unreal support now here unreal really has the best support for the real time session based

99
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,970
games.

100
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,960
He's just built in as we have seen.

101
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:53,900
We were able to just ramp up the two players with very little effort and obviously that is session based

102
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,380
because we are hitting play it last for a certain amount time until we hit escape and it ends and everything

103
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,460
we do own real tends to be a variation on the Real Time session.

104
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,990
Now that doesn't mean that you can't build turn based and you can't build persistent world games in

105
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,460
unreal.

106
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,330
It just means that you're going to have to build all of our logic yourself.

107
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:20,360
And so we are going to be starting off with using real time session based as this is what unreel really

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,810
supports and it also puts us in a very good technical grounding for understanding how we might make

109
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,460
turn based games as well as a persistent world games.

110
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,020
So we're going to be using that as a vehicle of knowledge to teach us about everything in the networking

111
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,300
a multiplayer space.

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,150
Okay.

113
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,740
So next up I want to give a brief outline of the journey we're going to cover.

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:51,700
So in session based games we have typically three stages that we go through in order to make a connection.

115
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,770
The first one is discovery finding who else is online who's hosting some games and finding a session

116
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,870
that we can join and play with.

117
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,390
The second one is connection.

118
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,360
That is where we are joining the session hooking up from a client sue a server will talk a bit more

119
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,470
about clients and servers in the next video.

120
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,950
And we are playing in the same space very much as we've already seen done in unreal.

121
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,520
That was the connection aspect.

122
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,690
Then we've got synchronization which is after the connection we need to make sure that what player one

123
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,570
sees is the same as what player to sees even though they are running over separate network connections

124
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:36,080
and we don't want player to if he's not the one running the server to be seeing a really laggy horrible

125
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,130
version of the game he still needs to have a good experience so we're going to talk more about synchronization

126
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,900
as well.

127
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:47,100
Now we're going to be roughly covering these in the order 2 1 3 so we to start off with connection.

128
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,640
That's what this section is all about getting connected and using and Real's builtin tools to make a

129
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,520
fun game already.

130
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,260
Then in the following section we're going to be talking about discovery was going to be a little interim

131
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,780
for you guys but we're going to be talking about discovery and using steam to find your friends online

132
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,520
and how to play em all that sort of thing and getting a self hosted servers up and running.

133
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:18,650
And then in three if I can keep on the same slide we are going to be looking at synchronization all

134
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:23,450
the gory details of how to make your game look smooth even though they're not running on the same computer

135
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,780
and trying to keep things in sync.

136
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:32,600
Okay so next up we have share in your ambitions that is going to be channelled which I have gone to

137
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,260
a few too many times already.

138
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,820
What will you build that is the idea here we're going to ask you to review the outline of games types

139
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,230
that I've just given you so it should be fairly fresh in your mind then what background are you coming

140
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,560
from.

141
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,780
Are you looking to be part of a big team.

142
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,320
Are you looking to be an indie developer.

143
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,150
Are you maybe already an indie developer or are you just a hobbyist doing this for fun.

144
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:59,320
Tell us a little bit about that and then tell us what you want to make in the multiplayer space.

145
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,620
Is it turn based.

146
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,590
Is it against my better judgment is it hammer M.O. or is it a real time session based game.

147
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,040
And what kind of aspect or a mere mishmash both.

148
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,980
Tell us what you're interested in and what kind of designs you've got in mind and what difficulties

149
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,640
do you foresee in this type of game obviously in a memo.

150
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,210
No I am foreseeing many difficulties but tell us a little bit about what you think they will be.

151
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,440
So pause the video and go and have a go.

152
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,510
Okay welcome back.

153
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:34,660
So hopefully you've gone over to the community website using the map from the previous lecture and I

154
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,040
hope that you have shared and also gone and responded to some other people remembering to give as well

155
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,460
as get.

156
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,240
Now the idea here is to just get thinking about the types of game 4 going to be making.

157
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:57,250
So here in this particular section we are going to be making a third person puzzle based game.

158
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:04,360
The idea being that you have to together solve the puzzle and we're going to be using this to get ourselves

159
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,580
connected over a network and understand what connecting over a network really means so that further

160
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,270
ado let's dive further deeper in the next lecture.
