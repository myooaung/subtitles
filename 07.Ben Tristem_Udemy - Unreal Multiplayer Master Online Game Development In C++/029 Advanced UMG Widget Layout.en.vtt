00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.190
Welcome to another intriguing lecture on you I am in this lecture we are going to be looking at different

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.390
ways of laying things out in you.

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.700
Other than the canvas so that we can create a cool and flexible layouts like this one where it's slightly

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.940
different to how we've laid out the canvas side by side buttons.

5
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.960
But it can still be just as responsive to fluid changes in our UI size so if I bring in really narrowly

6
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.840
you can see those buttons are looking just fine up until the main menu doesn't fit on the screen anymore

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.560
of course.

8
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.550
But it is scaling pretty damn well.

9
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.080
So we're going to go ahead and find out how we can achieve this using some things called container widgets.

10
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.990
Let's dive in.

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:54.130
So up until this appoints widgets have been laid out in a very simplistic way now let's go ahead and

12
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.150
navigate to our menu system in the content browser open up the main menu because we're going to be working

13
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.050
on that and we want to be able to see it.

14
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.340
So that's one thing and we've got awp main menu.

15
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.520
Widget which I want I open up and bring into the main window.

16
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.730
Let's stop simulating for now so you can see how it's laid out.

17
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.850
But it's also not very well centred in the middle of the page.

18
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.510
And you know we can't achieve very many exotic layouts in this way.

19
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.030
So I want to tell you a bit more about how this is working in the first place and it's working with

20
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.000
something called a container widget.

21
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.300
So let's talk about how container widgets work you can find most of the container widgets in your pallet

22
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.660
under the panel category.

23
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.860
For some reason and you can see that there are a few of these.

24
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.360
One of which is called the canvas panel and actually you may not have realized it but you've been using

25
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.980
the canvas panel all along.

26
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.160
It's here at the root of your hierarchy just under the main menu widget you have a canvas panel and

27
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.620
this canvas panel is what's responsible for laying out all of its children.

28
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.750
The tags the button and the other button.

29
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.140
And how does this work.

30
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.300
Well basically you can put children under quite a lot of different elements including the button you

31
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.930
can see the button has got a child it's the text host.

32
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.380
But the difference between the canvas and the button is that the button can only have one child.

33
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.780
So if we went to the common elements in the pilot and tried to drag from there a text item on to the

34
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.530
button in the hierarchy you'll see that there is a low or no go sign saying which it can't accept additional

35
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.250
children because the button can only accept one child.

36
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.000
Okay.

37
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.840
So why is that.

38
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.290
That's because most widgets have the concept of child slots.

39
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:55.450
They basically means that you are as a child in a slot belonging to the widget and some might have infinite

40
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.890
many infinitely many slots.

41
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.100
Some might have a limited number of slots such as 1 in the Button's case but in all cases if you're

42
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.710
doing that you tend to get some properties given to the child from the parent.

43
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.120
So if I select my main menu text and have a look at the details you'll see that right the top we have

44
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.410
this section called slot in brackets canvas panel slot and these properties don't belong to the text.

45
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.930
No no.

46
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.420
They belong to the canvas panel but are related to this particular child.

47
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.730
So they are the things that allow us to lay out this item inside the canvas.

48
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.710
And we're familiar with how that works.

49
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.650
It's all the anchors and positions and alignment stuff that we've been talking about already.

50
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.340
Same with the buttons and so on.

51
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.910
But this isn't the only way to lay things out if we open up an button and look at the text inside the

52
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.560
button you'll see that there is a button slot as well except it doesn't have all those properties.

53
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.510
It has much simpler properties such as padding horizontal alignment and vertical alignment.

54
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.310
So what would happen for example if I changed a horizontal alignment to align fill.

55
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.790
Then you can see that that item the text item has grown to fill its button.

56
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.380
And if I do a line centre then it goes back to the centre and I can even change things like the padding

57
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.570
so if I put 100 padding then my complete disappears.

58
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.290
Basically the text disappears.

59
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.150
That's not a very good example.

60
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.800
But these aren't the only widgets.

61
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.010
Let's go through them one by one.

62
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.290
We talked a little bit about the camis widget let me just overview that.

63
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.240
So the canvass widgets properties are.

64
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.270
Anchoring.

65
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.120
So we've seen the anchor points and how you can spread out the anchor like this to give you proportional

66
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.500
scale.

67
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.610
And how it is a proportional offset so we can create an offset from a proportional point.

68
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.380
We've seen how you can use alignments and what else have we seen.

69
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.720
We've seen a little bit of size to content but that's not too important.

70
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.220
And we don't know what z order is just yet.

71
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.360
So Kamps is fairly straightforward and the Order of the children on the canvas doesn't matter too much.

72
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.290
Does a little bit but not too much.

73
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.900
And the main thing is the layout is done entirely element by element.

74
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.870
However there are other types of widget such as the horizontal and vertical boxes which do lay out in

75
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.740
a very different way.

76
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.610
Now let's go ahead and find one of those it's under the panel category in the powlett as I already said.

77
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.870
And it is the horizontal or vertical box is going to go with the vertical box.

78
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.350
The reason that I'm grouping them together is are they identical they're just one works vertically one

79
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.180
works horizontally stick my vertical box underneath the canvas panel as you can see.

80
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.660
It just shows up as any other box in the canvas pad but it's a bit empty at the moment.

81
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.490
The real magic comes about when you stick things under it.

82
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:58.650
So let's grab our main menu and the two buttons in the hierarchy and drag them under the vertical box.

83
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.460
Okay.

84
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.260
So what just happened that let's create our make a vertical box a little bit bigger and rescale it see

85
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:13.510
what is happening when we rescale you can see that the children of that box are getting laid out in

86
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.480
their order.

87
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.110
So the text first then button one then button two and they are filling the width by default.

88
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.400
And they are just not filling the height.

89
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:32.380
So if I reorder these children say if I put my text a little bit under the button then you will see

90
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.770
that that reorders them in there lay out as well.

91
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.150
So this is a slightly different paradigm for using children.

92
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.630
Let me put our maimie Text Back.

93
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.600
Okay.

94
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.020
And if we select any one of these you'll see that the slot properties are now different.

95
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.300
They're very similar to the button ones so we can select a horizontal alignment so it can be filling

96
00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.690
the vertical box space or it can be horizontally aligned to the centre.

97
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.920
And so or to the left or to the right but also one more thing you can do is choose between size auto

98
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:17.500
which uses the height it makes me makes a minimum height possible depending on the size of the containing

99
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.230
element.

100
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.290
You can choose fill which tries to make it as big as it possibly can.

101
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.050
Making room for other film elements so if I had the other button also as Phil then you'll see that they

102
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.000
equally share the space that is available between themselves.

103
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.770
However I can change this Phil parameter to say how equally they are going to try and share their space.

104
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:44.530
So for example I might say that I want the button to have half as much priority on that extra space

105
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.020
and you can see that now it's going to be divided in two thirds goes to the main menu and one third

106
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.640
goes to the host button.

107
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.720
Okay so let's take those back to auto just to not confuse.

108
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.790
And you'll see that we're left with the empty space there.

109
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.220
So vertical box very similar to the horizontal box as well the horizontal box just does it horizontally

110
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.170
rather than vertically.

111
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.620
Fairly straightforward.

112
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.150
Now let's have a look at another type of a box.

113
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.570
Called the size box.

114
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.780
What does the size box do.

115
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.580
Well I will show you a little trick first of all.

116
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:23.110
Let's go and open up one of our buttons this the host button select that host button text and right

117
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.220
click on it.

118
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.030
And go to wrap with.

119
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:36.940
And select the scale the size box like so when you see what happens is it puts the size box in the place

120
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.850
where the text was and it has put the text underneath it.

121
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.310
So that is have a look at our size box and see what it does.

122
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.670
Apart from having the button slot properties which any item underneath the button would have it now

123
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:59.860
has a child lay out and this child lay out allows you to override certain positions and certain things

124
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.170
about its size and height and minimum height and maximum height and things like that.

125
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.340
An aspect ratio.

126
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:13.960
So you can use this when you want to enforce a certain size so if you wanted your button to be a certain

127
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.490
size and be a certain aspect ratio then this is what you could do.

128
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:25.540
You could say Max aspect ratio is going to be something like 1 for example or we can say that the height

129
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:31.060
and width needs to be exactly something and then I can set those a height and width as you can see me

130
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.130
changing this height and width is changing the height of the button because the button to the button

131
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:41.290
depends on the height of the thing inside it so you can use these size boxes in this way.

132
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.590
That's one way or you can use them as spaces.

133
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.260
So let's remove that box for now.

134
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:52.350
So I'm going to go out to replace with and replace with child.

135
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.270
So that removes the.

136
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.330
That's kind of analogous to the wrap with replaced with gets rid of it.

137
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.860
And I'm going to add in some size boxes under the vertical box.

138
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.630
So let's go ahead and do that.

139
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.200
Find a size box again it's under panel and bring it in as a child.

140
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.220
Of the vertical box and a sibling of the buttons are going to stick it between the two buttons.

141
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.750
So what we are doing here is we're trying to use it as a spacer.

142
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:29.240
So if I select this sized box and go to its vertical box slot propertys I can select fill and this will

143
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.650
basically use up the free space to put padding between the host and join buttons.

144
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.570
I find that very useful indeed.

145
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.670
We can bring in another size box and do the same thing just above our other button between the button

146
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.470
and the main menu text and hit fill again.

147
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.050
And you can see that it is all spaced out and nice and hunky dory.

148
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:59.990
Now one more thing one more useful thing is if you have things that lay out not vertically or horizontally

149
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.980
but from in-depth on top of each other then you need yet another component not the vertical box or the

150
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.710
horizontal box but rather a box or a widget called the overlay widget.

151
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.790
So let's bring the overlay into the scene.

152
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:21.050
Going to bring in as a child of the canvas panel obviously it looks the same as most of these other

153
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.200
layout things.

154
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.930
It is just a empty box to begin with.

155
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:33.560
But the difference is if I am brought in an image into the canvas serpell go to common image bring that

156
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:41.450
image into a canvas and you can see it just goes over the top of our main menu if I scale it up and

157
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.900
put it over the top of my menu it goes over it not under it.

158
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.560
Now you can use z order.

159
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.590
So correct for this I can make a negative order in it or go behind some things but that's a bit messy

160
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.650
and prone to breakage sometimes.

161
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.240
So I'm going to go change.

162
00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:03.270
First off the colour of this background so let's go to the colour and opacity settings and let's see

163
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.080
can change that to black.

164
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:14.620
And what I wanted do is make robust ordering of these and the overlay panel is great for this so I can

165
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.930
put the image as a child of the overlay.

166
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:23.860
I can put the vertical box as a child of the overlay and you can see there's a pattern starting to emerge

167
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.600
if I bring this overlay create it bring up to size.

168
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:35.830
You'll notice that the menu the vertical box and the image have both shrunk to their minimum possible

169
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.010
sizes.

170
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.030
That's because if I click on one of them and look at the overlay slot properties by default it is just

171
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:50.140
trying to horizontally align it to the left top whereas if I choose to do a horizontal line fill and

172
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.450
vertical fill then it's going to try and fill that overlay with it and I can do the same thing with

173
00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:00.190
the vertical box horizontal line fill vertical line fill.

174
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:08.000
And by changing the size of the overlay now we can change the size of that menu and the image.

175
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.730
Now that image is in the background the reason for that is that the order matters in the overlay just

176
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.430
like the vertical with her box.

177
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.410
It matters in Except in this time in which thing overlays the other.

178
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:26.770
So if I bring the image to the bottom of that list you'll notice the image overlays the vertical box

179
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:33.860
and if I bring the vertical box to the bottom of the list of children then it overlays the image.

180
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.630
So that's just another way of laying things out.

181
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.560
We've had vertical horizontal and now had in the z order.

182
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.730
So let's try and use some of this knowledge to create our own layout.

183
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.490
It's going to be your challenge is to create a scalable lay out the looks like the one in the challice

184
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.660
light with many at the top and host and join that side by side.

185
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.980
And the idea being I want this to work.

186
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.270
When you scale your window to all sorts of different resolutions you can use all the components that

187
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.080
you think are relevant.

188
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:10.110
Just go wild and experiment and try and see if you can really get a good understanding of these lay

189
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.030
out components.

190
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.220
Okay welcome back.

191
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.380
Let's give this a shot and shall we.

192
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.720
Okay.

193
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.780
So first things first I am going to take.

194
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.430
A horizontal box full laying out the host and join which it.

195
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.590
So let's go down to our panel horizontal box.

196
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.060
I'm going to put this horizontal box as a sibling to the buttons for now.

197
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.620
And I'm going to take these two buttons along with the size box in between them and stick them inside

198
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:50.820
the horizontal box then you'll see instantly they get laid out side by side not really perfectly as

199
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:56.880
I wanted but almost now the overlay I'm not going to need at this stage so I'm going to delete the image

200
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.880
and click right click on the overlay go to replace with and replace with child.

201
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:10.230
And they go we've got ourselves the vertical box and now just as the outermost thing so I can rescale

202
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:16.500
this around and you can see it already giving us a fairly good idea of what we want or it's looking

203
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:22.320
fairly close to what we were seeing already so we just need to look at how to position in the middle.

204
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.240
Now there's one way that you folks already know which is you to use the canvas panel slot.

205
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:37.530
But the other would be to position it inside basically any of these vertically either a vertical box

206
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.000
or a.

207
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.860
Well let's let's have a go.

208
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:47.280
So I want to position the vertical box inside perhaps another vertical box so let's right click on it

209
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.930
wrap it with and then a vertical box.

210
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.500
Like so.

211
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.810
And the other thing I want to do is see let's just try and see if we can replace the canvas panel together.

212
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:04.620
If I go to right click on the camors panel replace with yes replace with child so I can have a vertical

213
00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:11.550
box at the top level and you'll see one problem here is that my in a vertical box is taking up all the

214
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.220
space.

215
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:20.070
Well if we click on the inner vertical box then we can make it not feel as part of its vertical box

216
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.900
slot properties.

217
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:26.790
So it will be minimum size and vertically aligned.

218
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.370
Try and vertically align it to the centre but we notice that it doesn't quite vertically align it to

219
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.170
the centre.

220
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:39.720
But if we do feel it does align itself to the centre how if we'd got no control over the size of this

221
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.160
vertical box is just going to be try try and be as small as possible so we can wrap that vertical box

222
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.640
in a size box.

223
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:55.940
And we can use that size box to override the width and height and create the sort of size that we actually

224
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.130
want.

225
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.380
Create a fixed size.

226
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.960
For the host and add join menus.

227
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.800
Like so.

228
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.870
So we've actually laid this out entirely without using a canvas now and it is perfectly aligned in the

229
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:12.340
centre with no faff.

230
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:18.910
So let's go ahead and hit play and you see we've got our host and join buttons and if we scale then

231
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.220
they seem to scale quite well.

232
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.800
Stop and play in a separate window so I can scale it more accurately.

233
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:28.720
Switch over to it.

234
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.890
And they go is scaling rather nicely.

235
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.620
Mostly taking up no extra.

236
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.650
No extra room.

237
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.150
So if we bring it in.

238
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.640
The buttons come in as well.

239
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.110
One thing we could do there is add a little bit padding on either side of the buttons to do that.

240
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:55.510
I'm going to take that take a size box and stick a size box on either side of the buttons inside our

241
00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.730
horizontal box so let's stick some size boxes under the horizontal box.

242
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:05.140
One thing you'll notice is if you select a size box you can actually move it along with some arrows

243
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:12.340
in the UI as well which is quite handy way to do things and stick it to feel and feel.

244
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.820
On the other side of the size box as well and you can see a join.

245
00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.270
Menus are brought in a little bit closer.

246
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:25.120
There's also change our size box size width a little bit because it's now a little bit narrow for the

247
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.640
host and join buttons.

248
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.070
So let's bring them out a little.

249
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.020
That's obviously just the maximum width because if it needs to be smaller it will be made smaller.

250
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.520
Let's go ahead and hit play.

251
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.670
And bring them in and they go.

252
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.880
It leaves a little bit of margin round the host and join buttons.

253
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.590
So I'm very happy with how that scales I'm unhappy with that as a solution to the challenge and we've

254
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:52.350
used entirely vertical boxes size boxes and horizontal boxes that we've just learnt about so we've really

255
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:57.660
started to understand how these container widgets work and how they can help us lay things out in more

256
00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.620
flexible ways than the canvas widget alone.

257
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.670
Congratulations packed cells on the back.

258
00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.320
Next letter we're going to be looking at how to make this look really beautiful with some images buttons

259
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.280
and fonts.

260
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.970
See you there.
