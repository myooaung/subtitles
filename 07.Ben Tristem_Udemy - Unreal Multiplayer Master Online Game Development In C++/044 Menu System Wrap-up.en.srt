00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,480
Congratulations on getting to the end of the U.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,280
S. and other section down.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:15,290
Now I know this wasn't a very multi player resection but it is going to be incredibly useful for us

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:22,130
going forward to be able to build UI that allows us to do more complicated things in the network and

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,710
allows more complicated connection procedures.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,330
And that's what we're going to be using in the upcoming sections.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:34,340
So if you want to spruce up you die a little bit more and a bit more polish and go and share it in the

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,300
discussions.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,210
Now the discussions link is again as usual in the sidebar but I've also included a link to the student

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,860
showcase where you can go and see what other students have put together for this section.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,600
What are the kind of extensions they've done and hopefully take a bit of inspiration from that to add

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,510
some polish to your own UI before moving on and to make sure you share your final product before you

13
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,380
take the next section.

14
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,750
I look forward to seeing what you come up with.
