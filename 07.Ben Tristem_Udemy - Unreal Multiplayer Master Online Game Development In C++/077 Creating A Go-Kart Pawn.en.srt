00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,530
Hello and welcome in this lecture we are going to be making a start on our new game a card based game

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,200
which is going to allow us to understand everything that we need to know about the control and physics

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,200
in something like a movement component.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:26,910
And this is going to form the basis of being able to understand how to synchronize this movement across

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,280
a network without it feeling laggy without with you keeping control and with keeping the fairness all

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,980
all of those things we're going to be learning.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,180
But first of all we have to actually create a car that can move around the world as you are currently

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,480
seeing.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,750
So let's dive in and see how we can do that.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,510
This section is all about being able to synchronize the most complex of things which is player movement.

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,990
Very hard to do in a convincing way so that both the player feels responsive and everybody else can

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,940
agree on what the player is doing without giving that player an advantage can be very very tricky to

13
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,270
understand it properly we're gonna actually have to build up our own player movement object component

14
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,460
our own play movement code and rather than just replicating a character move.

15
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,050
We're going to do something a little bit more interesting and a slightly more simple which is to create

16
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,820
a movement set up for a car instead.

17
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,070
So we're going to be doing a racing type project.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
It's going to be very very basic.

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,470
We're not going to be using physics we're going to be creating our own very rudimentary physics in order

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,590
to do this.

21
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,450
So the first thing to do is go ahead and create a project based on a vehicle project in on real So I'm

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,940
going to go ahead and launch up the four point seventeen Ed where we can go ahead and create ourselves

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,800
a starter project.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,940
So the first few lectures in this section on actually going to be about multiplayer at all.

25
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,030
They're going to be laying the foundations of how we can create a movement component so you fully understand

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,980
what's going on in movement in the first place absolutely vital to being able to replicate it over a

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,850
network.

28
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,520
And then we cannot go in to that replication step and make sure that it replicates.

29
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:15,990
So the first things first we are going to be going to new project tab go into the C++ tab and we want

30
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:22,740
to look for the vehicle start a project not the vehicle advanced because that has way more physics stuff

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
in it than we want.

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,670
So were going to get a vehicle which gives us this nice sedan model and a nice obstacle course and then

33
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,970
we are going to select the desktop console option maximum quality and I'm going to select no starter

34
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,810
content and I'm going to stick this in side with the project that I've already created my great project

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,220
and I'm going to call it crazy carts which is the name of that section.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,300
So they would go crazy carts and I am going to create that project and it's going to it can populate

37
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,210
all of that.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,760
But while it's can populating I'm just going to make sure that my guitar ignore which I had get automatically

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,190
create for me and you can do that too when you create me in new projects then I'm going to take that

40
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,230
and I'm going to copy it in to the root of the unreel project so that it applies at the right level.

41
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,810
Because if you open up the guitar ignore for those of you understand the get ignored syntax and I'll

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,040
just tell you very briefly it's very straightforward in this case then this is telling us that anything

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,850
that begin that ends with SLN in this directory so it has to be in the right direction he is going to

44
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,590
be ignored if we put it directly above then it wouldn't have picked up on the SLN it wouldn't pick up

45
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,290
on the binaries folder and those would all get including get.

46
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,510
Which of course I don't want.

47
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,580
Okay so my project has finished modulating and has now got visual studio here for crazy carts and I've

48
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,760
also got the crazy carts ed.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,120
Now what's fun to do is go ahead and play this game and you're actually going to see how nice and physically

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,430
accurate this whole sedan model is and you can go over the torain you can accelerate.

51
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,430
You can get up the touraine like so and want to conceal the suspension and action and it's it's quite

52
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,900
fine and you can knock over these cones.

53
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,680
Unfortunately we're going to be reducing the functionality of this game to make it really straightforward

54
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,570
so that we actually understand of what is going on in the whole physical simulation because it's vitally

55
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,390
important that we are in control of every step.

56
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,760
Not just.

57
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,120
No not not just being able to control a physics engine we need to be able to literally control it down

58
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,730
to being able to move the car.

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,240
So what we're going to do unfortunately is we are going to dispense with this car and we are going to

60
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,250
replace it with our own siding and to remove this porn from our scene.

61
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,770
And we are going to create our very own car porn instead.

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,500
We're going to go to the add new menu.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,840
We're going to create a new C++ class because we aren't going to be doing this.

64
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,920
We are going to be doing in C plus then select the pawn go to next and I'm going to call this go cart

65
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,780
because it's going to be the basis of a go cart.

66
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,620
Go ahead and create that class.

67
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,250
Wait for the C plus plus to compile and then what we're going to need to do is we're going to need to

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,740
create a blueprint based off of this which will have the mesh and the camera and we all need to create

69
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:26,910
a blueprint based off the game mode so that we can edit it and make sure that the correct pawn is being

70
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,200
loaded when we hit play which is at slightly more boring at this point because we haven't added any

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,080
functionality into that porn but will soon be rectifying that situation.

72
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,030
Okay so it has gone ahead and created the C++ porn.

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,680
We can go ahead and quick on that go cart porn.

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,250
Create a blue print class based on go cart porn and I'm going to actually create a new folder to put

75
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,100
that in first.

76
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,970
So let's go up to the top level and I'm going to create a folder for all of our assets new folder called

77
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,390
crazy carts.

78
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:01,920
Mike so.

79
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,850
OK so we've got crazy carts and then we're going to go to the ad new and air.

80
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,190
Go create a new blueprint class and it's going to be based off one of our classes so all classes go

81
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,080
kart is what were going to base it off I'll select that go ahead select and then I'm going to prefix

82
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,290
this with BP under score and then go kart.

83
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,770
So same name but it's that BP some platt's.

84
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,030
Okay good.

85
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,080
Now let's open up that blue print subclass and we can create the go cart.

86
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:42,150
So here is the go cart blueprint editor and instead of the default scene route we're going to want to

87
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,270
add a skeletal mesh.

88
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,730
Because the skeletal mesh because the car that we saw previously is actually a skeletal mesh rather

89
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,150
than a static mesh.

90
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,480
So then when we've got skeletal mesh we can go over into the details and selectively mesh for the sedan

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,620
skeletal mesh.

92
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,430
So if we zoom out they go you have got yourself the sedan that we were seeing previously as the object

93
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,500
of our.

94
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,140
Of our.

95
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,500
Basically.

96
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:18,030
And if we go ahead and we can go ahead and save this and go over into our vehicle example map and set

97
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,900
this up.

98
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,640
You need to set up the game moden to spawn correctly so to do that I'm actually going to go and add

99
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:32,550
a new blueprint class and I'm going to search in here for a game mode.

100
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,980
And we've got a few game modes including the crazy cartes game mode.

101
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:43,240
So let's override the crazy card game mode and I'm going to prefix this BP game mode and we can take

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:52,270
this BP game mode and actually go to our blueprint menu on our vehicle example map select under the

103
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,220
world override.

104
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,310
And fact over the project settings.

105
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,370
We're going to go and select a default game mode so select game mode based class and then we select

106
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,900
B game mode.

107
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,650
That should change our game mode over to this blueprint game mode.

108
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,650
And what it all crucially allows us to do is if we open up our BP game mode then we can look in the

109
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,980
details pane and find our default porn class.

110
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,510
And I can change it from the crazy cart porn over to ad BP go carts.

111
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:30,260
Now when we go and play we should spawn with no still spawning with the wrong thing.

112
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,940
So let's check that out.

113
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:43,630
If I go in to the world and I select the world settings and expand out at the world override game mode

114
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,880
is actually still crazy card game mode.

115
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:52,240
So if I go to my blueprint menu again and I go to the world override then I should be able to just go

116
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,090
and select the.

117
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,510
No none override.

118
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:04,100
So this world should not override the game mode which now means that if we go ahead and hit play.

119
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,080
We've got another problem which is that we appear inside our go kart.

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,500
The reason for that is that there's no camera so we can go ahead and set up a camera.

121
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,330
In fact let's make that part of your challenge so the challenge is going to be to actually get the thing

122
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:20,930
moving.

123
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,750
Now the first part is going to be adding an appropriate camera of your own so that you're not just pointing

124
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,490
inside the mesh body.

125
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:36,080
Then I'd like you to look hook up the forward axis so you can see how that's done on the current pawn.

126
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,720
That was the default in here you can see how to bind the axis in case you've forgotten you can you then

127
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,850
use a set velocity member variable to set a velocity that will later use in tick.

128
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,160
So if it's going forward you set a forward appropriate velocity.

129
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,530
If the axis is backwards any set a backwards appropriate velocity and so on and so forth and then I'd

130
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,450
like you to update the position in tick.

131
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,240
So those actually got the porn moving backwards and forwards and you can see it so pause a video and

132
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,690
have a go at this challenge.

133
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,630
Okay welcome back.

134
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,230
So first things first let's get that camera working.

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,810
So it's actually pretty easy to see out the camera what we're going to do is we are going to add a spring

136
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,520
on first of all.

137
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,230
So I'm out in the spring arm which is based around the centre here I actually want to move it up a little

138
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,980
bit and towards the back of the car and then I want to change its rotation angle somewhat.

139
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,320
So I'm going to do that by indeed changing the rotation and then at the end of the spring arm we can

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,790
go and add another camera component which is going to go on the end of the spring or looking at the

141
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,260
car.

142
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,700
So let's go ahead and play and see if that works.

143
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,110
There we go.

144
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,550
We're now looking at the car where it's a bit close up.

145
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,530
So I'm either going to adjust the angle of the spring arms slightly.

146
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,740
I think that's what I'm going to ahead play.

147
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,140
And now you can see we're looking out in front of the car still not quite right in my opinion.

148
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,890
I think we might need to move that spring on just a bit further up.

149
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,270
So play.

150
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,020
Okay.

151
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,440
So now we're getting there.

152
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,160
Just a couple more tweaks.

153
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,340
I like my two weeks ago.

154
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,820
Okay.

155
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,970
So now we are have got a spring arm and it is going to roll.

156
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,650
You can see as it's pointing at our car we can't currently move it.

157
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:26,950
We can't use the wsb a car keys like we were able to with the previous car so that's the key.

158
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,240
The throttle set up that we're going to be doing okay.

159
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,560
So first things first I said to them the go can't do it.

160
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,250
We're going to have to have a velocity member variable.

161
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,420
So I'm going to create a private section for that.

162
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,150
And I'm going to create a f vector.

163
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,170
Called Velocity.

164
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:49,980
Like so.

165
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,600
And then what are we going to do.

166
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,600
We are going to go over to the C++.

167
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,810
We wanted to bind some input which we know happens in set play a input component.

168
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,470
But if you forgot how to bind.

169
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:10,670
Exactly we can go into our sources and we can go to crazy cards and find the crazy cart porn copy and

170
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,960
look in there set up component set up input component and you can see they've got a bind axis move forward

171
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,530
so I'm going to go ahead.

172
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:25,530
Copy that go over to my C++ and stick that in there so that we are binding the axis to move forward.

173
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,810
The player input component is not happy with for some reason.

174
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:36,060
Because it's got some incomplete classily must have been a header that we were using in the other crazy

175
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,050
carts porn.

176
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,990
So let's go and have a look at that.

177
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,220
And sure enough there's a component input components I'm going to go over to my head a file actually

178
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,720
my C++ file and pop it at top.

179
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,820
And we are going to hopefully have that error go away.

180
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,750
Now it's obviously complaining about move forward nonexisting on this class.

181
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,500
Well I got change first of all the class best fire.

182
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,640
Then I've got to actually implement and move forward so it's going to return void.

183
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,010
It's going to take the axis which is gonna be a float.

184
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,570
Or just call it value.

185
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,630
And then got a body.

186
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,130
And then I can take this and make a signature out of it in the head a file so go over to the pedophile.

187
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,300
It's going to be private because we don't need that calling from the outside.

188
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,440
Thank you very much.

189
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:28,660
And we are going to just remove the name space and add a semicolon which allow us to build this file

190
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,220
now.

191
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,210
And we should be able to use it to set a velocity.

192
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,590
So that's what I'm going to use it to do.

193
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,170
I am going at two in here just do velocity.

194
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,660
Equals.

195
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,260
And then it's going to be equal to pretty much.

196
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:49,160
I'm just going to say let's see it moves in centimetres per second.

197
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,510
But I'm going to leave my velocity as meters per second for simplicity and will convert it in tic at

198
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,630
the last moment.

199
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:04,810
So I am going to go with 10 meters per second is going to be the velocity of my car in fact that's pretty

200
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,870
slow lets go forward 20 meters per second and I'm going to multiply this by the value of the throttle

201
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,890
that we've got in here because that means that this value will be negative and we're heading backwards

202
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,510
and positive woman going forwards.

203
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,720
So multiplying it by 20 will help there and we actually.

204
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,550
Velocity here as a vector.

205
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,260
So we need a direction to this quantity and I think the direction should be the forward direction of

206
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,910
the car.

207
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,290
So that's pretty easy we can do a get asked forward vector let me just do that without messing up the

208
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,460
rest of the line get actor.

209
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,210
I think forward vector you can easily find this in the documentation.

210
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,070
Here we go to save you the hassle of looking for it.

211
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,260
This is the documentation page which I will include and I'm going to copy and paste it over here.

212
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,590
It wasn't quite able to auto complete in visual studio.

213
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,960
Okay so we've got an active forward vector with multiplying it by 20 meters per second and then we're

214
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,450
multiplying it by the value so that all making either positive.

215
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,360
So in the forward direction or negative in the backwards direction.

216
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,650
And that should do the trick for setting up a lost time.

217
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,740
Now over in tick what we want to do is actually update the location of our porn.

218
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,200
Based on this so I'm going to create an F vector Delta.

219
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,180
Which basically.

220
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,830
I mean delta in the sense of the Greek letter which is typically meant to mean difference so difference

221
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,790
in space is what we're going for here.

222
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:39,130
It's the difference in space and in fact let's go ahead and call it something more meaningful like that.

223
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,770
Let's call it the translation.

224
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,520
That's the translation in space.

225
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,670
And then what we're going to do is we are going to create that from the velocity.

226
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,930
So we've got a velocity which is a vector and it's in meters per second so it's how many meters were

227
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,520
moving in a given second the translation on the other hand is just in meters.

228
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,090
In fact it's in centimetres.

229
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,390
So we need to do two things to convert it.

230
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:07,540
First of all we need to multiply by Delta time so the time elapsed in this when the last frame.

231
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,280
So that's how far we have to move it because that's how much time has elapsed.

232
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,470
So that is the meters per second multiplied by seconds just makes it into meters now and then the other

233
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,650
thing we have to multiply by is 100 to get from meters in two centimetres.

234
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,390
So we're going to multiply by 100 as well so its velocity multiply by 100 multiplied by Delta time gives

235
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:35,160
us the translation and then what we can do is call another function on actor which allows us to translate.

236
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,330
So the way we do this is with actor and actor world offset.

237
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,440
So you can see it takes two arguments.

238
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,480
One argument arguments actually necessary which is the Delta location which is also what we're calling

239
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,860
the translation.

240
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:55,820
So add actor offset translation and that should have us pretty much done for updating and moving a pawn.

241
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,290
Let's go ahead and build and try it out.

242
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,830
Build works that's fantastic.

243
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,190
Let's go over and actually test it in the motion.

244
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,810
That's my maps not saved for some reason so I'm going to save current and I'm going go ahead and play.

245
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,640
And there you go.

246
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,500
I can hit my forwards and backwards buttons and sure enough it moves forward at 20 mins per second it

247
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:21,040
moves backwards at 20 meters per second and we can't turn at the moment but a it's also got no acceleration.

248
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,040
So all those things we are going to be fixing in subsequent lectures.

249
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,040
But for now it is a start.

250
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,810
You've put together the basics basic of basics of a rudimentary physics system which is a velocity and

251
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,760
some control.

252
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I'll see you in the next lecture where will be adding more to it.
