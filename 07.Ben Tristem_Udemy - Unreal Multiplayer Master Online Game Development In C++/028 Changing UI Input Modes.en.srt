00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,250
Welcome in this lecture.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:15,350
We are going to make our menus clickable doesn't seem like a big job but trust me when we're doing it

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,060
in C++ it's not always straightforward.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,690
The documentation is a little bit tricky to navigate.

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,790
So I'm going to be showing you mainly in this lecture how to navigate the documentation to achieve the

6
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,940
goal of being able to click on things and also to be able to see the cursor.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,250
Let's dive in and see how that's done.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,900
Okay so we've reached the stage of adding it to the viewport.

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,600
But currently our main menu is unusable.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,670
The reason for this is twofold.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,860
One we can't see our cursor.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:52,120
And second we can't click on anything so the input is going into the game behind our menu or the level

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:59,020
behind our menu rather than the actual main menu that hasn't been focussed it hasn't been given what

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:06,160
we what it needs and to do that we are going to have to change something about the play a controller

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:12,250
because the control of the play controller is currently going in to the game and we want it to go into

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,880
the menu instead.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,240
Now the way you do this is using a.

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,150
Method called Set input mode.

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,470
Now for this bit of video I would like you to put your hands on your laps and just watch what Im doing

20
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,050
rather than doing anything for yourself.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,630
Because the challenge is going to be to recreate this without looking at what Im doing because I want

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,440
to see how well you can do these things for yourself.

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,480
Just using the documentation and just discovering.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,930
So this is the entry point you can use the resources that I've included they are going to be helpful.

25
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,990
But Id like you to try and do the challenge that comes later on without looking at my code at least

26
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,310
at first and then see where you get to.

27
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,230
Okay.

28
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,990
So with your hands on your lapps Lets get stuck in.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,810
So the first thing is we want to set input mode on a player controller.

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,150
Okay.

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,090
So the question here is going to be how do I get hold of a player controller to set its input mode in

32
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,070
the first place.

33
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,740
We go over to Visual Studio then we should see that weve got hold of a player controller before when

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,630
we were trying to do client travel so this should be fairly straightforward.

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,240
Just going to get the first play control like we did down here.

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,350
We're also going to do the same nul return check thing you Bob.

37
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,650
So then we're going to load after we've loaded the menu at the viewport.

38
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,000
We're going to get hold of a play a controller.

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,180
Okay that's all straightforward.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,940
Now we want to go ahead and do the next step which is to set the input mode so we need to think about

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,400
what the arguments to set input mode are.

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,800
Okay we've got an F input mode data base that's a bit weird it's not a database it's a data base because

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,660
it's the base class that's what it's saying here not a database or anything like that.

44
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:09,560
So if we click on that it's going to give us the documentation for this f input mode data base and you

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,120
can see that by itself it's not particularly useful but it's subclasses.

46
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,810
Ah that's why it's a base because it has some subclasses and their names kind of suggest what they do

47
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,330
want input mode game and why.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,390
Game in F input mode game only and F input mode UI only.

49
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:38,220
Okay so clearly what we want to be doing is having the input mode for you why only so that we don't

50
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,160
have part of the input going to the going on par going to the UI we want it all focussed entirely on

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,130
to the you guys.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,200
So we've got to go ahead and create one of these struts.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,370
We know that creating structures is pretty much as simple as just creating one and then setting its

54
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,460
variables.

55
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,340
So let's go in to C++ that might be a reminder for some you if you didn't know that.

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,920
Don't worry I just told you so we can copy the f input mode.

57
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:17,250
You my only head on over to the C++ and paste that in and I'm going to call this the input mode data

58
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,070
semicolon so that's created it already.

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,760
That's called the struct constructor and we've initialized some input mode data.

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,180
Here locally it's not a pointer so it's here on the stack.

61
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,550
If you know what that means we're going to do input mode data.

62
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,560
DOT.

63
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,040
Because not a pointer.

64
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,490
And then we want to set those properties that are there in the variable.

65
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,640
We want to look at those variables and see are any of these useful Do we want to stick with the default

66
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,240
behaviour.

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,750
Or do we want to go with something else.

68
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,560
So we've got widget to focus.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,890
That's an interesting one to start off with a widget to focus.

70
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,070
We know which widget we'd like to focus now it's not auto completing.

71
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,590
And if I hover over it it's going to tell me that the identifier is not defined.

72
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,050
That's because I've called it data not data.

73
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,550
So were going to do a dot widget set widget to focus.

74
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,250
And then we need to pass in an s widget.

75
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,380
Now that's a bit problematic because what we've got is you use a widget.

76
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,140
So hopefully the next thing you'll be thinking about is looking in the user widget manual and seeing

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,730
whether there is anything that can help you convert or return an S widget.

78
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,030
So let's just have a look through here for s widget.

79
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,130
We've got a get widget handle that's not quite what we want on the widget rebuild.

80
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,800
We don't want that e there so one thing to remember here is that it's only showing the functions that

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,780
were declared in this class not necessarily the ones in the super class.

82
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,850
So let's go one level up to a new widget because that might have something relevant as well.

83
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,820
Let's go and search again for the s widget.

84
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,160
K.

85
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,310
Got a few more things here.

86
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,020
And if you go looking through them we've got my widget.

87
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,480
The underlying s widget that might well be the thing that we're looking for.

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,450
It's a variable.

89
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,600
Let's see if there's any functions in stead that might return the same thing.

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,190
Okay granted this one's a little bit tricky to find so I'm going to include the link in the lecture

91
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,730
resources for you to use during the challenge.

92
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,010
The thing that you want is a take widget because it as the documentation says gets the underlying slate

93
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,370
widget or constructs it.

94
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,680
If it doesn't exist.

95
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,310
So let's go back over to Visual Studio.

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,110
That one was a little bit of a tricky one to find.

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,740
So we'll do menu arrow take widget.

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,010
And that's a function.

99
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,860
So that's going to set its widget.

100
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:01,190
Anything else that we want to set on the input data let's go and have another little look at the input

101
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,610
mode data.

102
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:10,390
At this point we are configuring the input mode as we have already seen so the other thing here is the

103
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,990
mounce lock mode.

104
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,090
So let's see if we can set the mouse lock mode down here so input mode.

105
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,330
Data dot.

106
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:31,420
And here we've got a set mouse to viewport behaviour set lock mouse to viewport behaviour.

107
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,510
Got a couple of options here.

108
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,180
Let's take a look at the docs to see which one we would prefer to use two functions here.

109
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:47,000
Set mouse to viewport and set mouse to viewport behaviour so the mouse to view poor behaviour takes

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,660
in a lock mode in.

111
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,530
Let's take a little look at what that E name does.

112
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,770
Do not lock a lock on capture and lock always.

113
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,560
I think we're going to do a do not lock when we're in the menu we can move our mouse outside of the

114
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,320
menu.

115
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:12,880
So I'm going to use that version who are going to set mouse to view poor behaviour.

116
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,770
It's going to be the e mouse lock mode colon colon do not lock.

117
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,240
So we can't finish that off.

118
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,360
So now that we've constructed an input mode data we can indeed call our set implode so it's going to

119
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,240
be player controller.

120
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,250
Arrow.

121
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,270
Set.

122
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Now I wonder why it's complaining here.

123
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,940
Because I've misspelt player control a set input mode.

124
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,720
Isn't working out.

125
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,140
Why is it not auto completing for me.

126
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,280
I can go and copy set input mode from the documentation so if that helps.

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,150
So input mode and then we can give it the input mode data which we have been constructing.

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,080
MIKE So semicolon to finish that off.

129
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,020
And one more thing that we're going to need to do is make the cursor visible.

130
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,050
This is a very straightforward one indeed.

131
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:26,020
If you go and have a look at the play a controller documentation we can search for curser in here and

132
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,460
you'll see that we've got a property called B show curse.

133
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,870
Show mouse cursor.

134
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,850
We obviously want to set that one to true.

135
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,410
So it's going to be player controller.

136
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,820
Arrow B.

137
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,890
Show mouse cursor equals true.

138
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,590
Okay.

139
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,410
So that is the things that you need to remember and don't worry.

140
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,880
The challenge is going to prompt you.

141
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,370
Obviously you can use all of the resources to help you out in the challenge.

142
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,070
Well done for keeping your hands on your lap if you managed to resist the temptation to follow along.

143
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,630
Let's build and see that in action.

144
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:11,220
So that build is completed Let's go and try playing from our main menu level I'm opening up the main

145
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,050
menu level which is under content.

146
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,640
Many system I'm going to hit play.

147
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,270
And now you can see I've got my cursor it's not locked in to the screen I can move it out but I can

148
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,490
click on buttons and I can hover over them and I can see my cursor.

149
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,760
So that's fantastic that's done an input mode allowing us to click on things and it's also done our

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,120
cursor because we can see it and it's not locked in to the window.

151
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,900
Fantastics.

152
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,900
Now it's time for you to have a go.

153
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,810
To repeat these steps for yourself.

154
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,370
Now that might sound like a daunting task.

155
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,760
But let me just prompt you with that or make it a lot easier.

156
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,480
You're going to be rediscovering the API.

157
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,350
I think this is going to make it really settle in your minds much better than if you just copied me.

158
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,140
And it's quite a complicated API but also very useful.

159
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,700
So you were going to be setting the input mode.

160
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,540
That's number one thing that you are going to be doing and you're going to be using obviously all the

161
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,610
resources I've given you to help you do that.

162
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,260
You got to make the mouse cursor visible.

163
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,050
That one's fairly straightforward but you've got the resources there as well to help you remember what

164
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,700
the calls are user documentation to help you.

165
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,650
Again all the links against this lecture that can help you out and try not to peek at my code.

166
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:25,890
Try and do it entirely from the documentation and the fact that you are trying to set the input mode

167
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,370
and move it make the mouse cursor visible.

168
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,720
So it's directed towards those goals.

169
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,520
Use the documentation to aid.

170
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,390
Okay.

171
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,900
Pause a video and have a go.

172
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,300
Okay.

173
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,940
Welcome back.

174
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,330
So hopefully you got on all right without Let me know in the Q and A how you found that challenge I'd

175
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,480
be really interested to know whether you got through the documentation without peeking or whether you

176
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,450
did have to peak in the end.

177
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,250
Obviously I'm not going to go through it again.

178
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,050
You've already seen how to do this.

179
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,600
And if you need to you can re watch the video.

180
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,740
Remember that you can always look at the code on gitte Hub now after having attempted the challenge

181
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,410
and see whether there was anything that I did differently.

182
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,700
Maybe you did it better.

183
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,610
Dont necessarily throw away your solution because it wasnt the same as mine.

184
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,490
If it works if it achieves the same thing then just evaluate the pros and cons and maybe yours is better

185
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,250
and if its better.

186
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,780
Share it with us on the community website and I will see you in the next video.
