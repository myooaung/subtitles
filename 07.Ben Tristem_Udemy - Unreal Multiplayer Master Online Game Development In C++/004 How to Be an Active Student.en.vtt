00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.150
Welcome this lecture is all about how you can get the most out of this course by being an active and

2
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.530
engaged student the kind that we really really love.

3
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.770
So we are going to be telling you about how you can get hold of the code changes and the code that was

4
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.030
created in these lectures over on gitte Hubble by telling a little bit about that.

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.650
Are we telling you about our community site and how you can access it and how you can use it to the

6
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.890
best advantage for yourself and to share with other students.

7
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.060
Going to tell you how to get access to these slides.

8
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.680
And for this lecture and I'm going to tell you a bit more about the other places that we have community

9
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.600
out on the web that you can join and be part of and feel like a part of a full and rich cohort that

10
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.990
we are.

11
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.900
So let's jump in and see how to do that.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.980
So those of you new to game def TV courses might be wondering that some things are a little bit different

13
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.270
to what you might be used to.

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.930
And one of the first little differences you might encounter is that in the video we've got this bar

15
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.090
at the bottom which is just to help you keep track of where we currently are and what we're currently

16
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.720
doing in the video.

17
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.950
So I'm going to be clicking at the bottom there and it will give us an idea of the next thing that we're

18
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.940
doing so right now I want to talk to you a little bit about source control and code.

19
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.790
So in our coding courses we always have a link in the resources so this is the you know we page as you

20
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.650
might expect it.

21
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.270
And here if you expand for the resources available you'll see there's always going to be resources available

22
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.960
because we've always got something to share with you.

23
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.200
And those resources for example are at lectureship project changes.

24
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.290
Now what this points to if I go and click this is the exact commit for this lecture.

25
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.530
So what that means is it shows you exactly the changes made in this particular lecture.

26
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.970
So we've got the gitte ignore file that we added in the last lecture.

27
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.130
We've also got all the files from the third person example project that were included and is very good

28
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.990
with code because it shows you exactly what was added and what was removed.

29
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.400
So if at any point you're like did I do exactly what was in the video I'm not sure I totally managed

30
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.280
to follow that.

31
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.880
Then just click on this link and go and have a look at exactly what was added and removed.

32
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.380
We don't do anything off screen.

33
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.130
So everything here is what was done in the lecture.

34
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.400
So you can always do that from any lecture just to repeat this.

35
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.560
By the way is great hub.

36
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.450
If you've never come across give up before don't worry just use it.

37
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.230
As I mentioned.

38
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.510
But for those of you do know about it hub then you'll see that there is an unreal multi player user

39
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.980
and this organization as it's called and get hub terminology.

40
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.730
And here we have a section or a repository per section per project so you can see here.

41
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.470
There's actually an index of the lectures and everything coming in lectures.

42
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.190
But that's a bit inside.

43
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.660
So that is how to get hold of the code how to get hold the source code.

44
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.780
You can always download.

45
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.480
By the way the source codes if I go back to the link that I followed you can see up here.

46
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.770
That's what it looks like.

47
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.980
And I can always go to browse files and download my own copy by going to clone or download and then

48
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.330
just downloading the zip.

49
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.180
Or you can clone it at if you know how to use it.

50
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.570
But you could always download the zip and you can just run it in unreel and just double check it against

51
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.190
your own stuff so that's always a great first port of call you having issues go and double check it

52
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.710
against the code that I have got in the lecture and see how it might be different see why something

53
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.620
might be going wrong.

54
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.170
Okay.

55
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.040
So that source control out of the way.

56
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.640
The next up is our community site that's the second link you'll see here.

57
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.580
And it says this lectures discussions now have you go and click this lectures discussions.

58
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.610
It will take you to a special part of our community website specific to this lecture.

59
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.090
So if you go ahead and add a new discussion let me just show you a couple of things that will happen.

60
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.460
You've got the option to create your own title.

61
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:09.200
But here at the bottom you've got a special little tag or lecture link that is going to collect all

62
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.990
the posts that came from this specific lecture together.

63
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.920
And in fact Furthermore we've got some more categorization going on here because we're inside the section

64
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.520
called one puzzle platforms Section 1 puzzle platforms.

65
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.160
And that itself is inside the section called unreel multiplex.

66
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.950
That's what you're seeing in this little breadcrumb navigation at the middle of the page saying unreel

67
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.220
multiplayer.

68
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.560
So one puzzle platforms and then this string with underscores that's basically saying lecture one connecting

69
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.680
two players as is the name of the lecture.

70
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.500
So if you go to any one of these you can go up to the section level and have a look at all the posts

71
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.590
for a given section.

72
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.840
You can go up to the coarse level and have a look at all the posts for the given course unreal multiplayer

73
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.150
and you can even go and have a look at some of the other courses just by going to the game deaf community

74
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.980
home page that's community not going to adopt.

75
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.140
You mean you can see everything from all our courses there and all the topics that are being posted.

76
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.610
So that is our community website again.

77
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.350
You can always follow it from the link on every lecture as it is a unique link for every lecture.

78
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.980
Now how about the slides.

79
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.560
You've seen me using slides in the previous lecture and you've seen the challenge slides and all the

80
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.370
various resources that sometimes it can be useful to go back and refer to them.

81
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.900
How do you find them I hear you ask.

82
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:45.040
Well you go to bitly multiplayer slides there's also going to be a link against this lecture and bitly

83
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.980
multiplayer slides will take you to this Google Drive page which will have more slide decks and they're

84
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.660
listed by section so you can open up the section 1 slide deck and here it is.

85
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.640
You've got the section 1 slide that will take a little bit of time to load because there are some images

86
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.320
in there and so on and so forth but you can then just go through and have a look at the slide.

87
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.910
In fact you can go and have a look at the slides.

88
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.860
While I am editing them and making the section.

89
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.150
If you're here in early access so it's always worth going to the bitly multiplayer slides and you can

90
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.790
make a comment on the slides as you're doing them saying All that sounds interesting.

91
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.660
Well I don't understand this and I will hopefully reply to them.

92
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.970
So do go and visit the slides if you're interested you can also download them.

93
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.580
I think somehow I'm sure you can figure out yes than him download.

94
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.440
As you can download it's a PowerPoint or a PDA if you like that sort of thing to have it off line or

95
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.110
on your phone on your tablet or something of that sort.

96
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.020
Okay what about the rest of our rich community while our rich community tends to live mostly on you

97
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.030
to me because you're here taking our courses so we also have a very vibrant Q and A.

98
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:58.270
Obviously this is not very vibrant just yet but you can go and browse or Kule able to ask questions

99
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.180
there.

100
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.390
And furthermore we have a Facebook group which also linked from this lecturer.

101
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.610
So don't worry about trying to remember all these your elves they're all linked from this lecture and

102
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.360
the Facebook group is generally for all you lovely unreel folk trying to learn.

103
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.620
Und real stuff so you can go and have a chat.

104
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.590
Share some stuff and do all that kind of great Facebook stuff.

105
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.270
Over on I guess it Facebook.

106
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:31.160
And there's one more place that you can go which is our discord live chat server.

107
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.540
The game dev TV official server and here you can see we have multiple channels including one for unreel

108
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.440
and that is where you might go and chat about unreal with people who are online at the time and it's

109
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.800
real time chat so different to the other things on there.

110
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.170
If you're familiar with this good it's a game a chat if you're not familiar with it then that is quite

111
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.400
a cool place to be.

112
00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:00.390
And nice to hang out and sometimes we do live voice things there as well which can be quite fun.

113
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.740
Okay so that is a lot of places a very rich community indeed lots of places to go.

114
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:12.670
So I want to give you a quick little map that may help you to navigate that community and actually figure

115
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:19.210
out where you need to go if you've got a particular desire to share or a particular question to ask

116
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.660
and that is the main distinction in fact is.

117
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.220
Are we talking about something that needs an answer.

118
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.890
So let me give you an example.

119
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.090
I've got some code that I've been following along with the letter and it's not compiling and there's

120
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.930
an error and I'm not sure what this error means.

121
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.110
So I'm going to ask myself the question.

122
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.440
Does it need an answer.

123
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.770
Well the answer here is yes because there is something there is a solution.

124
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.960
There is something that can be marked as a correct answer.

125
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.770
So yes it does need an answer so I'm going to go and post that on you to meet Q In Ages 3.

126
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:56.440
Mind you the enemy Q and A being this one here works as broski at the bottom you lecture and you have

127
00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.800
questions you can ask a new question and you can put in all your usual bug reporting style stuff there

128
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:10.780
so you got to tell us what you have tried how it is you are expecting it to behave how it actually behave

129
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.040
screenshots and videos are really helpful.

130
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:20.530
If it's the kind of behaviour like that code if it is not a screen shot a ball and code please please

131
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.340
please please.

132
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.620
You share it using the code formatting option here in the Q and A.

133
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.710
Or using a hub just so he joked just docket hubdub com and paste your code in here and that gives you

134
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.090
a link that you can share in the Q in a.

135
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.540
That just makes it so much easier for us to read.

136
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.730
So please consider those of people who are going to be trying to help you and make it easy for them

137
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.240
to help you.

138
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.680
That's just the golden rule.

139
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.690
Make it easy for people to help you.

140
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:52.030
Okay so once you have shared it on udemy you've got ask yourself the question is this issue blocking

141
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.240
me.

142
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.340
Are you stuck.

143
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:58.930
And if that is the case if you're completely stuck then it might be a good idea to go and share a link

144
00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:07.050
to your Q and A question over on discord because discord is alive chat you can go and say hey guys I

145
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.160
am having a bit of an issue is anyone around who could help me out and as someone from the community

146
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.300
might be able to help you out.

147
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.350
If they are not.

148
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.490
Then you've always got the fallback of having asked the question.

149
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.460
On the Q and A.

150
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.520
In the first place.

151
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:25.030
So either me or one of the student instructors or another member from the community will come in and

152
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.140
help here.

153
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.340
Now do remember to give as well as you get.

154
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.590
You may get lots of answers on macewan.

155
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.940
But please go and browse the cuno as well and look for unanswered questions and see if you can help.

156
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.430
Help.

157
00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.600
See if you can at least point them in a direction that might be helpful.

158
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.200
That helped us a lot.

159
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.290
It helps other students get a better response and in turn that will obviously help you get a better

160
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.880
response as well.

161
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.790
Now let's take another example what if it doesn't need an answer.

162
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:57.490
What if I made a really cool game and I want people to give me some feedback about it.

163
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.590
Well it doesn't have a answer per say.

164
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.610
You can't mark that.

165
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.180
Oh yes that feedback was the correct feedback.

166
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:08.890
So it is not needing an answer is you're wanting some response but you're not needing an answer per

167
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:16.570
say and that is where you would go to gamed dot TV So you would follow the link from the lecture.

168
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:23.440
So just show you that you got the lecture resources and you go to this lectures discussions.

169
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.740
And here you would create a new topic and you would give it an enticing name.

170
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:35.020
You would include lots of screenshots may be a video because basically you want to enthuse people and

171
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.260
get some response.

172
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:42.490
You really want to market the thing that you're trying to share so that people want to get involved

173
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.800
and talk about it.

174
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.870
And then if you want to get more exposure for that then you can share it over on discord again.

175
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:50.800
Same deal.

176
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.700
Now again give some and get some.

177
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:59.410
If you're going to share on game day of TV please please please go and have a look through at least

178
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.000
the section discussions and see if someone answers shared some stuff and give them some response and

179
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.610
give them some feedback because that's always very lovely to hear what people think about your work.

180
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.710
Criticism obviously do it with care and do it in a nice way.

181
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.240
Not in a nasty way.

182
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:23.020
That should be fairly obvious So all that remains is for me to give you a challenge and that challenge

183
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.480
is to say hello world and in his case.

184
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.070
I'm not asking you to write some code.

185
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.570
I'm actually asking you to go and say hello to our community.

186
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.270
So go and introduce yourself to the community.

187
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:38.110
Use the map from the previous slide has a guide to where you should end up and share your why.

188
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.940
Why are you doing this course.

189
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.770
What do you want to make from it.

190
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.650
And yes tell us a little bit about your background and your self.

191
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.540
Okay so pause a video and do that challenge.

192
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.180
Okay welcome back.

193
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.320
I hope you did the challenge because you're not going to get anywhere out of this course if you aren't

194
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.080
doing the challenge.

195
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.790
It's a very important part of the game day TV experience.

196
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:06.320
So if you followed the map then you would have said to yourself well I am just sharing my story and

197
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.810
I'm introducing myself.

198
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.650
That's not something that has a correct answer.

199
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.210
So I'm not going to go to you and me for that.

200
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.750
I'm going to follow the link at game def TV and I'm going to share my story there.

201
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.900
And then I might go and hop on over onto discord again.

202
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.460
The link to the discord.

203
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:26.350
In fact I haven't mentioned that yet that you need to accept an invite that is linked from this lecture.

204
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.290
Follow that link and you will be able to join in the discourse discussions as well.

205
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.580
So hopefully use that opportunity in this challenge.

206
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:39.360
We haven't done so already to go and join the dischord server and introduce yourself there as well and

207
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.260
get a little bit involved in the chat going on over there.

208
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.400
So congratulations.

209
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:48.720
You have been officially introduced to the community and I welcome you wholeheartedly here and I am

210
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.310
sure I will see your messages and I welcome you on the forum as will other students.

211
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.030
So see you in the next lecture.
