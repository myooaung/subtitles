00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.180
Welcome this lecture is all about this little gizmo here the pressure pad.

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.030
We are going to be creating a pressure pad that activates the platforms or at least the basis of it

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.010
because it doesn't activate the platform just yet.

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.730
But we're going to be creating this with a trigger volume and a pressure pad.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.210
It's mesh at the bottom.

6
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.010
In this lecture we're going to be making it mostly in C++ with an extension in blueprint.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.860
So let's dive right in and do that.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.960
So one more thing that I want for our game is to have trigger platforms where we can go and stand on

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.710
them and activate the platforms.

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.210
Now the reason that I want this is so we can make this truly a multiplayer required game I want to create.

11
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.600
Let me show you this.

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.230
The following puzzles experience that we're going to have this platform that moves between here and

13
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.150
here but it only moves when someone standing on a pressure pad on a trigger.

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.030
So that is going to mean that in order to get from A to B from this location to the location over in

15
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.200
the distance someone's gonna have to be standing on the pressure pad while the other person is standing

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.960
on the platform and that makes it intrinsically multiplayer.

17
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.700
So that's what I'd like to do.

18
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.750
Create a platform a trigger platform on both of these stages so that both players can get across and

19
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.360
yeah.

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.520
So let's go ahead and start off by creating a C++ base for this.

21
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.380
I'm going to go into the content browser and you can follow along with me.

22
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.200
We're going to go to add new create new C++ class.

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.040
And I'm just going to base this off the active parent class.

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.970
Go ahead and hit next.

25
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.120
And I'm going to call it a platform.

26
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.130
Trigger.

27
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.300
Create that class.

28
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.420
Now let's wait for it to compile and while we're doing that let's think a little bit about what the

29
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.150
internals of this trigger might need to be.

30
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.960
So clearly we want something that can give us events when we stand inside it or stand on top of it.

31
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.140
For that I'm going to be using a box component and the box can count component can give us overlap events.

32
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.590
So we're going to be registering for the overlap event in the next lecture.

33
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.690
But in this lecture we're just going to be setting up the component inside of C++.

34
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.570
So when the C++ code has finished generating compiling that is what we're going to do.

35
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.600
In fact let's get a little bit ahead of ourselves and start having a look at how we might do this.

36
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.370
So the key term here is create defaults sub object.

37
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.370
That's how we create components inside C++.

38
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.370
Now I've just gone ahead and done a google search for it so we can copy the definitions because I never

39
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.430
quite remember exactly how it's done right.

40
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.870
It's pretty pretty hard to remember everything.

41
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.300
So what you want to do is.

42
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.930
Okay so we've got something like an F object initializer.

43
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.240
I don't think this is the easiest way.

44
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.750
I seem to recall there being easier ways.

45
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.870
So there seems to be a second documentation link further down which just looks almost identical.

46
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.410
So I'm not sure why those two are different documentation links.

47
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.120
Maybe there's some slight difference in the verschuren or something like that.

48
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.740
Let's have a look further down still.

49
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.180
And you object this creates default subject now that now that I could stick with that seems to make

50
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.480
a little bit more sense.

51
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.710
So how to read this well we've got a template argument and I don't think we need the second template

52
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.850
argument and we've got the return type which is the same as the template argument so this makes sense.

53
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.340
We've got a subobject name which is an F name and a boolean whether it's transient or not.

54
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.500
Case by now hopefully our class has finished generating Let's go back over into unreel and see whether

55
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.380
that is the case.

56
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.800
Nope still generating.

57
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.070
Okay well let's wait for it to finish.

58
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.660
And while we do that we also need to think about what we are going to be creating We're going to be

59
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.940
creating a box component so let's search the documentation for the box components as well.

60
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.600
Often add eui for unreel to search terms if it's going to be ambiguous.

61
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.750
So we've got the you box component that's the type that I'm going to want to create.

62
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.850
Now remember that in newer unreal versions you have to include what you use.

63
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.510
So in order to use the you box component we have to look for the correct header.

64
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.360
It's going to be down here at the bottom.

65
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.780
The box component.

66
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.030
Dot H.

67
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.690
And then we'll be able to use the type that you box component type inside AC plus plus.

68
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.350
So at last my compile finished and popped up with visual studio with and newly created platform trigger.

69
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.760
So the first thing I'm going to want to do is create a new property to store the component.

70
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.770
We always have to have a new property for these components in order for them to hang around because

71
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.420
having you property to a component means that it won't be garbage collected.

72
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.870
So let's go to the platform trigger and under.

73
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.750
I think we're going to keep this private for now.

74
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.460
So let's create a new private section for that.

75
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.790
And then we can always make it more permissive later if you want to.

76
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.850
It's going to be a you property and at the moment I'm not going to give it any particular.

77
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.720
Properties of your property and where it's going to be a new box component.

78
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.670
But we don't like including things in the head of files in order to do this so I'm going to do a forward

79
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.610
declaration at this point because I don't actually need to use any of the guts of the box component

80
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.920
so I'm going to do it for decoration which is class.

81
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.390
You box component which is copied star because it's a pointer and then we are going to call this the

82
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.440
let's see the pressure of volume perhaps.

83
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.940
To basically say it's kind of that pressure pad that trigger triggering volume I think triggering volume

84
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.340
might be a better name actually.

85
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.430
Or trigger volume.

86
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.170
Like so.

87
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.460
Now we need to populate that trigger volume with an actual instance of the you box component.

88
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.150
Best place for that is the constructer So let's go back into the platform triggered off key and here

89
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.270
after the can ever tick.

90
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:32.080
We can talk about creating these default subjects so I'm going to go back to my documentation for the

91
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.830
create default subobject and I'm going to copy the create default subobject.

92
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.580
I never remember how to type things.

93
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.400
And then we are going to make an instance of you box.

94
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.620
Component.

95
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.610
And we're going to give it an F name.

96
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.010
And the f name is going to be let's call it again the trigger volume.

97
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.200
So that's what's going to show up in the blueprint subclasses.

98
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.020
Kate so that's seems all right no redd's quigley's.

99
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.360
And we want to capture the return value there in two volume.

100
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.770
Trigger volume private variable.

101
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.380
MIKE So and one more thing is I want to set the root component of this actor.

102
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.890
Now that's fairly easy.

103
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:42.880
You've got a root component property here which we can just set to that trigger volume.

104
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:51.580
But I want to first make sure that the trigger volume hasn't initialized null hang on we've got a little

105
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.820
bit of an error here let's see what that's about.

106
00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.970
Cannot a value of type you box component star cannot be assigned to an entity of type Useem component.

107
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.920
Now that's because we haven't included the header for the you box components so let's go ahead and do

108
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.310
that.

109
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.130
You can find it on the documentation page.

110
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:15.670
Scroll to the bottom and it's basically the bit after the runtime engine classes it's just components

111
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.210
box components.

112
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.030
H.

113
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.980
So I can grab that go back to visual studio and I'm going to include it below my platform triggered.

114
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.740
H leave a bit of space so that it's clear that this is including stuff from the engine.

115
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.510
And paste that in.

116
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.860
Hopefully that should make our error go away.

117
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:43.550
Yes it has now it can assign to a you seen component because it knows that it's a Useem component.

118
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.600
And one more thing I'm hyper paranoid about null pointers in unreel because it can bring the whole Ed

119
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.710
crashing down.

120
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:56.610
So what I've actually got here is a text expansion which automatically basically creates a nold check

121
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.650
and does an Ensure around that null check that if you're not sure what an insurer is you can go ahead

122
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.730
and look at the documentation.

123
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:08.340
Basically it throws an error into the logs but without crashing the editor.

124
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:15.780
So my I call it null RET it's a text expander shortcut you can use something similar.

125
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.880
It's a very cross platform so it's not visual studio dependent at all you can do this on Mac as well

126
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.410
and you can see what is doing here is it saying well I'm going to include this.

127
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.780
Just tell me what the name of the variable is.

128
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.320
So my name of the variable is trigger volume.

129
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.730
Okay.

130
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.580
And there we go.

131
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.110
It has expanded out and let me just read to you what this one liner is doing.

132
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.730
It's saying first of all ensure which is the check.

133
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.940
So we want to ensure that trigger volume is not equal to null pointer.

134
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.530
That's what we want to be true.

135
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:56.410
But in case it is equal to null pointer then we want to return from this method and not execute any

136
00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:01.660
more of it because the rest of the method might be dangerous for there being a null pointer in it.

137
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.400
So that's basically what this does.

138
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.260
You can pause a second and make sure that you fully understand what that one line does.

139
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.420
It's a little bit terse.

140
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.850
It's got a few exclamation marks in it a few knots and Legations in there.

141
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.780
So just get familiar with that get happy and do ask the Q and A.

142
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.010
If you still aren't quite happy with what that ensure is doing.

143
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.830
Okay let's go ahead and build this now.

144
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.650
OK we've got a successful compile so we're ready to move on to the next step because we haven't actually

145
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:36.320
Gotz in the world yet the next step is to tweak the blueprint so we actually need to have a blueprint

146
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.780
in place.

147
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.860
That's going to be your challenge.

148
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:46.200
The challenge is to create a blueprint child of this class of the trigger component class.

149
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.940
So first off that blueprint is going to be used to scale the box to sensible dimensions for a trigger

150
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.580
platform.

151
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.550
Just remember that we're going to have our character walking into this box and that's what's going to

152
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.740
set off the pressure pad.

153
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.140
Secondly we need to attach a mesh that makes it obvious that there is a pressure pad to stand on at

154
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.250
tool.

155
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.830
And thirdly we want to place it in the world in the correct spots.

156
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:15.190
Remember that I said we wanted it to be near those that moving platform.

157
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.560
The third and last moving platform because we wanted to activate that moon platform on both sides of

158
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.480
the divide so pause a video and have a go at this challenge.

159
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:34.080
Okay Welcome back let's create this blueprint child so I'm going to go over to the unreel editor and

160
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.740
let's see what's the first step.

161
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.940
I'm going to add new.

162
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.480
No I'm not.

163
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.680
I'm going to go up from the C plus pass classes Otherwise it's going to not give me the full ad new.

164
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.280
Man you going to create a blueprint class.

165
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:50.930
Maybe not.

166
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.950
Maybe this isn't the quickest way.

167
00:11:51.950 --> 00:12:00.740
Let's go down back into the C plus plus classes and find our platform trigga right click it and create

168
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.770
a blueprint class based on the platform trigger.

169
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:04.840
That's what I want.

170
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.360
Okay now we're getting there.

171
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.780
And remember our prefixes we want to prefix this with BP underscore that will help us differentiate

172
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.900
it from the C++.

173
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.320
It also basically is the convention.

174
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.000
Let's go ahead and create that class.

175
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.970
I think I've created it in the wrong place so let's put it in.

176
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:29.260
Now we've actually created something for this particular game for our puzzle platforms gameless create

177
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:37.390
a new folder specific to puzzle platforms where we can put any of the assets that are not taken from

178
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.130
elsewhere.

179
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.100
So I'm going to create a new folder.

180
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.330
Call it puzzle.

181
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.200
Platforms.

182
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:54.270
And move our BP in to that puzzle platforms folder.

183
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.700
And let's go over to that Tammy that was opened up for our puzzle platform BP trigger Okay.

184
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:09.450
First off we've got our trigger volume which as we know is a box collision component and we can't edit

185
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:09.880
it yet.

186
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.270
Okay.

187
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:19.340
So why can't we edit it because our new property doesn't have any of the required.

188
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.530
Ed Ball.

189
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:28.000
Annotations basically So if we go back to our platform triggered dot H then you see we left our property

190
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.840
open in order to get this up to the point of.

191
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:41.670
Basically being able to see an edit our volume you would think that you need an editor anywhere but

192
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.800
if you use edit anywhere give it a try.

193
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.980
You'll see what happens you get some collapsable widget and that's really strange but the reason for

194
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.630
that is because it's saying you might want to be editing the pointer and we clearly dont want to be

195
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.380
editing the point.

196
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.490
We just want to be able to see the contents of the pointer and change the contents of a pointer.

197
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.220
So for that counterintuitively we actually use visible anywhere.

198
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.460
So let's try that.

199
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.680
Now the autocomplete isn't going to help me so it's visible anywhere with kamil case.

200
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.550
Go ahead and compile that and see if that has the right impact on the blueprints.

201
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:22.520
Okay compile succeeded Let's go over and see if that's had the required effect in the blueprint let's

202
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.490
click on the trigger volume and sure enough all the properties show up.

203
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:30.610
Now you can try doing edits anywhere to see what I meant by that effect but hopefully you got there

204
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.860
yourself in the challenge.

205
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:38.290
So let's click on our blueprint trigger volume and change the box extent to be just a little bit bigger.

206
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:46.700
I think I'm going to go for about 100 by 100 by 200 something like that.

207
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.080
So we get a nice box there.

208
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:57.470
And I wanted to add a mesh as well so let's add a mesh that will be a Add component static mesh and

209
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.850
I'm going to call it the pressure.

210
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:11.260
And I'm going to use a cube and then I'm going to use scales said cube and actually you'll notice that

211
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.510
our volume is a little bit big because that cube is 1 meter squared and a character can sit squarely

212
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.120
on it.

213
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.950
So we want to first off scale AQ a little bit down so it's more of a squashed pad.

214
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:27.080
Then I want to move it towards the bottom.

215
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.770
Of our trigger volume and then a trigger volume.

216
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.590
We want to bring in maybe to have box extent.

217
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:42.270
I think it looks like half the size so 50 by 50 by 100 seems like a more sensible size.

218
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:42.600
Okay.

219
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.580
Now I need to bring the pressure pad back up a little bit.

220
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.650
That seems to be just about right let's check off against the challenge.

221
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.090
Okay.

222
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.040
Final thing is two places in the world.

223
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.830
So let's go ahead and do that.

224
00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:06.420
I'm going to navigate my way to the top of unseen area number one go to my posit platforms folder and

225
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.200
bring out that trigger.

226
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:14.270
To bring it up a little bit and then we get we've got our trigger with a pressure pad which is looking

227
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:19.970
a bit bulky actually I don't like the height of that trapped pressure pad let's make it a smidge smaller.

228
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.640
To do that I think I'm going to have to manually edit this scale because it's a little bit too sensitive.

229
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.820
Go I'd do it.

230
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.440
I'll set it to point one in that dimension save go back to our map.

231
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.280
That's looking like a better press pad already.

232
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:44.360
So that pressure plan add pressure pad is in place and with a shift whoops let's see where this shift

233
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.240
and a move.

234
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.360
Nope not a shift in a move but a control and a move.

235
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.000
Nope.

236
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.070
See if I can get this right.

237
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.720
Alton a move.

238
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.480
There you go.

239
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.100
Alton a move.

240
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.800
We do placate while dragging.

241
00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.620
And I'm going to take it over to the other area and that's great.

242
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.090
That's placed in the world obviously has no functionality yet but that's what we're going to deal with

243
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.070
in the next lecture.

244
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.040
So I will see you there.
