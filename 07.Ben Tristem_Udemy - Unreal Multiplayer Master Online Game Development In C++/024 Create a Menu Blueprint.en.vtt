00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.230
Welcome.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.860
In this section we are going to be starting to build a menu system on top of the game from last section.

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.920
Many systems are key to multiplayer games so we're going to be starting off by creating and revising

4
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.630
some simple menu lay out for unreal and be going on throughout the section to flesh that out into a

5
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.730
fully functional menu system that allows you to execute all the commands that we created in the previous

6
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.590
section.

7
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.840
So let's dive in and see how to get started on this.

8
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.820
Okay here we stand with a brand new empty project ready to get started and stuck into understanding

9
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.070
how many systems work.

10
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.260
Now many systems on their own don't make very fun or exciting games so we are going to build it around

11
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.550
the game from the previous section so that we have something to play into.

12
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.090
Just an example to work with.

13
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.460
But the idea of this section is that the menu system is going to be completely decouple a ball or very

14
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.000
easily decouple a ball from the game itself.

15
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.640
So you'll be able to take this many system and plonk it in the other games that were going to build

16
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.430
and extend it further for their requirements.

17
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.610
The idea being that the menu system can be quite separate from a game in itself but as a starting point

18
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.310
we are going to be using last sections project.

19
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.090
So let's go over to get hub and get hold of that.

20
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.840
Here's the last section to go and download it.

21
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.760
I recommend going to clone or download and for this I don't want the whole get history I just want the

22
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.040
projects I'm just going to download the zip and should be safe with that.

23
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.940
Well go ahead.

24
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.290
Great.

25
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.020
Zip and download it for you.

26
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.100
And we're just going to take this and unzip it and take the contents.

27
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.550
Basically just the project and place it in our menu system when that's finished downloading.

28
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.430
That means that what we're going to do is build around that.

29
00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.970
Create a directory structure inside there for the menu system that we can then extract out later into

30
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.450
other projects and I'll be showing you how that is possible how we can extract out a project in later

31
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.540
sections.

32
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.280
Let's go and see if our download has finished.

33
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.340
Yes it has.

34
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.270
I'm going to go ahead and open up that zip file.

35
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.900
And I am going to extract all.

36
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.780
Extracted my downloads.

37
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.650
That was reasonably quick and then I'll get my downloads and we've got that folder for puzzle platform

38
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.430
master.

39
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.690
We've got the read me we don't need but the project with it's get ignore and the you project all set

40
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.810
up there that we do need.

41
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.040
So I'm going to go ahead.

42
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.360
Copy that.

43
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.370
And go back over to our menu system folder and paste it in there.

44
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.510
Very straightforward stuff on it you could be following along with while I'm doing this.

45
00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.430
And now because we've brought in a whole chunk of work here I would like to go ahead and well firstly

46
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:09.040
get it set of building so let's generate the visual studio project because then we can open the visual

47
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.500
studio project and it can start indexing while the project is building itself.

48
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.030
So first off I always do that I generate the visual studio project.

49
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.710
I open up the visual studio project so it can start indexing and then I open up the new project which

50
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.220
should hopefully ask me to build a go.

51
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.900
Nothing built so would you like to rebuild it.

52
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.540
Yes I would.

53
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.020
So I can go ahead and start the build process.

54
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.160
I can start the indexing process all of this can be going on while I show you that I am going to be

55
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.740
committing this so I'm going to go in to source tree for this.

56
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.620
I have had the initial project with the initial uncommitted changes and I'm just going to make a commit

57
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.610
for this.

58
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.550
So let's go ahead and hit the commit button at the top left on Windows.

59
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.070
And let's have a look at what it's going to stage.

60
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.390
This all looks reasonable.

61
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.360
The kids ignore that we copied across seems to be working correctly.

62
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.140
So I'm going to stage all of that.

63
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.850
We go.

64
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.160
And then I am going to write a reasonable commit message.

65
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.790
So import project from puzzle platforms is going to be my commit message.

66
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.800
And then I'm going to hit push changes immediately to origin mass Sturgis simplicity and I'm going to

67
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.930
go ahead and commit that.

68
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.360
Now it's going to take a little while because it needs to be pushing quite a few files but in the meantime

69
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.430
we have got unreel started loading up in the background.

70
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.980
So while it's pushing we can be doing the next step.

71
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.950
So the goal is to be able to create a menu system that allows us to do everything that we can currently

72
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.570
do only on the command line here in app projects so that's going to be to host and to join mainly So

73
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:05.580
we're going to need a menu that will replace our lobby as a main menu area that allows you to host a

74
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.380
level and take you to hosting and join and type in the address and hit join and display any errors if

75
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.380
any errors occur while trying to join.

76
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.130
So the first place to start with this is just to create a menu blueprint in the first place so let's

77
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.140
go ahead and do that.

78
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.720
I'm going to go into my content browser and up to the root of content.

79
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.920
And here I'm going to create a brand new top level directory for the menu system.

80
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.330
As I said I wanted to be completely separable.

81
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.030
So that's the way we're going to do it.

82
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.210
Add new new folder and let's give it a sensible name.

83
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.520
EF 2 to rename and we will call it menu system.

84
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.340
Without the space then like space.

85
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.010
Menu system.

86
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:10.190
And let's open up the menu system folder add new and we can go down to user interface and select the

87
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.130
widget blueprint.

88
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:19.040
Now remember with widget blueprints we like to use the prefix W. BP to differentiate it from standard

89
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.840
blue prints.

90
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.450
And I'm going to call this the main menu as the blue print name.

91
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.900
Let's go ahead and open up that blue print.

92
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.900
Now the moment we're doing this in blue print but do I am going to be using a lot more C++ as we go

93
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.820
on so no fear.

94
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.570
We'll be showing you how we can use blueprint for it's good out which is the visual layout stuff and

95
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.550
we can you C++ for what it's good at which is all the binding and Data Handling on the back end.

96
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.830
So I'll be doing that in later lectures.

97
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.200
But first off we're going to create the blueprint front end and then have something to put into the

98
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.820
back.

99
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.450
So hopefully that's all fairly familiar with you how to create a menu blueprint.

100
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.370
Let's go on and have a look at a revision of lay out in unreel lay out and real can be a little bit

101
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.710
complicated so let's think let's just revise that and get it fresh in our minds.

102
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:16.090
So we've got a pallet over in the left of our UI editor which gives us lots of components that we can

103
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.270
click and drag in to our canvas.

104
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:28.690
And on that canvas we can move them around are all around the place and in the left hand underneath

105
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.920
the palette we have a hierarchy.

106
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.280
So you can see that the canvas panel has below the border that we just dragged in and we can generally

107
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:43.150
nest items as they allow nesting so certain types of items will allow other widgets to be put inside

108
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.650
them and so on and so forth.

109
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.800
And that can affect later.

110
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.790
And we'll see more about advanced layout late in a later lecture.

111
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:57.370
But let's think about the very very simple case of lay out if I bring in a text box like this one ATEX

112
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:04.250
block and move it around what's actually going on in the property pane over to our right.

113
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.910
You can see that we've got position X and Y.

114
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.980
And as I move it that position is changing.

115
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.940
Now this is obviously great if I want to position things relative to that top left corner.

116
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:23.560
But what happens if I try and rescale my Cambers I've got a little scaling thing down at the bottom

117
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:30.180
right to enable that you may need to mess around with some of these buttons at the top.

118
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.030
At the top right at the bottom left.

119
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.370
I've got this little scaling buttonless and you can see it can be used to scale between something like

120
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:45.460
720 P or up to 10 80 or down or just some random resolution as well.

121
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:52.210
So what you can see is that when I am scaling like this my text block is eventually going to go off

122
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.580
to the side and it's certainly not staying in the middle the whole time.

123
00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.430
And depending on the different layouts of scale that's certainly not staying in the middle.

124
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:08.440
So what if we did want that textbook to be centred towards the middle of my page and well to do that

125
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.630
we've got something called the anchor and that's this flower looking symbol in the top right is not

126
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.550
actually a flower it's actually got some Or basically its petals can be pulled out in this fashion.

127
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.690
As you can see to make a sort of percentage style box and I'll talk about that in a little while but

128
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:31.990
let's move it by the Centre first because what we can do with this anchor is if I expand the anchor

129
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.820
property in details.

130
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:41.380
You'll see we've got a minimum and a maximum at the moment are linked to each other but basically percentages

131
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.310
of this screen space.

132
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.990
So if I set them to point five.

133
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.360
And point five.

134
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.930
And then basically set all of them two point five.

135
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.550
Then what we've ended up with.

136
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.860
He is an anchor out there smack bang in the middle of the page.

137
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:09.810
Now what I can do is I can move my text block to be in a position relative to that anchor.

138
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:16.230
And when I recycled the screen it's going to stay at that position relative to the middle of the page

139
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.350
which is much better if we're trying to create a menu that is anchored to the middle of the page.

140
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.860
Hence the name anchor.

141
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.880
Simple right.

142
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.690
Okay.

143
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.540
So we've got that we've got how to anchor things to the centre of the page and that's quite important.

144
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.220
Now let's think a bit about these minimums a maximum.

145
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.550
What does that do.

146
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.360
So you can see that I can change the minimax by pulling out these petals you can pull out different

147
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:46.350
petals to experiment with and see how that changes the different of these four minimums and maximums.

148
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.900
But what does this actually mean.

149
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.640
Well you'll notice that when I actually pull that petal out so let me try it again.

150
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:03.350
We get a change in the properties in that panel so when it's all together we've got a position X and

151
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.880
Y and a size X and Y.

152
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.200
If I pull them out then we no longer have size X and Y instead we have those four properties replaced

153
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.570
by offset left offset top offset right and offset bottom.

154
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:23.170
So what this does now is it turns the size of our textbook also into a relative thing.

155
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.060
It's now a percentage based thing.

156
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:34.070
So if I pop my box to be somewhere in the middle like this and then I resize my text block to be about

157
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:43.460
any size just like this within within or without of this now expanded flower then when I reach size

158
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:51.260
what you'll see is that the scale of the text box itself is changing with the scale of the page.

159
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.220
So it makes the size relative as well as the position.

160
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.590
That's the general idea.

161
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.440
And these are the basic tenants of lay out when we are in unreel.

162
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.750
So now it's your turn to go ahead and create your own basic menu.

163
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.280
How are you going to do this.

164
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.500
Well it's going to have the following it should have a title for a start.

165
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.470
So a title of the pop top saying that what's the name of the game that this is the main menu.

166
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.270
Maybe a little bit of text a description.

167
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.990
But often you don't need that.

168
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.150
It's also going to have a host button to replicate that house command that we created and a join button

169
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.530
which isn't going to be exactly the join command because it's going to have to go on to another screen

170
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.180
to do more complicated stuff there.

171
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.700
But it's going to be a start.

172
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.430
So pause a video and have a go at creating this menu.

173
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.140
Okay welcome back.

174
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.470
So let's dive into making this menu.

175
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:48.420
First things first is text the text block is a useful place to start but I'm going to delete it because

176
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.430
we've been messing around with this lay out.

177
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:58.200
So I'm going to start with a new text block and I'm going to change the text in it so the text content

178
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.790
area of the details pain.

179
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:07.030
I'm going to give it a really mundane name like Main Menu for now and hit enter for that name to come

180
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.440
across.

181
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.610
Now let's see.

182
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:17.690
I'm going to resize that menu to be about the right size then I'm going to go to my appearance and change

183
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.030
it.

184
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:25.180
It's justification to be Centre aligned because I want my main menu text to be Centre aligned and then

185
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:32.050
I want to change the font size so under appearance and font we have the size as well as the font family

186
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.530
so you can choose a more elaborate font family if you want.

187
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:42.040
You can go and do that by I believe searching through the content browse we've got a few here in my

188
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:48.900
engine fonts just roboto Mostly Android sans some free fonts that are on my system.

189
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.560
But you can go ahead and get any fonts that you like from places like Daff font or any other.

190
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.710
Google's open source font products is a good one that will allow you to distribute them for free.

191
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.460
And so we can change the size that's what I was here for.

192
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.350
Sam's getting distracted again.

193
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:11.800
And let's bring the main menu up to a larger size make its box around its a similar size so that the

194
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.500
justification is working correctly.

195
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.950
I may be oversized But for now it seems to be okay.

196
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.470
Now my anchor position I'm going to go ahead and change that to being as we've done before.

197
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:31.120
Point five all around this point five five Tam point five enter.

198
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:37.210
And that's got an anchor smack bang in the middle which allows me to position my main menu somewhere

199
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.360
around the middle to not going to be too accurate with this.

200
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.560
There's going to be I'm going to be doing the lay out in a slightly different way later with some more

201
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.350
advanced lay out components case that's more or less in the centre and I can check that the layout is

202
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.710
going to work by rescaling.

203
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.720
This menu seems to work okay for quite a range of sizes which is good.

204
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.620
Next up I'm going to add in a host button so let's pull in our button.

205
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.760
Make it a sensible size.

206
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.380
And then we're gonna have to add some text.

207
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:16.780
Now you may or may not remember how adding text works it's fairly straightforward actually the way that

208
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:23.620
you and text is you pull in a text component onto your button and what you'll notice happens is that

209
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.390
that text component gets nested underneath the button as I said certain components have slots underneath

210
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.830
them that you can put on one or more other things inside them.

211
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.090
And the button is an example of that.

212
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.340
Now in white it's a little bit hard to read.

213
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:44.230
I'm going to change the appearance of the colour to be a black one and then I'm going to change the

214
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.540
text to host it.

215
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.600
Enter for that to happen with out the hash.

216
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:57.460
And I am going to change the size of the text to about a forty three so now I got a nice sizeable host

217
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:02.080
button that looks good and I'm going to change the anchor again.

218
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.240
This time is getting a little bit tedious as net.

219
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.660
But we're going to create the pain first and then we're going to learn how to fix that pain so I can

220
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.620
it is a bit of snappin going on so I can actually position it 2.5 quite easily.

221
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.970
Then I'm going to take this button and copy and paste it.

222
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.700
Which didn't really work.

223
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:27.970
So let's right click and copy and right click on the canvas which is what I want to paste it under and

224
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.940
paste there that makes it a little bit more clear to one real.

225
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.830
Where you wanting to copy paste because it doesn't know otherwise.

226
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:41.020
It's saying I can't put a button inside another button which is fair enough as I said you can sometimes

227
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.960
have only one thing underneath the other elements in this hierarchy.

228
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:53.440
So let's take that second button and stick it underneath the first and select its text again in the

229
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.160
hierarchy.

230
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.070
Go over to the details and change the text from host to join.

231
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.980
That looks fairly straight forward now and the anchor is in the correct place because I copied it from

232
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.060
the host button.

233
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.570
So now if I rescale.

234
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.190
If it will let me rescale indeed.

235
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.930
Then you see that all the buttons seem to be moving in the correct fashion so that's a job well done.

236
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:27.440
In my opinion we've created a very simple main menu will be sprucing it up through this section and

237
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.150
we will be making it much more functional than it currently is and make it actually do stuff in our

238
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.980
gamebook patch on the back.

239
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.560
A great start to the second section.
