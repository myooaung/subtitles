Hi there.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.030
Congratulations on making it to the end of the Course.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.300
This is the final lecture except for the bonus one that comes after it.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.210
And this is to basically wrap up and say well done for getting through this.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.860
This was pretty advanced content.

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.640
I'm really happy that you made it through and that you've been engaging and you've done lots of stuff

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.750
but this isn't the end of your multiplayer journey.

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.570
Oh no no.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.160
All I've done is given you the tools to go on exploring.

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.170
Now it's your turn to go off and start creating your own projects of your own devising.

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.950
And if that's a little bit scary maybe you just want to go back to this project and go on improving

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.770
things maybe you'll take some of the synchronization stuff and take it and impart apply it to the previous

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.650
project that's a great way to start reapplying your skills.

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.170
And another good way to go about this is just to create your own project.

15
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.910
What did you want to create.

16
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.450
Remember to keep the scope quite limited so that you've got a chance of actually learning and doing

17
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.170
this.

18
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.500
So go ahead and do a very limited scope project.

19
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.390
I'd love to see what you come up with.

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.160
Do share it in the community site.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.600
We'd love to see any products you do make a little video of the game play to tantalize people and share

22
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.050
it in the community website.

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.790
I'd love to see that just repeating myself.

24
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.530
But I really really would.

25
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.490
And you'll notice that there are a few topics we don't cover in this course most notably so far we do

26
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.670
not cover dedicated server.

27
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.980
And the reason for this is that most of the techniques that you've already learnt are exactly the same

28
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.170
in a dedicated server is just that.

29
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.400
Either the dedicated server is running with a player on it or it's not.

30
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.910
So there's very little difference there's only stuff around hosting and that's not really within the

31
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.340
remit of this course.

32
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.420
But if a lot of people want to hear about dedicated server then we may add that in later.

33
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.820
But just say if you wanna hear about it or say if there's anything else that you rather hear about that

34
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.330
we haven't covered and just mention it in the comments for this video but otherwise I would look forward

35
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.150
to seeing what you create.
