00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.590
Welcome in this lecture we are going to be preparing you why to display a cervalis.

2
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.070
So here I've got my you.

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.250
If I hit the join button then we get this list with an empty entity list essentially.

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.790
And for now I'm going to hook it up so that when we hit join it is going to add a new element to this

5
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.940
less than as you can see it's a scrollable list you've got scroll bar at the right here.

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.150
And it's going to be storing our list of servers.

7
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.550
It isn't yet but it will be will be populating it in the next lecture.

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.480
But in this lecture will be figuring out how to achieve this.

9
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.720
Let's dive in.

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.410
So we're going to the point where we're able to find sessions but it's not very pretty at the moment

11
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.540
to have to go and do it in the output log.

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.130
We've got you for a reason.

13
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.500
We want to be able to hit the join button and have a list of available servers current here rather than

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.790
us having to type in the IP address.

15
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.310
So let's begin with that.

16
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.920
So we're going to actually be using a component called a scroll box.

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.860
Let's see why.

18
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.160
Let's go into the content browser and open up our main menu and Main Menu widget has opened up on the

19
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.840
other.

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.580
Ah the window for me.

21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.220
And here we go this is our main menu as we know we have a little bit revision we've got a menu switcher

22
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.520
and a join menu and join menu is what we want to change.

23
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.180
We want to change out basically this IP address field.

24
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.690
I want to remove that and replace it with.

25
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.310
You can see here we've got a size box or a couple of size boxes around around that area.

26
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.600
And actually I want to add in another size box which is going to contain a scroll box so let's add in

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.330
the scroll box first.

28
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.080
So I'm going to grab a scroll box from the palette.

29
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.150
I'm going to stick it between the two sized boxes.

30
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.810
Obviously it takes up no space whatsoever which isn't the best thing in the world.

31
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.600
So let's right click on it wrap with wrap with a scale box.

32
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.440
There we go we've got ourselves a scale box around the scroll box and this scale box.

33
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.220
Now I want to.

34
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.540
Don't want to stretch or scale to fit.

35
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.620
Is it scale so I.

36
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.380
No it's not scalable I want undo that.

37
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.000
I want size box ramp with size box easy to get these names confused.

38
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.530
Let's click on the size box.

39
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.140
I want to override its height so I'm going to go to the child lay out click override height override

40
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.560
and I'm going to increase that until we've got some visible size.

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.490
There we go.

42
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.020
And this is going to be for the list of servers is going to go in here inside the scroll box obviously

43
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.810
a scroll box is going to have all of its children.

44
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.490
And then it's going to scroll so let's add in some children just for a test so I'm going to look for

45
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.200
some text elements.

46
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.240
And I'm going to stick some in the scroll bar.

47
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.390
And another one and another one and let's just keep adding them until we've got.

48
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.190
Lots and lots of text they go and you can see that you end up with something that is scrollable.

49
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.540
So if we go ahead and play this to test it out you know and join they go you got a scrolling list which

50
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.280
is going to be these scrolling list of servers of which we can then go ahead and click click on and

51
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.020
hit join.

52
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.300
That's what we're aiming for anyway.

53
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.970
Okay.

54
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.880
So if that is what we're aiming for let's go ahead and do it.

55
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.510
Let's go ahead and create this.

56
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.060
Set up so I'm going to delete the text boxes for now at least an app seems to accidentally deleted.

57
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.020
Also our scroll box so I'm going to undo that.

58
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.600
Let's see if we can undo that.

59
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.710
No.

60
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.450
I'm going to have to do it.

61
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.960
Maybe I can undo it.

62
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.660
I'm just not seeing it because I had the main menu selected instead to get all my text boxes delete

63
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.910
those and select the Confirm meant the join menu again.

64
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.030
So a bit annoying isn't it.

65
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.900
Let's.

66
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.360
Make sure we have got the main menu selected.

67
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.210
Okay.

68
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.080
So what we want to do is be able to add in elements into this.

69
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:18.900
And what we can do is create a widget of our own a new widget which is going to be a server line essentially

70
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.060
in here and we can style however we like and we can create some C++ to set the server name and so on

71
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.740
and so forth.

72
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.920
And we're going to add these in programmatically in B C plus plus.

73
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.550
Now it's actually very easy to add things in programmatically to a scroll box because a scroll box is

74
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.640
an instance of a you panel widget you can see it here among the children of you panel widget.

75
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.630
We've got scroll box and the U panel which it has these functions about children it can and have children

76
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.440
in it can also clear all children so it can get rid of all children.

77
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.320
Add them back in and so on so forth.

78
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.140
So that's what we're interested in we're going to be adding in children and constructing the custom

79
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.050
widget to display these server line.

80
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.340
So with your new knowledge of the scroll box I think you're perfectly capable of doing the next bit

81
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.470
yourself which is to populate the list to populate that scroll box list.

82
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:27.600
Were you going to create a new C++ widget to be the row in that list and create a BP child to do the

83
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.440
styling had a bit of text make it look like a row from a server line and then create this widget from

84
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.050
Maine.

85
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.670
C p p an add a few test ones in as children.

86
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.630
So just do this basically has it as a test for the now with some static data in it just to make sure

87
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.240
that we can test the process of adding children to the scroll box.

88
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.220
You can add as many as you like to get it to agilely scroll and were going to be testing basically doing

89
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.100
this in C++ and the next lecture will actually populate it with the data from find.

90
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.890
But we won't worry about that just yet.

91
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.840
Okay so pause a video and have a go at this challenge.

92
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.470
Okay welcome back.

93
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.970
So were going to start off by populating this list let's start off by creating a widget.

94
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.980
In fact I'm going to go in to my menu system and go to it.

95
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.560
Actually not necessarily in the main many cities because I'm going to go to add new C++ class.

96
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.600
I'm going to show all classes.

97
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.770
I'm going to look for user widget as we've done a few times already.

98
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.100
Go to next.

99
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.530
I'm going to call this server row.

100
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:45.460
And I'm going to make sure it's in the right folder with the other menu system stuff.

101
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.640
Don't go in the right folder out.

102
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.650
Go ahead and create that class is going to compile it now or just wait for the compilation to finish

103
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.990
and when the compilation has finished we are going to create the blueprint.

104
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.000
Child of this class.

105
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.150
Okay.

106
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.310
The cervero has successfully compiled.

107
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.200
Let's go up to our content browser route and from the content browser route we're going to go to the

108
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:17.250
menu system and we're going to add in a new widget blueprint he is so and new then we're going to look

109
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:23.760
for which one is it user interface widget blueprint is going to prefix with WB P. And it's going to

110
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.180
be server row glass server row going to open up the server row.

111
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:38.000
I'm going to go to the graph class settings change the parent class to our server row parent class and

112
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.760
save and compile that moscona Save the main menu hasn't been saved at the moment or compiled.

113
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.560
It's giving us actually an error about the IP address field which is fine because we haven't removed

114
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.800
that from the C++ yet.

115
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.760
We'll do that in just a second.

116
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.420
So we've got ourselves a server row now.

117
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.590
And with this novarro I just want to let's make sure it's much smaller here.

118
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.370
Like so and we are going to add in is not a canvas panel.

119
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.290
We don't want it to be a canvas panel at this stage.

120
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.950
Instead let's put in a see a horizontal box.

121
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.750
Horizontal box should do the trick.

122
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.500
I'm going to stick that.

123
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.790
I don't want it under the canvas panel it's right click on the canvas panel.

124
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.620
Replace with horizontal box.

125
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.150
There you go.

126
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.030
That's what we want.

127
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.960
We've got our horas on the box and another horizontal box only two of them.

128
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:43.450
And in this horizontal box I'm just going to put for now a text component so let's find the go to the

129
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.620
panel go to that text and add that under the horizontal box.

130
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:56.370
And this is looking very small but as we know it is just probably trying to look like the whole page.

131
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.130
In fact we might be able to change.

132
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:07.500
Desired on screen change the field size of this screen because it's just a small widget.

133
00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.720
We don't want it to be the full screen size.

134
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.980
So in the top right we go to Phil's size.

135
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:12.630
We can try.

136
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.380
Desired.

137
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.130
There we go.

138
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:23.560
That's going to now put it at the size that we have basically put in the amount of space taken up by

139
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.250
the widget.

140
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.520
So it's going to say text block at the moment.

141
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:31.050
I'm going to say change text block to serve a name.

142
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.540
Like so.

143
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.440
And I will change the text in text block to my.

144
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.250
Server.

145
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.640
Like so.

146
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.530
So fairly straightforward you could have done this with the text block but obviously this is going to

147
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.520
give us a lot more flexibility over the row formatting than we would have had otherwise.

148
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.790
So we've got that got the server row.

149
00:09:53.970 --> 00:10:00.570
We now have a problem with that IP address in the C++ So let's go over in to your visual studio find

150
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.940
our main menu.

151
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:07.510
Dot H and find the line it was complaining about which is the IP address field.

152
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:14.610
A You add a spool text box I want to change that over to actually be that scroll box that we've replaced

153
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:20.570
it with which we know to be a child of you panel widget and the API that we're wanting to use is actually

154
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.620
the you panel widget API.

155
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:31.800
So Im going to be using a U panel widget pointer and it is going to be called not the IP address field

156
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.020
but rather the server list.

157
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.730
Let's check that we can rename the scroll box to the server list.

158
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.700
Just to bind things across and we'll call the IP address the server list.

159
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.000
MIKE So let it let it build.

160
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.630
It's going to fail I assume because something in the C plus plus is going to have wanted that server

161
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.350
list to be around so we can also check that.

162
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.700
MYERS it IP address field.

163
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.650
Yes it's got that in Join server.

164
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.410
So for now what we can do is we can comment this out and we can make sure that we're going to make this

165
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.190
work in the future.

166
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.170
With an new server list at the moment it doesn't make sense.

167
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.500
So let's go ahead and select this and commented out because we know it's going to fail.

168
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.110
Caricatural see your control See control care.

169
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.860
Not entirely sure.

170
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.580
I can always remember this one.

171
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.900
You never forget the short cuts then are you can obviously go and find it in the menu instead.

172
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.950
In this case it's under the edit menu I believe.

173
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:45.170
And then if we go to advanced there is commenting on comments section so that should be control K control

174
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.510
see or is matched to get these things control cake drop See they go we've commented it out that's go

175
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.350
ahead and build.

176
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.840
See if there's any other instances of IP address it looks like those are the only ones for now.

177
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.960
So we should be okay with the build.

178
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.830
Yes indeedy it did work.

179
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:06.820
Let's go over to our blueprint and make sure it compiles Yes it does it's able to find the cervalis

180
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:12.560
which I'm happy about that means it's time for us to construct this widget.

181
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:19.940
Now if you have forgotten how to construct said widget then the clue is in our main menu not in our

182
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:25.040
main menu Sorry but in and game instance p p where we should be constructing a widget.

183
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.550
Let's see if we can find that.

184
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:37.510
So here it is in load menu widget and in load many widget we can see that there we are using this create

185
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.710
widget.

186
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.120
Function with the.

187
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:51.320
You may menace the type and then we are adding this this menu class that menu class is declared at the

188
00:12:51.320 --> 00:13:01.520
top by our find F Class finder so we can go ahead and create an F Class finder going to do this in Maine

189
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.360
many see p which is where we want to be creating this.

190
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.370
So I'm going to go ahead and do it just before all our binding in fact we don't have a constructor here

191
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.850
at all.

192
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:18.440
So let's create first the constructor which is going to return nothing doesn't even have a void with

193
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.790
a constructer main menu.

194
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:30.020
On calon you main menu and it is going to I don't think it has to take any arguments let's leave the

195
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.400
arguments out of the picture for now.

196
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.860
It is complaining that we have.

197
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.840
Now the reason this doesn't work is because we need our f object to initialize it like we've got over

198
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.530
in the game instance C++.

199
00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:51.560
So let's get that initializer taken over over here and this still ain't going to work because we want

200
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.330
to actually declare this.

201
00:13:55.010 --> 00:14:00.450
Constructer somewhere in our main menu.

202
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.510
So actually let's have a look at what it is in the superclass.

203
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.030
I assume it's going to be public.

204
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.980
So actually I just put it in public.

205
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:15.870
So go to the head and we are going to look for public section much of which we don't actually have one

206
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.660
at the moment is all private.

207
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.240
So we're going to create a public section at the top.

208
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.240
Call it so call it public.

209
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.180
And then we are going to paste in our constructor.

210
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.160
We're going to remove the name space.

211
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.350
Like so.

212
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.700
And that should do us just fine.

213
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.520
Okay so we're going to in this constructer.

214
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:45.550
Copy over our class finder jargons set up stuff and stick it in.

215
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.510
Stick it in to our C++.

216
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:57.060
Go and we're going to rename the class that we're looking for because of this we're not looking for

217
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.110
the main menu here we are looking for.

218
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.230
We serve.

219
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:06.790
What do you call it sever row and it is going to be a you use a widget.

220
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.410
Menu BP class.

221
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.640
Nope.

222
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.760
That's going to be the server row BP class.

223
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.630
And we can take that and copy and paste it elsewhere.

224
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.580
In two other uses which is is this of it.

225
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:29.920
And we've got our construct to help us namespace which isn't included So let's get that from the s.p.

226
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.070
as well.

227
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.980
Got the constructor.

228
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:41.680
Help us go back to the key and stick it in there and just put it between the main menu include and these

229
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:48.730
other components that we are including Okay so that should be okay now and menu class is what we're

230
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.990
trying to save it as.

231
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.440
Nope.

232
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:57.940
We want to go to a head a file of game instance so the puzzle platform game instance each find that

233
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.700
menu class copy it go back over to the head of the main menu.

234
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:10.780
And in here we are going to have a private property that is the T subclass of and is not going to be

235
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.310
the main menu class but B server row class.

236
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:24.350
And it's still a sub class of the you use a widget so we can take that we can set it in our constructor

237
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.450
and all that is.

238
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:32.880
Well now we can go ahead and construct a widget of that type I'm actually going to do it in Join server

239
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.490
because we've got a button currently not doing anything.

240
00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.880
And that's where I would like to be able to hit the button and have it create a new widget.

241
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:47.220
So let's go to the C plus plus of the game instance again and find its widget creation code I think

242
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.540
it's the host server or something.

243
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.420
No I think it must be in load menu there it is we've got this create widget We're checking it's and

244
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.080
narmer doing a set up we don't need to do a set up in our case.

245
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.570
So let's go over to the C++ of the main menu again.

246
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:10.050
Paste in that create widget stuff and it is going to be let's see it we're going to be creating the

247
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:19.740
widget of the server row class type and the actual type that we're going for is not going to be a new

248
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.660
main menu at the moment we don't actually need it to be the server row.

249
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:30.090
But let's think about let's think ahead a little bit it's going to be a you server row and that server

250
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.110
doesn't exist yet because we haven't included it so let's include it.

251
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.650
I'm going to add the Include at the bottom of all the platform or the engine includes that we've got

252
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.560
it's going to be including the server.

253
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.330
H That should help us out a little bit there.

254
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.510
And we're going to save it in to a variable doesn't need to be a menu in this case it can just be a

255
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:54.620
temporary you serve a row variable which is just in this join server.

256
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.640
So it's going to serve a row.

257
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:04.410
It's going to sort of call it Roe but remembering to use upper case upper camel case for visual studio

258
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.230
for unreal.

259
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:12.230
I mean and then create which is complaining about is there anything we need to do to include that.

260
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:20.680
No it's actually talking about a different error if I hover over it is saying argument types are not

261
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.470
really matching basically it want to create widget if we look at the definition of create widget to

262
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:33.070
either take a new world a game instance or a play a controller so we can get hold of the world from

263
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.230
this object so let's do that.

264
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.560
We don't do it this arrow and let's see if we've got a get world.

265
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.470
Yes we do have a get world.

266
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.350
We do want to make sure that this is not null of course.

267
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:53.390
So we're going to do a new world world equals this world and we're going to do it.

268
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.030
Sure.

269
00:18:54.030 --> 00:19:01.810
In here just to make sure that the world is not not a pointer and will return if it is.

270
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:11.370
And then we can use this world in our create which be then ensuring that the Roe is not null rather

271
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:18.960
than the menu and then then we can do that what wed been hoping to do which is to add it to the serve

272
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:19.400
list.

273
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:24.460
So weve got our server list object and we can do an add child.

274
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:30.190
And with that child we can add in the new widget which is going to be a row.

275
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:37.140
Like so the row that we just created and lets see if that builds and if it doesnt build Why not.

276
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.890
Just a couple of simple errors.

277
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:45.230
The point is around world world should be a pointer not just you world.

278
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:50.810
Same goes for the cervero you are probably noticing these errors as I was typing them let's go ahead

279
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.420
and build it and test it.

280
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.020
So that's a successful bill.

281
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.760
Let's go over in that to unreel and hit play.

282
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.030
Go to join menu and hit join.

283
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.120
And every time I hit join you can see it is adding one of our server elements to the list congratulations.

284
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.050
Pat yourself on the back.

285
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:13.730
Hopefully quite long but hopefully it was all mostly revision So you managed to bear with me and I'll

286
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.030
see you in the next lecture are we actually going to populating this with useful stuff.
