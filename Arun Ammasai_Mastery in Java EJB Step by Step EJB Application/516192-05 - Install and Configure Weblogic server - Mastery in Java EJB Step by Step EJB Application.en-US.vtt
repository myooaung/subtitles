00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.895
So the first thing which we need to do a download WebLogic server.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:10.290
So let's go to your browser and search for down or WebLogic server.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.150
It will take us to the oracle.com where we can download the packages.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.105
So basically when you enter this page,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.955
you a quick install it for Mac warriors,

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:24.345
Windows and Linux, because it is going to be a JAR file.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.480
So we're going to execute the JAR file to install a regular server.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.780
So it's going to be common for Mac, Windows, or Linux.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.375
It doesn't matter which operate instruments you're using.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:34.950
So first thing which we need to do,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.835
just accept and download it.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:41.345
It might ask you to login.

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:42.785
So it has two.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:44.480
Yeah, it is asking me login.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.880
So you need to have the username,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.305
password and Oracle account.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:50.060
So I'm going to use my article accounts.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.095
I'm going to pass it for now.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:54.870
I'm going to increment condition and then I will open the page.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.670
I just provided my username and password.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.870
So it is downloading the zip file,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.950
which contains the jar file,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.200
so where we can save it, Let's create a folder and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.590
the desktop like we have a folder, Salter folder, right?

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.930
So we have a folder called soft and my desktop.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.175
So I'm going to say we didn't know software folder and save it.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:17.825
So it might take off.

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:22.925
It's already downloaded. So let's go back and show in Finder. Then.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:24.710
So first thing which we need to do,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.110
extract the zip file.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.925
Just double-click it automatically extract it and it will give you the jar file.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:36.545
So this is a location where we're going to install our WebLogic location.

00:01:36.545 --> 00:01:38.780
So I'm using my desktop because I already

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.720
have the WebLogic server installed in my different location.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.395
Just to show you, I'm going to create a clean dislocation and then

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:49.295
I'll tell you how to create a domain from it, right?

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:52.025
So first thing we need to know, Let's go back.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:55.040
So this is a desktop and this is a software folder.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.130
And we need to open the software folder in the command prompt.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.710
If you're using Windows, you can use the command prompt.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.900
If you're using Mac, you need to use the terminal.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.425
So new terminal.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:09.020
So I just open my terminal here.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.880
And then first thing what we need to do,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.220
check what the Java version is available.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.415
So make sure you have a Java 8 version or a bot.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:21.215
So it should be comfortable to using the logic circuit while c.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:25.880
So now we need to execute the Java JAR file using Java,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.250
iPhone, job and space NU in and to provide the JAR file.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.945
And what are the JAR file name?

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:37.715
Let's coincide f m w, That's the jar failure.

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:40.715
So f m w,

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:47.360
quick generating that jar file.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.460
So this is JAR file, we're going to execute it.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.060
Just press Enter it automatically,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.680
setting it's a common prompt so you will not getting

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.120
any fancy dialogue box where we can choose Next,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.365
Next, Next and greater domain.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:06.755
It will not happen in this way because it's just a quick installer.

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:11.555
It will automatically run some commands and it'll execute

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:18.305
and create a folder in this particular desktop location C WALS one double for 11.

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:22.190
So for now it is copying the files and then it might take a while,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.240
so I'm going to pass it now.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.240
So once the process then I'm going to start it again.
