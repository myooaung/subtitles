00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.215
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.215 --> 00:00:03.405
Welcome back to simply talking about

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:07.410
how the stateless bean looks like and how the state for beans looks like.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.090
It's not a big deal,

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.650
but we need to see it, right?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.030
So as I mentioned earlier,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.070
stateless it does not have any state,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.455
which means you don't have any data in it.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.045
So what do you mean by the data?

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:21.075
Think of it this UNAIDS all about the client and communication,

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:23.579
client and the server communication.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.300
So when a client request, if it is a stateless,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.880
it does not contain any user information,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.779
their body, a state.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.825
That is what we're talking about has that data is not accurate database data.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:37.955
So what do you mean misstate full then?

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:42.560
So which means it has some inputs from the client perspective.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.820
So which holds some information.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.550
For example, if you're creating an ADA but application you can

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.625
provide how long that particular session,

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:50.840
our particular has been,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.925
has to be alive.

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:54.125
Right?

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.225
So let me create a simple,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:57.605
I'm not going to execute it.

00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:02.255
Let's create a simple beam here to show you how it looks like.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:08.150
So here what I'm gonna do is let's create another being here under the beans folder,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:16.130
create a new session when so I'm going to simply name it ASA stateful,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.030
sorry, stateful session bin.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.290
And next and the map.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.660
And um, anyway, I'm not going to execute this exam because

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.825
executing it's pretty much the same as a stateless and stateful.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.820
So I'm gone on, does anything if you want,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.740
you can create it, not a problem.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.655
So now I have a state, okay?

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:44.210
So stateful, okay, so I should have mentioned state full.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.715
Anyway, it's not a problem. We can modify it here.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:54.665
State. So, okay, so this is a stateful EGP.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:57.680
What do you mean by stateful contains the user information,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.985
as I mentioned earlier.

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.145
So if it is a stateful,

00:02:01.145 --> 00:02:04.430
it can hold some information from the client,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.335
which means I can tell there's some annotation like stateful timeout here.

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:14.240
So what did the unit,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.160
so what, what do you mean by unit?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.595
So whether you are going to provide

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:24.560
that timeout in minutes or seconds are different unit.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.810
So I'm going to use time unit dot.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.145
And here you can see days,

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:30.110
hours, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.920
nanoseconds seconds does what I'm talking about ASA units anyway,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.500
we're going to talk about only the minutes here.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.249
So whenever this bean has been invoked,

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:45.605
it has to be active for one only maybe 20 minutes or ten minutes.

00:02:45.605 --> 00:02:47.885
So value is 20.

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:52.520
So just take a look at the previous mean and the current one,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.130
we have the state of a,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.465
b, and a to the stateful.

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:59.225
And it holds some data,

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:00.800
not only business logic,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.180
it holds the Someday TSL,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.180
which means the client is intimating

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.220
this particular bin has to be active only for 20 minutes.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.230
So that is the exact difference between stateful and stateless beans.
