00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.995
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:03.660
The first thing which we need to do,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.120
Let's create a JVM server.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.599
So first thing, let's log in into our server.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.670
So once logged on the server,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.070
the way how we can create a JSON server,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.750
either you can go to us,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.630
he says in the dashboard under the messaging,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.200
or else here, you can go to expand the syllabus and there you can find on messaging.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.750
So under messaging, we have a JSON server and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.450
modules and the parts are racism and much more.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.250
So first thing which we need to do,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.605
Let's create a GMS server.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:45.980
Okay, so we're going to work with the order management kind of stuff, right?

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.750
So I'm going to create a aij,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.120
my server with the name of our management team,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.505
a server. So new.

00:00:52.505 --> 00:01:02.070
And I'm going to name Odessa on an AMD JVM server.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.315
Okay, and then click Next.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.690
And we don't have to choose any persistent store.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.230
Let's keep it as a default.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.955
And then when the chooser target,

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.030
so in which, so what are you going to create a GMS?

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.595
So I'm going to create an admin server.

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:23.580
So click Admin Center and then click Finish.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.480
So once the j m sub l is greater than the next thing which we need to do,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.940
we have to create a J m and J must module and then we'll map that to a large GMS over.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.625
So the next thing, GMS modules,

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:40.280
click James models and click New.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.845
And there you can find the name here.

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:49.770
And let's name it as a Order Management James module.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.045
Okay, and click Next.

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:58.610
And here we need to choose a target server.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.825
Again, it's going to Maputo admin server and click Next.

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:07.050
And we don't need to choose this option for now, just click Finish.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.500
So we created a j m,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.740
and j must model the next thing which we need to do,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.165
we have to create a SAP deployment where we can group our targets into separate category.

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:26.330
So we just open the arm and let's go to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.400
the GMS module here and click

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.965
the order management games model which we created. Just know.

00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:33.740
And here go to the SAP deployments.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.110
And here you can create a new SAP deployment.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.039
And here I am going to say or management,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.420
I mean some deployment.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.450
Deployment and click Next.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.940
And let's enable them both.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.415
Servers and click Finish.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:59.270
So now we're going to the gym and silver and we credited James module and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.870
to the model we could add a sub deployment as well.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.210
So the next thing what we need to do,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.345
we have to create a data source,

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:10.460
not a data source, JVMs,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.355
connection factory and the q.

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:17.210
So let's create the DJ MS connection factor.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.650
Click Order Management.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.600
Okay, go to the Janus model and here we have our management GMS modelling. Click that.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.510
And here you can create click new.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.395
First thing we need to create a connection factory,

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.875
select, collection, factory and click Next.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:40.140
And here we're going to name it as a order management connection factory.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.870
And here j and m,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.010
This is the unique name we're going to map in our code or wherever we are trying

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.635
to provide our queue names or connection factor names.

00:03:54.635 --> 00:04:01.355
So I'm going to name that as a GMS James Glass, order management.

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:03.515
And we can name it like that,

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:09.439
order management connection factory.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:18.280
So then click Next and go for ad once targeting because we have d sub diploma, right?

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.975
So we can map it order management.

00:04:19.975 --> 00:04:22.300
So it automatically will marble in the admin server and

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.360
the order management Daemon Server. Then click Finish.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.340
So the only one thing is left,

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.590
which is creating a GMS.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.485
Q. So now I have a connection factory,

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:35.140
and I'm going to create a queue now.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.900
So now we're going to select the queue and click Next.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:47.830
And here we're going to name that ASA can order management and the JND name,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.375
and it's a unique name, so J MS flash order management.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.380
Q.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.170
Okay, So then click Next and choose the SAP deployment,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.480
which is a order management some deployment,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.130
and then click Finish.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.940
So now everything is finished.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.570
We created at the JMU subtler and subtler, we created a module.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.615
Inside the module we created a connection factory and the order management q.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.295
Okay, so now we have the Q.

00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:26.885
Let's open the Q here,

00:05:26.885 --> 00:05:29.285
and let's go to the monitoring tab here.

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:37.010
And here you can see the instance order management GMS module under the queue name.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.475
And so far, we don't have any messages here.

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:43.100
So whenever the message posted here,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.830
it will be consumed by our message driven

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.875
been so far now we are not going to write a message driven been.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:54.140
First, we will write a simple client to post a message to this particular Q.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.185
And then we'll come back and see whether the message receiver here.

00:05:57.185 --> 00:06:00.935
So if a distributor then we'll go and write our MD,

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:04.490
I mean the message driven bean and then will consume the method.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.870
I mean the message here.
