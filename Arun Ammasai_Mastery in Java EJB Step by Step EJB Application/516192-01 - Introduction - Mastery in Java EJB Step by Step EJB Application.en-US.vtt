00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.420
Hello everyone.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.795
Welcome back to this course in this NDA and goes,

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:12.540
we are going to discuss about the EGB.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.540
So what is EGP and why do we need them?

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.899
And what is the advantage of using an EGP?

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.485
Not only that, we're going to talk about what is JP and

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:26.700
how the EGP is walking along with JP.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.110
And then we'll talk about

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.970
some important database queries and how to configure an application server.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.825
It can be WebLogic server or it can be a Java server.

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:38.925
For a discourse perspective,

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.740
we're going to use our WebLogic.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.075
So what are we going to cover here?

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:48.619
We're going to talk about how you can use the Eclipse and how you can configure

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:53.705
your WebLogic server to view or Eclipse ID.

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:57.560
So the reason you don't have to go back to Laura and do

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.360
the manual deployment so we can directly deploy your application,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.160
which is an EGP application from your eclipse to a WebLogic as sour.
