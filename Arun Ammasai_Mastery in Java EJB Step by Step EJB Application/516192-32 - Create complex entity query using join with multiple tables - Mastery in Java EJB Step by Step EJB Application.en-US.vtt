00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.575
So let's try one more select operation.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:06.330
So, but this time we're going to try it.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.810
But because last time you tried to kind of accomplish complex correlate,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.050
this time we'll try one more level up.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.165
So let's try add three tables.

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:20.880
For example, if you take a look at the structure here, employees, customers, orders.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.255
So basically what I want to do is I want to fetch

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:30.285
all the orders done by a specific employee.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.360
So which means I need to combine my employee table along with

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.810
the customer and the customer to my orders.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.075
I need to link these three tables.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:44.765
First, let's write a simple SQL query.

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.900
So let's see what are the fields necessary from employees to customer.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.310
Employee number is the key.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.800
So in employee stabilise the employee number.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.835
In customers, it is a sales rep employee number.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:59.090
That is the connection from customer to order.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.515
Customer number is the key.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.885
So customer number is again the customer table,

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:05.975
but I think the same field in the orders as well.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:08.540
So let's try to create a query.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.805
And then we'll see how we are going to write them at that first thing.

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:18.890
Select star from trying to him. I'm enjoying here.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.275
Employees, AMP, c'mon.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:23.675
And what Alice customers, right?

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:28.025
Customers commands CUSD and the last name.

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.750
And the last one is orders.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:38.600
So right now the condition first thing we need to combine the employee and the customer,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.509
okay, first, I know an employee,

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.240
it is going to be employee number, right?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.400
So let's check the data once before we make medical gory.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.875
It's an employee number.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:56.525
So employee number, right.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.235
So employee number.

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:04.115
And what is the name of the customer driven SDI in sales of employee number, I guess.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.260
Let's verify it one more time.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.590
Customers and then run it on wounds.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.810
Yes, it is sales per employee number.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.575
So cos dot sales,

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:23.940
rep, employee and number.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.875
And the last condition meaning to combine the customer and the order.

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.280
So the common field is customer number rates.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.025
So this is a customer number, okay?

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:46.085
So CUSD dot customer number

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:50.180
is a quilt and then audio rate.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.085
So OD or customer number.

00:02:55.085 --> 00:03:03.030
And AMP dot any employee number.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.660
Employee number is equal to solid.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.450
Check the employees table once.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.910
And we'll finish the appropriate data.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.680
And here we have a lot of employers rates.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.600
Let's get some sales rep.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.070
So let's pick Okay,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.990
let's pick one to 160 button.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.265
Okay. So employee number 12, 16.

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.855
And let's see how many.

00:03:37.855 --> 00:03:40.090
I want only the order information.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.490
So ODR dot star.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.710
Now let's execute the Caribbeans,

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.150
the Hominidae Carter economic tree.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.200
Okay, so now we've got the outcome.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.300
So totally 8000 cards.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.865
So which means by this employee,

00:03:54.865 --> 00:04:00.295
there are 18 artist has been placed on processed.

00:04:00.295 --> 00:04:01.810
So now what do we need to do?

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.415
We know how to do that in SQL query now we need to convert this into Egypt BigQuery.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.055
Okay, let's do that.

00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:19.445
So select only our space and from the first table,

00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:25.055
employee, employee, EMP, take a look at it.

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:29.135
This is the employee, It's not employees because the object is the same employee.

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:33.605
If you take a look at the employer Java employees a DD name,

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:35.945
right? I mean the entity name.

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:38.750
But it associated with the table m implies

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.060
win because when we're trying to create a new student that

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.685
is a no annotation for table read because the table name and the class name are same.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:50.495
Since it is a different year and we have the notation here.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:53.390
So a employees, let's go back.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.150
And then so employee and Northern next one,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.845
customer customer and gas,

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:03.965
and then the other one order space.

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:05.240
Oh, the R.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.950
So now what do we need to do?

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.840
We need to combine all these tables,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.595
all join all these tables.

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:12.785
Okay, so EMP dot,

00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:18.725
so that is very evident one so employee dot, employee number PLC.

00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:23.270
And let's go back to our query and employee number is equal,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.445
which is coming from customer dot.

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:27.200
And what is the customer?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.585
Let's open the customer entity.

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:31.744
Customer.

00:05:31.744 --> 00:05:34.085
So customer dot employee, right?

00:05:34.085 --> 00:05:36.740
So here, customer at employ many to one join.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.390
So this is the employee, employee.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.620
Employee and the employee number from the employee table.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.835
Okay?

00:05:46.835 --> 00:05:48.950
So the first condition is done.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.825
So next, the second condition,

00:05:50.825 --> 00:05:54.740
combining the customers and the orders, right?

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.030
So CUSD dot, what is the customer ID here?

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.450
Let's go back to customer and yes,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.935
this is a customer number.

00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:06.770
Copy this and go back to our query.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.830
And customer dot customer number is equal to

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.235
and we have recheck the same in Lee order details as well.

00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:16.500
So let's open the order.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.540
Order dot Java and here,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.985
list of a customer.

00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:28.550
So customer dot customer ID to see, go back.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.550
Customer. And the customer number,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.560
we know that it is customer number.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.220
I'm sorry.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.890
Say customer customer number.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:47.660
And the final condition, employee rights.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.175
So EMP dot what does the employee code which you're going to use the employee number it.

00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:58.230
So employee number, EMP,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.765
employee number.

00:07:02.765 --> 00:07:04.520
Okay, so this information will,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.500
for this particular EMP number,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.960
the input is coming from the augmented.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.820
So now the query is ready.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.365
Now we need to validate that.

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:17.015
So what we can do is go back to our bean and create a new method.

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:20.465
So first let's go to the bean or remote where you can create a method.

00:07:20.465 --> 00:07:21.665
And here what I'm gonna do,

00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:24.875
I'm gonna get a list of orders, right?

00:07:24.875 --> 00:07:32.820
Let's stop order space and get orders by EMP, employee.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.925
Employee.

00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:40.130
And the input is going to be so in employee, what do we are passing?

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.330
We are passing employee number.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.515
I do just an integer field.

00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:49.130
So it is going to be int employee number.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.245
And save it.

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:54.060
So let's import the order.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.720
Okay, The moment we saved,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.490
we'll get an error message in the management

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.170
when because we need to implement the method,

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:08.015
right? Add unimplemented method.

00:08:08.015 --> 00:08:09.245
Let's go down here.

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:12.500
Okay, So let's generate the first query.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.830
So e m dot create,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:25.255
Wiley, sorry, Create Query and whenever the past according here.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.120
Okay, So what I wanna do, okay,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.160
so what is according to China to paste it

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.770
here because we already manipulated the correlate.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:39.715
So just copy and go to our being and paste it here.

00:08:39.715 --> 00:08:42.760
Okay, so now we have everything in place,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.715
now we have the query ready with us.

00:08:45.715 --> 00:08:47.470
It's the next thing we're gonna do.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.100
This.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.690
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:51.430
let's make it much clear.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.420
So I'm going to create a variable query dot.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.219
So this is going to be query.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.990
Okay, so now we have the information.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.420
So the next thing which we need to do is we have to pass

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.015
the parameter because when deposit employee number rate.

00:09:07.015 --> 00:09:11.710
So that way we can do that query set.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.665
You can do it in a single in are you going to eat in multiple?

00:09:13.665 --> 00:09:15.610
And that's not a big problem.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.635
So here I'm going to pass the parameter.

00:09:17.635 --> 00:09:20.650
So the name, I'm going to pass this employee number e,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.140
and that is what do I pass in the query.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.430
So employee number and copy the input from here and put it here.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.515
Control V.

00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:32.260
Okay, so now we have everything ready.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.445
So we have the query.

00:09:33.445 --> 00:09:35.905
So all we need to do just to execute the query,

00:09:35.905 --> 00:09:39.580
query dot, get our result list.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.465
That's all.

00:09:40.465 --> 00:09:45.920
So now we have I created a matter which will bring the records based on the employee.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.270
It will give the orders.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.890
So next thing which we need to do,

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.100
it's very deliberate, will deploy automatically.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.725
Okay, So let's save it.

00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:56.420
Save all.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:02.525
Okay, so the planet is got picked and an applied been published successfully, 1010.

00:10:02.525 --> 00:10:03.785
Okay, now understand.

00:10:03.785 --> 00:10:05.885
So let's go back to order management is,

00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:07.985
and then what I'm gonna do as usual,

00:10:07.985 --> 00:10:11.015
comment out the previous one which we tried.

00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:18.560
And then what we're gonna do is look up dot get odd us by employee, right?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.570
And we'll pass them 12,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.730
16 rates on day one to two, the past.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:27.890
And then what we're gonna do is create that data out of it.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.400
Sorry. So orders.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.420
Okay, so you may be thinking will be,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.940
will we be able to print the orders now we want,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.820
because we need to implement the toString method

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.150
or we can only see the objects in the console output.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:51.204
So let's import the toString method and generate.

00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:53.110
So just save it.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.395
So it will automatically get built and deployed.

00:10:56.395 --> 00:10:59.350
Okay, distinct and a deployment is done.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.450
Let's go back to them blind.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.190
So now we have everything ready.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.525
All we need to do is just print the orders.

00:11:06.525 --> 00:11:13.130
For each order is not

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:23.120
sewerage system dot out dot print LN.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.670
Okay, So now everything's really lit a render file as a Java application.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.505
So we'll see the outcome in the console.

00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:32.990
Let's go back.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.840
So we are supposed to get how many results?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.250
18 rates.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.040
So we need to get these 18 information in the console.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.890
See now, we've got all the information,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.960
which means if you count it will be 18.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:52.325
So we'll have the order number and comment order date and all the relevant information's.

00:11:52.325 --> 00:11:52.940
Right.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.010
So everything that we are available here.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:58.175
So this is how we make use of create query.

00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:02.630
Okay, so now we know how to create a named query and how to create

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.790
a more mercury and how to use a native query and how to create some complex queries.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.470
So in the next example,

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.880
what we want to do is let's try do some credit, okay, credit process.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.720
So select, update and delete, right?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.120
We already tried multiple select methods, right?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.880
So in the next example, we will try to update something, right?
