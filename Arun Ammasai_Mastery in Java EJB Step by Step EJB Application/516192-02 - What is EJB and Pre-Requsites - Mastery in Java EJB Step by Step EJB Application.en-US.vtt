00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.325
Welcome back.

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.655
So what are the first thing which you cannot discuss today?

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.120
So first we need to understand what is an AGB, okay,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
so EGP stands for Enterprise Java B.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.285
And what is the purpose of it?

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:21.810
What can we do something else like springboard and hibernating everything,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.195
purpose, similar kind of approach, right?

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.565
But what is the advantage of using the EGP?

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:30.180
So basically, whenever you are trying to use an EGP,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.300
It's an architectural for a building.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.940
Here, a highly scalable and strong enterprise-level application.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.005
You can simply say you can delve deeper into end application with EGP,

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.270
which means you can have the client and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.365
communication and you have the interaction with the database.

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:54.050
And you'll get the request and you will process the request based on the input.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.570
And we have a load balancer.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.750
So the container will take care of the load balancer,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.810
how we can serve multiple request.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.205
And not only that,

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:10.565
it can be deployed on Java application servers like WebLogic,

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:14.255
gibbous, and we have a lot of different servers available in the market.

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.880
And for this tutorial,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.950
are we going to use a WebLogic?

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.880
And we're going to discuss a lot of new things about EGP 3, okay,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.120
so we're not going to talk about a AJ pi2 times 0 anymore

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.110
because we have 3 which contents?

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.140
Lot of new functionalities and annotations to be as simple,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.715
Egypt with 3 makes development easy when it's compared to ADP to 0.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:49.610
So before we start the course,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.905
what are the important prerequisite site which is required for each and every one of you.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:59.765
So you all need just a basic programming knowledge in Java.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.290
And you need to know about any ID.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.300
It doesn't matter which idea using.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.530
For this course purpose,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.880
we are going to use the Eclipse.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.490
You can use Eclipse or you can use NetBeans,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.275
or you can use Intel J,

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:15.110
the ID different is up to you.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.190
And if you have a basic understanding of what are

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.215
some other technologies like a database and application servers, it will be good.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:25.880
But even if you don't,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.985
don't worry about that, we will.

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:32.360
How a simple our simple discussion

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.905
about how we can use the database and how the application server is working,

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:39.470
and how we can configure the application servers.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.080
So we'll spend some time over there and then we'll move on

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.660
to our Application Development.
