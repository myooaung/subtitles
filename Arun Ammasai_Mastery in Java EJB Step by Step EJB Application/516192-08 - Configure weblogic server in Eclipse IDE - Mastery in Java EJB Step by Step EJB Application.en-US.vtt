00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.765
So as I mentioned earlier,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.260
now we have the amines ready.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.580
So next thing what we need to do is we have to configure a server.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.680
So when you have a concern or what it can do,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.865
you can create some methods here and you can deploy it and you can test it out.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.605
That is a first step, correct?

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:23.310
So here under the server I'm going to click there is no service as of now.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.180
And I'm gonna create a new server because we know that we created a domain.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.680
And most important thing,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.045
as I mentioned earlier,

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.500
we just created one,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.210
our domain, our desktop folder.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.920
Correct? And under the use of project,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.615
we have the domains and here we have the base domain.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:45.035
So I'm not going to use this domain because the Zavala on the desktop.

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:48.110
So I'll delete it after some point of time.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.110
So what we're gonna do, don't worry about that I created as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.990
same way in a different location.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.710
So under My Drive we have a WALS server.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.925
And here if you take a look at it,

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.850
it's pretty much the same WALS one for w1.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.560
And inside we have a USA project.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.090
So I have a domains here.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.930
Here the domain name is w, ls and the scrotum.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.030
And so this is a domain which you're going to configure.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.235
So let's see how we can do that.

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.340
Right-click and create a new server here.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.890
And we're not going to use a J Boss, right?

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.690
So we're going to use the Oracle WebLogic.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.420
So go to the article and click

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.820
Oracle DB logic server and then click Next. It might take a second.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.845
And click Next.

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:34.115
And we have to provide the WebLogic home.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:37.834
The sorrow has been installed,

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:45.185
so it is available in our my user folder,

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:48.320
WNS and WALS 14 WO N'T.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.980
And this is where we have the WALL-E server and open it.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.640
So it will choose the WebLogic home at the same time,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.910
a dual fish, what is a JDK?

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.265
So we are using JDK 1.8 and then we're going to click Next.

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:10.145
And so here we need to provide a domain at data tree.

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.309
So in the previous step I used,

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.220
I mentioned VAT is the WebLogic server installed.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.465
So in my WebLogic server,

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:18.845
I might have multiple domains,

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:20.420
each domain I'm trying to use it.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.690
So you can use this option and daddy can browse

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.080
it or when because the blood isn't already configured, right?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.830
So which means it can fetch all the existing domains.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.720
So we have the WLS domain, right?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.000
So let's choose the WALS domain here.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.790
So next thing, Let's click this button.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.570
Enabled this one because always start out with blood and settler in debug mode.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.955
The reason why I'm doing that,

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:51.875
that might be possibility,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:53.375
something might get strong.

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.100
So again, what do you need to do?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.990
You need to go back to this server name to change

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.645
the configuration into logging level to debug.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.490
So to avoid that, Let's anyway,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.080
we are doing some development purpose, right?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.300
So for us, we can keep it in a debug mode,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.440
but when you're going into production,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.085
we need to make sure the DBA has been changed to a normal info.

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.540
And click Next.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.410
And let's name our server,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.690
maybe WALS and the sql Server.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.520
And click Next.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.435
And this is the application I'm going to use.

00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:30.710
So let's add this.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.840
So the moment you configure here,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.490
so whenever you're trying to run the application,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.020
we can directly allow our Eclipse to deploy into over WebLogic salary itself.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.030
And next, and we can finish it.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.785
We don't have to go for the next steps.

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:45.630
We can data to either finish here.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.360
Okay? So now we have our web server is installed here,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.705
and for now, I don't have any issues.

00:03:56.705 --> 00:03:59.015
I can clearly mapped our website, et cetera,

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:02.870
because the appraisal which we installed is the 14 version.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.425
When you are trying in your day clips eight might give you an error because

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:10.205
our normal eclipse will not support to that particular server.

00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:11.195
So what do you need to do?

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:12.920
I'll give you some URL.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.825
So what you can do is just go to this blog and here we have they have a proper details.

00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:20.465
I followed this whenever when I got that issue.

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:25.100
So basically what do you need to do is just follow the steps.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.645
So install new software and use this particular repository location.

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:34.235
And it will allow you to install the advanced version.

00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:38.720
It will allow you to configure the advanced versions of Oracle in sovereign nation.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.040
So here.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.950
And then you know, you don't know how to choose all of them.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.990
Just choose all the tools here.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.305
So, and then restart your ID.

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:53.570
And then the same thing,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.980
go to this arrow to create new server and everything work perfectly.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.040
So you need to do this just in case if

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.205
you're facing any issues when you're trying to create,

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:08.070
when you try to map a server in your Eclipse.
