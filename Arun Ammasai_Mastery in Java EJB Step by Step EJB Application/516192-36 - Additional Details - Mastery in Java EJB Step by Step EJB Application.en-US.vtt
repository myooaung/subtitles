00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.520
So we covered all the essential details which we required to learn about EGB.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.925
And there are other additional things that you need to be focused

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:15.615
on if you're going proceed forward to the EGP.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.010
So you need to our app,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.420
what is the GPA n,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.145
What is the Hibernate end?

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.110
And as I mentioned, AAP, okay,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.570
So all of them are a different kind of frameworks,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.254
but all of them are using their own query language.

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:28.950
Like in a hybrid mode, we're,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.470
we're calling the method hibernate query language.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.440
Since there isn't a GOP we are calling ease UP query language.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.519
And in all the different frameworks,

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.910
we should be able to write a query based on our object,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.980
how we written in the EGP Curry.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.755
At the same time, you can write your own SQL.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:47.405
Sql.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:52.250
So which means all the framework they will support RGB query at the same time,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.365
they will support the natives Cody aswell.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.870
In ADP we are calling as native code

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.660
you write and but if you're going for a minute, I think it is.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.565
I'll create SQL query.

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:05.330
That is a method which unit to use when you're passing your native code, isn't it?

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.115
Right, and add another thing,

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.260
AGB star is whatever we try to write.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.440
So this can be exposed and have epsilon is the aswell.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.905
So if you want to know more about age of Web Services,

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:17.705
just go back and sum,

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:19.820
read some article because the reason why we're

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.655
uncovering how covering in this particular course,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:24.695
it did this is indicated for to learn about

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:28.550
EGP containers and entities and how we can use entities and Egypt,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.930
good language and everything.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.635
Okay?

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:32.780
So because if you know all of these things,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.290
you should be able to understand how it can we expose it as a GP said,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.340
was it's pretty easy.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.645
It won't take much time.

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:40.115
And not only that,

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:41.960
we're writing an EGP services, right.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.775
So which means you how to write your own exception handling, specific exception handling.

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:48.500
Because whenever you write an application,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.735
it's our responsibility to write to

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.650
our explicit exception handling for our application perspective.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.665
The same thing can be handled two in Egypt.

00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:04.430
So and also Egypt become dinner supports some AML Exception Handling SQL.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.840
And apart from that,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.545
there are few things you need to be aware of it and additions.

00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:15.455
And what is JND a binding and callbacks and timer services.

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:19.895
So these are all we covered in this particular course so far.

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:26.255
And I think we should be good to go from this point.

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:28.775
So if you have any questions,

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:33.470
don't hesitate to ping me and send me a message over any communicator.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.360
I can add a response back to you guys as soon as possible. Thank you so much.
