00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:06.540
So we need to understand what is the advantage of using Egypt.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.520
Yes. So it's a simple implementation of a large end-to-end application.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.460
As I mentioned in the beginning.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.360
This Egypt, which is going to use for creating

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.640
a large enterprise-level application that is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.305
where this particular terminology called as the Enterprise Java bean.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:28.965
And not only that, there is some other advantages as well.

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.855
So when we are using the EGP,

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:34.260
the container provides most of this system level services.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.410
So like how to handle the transaction and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.560
how to hand the longings and how to load balancing.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.350
Because when you serve multiple I request at the same time and how it

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.700
can be balancing their request based on the demand,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.725
and how the persistence is working,

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:53.425
and how we can draw the exception handling.

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:57.745
So enormous and RAV how to write a separate code for each and everything.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:02.155
But in Asia, but we can use annotations to handle these things.

00:01:02.155 --> 00:01:03.340
So as a developer,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.430
all we need to do is just focus on the implementation of your business logic.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.490
And not only that, the EGP containers,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.010
they will manage the lifecycle of your instances or objects.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.060
So developer need not to worry about when to create R1,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.450
to delete the objects.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.875
And next thing, how we're going to create a project.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.870
So we're, as I mentioned earlier,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.360
we are going to use Eclipse and we're going to create a project using math.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.594
And so we don't have to mapping the jazz manually.

00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:44.765
And then we're going to configure our application server.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.585
And then we will create an EGP.

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:50.015
So the way, how are we going to proceed from here?

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:52.715
Let's create an application server.

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:55.130
The reason why I'm starting with application server,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.960
because those application server we need to provide when we're creating an EAB project.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.954
So let's create a server.

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:04.175
And then we'll create a project,

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.920
and then we'll map the server into the project.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.585
An hour I tried to deploy,

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:14.435
I can directly use our Eclipse to deploy your EGP application into a WebLogic server.

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:15.980
So in the next video,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.920
we're gonna talk about how we can configure the application server,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.570
which is a WebLogic.
