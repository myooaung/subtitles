00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.950
So the first thing, we are going to create a new project,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.810
and we're going to create a map and project that's greater than one project.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.025
So my one project.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.690
And before we select,

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.450
choosing the dependency, we need to choose

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.815
a proper archetype because we need the Java EGP support, right?

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.810
So I'm not going to click this one because

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.045
if you click this box, you know what will happen.

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:33.845
It will escape this election it to that limb onto the dependency sections.

00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:37.490
So let's select our own pocket up here.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.840
So basically what I'm trying to do here,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.240
I'm trying to search for EGP here so that a lot of different catalogs are available.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.250
So the one which we are looking for,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.125
there are a lot of different types available.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.060
It's up to you which one you're gonna choose.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.295
So I'm going to use this one,

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.725
EGP, Java EE 7.

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:58.020
So click Next.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.090
So as into some Maven project,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.570
we need to provide D, the group ID and the artifact ID.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.580
So we're gonna employ the group ID as this project.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.370
We're going to deal with some order management application.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.675
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create one dot order management and I'm going to

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:29.300
name it has a and b order management.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.385
And then so what is our default package is going to be order management.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.725
Let's keep it simple.

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:39.870
Order management.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.970
Okay, So then we will select Finish.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.350
It will create a project and we'll have the POM file.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.760
We all know that POM file,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.160
which contains all the dependency for now,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.650
we are not going to modify anything.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.650
We will add the dependent is later based on

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.270
the required information because we're going to go a step by step, right?

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.740
So let's talk about as simple EGP and Dan will go for some additional add-ons concept

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.765
like JPA and how to deal with the database, everything, right?

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:18.050
So now we have the project are ready.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.940
So let's try to create a simple Hello class are as simple beam.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.060
So how we can do that? Just right-click.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.550
And we aren't going to create

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.620
any message driven been because we're not going to deal with

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.480
NIGMS funnel for out for now we'll quit simple as session beam.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.630
And I'm going to name as well packaged, right?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.360
So com dot Order

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.890
Management, dot bin, right?

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.670
So I'm going to create a package called a beans and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.110
my bin names is going to be testing on, right?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.570
So I'm going to create a list session theme.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.650
And I'm going to need any interfaces because let's create

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.670
a method in the interface and then implementing the implementation.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.520
The implementation is class is going to be other bean class.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.590
So I'm going to tell it to different types

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.560
of interfaces available here at remote and local.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.990
You might think, why do I need to have a remote and

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.990
why do I need to have a hybrid remote and local.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.710
So remote is used to for providing it to

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.855
the third parties when you're providing your EGP deal to the other person.

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:42.410
So they'll how Wanli, few months,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.660
that's bad when you're looking at the local interface,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.010
which contains a lot of math,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.540
that's a lot of additional methods.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.630
A few methods which you add it for your testing purposes.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.035
You don't need to provide all of them to the third party.

00:03:54.035 --> 00:03:57.785
So the third party only required one or two methods.

00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:00.335
But in your local, you will have those two medicines.

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:04.580
Additionally, we have other methods as well just for our testing purpose.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.665
So for now, I'm going to use a remote and then select Next.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:15.560
And we name is taste session when and we have to provide a map name.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.280
So this is a map, a name which is used to for retrieving

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.480
the EAB from the algebra you several because we will deploy it in our server, right?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.505
And when we are trying to use a client,

00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:27.590
we need to prove it the address for EGP to pull

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.260
the information so we have to provide some mapping name here.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.440
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to provide a name called mean slash.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.955
Test mapping means test mapping v.

00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:43.040
And the transaction type is a container.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.725
We'll talk about that word, different transactions type.

00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:49.020
And then we'll click Finish.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.975
So now we have been already.

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:56.030
So the next thing,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:03.300
we're going to configure the server for our EGP application.
