00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:04.545
So finally we posted a message into our queue.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.215
Now it's time to consume it.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.700
Okay, So this is a message,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.230
we have another bloody server.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.125
So let's go back to our Eclipse.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.390
Now we need to write a bean.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.950
It's not going to be normal.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.550
It is going to be a message through and beam.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.110
So let's create a new bin here and it's going to message through and bean.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.480
And I'm going to name it as some order management.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.670
Order Management.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.370
Allison L.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.170
Q. That's fine.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.530
It listen.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.215
Imdb, message driven, even.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:47.450
Got it. And click Next.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.510
And destination type is Q because I'm not going to use the topic here

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.230
because we are using and just a Q here, and click Next.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.790
And then everything remains the same b name and a term search interface container.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.340
And it will implements the message listen.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.625
And because the message listener contains a method called on message,

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:09.980
and that is a method we are going to override it or providing implementation to that.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.455
And click Finish now.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:14.615
Okay, so now we have,

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:16.940
our messages are going to be an Israeli.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.230
If you take a look at the class,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.390
you have the annotation here at home message drew and which meant it's not a stateless,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.490
it's not a stateful, it is a different,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.150
it is a message driven bean and it has some properties in it.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.950
First thing we need to name it.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.155
So I can name it as a list MDB and come up.

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:38.765
The second parameter is active configuration.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:41.075
So let's start to modify it here.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:44.930
Okay? So now we have our activation config property,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.355
which contains a property name as a destination type and what is the property value?

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:51.845
So we are trying to look for GMS, a queue.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:56.010
We're not going to modify anything yet because we are going to add something to it.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.600
Right? So what we're gonna do,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.690
we're going to add a few more properties because I need to mention what is

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.515
my connection factory and what is my JND name, correct.

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:07.930
So let's copy the same here.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.690
I mean, copied from here to this particular location and copy

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.390
it and paste it into.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.020
So I copied twice and I pasted it twice because I need to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.725
provide the connection factory name here and the queue name here.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:30.220
So the property name, which means the key,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:39.860
is going to be connection fat PG AND name, factory, NDI name.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.175
So here you need to provide the DJ and a name.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:45.710
I mean the Indian name for the connection factory.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.090
So we can get it from

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.585
the previous example because here we have a connection factory here.

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:53.285
So copy that and go back.

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:59.810
And okay, so connection factories mentioned here, connection factor,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.270
make sure you don't have any mistakes,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.365
spelling mistake here because it won't be able to identify what we're looking for.

00:03:06.365 --> 00:03:12.875
So connection factory JND a name and then destination j and a name.

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:17.525
So destination j and a name which will represent the queue name,

00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:21.300
a destination j and d a name.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.830
And then here, of course, you know what we need to do.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.460
Let's go back to the previous method and we'll copy the queue name here.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.410
And just thank you.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.930
And we don't need that twice I could, I did it at one,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.910
but anyway, so let's base the value here.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.910
Okay, So now we have a GMS queue which contains a connection factory and also cuny.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.550
So next thing, we need to write some logic here because

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.760
the method is already how the empty body implementation body here.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.205
So now we need to prove or the implementation.

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:02.660
So what basically we are trying to do a message which will consume the,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.480
this is a matter which will contain the message from the DMS q.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.310
So the message is already ready here.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.950
So now what I need to do, just receive that for now.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.870
I'm gonna receive it as it takes to message.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.485
The reason you might ask Why am receive as a text message?

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:20.180
Because if you go back to the previous mentioned,

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.035
the message they posted as a text message.

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:26.090
If you have, we will want our D2L,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.545
like a store and our user.

00:04:27.545 --> 00:04:28.820
You can use that as well.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.055
All you need to do, just type cast it.

00:04:31.055 --> 00:04:34.230
And here extra message.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.990
So m plus j is a message which is coming

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.885
from this metallic and in a type cast into text message.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:49.310
So if you're using student,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.595
you how to add cash it according to the type.

00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:56.060
Okay, so now we have the message.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.900
So now what we can do it with try catch block.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.270
And here what I'm gonna do is message dot.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.665
What do we need to do? Message dot?

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:14.540
Get x because we used set the text right?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.725
So we're going to use C. You get X-naught. So which will give me.

00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:19.910
String.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.670
So now what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna progress this will here.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.555
So the message, message has been

00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:33.995
received and

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:41.225
the message content is.

00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:46.505
And we need to get the message from the message instance.

00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:51.185
And then we can blow up some branched actress just in case.

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:54.380
So prints factorise.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.620
Okay, so now we have everything ready.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.490
So the moment you deploy this code, what will happen?

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.695
We have the Q here, right?

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:07.880
The message, this message will disappear because it has been

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.770
processed by our listener messaged Driven Bean.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.390
So the moment you deploy,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.130
it will available and WebLogic server,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.640
it started listening and it found out that is a message waiting in the queue.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.695
So I need to pick the message and pauses it.

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:23.465
Okay, so first thing,

00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:26.780
let's try to deploy this code.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.649
Right-click runners on Solver

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.270
and click Next and Finish.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.060
So population to obliging server here.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.995
Okay, so it is deployed.

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:50.660
And if we take a look at the console,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.820
C message has been received and the message content is test to message to the queue.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.890
So this is a message which a poster from

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.245
our previous example and that is stored in our queue.

00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:08.195
So the moment I deployed the new code changes and new code genius contents, the MDB,

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:09.665
which is a message driven bean,

00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:12.800
which we'll look for any messages in the queue,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.855
and it found one and it prints out again.

00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:19.340
Now let's go back to our web server and you should still see the message here.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.530
All you needed just to refresh it.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.125
See the message is gone now.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:25.460
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.280
Let's go back to our previous example and let's try to post

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.585
some other messages, like test message.

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:42.545
Okay, so test measures to the queue and second message to the queue.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.630
So the moment Ira and the class,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.990
you know what'll happen in the message will be posted into our queue.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.970
But if you go back to the blood server and

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.745
the client to search for this particular a message.

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:55.610
It wouldn't be available because the moment it posted,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.395
it will be processed by our consumer,

00:07:57.395 --> 00:07:58.925
which is our MDB.

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:03.125
And let's right-click and run as Java application.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:06.240
Kiba, I am the console here.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.870
Okay, So the message has been posted and immediately

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.330
the message has been received and the message Cantonese.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.340
Second message to the queue.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.715
And now let's go back to our silver.

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:21.950
And still, you won't be able to say

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.815
anything here because the message has been processed immediately.

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:28.175
So let's try to find how many messages we process so far.

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.710
So go to our Q,

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.885
and here go to monitoring.

00:08:32.885 --> 00:08:36.545
And here see the message in total a two.

00:08:36.545 --> 00:08:38.690
Right? So now what I'm going to do,

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.630
Let's try one more example because this is not clear, right?

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:47.735
So I'm going to provide Cisco saying like message postdoc.

00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:50.315
So once the message went to the queue,

00:08:50.315 --> 00:08:52.685
I will get the message, post your message.

00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:56.330
So this is going to be third message to the queue.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.505
And what I'm gonna do is just to have an ion D L,

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.200
Just keep looking, they cancel.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:07.889
So what I'm gonna do is let's maximize it and right-click and run as Java application.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.730
C message has been post-doc.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:22.400
Okay, and if you go back and reference this page,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.260
see now it was too before.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.550
Now it is three because that is a one-word message he has been processed to.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.070
Now, you might be thinking why it is not

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.235
available here because we had a look back the proper console.

00:09:34.235 --> 00:09:37.610
We need to open the WebLogic cancel

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.120
here so you can see the message here. Let's click again.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.205
Go there and WLS server.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:49.445
And here, C, third message.

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:53.150
So this is how you need to post a message to the queue

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:58.140
and retrieve using our message driven beans.
