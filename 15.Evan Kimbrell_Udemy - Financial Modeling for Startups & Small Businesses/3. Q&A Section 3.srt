1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,650
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,640
We're going to take a moment to address some of the questions you might have and a few questions that

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,230
we thought would be interesting for you to see.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,440
All right the second three we were talking about some of the things you need to understand before you

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,240
model.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,420
So really we're just talking about best practices.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,720
Well so I'll start off with the first question so.

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,570
This is totally random sorry.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,110
What I notice is in your models why do you use yellow and blue like yellow background blue font using

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,660
a really peculiar choice.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,280
That's a really good question that if you go to UCLA that y has a really good question.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,060
And you know I actually when I first started learning financial modeling and I went to a few of the

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:48,600
workshops and boot camps in Wall Street and learned different kinds of financial modeling and it was

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,640
really common practice to use yellow cells with blue fonts.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,350
I didn't really like it at first this seems really got me.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,700
But over time as I built a lot of financial models for different companies for different investors in

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,940
different scenarios what I found is that it's impossible to ignore if you're sharing a model with someone

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,830
where you want them to know and look at hey this is an assumption.

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,510
This is something that you need to look at and then having it in your home is really easy to do that

20
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,800
now it can be any color you want.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,060
You just got to make it very clear to whoever is looking at your model what they represent.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,750
Yeah.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,950
And if you guys have skipped ahead to the case study where I talked about my startup you'll notice that

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,680
like the whole thing is color coded.

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,370
We didn't we didn't use yellow and blue but we use a whole bunch of like greens and blues and yellows

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,260
and stuff like that.

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,360
So yeah I mean it's really just like use it like a highlighter.

28
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,650
Right.

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,570
You bring used color to bring people's attention toward something.

30
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,850
But then also one thing I will say is that you can also add color and fonts and even small graphics

31
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,660
and like that because it makes your model look more polished right like presentation is so much especially

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,540
if you're trying to show it to someone else or in my case.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,180
I like using things that are prettier to look at.

34
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,570
And so I have an iPhone.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,610
But you know on like a like a hardware standpoint it's clearly inferior to all the Samsung and the Android

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,140
phones.

37
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,020
But I like it because it looks better.

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,340
Right.

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,120
So there's is something we said about adding some color as a way to focus attention but then also make

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:40,590
it look more polished even if it's not yeah absolutely as a VC What do you expect out of the model would

41
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,400
you expect a startup to project profits or do you expect them to break even for those years at home

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,620
wondering why is even a question.

43
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,740
Startups in general and you guys read my intro to entrepreneurship.

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,110
We talk about this what makes a startup a startup while a startup is a company that is designed to grow

45
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,590
as fast as possible.

46
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,490
And so when you're thinking of an organization in terms of we need to grow as fast as possible.

47
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,720
That oftentimes you're not thinking about profit right because if you're taking profit then therefore

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,180
you are not growing as fast as possible.

49
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,420
You should be reinvesting that.

50
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,830
So with that in mind we were telling you about startups and we're looking at a model you know I've seen

51
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,350
people do it multiple ways.

52
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:29,570
Generally what I look for a user look for and what I've seen of the consensus is that people don't want

53
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,760
to invest in something that is permanently going to break even even if they know that like this is the

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
name of the game right.

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,950
We don't make money until we figure out how to make money later on down the road.

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,890
We focus on user acquisition at the for at the very beginning.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:51,090
Generally what I have noticed is people will show heavy heavy investment in the first three years and

58
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,900
then they'll start showing a profit.

59
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,930
That kind of inverses and balloons and gets larger as you get towards like the six year mark.

60
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,860
Now part of the reason why that is and if you're really savvy what you can do is when you're talking

61
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,550
to a venture capitalist look at when they raise their fund.

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,090
Right.

63
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,210
So wait venture capital works is there's a bunch of people who are in suits and they find investments

64
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,220
for a fund.

65
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,120
You know at the very beginning what they do is they go to really really rich people or large institutions

66
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,030
and they raise a large like multimillion dollar fund and then it's up to them to go invest that now

67
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,440
in general venture capital funds last seven years.

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,040
I don't know why it's just seven years that's like the asset class.

69
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,290
So what you can do is if you're talking to a venture capitalist and you know that they have four years

70
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,130
left in their fund you should probably show that you're going to make profit within four years.

71
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,880
That's one way of doing it.

72
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,290
That's a very savvy way of doing it.

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,610
But in general since it's a seven year timeframe you could do fine just showing that hey year five six

74
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,790
we start getting into the situation we have so much profit we don't know what to do with it.

75
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,420
And that's not to say that you don't say like hey we're making tons of money and reinvesting it.

76
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,910
You're just saying in the future it's unavoidable that we're making profit versus at the very beginning

77
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,280
whatever it is we're building up our economies of scale or we're building up our user base or we're

78
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,440
in a change advertising tactics halfway through to something that's more lean.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,340
As long as you show that there's a transition and it happens eventually.

80
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,850
Here's the thing I also have capital.

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,020
We all know that it's just B.S. And we just kind of want to believe.

82
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,690
But in general we want to make sure that you understand what profit is right.

83
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,640
So if you don't have profits somewhere in it then we get a little bit worried that this is almost like

84
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,800
a hobby business.

85
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,230
Since you are in mergers and acquisitions.

86
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,790
So there's you guys in mergers and acquisitions you deal with mergers and acquisitions either you're

87
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,230
a consultant as a third party helping facilitate the process of a larger company buying a smaller one

88
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,830
or merging with one or you're someone within a company that does all the due diligence before you buy

89
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,600
a company like selecting them figuring out what they're worth negotiating etc..

90
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:16,740
So the main reason why people merge or buy each other is because of that horrible buzz word synergy.

91
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,090
Right.

92
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,530
And synergy is just like the simplest way I can explain it is in business terms it's one plus one equals

93
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,160
three.

94
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,580
Right.

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,710
So if I have one company that raises cows and one company that sells meat by virtue of sticking those

96
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,750
two together and by virtue of the cooperation and collaboration you can now bring to them bring to this

97
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,760
organization they will do better than the sum of those two pieces separately.

98
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,260
So that's synergy.

99
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,390
So my question was in M&amp;A when you're doing a deal are you're evaluating a deal.

100
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,780
Do you build synergy into your model beforehand like do you show.

101
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,400
This is our.

102
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,710
These are numbers now and here's after we acquire them and this changes something fundamentally And

103
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,850
here's the difference.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,270
Or is it just something you talk about verbally because oftentimes it's so subjective.

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,660
That's a good question.

106
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:15,410
When I was working M&amp;A we actually did not rule out the synergy from a potential acquisition or merger.

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,040
So at the time it was with the group where we were underwriting all of them in a deal.

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,970
So when we were looking at a potential deal we had a model for what our business was going to be.

109
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,230
You know before the merger and what our business would be after the merger post-merger and we looked

110
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,750
at synergies both on kind of the top line as well as the bottom line so there may be some synergies

111
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,920
where combining would allow some cross-selling of products for instance or some you know cross-pollination

112
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,760
of of of the customers.

113
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:53,220
And then on the cost side we look at potential ways to cut costs especially redundant parts of the businesses

114
00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:00,870
and then we would quantify that and then looked at how it impacts the bottom line of our main business.

115
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,700
So if you were at a public business and we look at the impact on earnings and I imagine its probably

116
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,650
different from organization organization.

117
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,950
Yeah maybe.

118
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,380
I can imagine Goldman Sachs maybe they don't maybe they do or I don't know.

119
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,930
One other question Nancy.

120
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,130
This kind of relates back to Section 2 but since we're talking about kind of best practices mirror Section

121
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,340
2 we were doing a lemonade stand and we are trying to figure out how much profit we should shoot for.

122
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,120
Right and the way we did that was by figuring out what's our what what is our time worth.

123
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,270
And then using that and going backwards and saying well that's being 40 40 hours a week on it.

124
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,870
I know you paid this much Therefore per week I need to make this much profit.

125
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:46,620
What do you do with a situation where you're not actively participating in the business and maybe you

126
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,210
don't even have a employee.

127
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,390
Maybe you just have a partner who's running it and that partner does not get compensated or compensated

128
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,250
significantly.

129
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,680
So I would assume that you would still have some sort of an ownership stake or some sort of stake in

130
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,920
the business.

131
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,450
Right.

132
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,090
So one way to do that is as a financial model that is projected for the business you would have an idea

133
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:15,140
of the profits that would be made from it in any kind of distributions that would be made from that.

134
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,690
And so based on your ownership stake you can see what that would look like over the project or the period

135
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,700
of the projection.

136
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
And then he can determine whether that's worth it or not for the initial effort.

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,210
You've got to put in in order to get that state.

138
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:36,480
Yeah I mean have you ever seen it where people instead of valuing their time the value like their equity

139
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,940
like their the value of the company.

140
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,220
And if I put about this amount of time and do it I need to see growth in the company of this much value.

141
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,480
You could I think you could do better I guess depends on kind of what your role with that organization

142
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,200
would be.

143
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,330
I've got a question for you.

144
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:59,490
I think there may be a lot of students who you know maybe starting businesses that are very new or you

145
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,680
know they may think to themselves Hey even I have a business that has a completely different business

146
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,170
model I can't find anything else out there that you know of anybody that's doing something similar.

147
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,870
What are my options in terms of financial modeling.

148
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,850
How do you know.

149
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,530
Well I mean it's it's tough right.

150
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,800
I mean anytime you blaze your own trail you kind of have to.

151
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,540
You have to invent a lot of things you do along the way.

152
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,820
I mean two things one there really are no financial models that don't have a comparable.

153
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,710
You might say like I've never seen someone do it before.

154
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,450
Yeah I mean maybe you just haven't looked enough.

155
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,350
You can always find something that's at least like 70 percent similar.

156
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,660
I mean you can come up with some crazy pricing but you can also find things that are are similar to

157
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,010
it.

158
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,420
Right.

159
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,270
Even if you had price that was fluctuating based off of astrological signs.

160
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:54,820
Right.

161
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,850
Like you could still find a business that uses external indicators to price their business commodity

162
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,640
businesses do that all the time.

163
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,260
They look at a stock price and based on that stock price which is also just almost as arbitrary as Astrology

164
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,010
will base their whatever so whatever commodity whether they're trying to sell it for.

165
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,610
So one I think you need to do more research is to find something that's comparable.

166
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,890
You might not find a hundred percent fit.

167
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,280
Obviously you might find 50 percent or 60 percent but that's close enough because the number two point

168
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,290
is we're making this stuff up.

169
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:32,840
I mean when you're projecting something and it's brand new whatever you put down is your best guess.

170
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,550
And as soon as you start getting into it from day one you're going to start getting data back and you're

171
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,740
going to completely change it if you're wrong.

172
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,240
So it's not always something to fret about to watch.

173
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:53,200
I mean I try to do your best if you have some goofy system but some goofy pricing systems or something

174
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:57,910
you can still take a guess at how many people are going to be physically looking at your product or

175
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,840
looking at your service.

176
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,170
Right.

177
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,520
So then it's really just a question of can you average out your prices.

178
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,670
Can you itemize it like this whether I'm selling this is it might be average of this price or this price

179
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,830
and kind of just go from there.

180
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,840
Because the thing is that if you have an unknown business model you're doing something brand new.

181
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,900
Well really the financial model that's only like one or two points right early just like your price.

182
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,790
I mean that's it really.

183
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,440
You still have you're still going to employees are still going.

184
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,530
A basic expenses start up expenses.

185
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,720
You're still going to have unit costs.

186
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,300
Cost of goods sold well depending on where it is.

187
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,570
So really changes a couple of things.

188
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,720
I really wouldn't fret about it.

189
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,880
We make this stuff up.

190
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,220
I know last point I probably say is like if you're trying to if you're saying like no I haven't I need

191
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,380
to have this exactly right right now.

192
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,030
And you haven't even stepped one foot into the business.

193
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,450
Well then you kind of have like a lead nightmare right.

194
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,670
You don't.

195
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,050
What are you trying to do are you trying to raise money before you've even tried the business.

196
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,070
I understand that's a thing like some people do raise money before they even try something like jet

197
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,950
dot com right.

198
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,510
That has raised billions of dollars on an idea.

199
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,740
But I would just generally say if that's the case you have way bigger problems.

200
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,840
That's a terrible way of going about it.

201
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,120
Yeah I would just like to add you know whatever your business is you're still going to have customers

202
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,030
hopefully that are going to pay you for something.

203
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,200
So think about that process that you're going to have to go through.

204
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,030
Your customer is going to have to go through to become a customer and then to pay you what are the decisions

205
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,790
that they got to make.

206
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,940
What are the offers that they're going to see and how you can use that as a basis for building out your

207
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,660
model.

208
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,740
Yeah it makes sense.

209
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,730
So the way that we're teaching this course we haven't figure this out as we start out with the fundamentals

210
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,320
right.

211
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,680
The things that everybody has in common and we slowly get more complex.

212
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,450
And then we start branching off in individual industries.

213
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,790
So my question is do you know of any industries off the top of your head or situations that are common

214
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,460
enough you know about it where the fundamentals don't necessarily apply.

215
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:10,090
Like for instance a business where they don't have operating costs or they don't have employees.

216
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,640
They only have robots or something like that where the foundation is significantly different.

217
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah I can think of an example for kind of exactly what we're doing if you're creating more of a digital

218
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,160
product or something that is where all of the effort is pretty much up front are primarily up front

219
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,000
and there's no inventory there's nothing that gets spoiled.

220
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,480
You don't have rent you don't have office space you don't have employees you're creating a digital asset

221
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,310
that then gets sold on a regular basis.

222
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,570
That's a very different model than say if you're running a restaurant where you know every time you

223
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,850
make a sale you still have to pay for the food.

224
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,110
You still got to pay for the labor.

225
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:57,160
You have lights that keep buying the AC you have all of those things that are baked into each incremental

226
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,040
sale.

227
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,020
But on the digital side may be very different.

228
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,720
But I think also one thing it's worth pointing out there is like even if you're doing a digital good

229
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,890
that doesn't have costs of goods sold well one technically it does have cost of goods sold.

230
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,430
Technically your storage is not free.

231
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,960
Technically your bandwidth is not free.

232
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,920
I mean it's peanuts but it's not.

233
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,190
You can never escape that completely.

234
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,460
Another thing is like OK so maybe you don't have operating expenses but at that point like if your friend

235
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,280
sends let's say you're mailing a course business right like going online courses.

236
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,310
Sure.

237
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,250
From the perspective of my first course I didn't have operating expenses because once I put it up you

238
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,120
know I didn't really have to do anything to it.

239
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,620
But if your idea is to make the second one then the upfront work you do for the second one then becomes

240
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,200
your operating expenses.

241
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,920
Right because now you are running.

242
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,020
You have revenue.

243
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,500
You are not a big question mark as to how you're running this business so you see that a lot.

244
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,360
Often with digital goods it's like up front work well your upfront work is no longer your startup costs

245
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,030
because you're not starting a business for every single new product.

246
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,640
Yeah it's one of those things it's like.

247
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,740
Sure it might be different but it's going be different by one small thing.

248
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,070
Or if you really think about it it's not really that different go.

249
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,300
OK so guys if you have any other questions ask them in the.

250
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,000
And then just tag Simon or I or him put in the Q&amp;A if you want to make us work for it.

251
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,930
Otherwise we will see you in the next section.

252
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,320
See you later.
