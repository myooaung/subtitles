00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.100
You will come back and this lecture we are going to do a quick overview of the SAS force case study.

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.940
We're going to go over the some of the early calculations that we need to make as well as the economics

3
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.340
of a single salesperson.

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.840
Now for a SAS company we're going to look at an example that is pretty common place in this space which

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.100
is in order to grow and sell are going to have to have a sales team and you're going to need a sales

6
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.170
person you're going to look at the actual economics around a single sales person.

7
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.860
How quickly does it take them to ramp up.

8
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.150
You know there's a learning curve.

9
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.560
You've got to account for things like sales attrition maybe there's firings for the salespeople that

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.450
don't cut it.

11
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.930
And also there are some that are going to is going to quit.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.410
Right.

13
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.270
And when you look at your overall growth it's really going to be pegged to how quickly you can hire

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.920
your sales team and grow your sales team.

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.200
OK.

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.810
So let's take first though look at some of the market calculations at least in terms of what would it

17
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.540
costs for us to get a qualified lead.

18
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.040
So what do we mean by a qualified lead in the SAS base.

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.590
Customers aren't just going to show up on your website and then buy it.

20
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.380
It's an inexpensive product and it's going to take a really high touch sales process.

21
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.470
So they're not just going to show up on your Web site and buy them and show up on your Web site fill

22
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.540
out some sort of an intake form request an initial call and then after the initial call they may set

23
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.820
up a demo and they may even get a trial or something like that.

24
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.120
So here I just want to separate that and get that in your head where qualified leads are the ones that

25
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.650
basically are ready to make a purchase there.

26
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.400
And it's for the sales person to take them from qualified leads to becoming a paying customer.

27
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.990
Now what happens between someone that's just showing up to the Web site and becoming qualified lead.

28
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.820
There's a lot of things that can happen in between.

29
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.870
We're just going to assume that there's stuff going on.

30
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.600
Maybe they need to set up appointments maybe they need to have a sales call but unqualified leads will

31
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.120
define as folks that are just showing up on site.

32
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.660
They're just visitors.

33
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.020
Not all of them are going to become qualified leads.

34
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.470
OK.

35
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.370
So when we think of it that way we can pretty quickly estimate costs per qualified lead.

36
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.230
Kate this is going to be the number that we're going to use for estimating what is the cost of sales

37
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.170
for every customer that gets converted because every customer that gets converted is going to require

38
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.480
a certain amount of leads and as good as your sales team's going to be they're not going to be 100 percent

39
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.290
at converting.

40
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.980
Depending on what industry it's in something like five to 10 percent are pretty good conversion rates

41
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.430
of converting qualified leads into customers so it could mean 10 or more qualified leads before you

42
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.880
get one customer.

43
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.200
OK.

44
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.250
So here we're just going to do a calculation for what it costs to get a qualified lead.

45
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.770
All right.

46
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.670
So let's start here.

47
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.110
What is the breakdown between organic traffic and paid traffic.

48
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.040
This is assuming that organic traffic is free.

49
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.110
People are just fining you guys from word of mouth from search.

50
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.940
You know if you're content marketing whatever it is but you're not paying for it get paid.

51
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.340
Traffic is more common in the space.

52
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.260
So if we are assuming that there's some cost paid per visitor this could be like your CPC cost from

53
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.090
the ad campaign.

54
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.700
Right.

55
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.460
Your cost per visitor to your site.

56
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.200
OK.

57
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.910
Now if we take the weighted average between organic and pay traffic we're going to get this cost per

58
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.870
visitor because some of it is free.

59
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.540
Right.

60
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.700
And then for the visitors then what percentage of the visitors become unqualified leads are the ones

61
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.220
that just show up and leave.

62
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.260
You wouldn't call them leads but maybe some of them a small percentage of them want to sign up for an

63
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.040
initial call then of those that become unqualifiedly.

64
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.350
You know maybe the set up a call what percentage of those actually become qualified leads.

65
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.330
So after the call they still have an interest they're very interested.

66
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.540
They want to have a demo.

67
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.350
They want to have a call with the sales person who's going to give them the full full options and walk

68
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.710
through all the details of why the products to me a perfect fit for them.

69
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.730
OK.

70
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.900
So if we make some assumptions around that then we can estimate how many unqualified leads are needed

71
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.970
to become a qualified lead to get one qualified.

72
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.660
So based on the assumption here that we need.

73
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.560
And then how many visitors will we need to get one qualified.

74
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.870
Well we can back it from this calculation here.

75
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:54.390
And to have four on qualified leads to get one qualified lead then four and then we need it to only

76
00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:02.690
2 percent become qualified leads that means 2 percent of 200 visitors would end up getting one qualified

77
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.550
lead right.

78
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.410
So then when we have that we can get it estimated costs of the number of visitors that is required to

79
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.600
get one qualified lead times the cost per visitor which is here 150.

80
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.710
So that becomes $300 per qualified lead.

81
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.760
Now we're going to be using this in our later parts of our model.

82
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.220
So the next thing to understand before we actually dive into the model that you're used to seeing is

83
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.840
we need to look at the economics of a single salesperson and you know this work sheet here if you just

84
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.320
work on this and understand this you're going to have a much better understanding of the SAS model and

85
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.950
why it takes a lot more money and a lot more time before you start turning a profit here.

86
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.100
Let's make some assumptions about the salesperson.

87
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.460
Right.

88
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:58.640
The salesperson is going to have a base salary and a performance salary where this is going to depend

89
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.990
on whether they are meeting their quotas.

90
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.400
OK.

91
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.990
You know there's going be some overhead for the salesperson.

92
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.210
Right.

93
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:12.830
They need a desk they need need phones they need to have meals an entertainment budget maybe to take

94
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.910
some potential qualified leads out and we can also assume that their salary is going to be growing and

95
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.110
also their expenses the overhead will get more expensive over time as well.

96
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.540
Here we're going to get an assumption around how many leads does it take to get one customer right.

97
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.260
If out of 100 leads they get 8 customers.

98
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.540
8 percent conversion rate.

99
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.170
Then it takes 12 and a half leads for every conversion.

100
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.600
Okay.

101
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.360
And those costs prequalified lead where we calculated that from earlier.

102
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.350
Some other assumptions.

103
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.500
What is the average annual contract value right over customer.

104
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.550
So every time a salesperson makes a sale and converts a customer what does the annual contract value.

105
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.190
We're assuming an expensive pretty expensive kind of middle of the road not now among the most expensive

106
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:08.300
some SAS solutions are like 150 250000 or even up to a million a year.

107
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.310
This is kind of like low middle range or right.

108
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.700
So 50 000 a year and the salesperson has a quarter of 1 million.

109
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.100
So that means they need to do 20 customers 20 conversions in a year.

110
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.470
And let's assume that there's a gross margins of 80 percent on the sales and then that there's also

111
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.590
going to be a price increase per year of 3 percent.

112
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.980
Okay we're going to call it price increase.

113
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.000
This is the price of the software assuming that it's going to get more expensive.

114
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.730
Now some other things to consider is the preferred salary.

115
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.150
Eventually it's going to depend on whether they are operating at their full productivity if they're

116
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.340
meeting their quotas right.

117
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:57.060
But maybe for the salespeople initially if you give them an opportunity to you know ramp up.

118
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:02.900
So what can happen is maybe hey look for the performance base you know the first three months of the

119
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.760
first four months is you get a 50 percent draw on that.

120
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.280
So here I said it so that the first four months has a 50 percent draw on average over the first four

121
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.480
months is 50 percent.

122
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.850
But going from 100 down what this means is hey month 1 regardless of their sales they're going to get

123
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.380
100 percent of the performance.

124
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.940
It's much too regardless of scale to get 65 percent.

125
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.010
And then three of those sales we get 35 percent.

126
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.310
And then after that is to me all performance space.

127
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.660
Right.

128
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.320
But this averages out to 50 percent over the first four months.

129
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.290
So basically I have a few months to kind of ramp up now.

130
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.080
These are kind of similar to what we've done before.

131
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.500
Right.

132
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.000
These are two track sales attrition.

133
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.280
This is a sales team basically.

134
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:51.560
But you know as a single sales person it's kind of weird to think about this but I want to put it here

135
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.950
because when we started thinking about whole team we're definitely going to have to account for attrition.

136
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.970
So this this could capture everything from like getting fired from leaving from going on vacation whatever

137
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:07.850
it is that takes down their sales potential or productivity during those months.

138
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.260
OK.

139
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:15.530
So we may start off with something like a high sales attrition early on and then stabilizing at a rate

140
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.030
after some time and then churn is going to be the loss of customers.

141
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:25.750
So this is to me the last in the actual recurring revenue that's being collected.

142
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.390
Okay.

143
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:31.020
So let me start with the higher churn and then hopefully stabilize some sort of a lower churn.

144
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.470
Okay.

145
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.450
And then here is the productivity curve.

146
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:42.590
This is basically hey how quickly can the ramp up to operating at full their full sales potential.

147
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:49.160
You know 100 percent means they're meeting 100 percent of the quota and then productivity curve of 10

148
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.610
means you know they're only meeting 10 percent of their sales quota.

149
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.370
So we're going to say hey and there when they're going to start off with only doing 10 percent of their

150
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:01.850
quota and it takes them four months to ramp up to 100 percent four months we'll match kind of this draw

151
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:07.080
down because by the fourth month they're going to get zero of the performance draw.

152
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.170
That's just given they're going to have to earn it after that completely.

153
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.650
OK.

154
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:19.540
So we start off with the productivity curve where starts at 10 percent and then ramping up to 100 percent

155
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.530
after four months.

156
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.600
So starting in the fifth month I get 200 percent.

157
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.050
And we also have sales attrition that's based on this information here.

158
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.690
And then we have the customer churn That's from this great here.

159
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:39.620
Now bookings annual contract value All right so fear is going to be the actual contract value that they

160
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.180
book in that month.

161
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.560
But remember we're going to assume that this is going to be collect it monthly.

162
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.490
So that's the annual contract value.

163
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.850
But that's not what is actually going to be collected so we're going to have to do some adjustments

164
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.200
there right.

165
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:58.120
But this is just a booking contract value that's come in in that month.

166
00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:58.570
Okay.

167
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:06.320
The sales attrition we're going to take off some of that sales and then the net bookings then will be

168
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.610
the annual contract value of the bookings from that month minus the sales attrition.

169
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.380
So that's that's pretty clear.

170
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:19.560
Then the actual monthly recurring revenue was actually build is going to be the net bookings divided

171
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:20.330
by 12.

172
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.760
The net bookings from that month divided by 12.

173
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:23.470
Okay.

174
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.850
And then that's the net monthly recurring revenue just from the bookings from that month.

175
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.310
But in order for us to track the actual Billings on a month to month basis we have to keep track of

176
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.470
all the previous monthly recurring revenue.

177
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.010
Okay.

178
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.210
So that's what this one is here.

179
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:46.370
We track the previous recurring revenue and then and then the churn is what we lose from the customers

180
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.280
from the previous recurring revenues right.

181
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.610
So the churn is based on the previous Emma.

182
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:58.700
Ours are monthly recurring revenues that the total actual monthly recurring revenue is going to be the

183
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:07.250
new monthly recurring revenue plus the old monthly recurring revenue minus the churn that happens on

184
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.340
the previous recurring revenue.

185
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.030
So then we have the actual monthly recurring revenue here that's happening.

186
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:19.650
So then when we have that we can also look at the cumulative billings for the sales person over time.

187
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.820
It's going to keep building up rates to get better over time.

188
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:28.130
The pricing gets higher they're at their full productivity their monthly recurring revenue for months

189
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:34.650
can grow and then their total is going to cumulative Billings is going to grow obviously for sure.

190
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:42.230
And then the gross profit is just going to be the cumulative Billings but minus the costs the gross

191
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.550
costs here.

192
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:49.160
So that means the profit is just going to be the gross margins times the Billings.

193
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.720
So that's kind of the revenue the Billings revenue side and prophesied for a single sales person.

194
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.930
Okay but then let's take a look at the expenses right.

195
00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.660
Expenses primarily is income from their salary.

196
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:00.940
Okay.

197
00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.500
So couple of things we need to track.

198
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.380
We have the expense growth rate that's for their overhead because that's going to grow over time.

199
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:11.050
We have their salary raise because it's going to grow over time as well.

200
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.900
And then we also have the performance salary draw.

201
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.520
So initially the base salary is just going to be base salary you know.

202
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:24.830
And then over time it grows that the raise whatever's being raised at those 3 percent grows a year from

203
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.450
now and it goes up.

204
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:26.910
Okay.

205
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:33.840
But the performance salary it's going to take the higher of the performance strawe or their productivity.

206
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.540
Right.

207
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.800
So initially the guaranteed draw is higher so they're going to get more of that.

208
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.840
And second month that's still better than you know their productivity so they're still getting more

209
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.180
of that third month.

210
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.070
This one is better.

211
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.600
They're actually their performance is outstripping the minimum guaranteed.

212
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:57.020
So it's going to be calling from here now and then moving forward calling from there and then so on

213
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.670
and so forth.

214
00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.080
Okay.

215
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:06.590
Now then the overhead overhead is just the overhead costs here divided by Also monthly and then is growing

216
00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.460
at the expense growth rate.

217
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.220
So initially at that rate.

218
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.980
And then over time it grows in each year after that.

219
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.620
Okay.

220
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:20.260
So that one's pretty straightforward then the other thing is then we have the cost of leads right.

221
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:28.400
So the cost of leads is going to be the total the actual annual contract value divided by the average

222
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:35.760
contract value times the number of leads needed for that number of conversions times the cost per lead.

223
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.000
So that's what that calculation.

224
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:42.920
And then it gives us the total cost of the leads for the sales person to in order to meet that sales

225
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.890
schedule that is calculated here.

226
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.140
That's the cost of all the leads.

227
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.010
So we added all of these costs here we have the total expenses.

228
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:59.460
And then when we look at Billings plus the total expenses we have the cash flow and the net profit so

229
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.530
when we look at this we can then calculate when a salesperson actually starts to break even when they

230
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:12.990
start to pull in more from their billings than the cost of of them operating as a salesperson right.

231
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.040
So based on their assumptions here we have something like a break even in months 6.

232
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:24.350
Then after that there are going higher and higher on a cumulative basis though you know we're going

233
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:29.770
to operate at a loss for a while right before actually before there's a payback.

234
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.410
Right.

235
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.640
And the full payback is when to come here.

236
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.370
So then when we do this we can also calculate what is the max cash deficit for a single salesperson

237
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.210
as well.

238
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:48.150
So one thing that's useful is when we look up the bookings for the total bookings here versus the churn

239
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.740
you're going to see something like this for a salesperson.

240
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.520
So initially it's going to ramp up pretty quick.

241
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.520
I mean the growth starts to slow down for the for the bookings but the churn will get higher as their

242
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.780
total books get bigger as they have more and more clients.

243
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:11.940
You know even if at the churn that stays a flat percentage rate from a larger base of customers that

244
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:18.630
that's going to start to increase over time then here's one where it is the monthly recurring revenue

245
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.810
versus expenses.

246
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.330
So expenses ramp up and then kind of it's pretty stable.

247
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:31.350
It's growing slowly right now but over time you know as the salesperson gets better their monthly recurring

248
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:36.900
revenue that they're generating is going to keep increasing and outpacing the expenses.

249
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:43.110
But what that means is there is an initial period where you're going to be cash flow negative on a salesperson.

250
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:43.460
Right.

251
00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.000
So this right here is looking at it kind of over the first three years.

252
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.900
But I can zoom in a little bit.

253
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:56.880
You know maybe we will zoom in and just look at just maybe the first two years instead of the whole

254
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.740
three years.

255
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.720
So I'm just going to update the chart real quick so you can see what that looks like.

256
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:03.950
All right.

257
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.080
So we're looking at the first two years there's a cumulative profits from a single salesperson.

258
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:15.330
We see that you know there's a max loss around the fifth month and then it starts to pick up and turn

259
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:20.160
around and then we start you get your money back on your investment return on your investment on a single

260
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:26.210
salesperson here in month 9 and then after that it's all gravy after that.

261
00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:31.590
When you look at something like this if we change some of the other assumptions the product is not that

262
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.480
expensive and maybe the quota is lower.

263
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.090
They're not able to do that.

264
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.910
Well you know and and you're converting 5 percent.

265
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.020
Well if that's the case then it's going to take longer to reach.

266
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.640
It's going to take much longer of an investment curve if you're paying them.

267
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.700
Same with the same compensation and you have the same training.

268
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:56.460
But that's what your product is that you can see that you know for a single salesperson each salesperson

269
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.650
is going to take you a while before you really get your investment back.

270
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:08.280
We're going to change some of those things back just for our example for the next one.

271
00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:15.690
So that's the economics of a single salesperson what's coming up is well what happens now if we start

272
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.140
to hire a lot more people.
