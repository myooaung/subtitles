00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.180
Here's another best practice to fall.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.330
Being clear is better than being clever.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.740
Even if you're the only person using or looking at the model that you're creating.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.620
So what makes a model clear.

6
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:25.710
While it's readable with labels that are self-explanatory the flow is logical and easy to follow and

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.230
it's usable 12 months later you can come back and easily figure out how to use it.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.770
And if you handed off to a business partner or anti-me they can figure out exactly what you're doing

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.110
even if they didn't build a piece of it.

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.670
So especially if you're going to be sharing your model with partners or investors you're going to have

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.030
to make it very clear.

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.520
So let's look at our recent jumpstart model we're doing with the multiple locations right.

13
00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.650
We had five locations here in this setup here makes this so that the core assumptions around each location

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.860
is very easy to read.

15
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.120
We know exactly what the assumptions are right and we know here are the global assumptions.

16
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:18.360
So one of the things that makes models clear rather than clever is to not hide any assumptions is to

17
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.200
pull all the assumptions out.

18
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.680
Right.

19
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.270
And to have the main logic very visible.

20
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.710
So if we look at any of the individual locations we see that all of the locations have the same structure

21
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.300
and because of the highlighting of the core assumptions we see that that's what's different.

22
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.340
Right.

23
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.360
That's what's different there.

24
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.240
But otherwise the logic is exactly the same and it's easy to follow from the top down.

25
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.600
And with Summary sheet.

26
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.410
Same thing with the top down.

27
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.760
Now you don't have to like the colors you can use whatever you want you can have lines and set of colors.

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.580
But for me I'm making this for myself and I'm making this for other people to be able to clearly distinguish

29
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.910
the sections here.

30
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.940
Right here I'm talking about the customers going from traffic stops to purchases and then I'm talking

31
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.110
about Cupps soul and designating there.

32
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.670
And then here I'm talking about revenues and then here are the operating expenses which includes the

33
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.320
cost of goods sold and then profits at the bottom.

34
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.520
You don't have to like the colors to be able to easily see the different sections.

35
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:32.790
So the other thing about making it clear rather than clever is for summary parts for you to pull from

36
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.680
all the components be able to hide them when you need to but have the summaries there.

37
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.050
The reason you wouldn't want say to have all of these just to be part of this line is because if you

38
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.130
made a mistake you wouldn't be able to see and pinpoint it right.

39
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.670
So if there was a calculation that was wrong here that doesn't look right compared to what I would expect.

40
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.010
I can drill down and see maybe which location is coming from where the error is from Whereas if I had

41
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.930
all the formulas all these values just kind of all rolled into here it would be really harder for me

42
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.400
to see because I can actually visualize the individual components.

43
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.930
So when you have more components Yes the model does get bigger but bigger and clearer is better than

44
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.360
elegant and hard to use or hard to identify.

45
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.570
So some of you may be developers that may become from the Ruby on Rails backgrounders.

46
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.060
You know there's some philosophy there around being super elegant.

47
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.560
And then the code is like art but then anybody else looking at it wouldn't know what the hell the original

48
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.720
person was trying to do.

49
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.070
And it's not very easy to maintain.

50
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:52.550
So don't use that approach here with modeling you rather get bulkier than get lighter and confusing.

51
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.280
Now I'm not saying you have to format things a certain way.

52
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.370
You might hate using color so you can use other ways to visually segment the different sections of your

53
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.360
model.

54
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.510
The point is to make it clear that you have different sections you don't have to make your inputs blue

55
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.680
with yellow highlights or make your negative numbers red.

56
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.090
You should just make them look different so that it can be easily seen.

57
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:26.760
So definitely separate the calculations and the logical steps and don't combine them do one thing at

58
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.060
a time and then do the next thing.

59
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.090
That's why we don't combine traffic with stops with purchases into one single calculation because if

60
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.460
you have an issue it would be really hard to separate them and we wouldn't know how to fix them.

61
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.600
It's much harder to maintain that way.

62
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.910
So it's better to be clear than to be clever even if that means a bigger model with more lines of calculations.
