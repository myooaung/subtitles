00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,100
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:03,800
OK.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,810
I want you to go and build a financial model that does everything.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,500
All right.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,160
Got it.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,850
Yeah.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,340
Not possible right.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,090
Well that's a mistake that many entrepreneurs make when they're trying to build a model for their.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,130
They try to do.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,820
Way too many things.

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,910
So another useful best practice for modeling is to clearly define your constraints.

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,290
It's related to mapping it all out.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,840
But this one is more about limiting what your model actually needs to do.

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,690
So too broad and the logic and technical ability required to build the model gets really complicated

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,980
if you follow the advice of starting simple and smarm.

16
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,770
You're already off to a good start.

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,970
But you still want to further define your constraints.

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,480
Yes.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,460
In our lemonade example we started with one location and one product.

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,240
But what do we want to look at.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,500
We also limited ourselves to looking at revenue and gross profits.

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,820
Only we didn't look at overhead we didn't look at financing.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,660
We didn't look beyond the first two years setting clear constraints can make your model building process

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,310
more efficient.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,620
So in addition to deciding what your model needs to be able to do it's just as helpful.

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,200
Defining what it does not need to do.
