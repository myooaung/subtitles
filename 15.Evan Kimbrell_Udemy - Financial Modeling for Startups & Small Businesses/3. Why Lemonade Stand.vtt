Hey I just want to take a quick moment to clarify a few things about the lemonade stand example.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.490
We get quite a few questions about it.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.510
So here's why we are using the lemonade stand example one.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.150
You guys all have a different financial model in mind different startup that you want to start.

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:27.090
Some of you might want to do a mobile app or a webapp or some biotech company or a co-working space

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.430
whatever that may be.

7
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.600
You have a very different startup ideas very different business models.

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.880
Now we don't want to dive into just one specific domain that's going to be relevant for everyone else.

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.540
The lemonade stand example although it is so simple and it doesn't really apply to any of you directly

10
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:54.450
the concept we want to illustrate is that very simple tweaks to a very simple business model can lead

11
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.690
to some fairly complex modeling needs.

12
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.480
So if you don't have the patience to learn a simple concept from a simple business model you're not

13
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.090
going to have the patience to build the financial model that you need for you're much more complicated

14
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.600
startup.

15
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.670
So give the next few lectures a chance and see how these simple little tweaks can lead to a pretty sophisticated

16
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.530
financial model even for something like a lemonade stand.

17
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.970
Now by the end of this course you're going to get all the tools that you need to be able to build your

18
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.540
much more complex financial model for your startup.

19
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.370
But you've got to start with the building blocks and that's what this lemonade stand example is for.
