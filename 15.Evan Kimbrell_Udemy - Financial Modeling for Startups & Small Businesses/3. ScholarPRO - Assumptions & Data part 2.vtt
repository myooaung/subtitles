00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.890
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.100
So last year we covered why this is set up this way why we have assumptions and data why we have Year

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.660
One use of funds and all these different individual tabs and then we also covered what are pivot tables.

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.810
Why do we put all of our assumptions in one sheet.

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.730
And then why in the world did we put some of these things here and why did we think these assumptions

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.750
were so important for what we were doing.

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.630
Also what was that mysterious Miami-Dade test this thing.

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.730
Well that was our trial test to see how popular our offering would be to students.

9
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370
OK so we left off direct cost assumptions.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.100
Now direct cost assumptions.

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.110
Remember again anybody could refute that.

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.940
They could say our credit card cost is too low they could say the costs require schools to low whatever.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.350
That's why we set it up so that they can change it direct cost assumptions are pretty helpful though

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.050
they don't get added up as a separate line item but later on will use these to show how profitable each

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.960
individual action might be.

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.190
So we could say if a salesman costs this much per salary to get a school and all of the costs associated

17
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.720
that we're also this we can then compare all of the costs for acquiring a school next to the revenue

18
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.000
from that school then promoting it to their students and then comparing those two is a great way of

19
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.840
showing value.

20
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.400
Look we put in $10000 and 3 months of time or month of time or whatever and we get $200000 or something

21
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.260
like that.

22
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.580
So really easy to show that off and it's generally something that people like seeing that on here we

23
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.530
put general administrative when you guys start your models do not forget about this stuff.

24
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.680
See it all the time.

25
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.030
People just forget to put the simplest things like they just don't.

26
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.450
You buy pencils pencils cost money it's going to come out of a business account you're not going to

27
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.680
buy it with your own money.

28
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.970
Anything like that.

29
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.970
It's OK to put things in this massive thing like office supplies office supplies per employee 50 bucks

30
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.690
per month.

31
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.270
OK.

32
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.210
I think that's completely reasonable.

33
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.460
We don't really need to label out.

34
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.820
Well they got a red stapler and the stapler as 1999 bill.

35
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.320
You have a coupon at $600.

36
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.340
It doesn't really matter.

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.670
We just pick something someone might argue with that doesn't make a huge kind of implication on the

38
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.770
rest of the model.

39
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.050
There are other things we put our utilities and rent.

40
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.270
We kind of assumed that our rent would be a certain price.

41
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.830
I think we are based out of Chicago at this point but I think we're moving to Boston in a while.

42
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.780
I was forgetting.

43
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.800
But the way we got this rent number was we just figured a certain amount of Squarespace per employee

44
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.620
and then we just kind of looked at commercial space and what was available I think actually you're planning

45
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.030
on using residential space which is technically illegal but it's actually a lot cheaper when you get

46
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.780
started.

47
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.950
A lot of companies do it.

48
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.080
So we just kind of guessed off that.

49
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.070
Again it's not a huge one.

50
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.290
You'll notice though if you if you think that 2000 for rent makes sense for the initial group of people

51
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.100
that will explain down here then as it grows and as we add more employees in the model you'll see that

52
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.760
our rent should go up.

53
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.750
But this is really just the base line we really probably should have put an explanation next to it.

54
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.820
OK over here we could travel sales employees $500 is pretty much a roundtrip per month.

55
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.120
This might be low.

56
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.990
I'm not really sure.

57
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.950
It kind of just depends.

58
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.650
I mean again if you want to get this number consider where you are and go get three prices for a roundtrip

59
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.400
to each coast over the U.S. So each coast and then one in the Midwest of your international then just

60
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.680
guess where most of your customers are and you know try to average it out and then just try to figure

61
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.780
out well you know if we said before it takes 14 hours to make a sale it takes three months to go over

62
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.040
that 14 hours.

63
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.250
OK.

64
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.450
Well how many times are they going be meeting and then you can kind of go backwards and say well they're

65
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.030
probably going to like 1.5 sales trips per month or whatever it is I would probably would have upped

66
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.210
this in reality than web hosting.

67
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.670
Yeah I mean guys don't forget that web hosting this is one that I think we showed a little bit of our

68
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.850
immaturity.

69
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.250
I don't know who.

70
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.450
I don't know.

71
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.350
2011.

72
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.470
Web Hosting is an enormous amount of money.

73
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.580
You can spin up something at Rackspace for $400.

74
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.350
That will hold almost millions of users.

75
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.990
It really just depends if you're like uploading images or pulling documents or things that are really

76
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.660
download upload heavy.

77
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.580
That's when it gets expensive Irland they're doing storage.

78
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.990
People are storing a lot of things that are large file sizes but otherwise man you can get away with

79
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.560
a lot.

80
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.920
All right so then down here we put the annual salaries and start months.

81
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.190
OK so this is just the assumption day 1.

82
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.530
How many people do we have.

83
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.360
And when are they starting.

84
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.500
So at this point we were justifying that this raise was going to be spent on our salaries because the

85
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.770
moment we did our first fundraising round and it was only over $200000.

86
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.310
And so the group was that point.

87
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.890
The point we really wanted to get into paying full salaries and not just like hourly contracts.

88
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.650
So that's why we justified this is going to be involved with this raise.

89
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.760
I'd still put this on any other fundraising document.

90
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.810
But this is why we specifically did it here.

91
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.160
As you can see here these are all the people we thought we would need at the very beginning.

92
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.490
We thought that you need operations.

93
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.760
A technical manager a CEO and a chief architect and well the rest of it would come in later if you are

94
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.550
curious why the CEO and the CEO gets paid so much less than the CTO.

95
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.270
Well the reasons one CEO's are more valuable harder to recruit.

96
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.070
I don't think we could find someone with the technical expertise to pull this off or anything less than

97
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.310
that.

98
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.330
And the other thing was my co-founder and I were the CEO and the CEO.

99
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.840
And because we were young at this point I was 22.

100
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.750
I could live off ramen.

101
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.910
I didn't really need a whole lot but it would be helpful to you know have enough money for things like

102
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.210
health insurance and the occasional flight.

103
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.860
So that's why we kind of put this here.

104
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.860
You know you see CEOs getting paid a lot more.

105
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.840
I see a lot of people in startups now asking for well over 100 depending on kind of where they're living.

106
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.510
We found that this was pretty acceptable and really just kind of a standard salary.

107
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.170
It wasn't like we recruited to see how to pay them a ton of money so they'd end up saving us a decent

108
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.700
amount of money.

109
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.220
And people found this completely reasonable.

110
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.600
Then as you go down here you can kind of see more to how we were kind of thinking about structuring

111
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.240
the company or how we kind of predicted this would work.

112
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.440
Remember we had no idea how big of a software application was going to be at the very end of it.

113
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.430
We didn't know how big of a deal it was get all of the scholarships into our application.

114
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.990
Literally no I mean didn't know a whole lot.

115
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.140
I mean we had mapped out quite well the sales side and the revenue side and getting the schools and

116
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.720
the penetration rate and stuff like that.

117
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.680
I mean on the flipside we really didn't know a whole lot about like what do you do after you have a

118
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.330
school.

119
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.140
So this is our best guess or best guess was think we probably figured that we would need programmers

120
00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.030
and we said well we're gonna need like a junior Dev and a senior dev.

121
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.080
That's kind of what we figured.

122
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.570
Two guys plus a CTO to make large architectural decisions is pretty good.

123
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.330
That's not exactly the lean.

124
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:15.120
You could definitely do without the junior and just have a CTO and someone else who is also a senior

125
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.790
you know nowadays the CTO is the one who makes it.

126
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.460
But in this scenario I think we are because we were thinking that the data structure and the software

127
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.500
structure was just so complex it was really not a simple application that we would need someone and

128
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.380
more of this larger architectural position also just kind of give us advices to hey don't do that you're

129
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.400
going to break everything.

130
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.210
So that was our best guess.

131
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.700
Why do we call them architects.

132
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:43.830
Well because we are pitching investors and investors are not terribly tech savvy so architects sounds

133
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.350
a whole lot better than Khoder or code wrangler or code monkey or as goofy things.

134
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.390
You see unlike people's design studios there is lost sales.

135
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:52.760
OK.

136
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.980
So we've put account managers and this is kind of the assumption was that we are sales and sales get

137
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:05.460
add on all of these universities but every year we have to read up and redo it and get a new promotion.

138
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.010
We also have to cancel constant answer their questions and make sure that the students also don't go

139
00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:16.020
to the universities and ask and say they're having problems or asked more questions really we just found

140
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.530
that there is a baseline level of maintenance.

141
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.010
So we figured it really make a lot of sense.

142
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.510
The salespeople do the ongoing maintenance.

143
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.240
We figured out today you could have much better economies of scale by training someone specifically

144
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.620
to manage them so an account manager 40 K for an account manager.

145
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.390
I think that's kind of low now.

146
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.230
But then again inflation is what doesn't.

147
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.300
Well it wasn't 12 that we had down here is university sales directors we had these people coming on

148
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.020
pretty soon realizing the idea here was we wanted to get someone who was more like a ring leader for

149
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.860
each sales team someone who really kind of owned a territory.

150
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.190
Right so a lot of sales companies you see are based on home territories.

151
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.910
So one in the Midwest someone on the west coast east coast northeast southwest whatever.

152
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.820
So we kind of thought that maybe that's the way this model would work out.

153
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.290
I don't know.

154
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.400
It might have been overkill it might be that you don't need to do that again and we would have figured

155
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.780
that out very quickly and would have deleted this and then just kind of removed it.

156
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.020
But this is pretty much what we were guessing we're guessing and add them on very quickly.

157
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.280
And if for some reason we change our mind or someone who is looking at this did not agree that could

158
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.810
change it right here and say No I expect them to come later.

159
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.700
Other than that we other person now.

160
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.440
Is that really Hayesville personnel.

161
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.560
So yeah.

162
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.830
Right.

163
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.310
So we had data entry that was really all it was.

164
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.490
Remember we have all these scholarships out there and really get their applications in our systems people

165
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.740
can be matched with them.

166
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.960
And that's just a lot of data entry.

167
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.890
We put 15000 because I mean we are outsource it.

168
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.210
So 15000 for an outsourced data entry person if they're trained and everything is actually quite generous

169
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.410
and we kind of assume that they would come on in the sixth month.

170
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.400
I'm not really sure who's going to do that up until that point this might be.

171
00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:01.520
This one is and you can see we're having some really tight and variable interesting so you could set

172
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.510
that I think maybe we couldn't agree on that one point or something and then the data entry temp was

173
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.650
kind of like because the thing is with a lot of the data entry it's not a slow burn.

174
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.470
It's not like you only have two hundred a day to put in.

175
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.770
It's more like today of 20 tomorrow or 50 the next day at 3000.

176
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.200
So we needed to have some kind of a fluid workplace arrangement.

177
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.430
And over here you can see the data entry goal.

178
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.730
So we just kind of put our goal over here and we tested this out.

179
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.760
So we actually tried to enter these in ourselves.

180
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.680
It was mind numbingly boring.

181
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.790
Anyway we figured you could get in probably 20 per hour.

182
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.540
It seemed reasonable to promise some of these ones are really thorny and it took a long time and some

183
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.350
are just a breeze.

184
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.450
What we ended up doing was breaking the data entry process down so there's three distinct parts.

185
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.930
One was finding the scholarship and then one was taking information and putting it.

186
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.910
And then one was checking it over and making sure there wasn't a mistake because once it goes in the

187
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.940
system it's a lot harder to fix it then.

188
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.660
So that's how we kind of broke it down.

189
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.670
Finding them is easy because once you find a cache of scholarships that usually come in bundles of 30

190
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.880
so yeah I'd probably take an hour to find one of those.

191
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.690
Putting it in yeah equal to six an hour it's just really tedious.

192
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.190
You know we looked in a lot of like technology that could scan it and do it automatically.

193
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.730
Unfortunately there was nothing at the moment.

194
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:18.990
Then what we did over here was we kind of figured the whole process capacity.

195
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.720
OK so what this was was you know doing get 20 an hour.

196
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.840
You can put six and you can review ten.

197
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:31.080
Well then on average since this middle one is the bottleneck you can really only do six an hour.

198
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.130
So we just kind of listed out how it can take really six things and an hour and for paying someone $8

199
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.800
an hour.

200
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.640
Well what would it take to get up to here.

201
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.320
Right.

202
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:45.140
And again this is our goal we figured 25000 five thousand pretty good for our initial round of sales

203
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.890
because if I log in and there's twenty five thousand in the database chances are going to get enough

204
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.310
matches that it's worth while again someone might disagree with that.

205
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.400
They might say 100000.

206
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.920
I don't know if using the 100000.

207
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.880
I think that we are best guess was there's something like 50.

208
00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.850
No one really knows because scholarships are really really disconnected.

209
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.470
There's just ones everywhere.

210
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.810
There are some scholarships that literally are only advertised in newspaper like this whenever there's

211
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:09.720
classifieds.

212
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:15.230
Yeah we saw a lot of those ideas and that's what we ended up finding out was that if you use those numbers

213
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.570
then it's going to take 7900 17 hours which will cost us 63.

214
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.100
So that's what the temp was we just figured well at first we're going to spend about $63000 to get all

215
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:31.760
of them in the system and then move on and then on an ongoing basis have these two after about six months

216
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.770
we figured does it take us about six months because of that we had the provider acquisition table here

217
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.590
and this was just well you know so we set our goals right for getting all of the scholarships in those

218
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:48.050
data entry and then we set all of our goals for what our penetration rate was and how schools are going

219
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:53.030
to get and how many sales a sales person would have to bring in.

220
00:12:53.030 --> 00:13:00.650
On average per year and low cost and to be so here we put our goals for providing we put provider acquisition

221
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.710
I believe provider acquisition acquisition is spelled wrong.

222
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:09.010
Was account managers managing the scholarships side and not the school side.

223
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.980
So scholarships themselves institutions usually it's like two people.

224
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.640
They change applications.

225
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.010
And so a lot of times they have questions and they need someone to interface with.

226
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:24.060
So I think we are guessing that we are going to get 3000 scholarship providers on.

227
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.150
We say we want to 25000 scholarships while providers 3000.

228
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:34.010
I mean there's a lot of ones that give away hundreds of scholarships and those ones only get one or

229
00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.360
two.

230
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.610
So I think that was just kind of a guess.

231
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:44.030
Again nobody really knew enough to say you can't get 25000 off a 3000 or it's impossible to get 3000

232
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.200
or there aren't 3000.

233
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.940
These are pretty much best guesses.

234
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.440
We use some basic data that we had found on or someone reast did research on scholarships.

235
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.170
That's what we kind of got a top line how many scholarship providers there were.

236
00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:01.870
And then we kind of use our own efforts to figure out how long it took us to reach out to all of them

237
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:07.070
and then kind of backtracked to figure out well in 18 months assuming this is how many employees we

238
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.770
have maybe we get 3000.

239
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.670
That was our best guess.

240
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.030
And then right here again we figured 50 people per person would make sense.

241
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:20.410
And then total providers I guess this would be over a certain time period per account manager.

242
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.170
I don't actually remember all of the details on this.

243
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.890
This is like the 15th probably iteration of this model so it kept changing and kept change and kept

244
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:28.490
changing.

245
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.290
And then down here we put a cost of acquisition calculations basically it was like Do you have an account

246
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:41.020
manager and they get paid $52000 a year and they can manage 400 people or whatever it is roughly is

247
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.590
roughly spending up $50 per provider right.

248
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.460
So that was an acquisition because we're essentially a two sided marketplace.

249
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.730
We had to get schools and students but also on the flipside of scholarships so either is management

250
00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.790
and acquisition on both sides then now here we set up something for employee bonuses benefits and taxes

251
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.110
and this we just use this kind of a hedge like we really don't want to sit there and figure out what

252
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:11.330
benefits we are going to get and how much it cost and what pricing we could get.

253
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.920
Zoll before like then payroll gusto.

254
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.900
So we just kind of did a.

255
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:21.350
Agassiz said oh 20 percent and we pulled that from some labor statistics we've found that says benefits

256
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.460
on average were worth like 15 percent.

257
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.060
So we wanted to up it to 20 percent.

258
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.760
Then we had payroll taxes.

259
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.690
This had to do I think with the state we were operating in.

260
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.040
And you know like San Francisco has a payroll tax some states have payroll tax.

261
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:41.870
I think that's kind of what it was or or it was the withholdings you have to do in the U.S. where you

262
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.770
have to withhold a certain amount of their income to pay the taxes for them.

263
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:46.810
I don't know it's kind of ridiculous.

264
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.610
And then recruitment refigured Well they're going to hire contractor recruiters or there's just going

265
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.370
to be costs associated with putting up jobs.

266
00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.160
The guys that are put up job postings probably know they are expense.

267
00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.870
So yeah.

268
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:06.020
Twenty five hundred per one that's not really that crazy when a job costs $400 to post things we put

269
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.820
legal and accounting fees kind of separated those out because legal and accounting are just I don't

270
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.230
know it's just a set of expenses you might expect and then we just kind of gave ourselves some room

271
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.970
we figured out another three grand per month per for legal accounting.

272
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.480
We used part time accounting that's pretty easy bookkeeping VERGA.

273
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.040
Seen like bench and it's a good bench dot com or something.

274
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.130
They're just on demand bookkeeping really easy miscellaneous accounting.

275
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:36.140
Not sure why we had that so large but I think it's because we assumed we had set up a law at the very

276
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.900
beginning and then every year for every quarter for taxes would be an X amount of work.

277
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.170
Then the last thing is tax and miscellaneous.

278
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.500
Again set this up so that other people can mess with that as much as they want.

279
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.880
And we put income tax so the percentage of EBIT which is earnings before interest and taxes.

280
00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:00.260
We figured it would be like 30 percent which I don't think is a 100 percent necessary when you do these

281
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:05.150
models because a lot of people just assume you're not going to have retained earnings you're going invest

282
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.430
that back in the company.

283
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.330
Now obviously this depends on the country.

284
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.140
Every country has different tax laws.

285
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.260
The United States has terrible tax laws.

286
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.080
The way we do it is oh that's nice.

287
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.650
You made some money if you put it in your bank account.

288
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.480
You don't spend it.

289
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.380
We're going to tax it.

290
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.140
But if you spend it then we don't tax anything.

291
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.910
I just don't know it just doesn't really make any sense.

292
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.150
We should just tax it on income instead.

293
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.680
But regardless that's how our corporate income tax works so that's kind of what we are guessing.

294
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.000
I think what we did is we looked at our progressive model it's like we have a progressive tax rate so

295
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.890
we looked at it and said Oh our corporate rate is going to be 30 percent based on our estimations.

296
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.120
And that's kind of what he came up with.

297
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.850
And again someone might look at this and go ooh.

298
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.490
I know that startups can get away with paying less in taxes they probably lower that down.

299
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:56.660
And then this is kind of where we'll make a calculation how much we pay in tax.

300
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.290
It's going to be based off of this.

301
00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:05.180
So if we were raising 1.5 million so that sat in our account and we didn't spend it then that's kind

302
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.140
of the tax we would get hit with so we didn't a paying $450000.

303
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.060
And yes that's off of investment.

304
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.780
OK so that pretty much sums up this assumptions.

305
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:23.450
S. I think the only thing left over here I think we try to these are kind of our startup costs so our

306
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.650
startup costs would be $60 $3000 in data entry.

307
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.640
See that there.

308
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.980
Then we figured well OK we got to build out this first V-1 because prior to this we are really just

309
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.560
working on a hacked together prototype.

310
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:42.140
So well we're going to pay X amount in contract front end development and then marketing materials we

311
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:42.770
figured.

312
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.530
I don't know.

313
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.770
This is probably where we take to get the first blast out to get leads in for our salespeople and in

314
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.480
postage fees I don't even know why we spent $20000 in postage fees it's crazy.

315
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:57.470
But the reason why this is front end and not back end was because the assumption was we want Sony's

316
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.400
a specialist in front end and x to design it make it Pertti.

317
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:06.620
And then this is why we would hire architects people who could do the back end because that was the

318
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.840
stuff that consing needs maintenance and changing and front end was just not it doesn't need as much

319
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.510
work or maintenance.

320
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:19.280
Okay so those are pretty much our startup costs and that pretty much sums up everything on this sheet.

321
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:25.190
We use these colors because why not just makes it a lot easier to look at it so it makes it look quite

322
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.280
a bit more polished.

323
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.580
Okay next lecture we're going to move on and start looking at some of these sheets we created like use

324
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.540
of funds monthly income statements and kind of break down what we did there and why we did it.

325
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.910
OK I'll see you then.
