00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,740
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,550
Last Lecture we went over one of the best practices that can really help you add some clarity to your

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,630
sales and operations part of your model if you've forgotten already.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,120
We're talking about the paradigm of looking at your numbers when applicable as a funnel.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:26,370
Anytime you have a user or a customer or a prospect progress from one stage to another and then presumably

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,050
you want them to go through these stages and that signifies that they're paying you more money or are

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,210
more likely to pay you money or they're doing whatever it is that you want them to do like sign up the

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,740
best practice in that scenario is to model it like a funnel.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,330
Now let's try to connect this concept back to the case study that we had finished last.

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,960
S. coworking space example.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,690
Now what might be an example of a funnel in that type of situation.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,590
Mary this is the coworking space we very UN originally called you works well of course.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,210
The obvious answer to this is we have the standard application of a funnel we could make a marketing

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,160
funnel Now Simon obviously didn't model this part yet but one of the costs we will definitely have to

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,030
calculate later on when we pick it back up in the course is the cost of customer acquisition what we

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,390
pay for every paid customer that comes in the door.

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,840
Now depending on how you acquire your customers the funnel process and the cost could vary wildly.

18
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,080
Let's say we were sponsoring events as a way to bring in sales.

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,680
My guess is that the funnel might look like we'll say step one.

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,710
We contact companies about sponsoring them.

21
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,840
Step two we agree to sponsor them.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,170
Step three we sponsor our first event set for receive a lead or a message of interest from someone who

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,990
is in contact with that event and then step five.

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,690
We have our sales contact them and then step 6 they become a customer.

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,330
Now of course if we didn't use sales and really use like an online form that it might be a little bit

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,080
simpler.

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,820
But most of these co-working spaces actually have some form of hand-holding to get you in the door and

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,850
get you situated.

29
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,480
What we could do with this funnel then is to take the total amount of money we spent sponsoring and

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:16,500
merely divide it by the number of people that reached stage 6 and that funnel for that marketing channel.

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,560
That would be our cost of acquisition per customer and we were running ads instead.

32
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,360
We would see a much more traditional funnel displaying ads seeing the ads cooking the ad reading the

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,230
page and then signing up.

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,760
We could then attribute a cost for each part of the funnel as a way of diagnosing internally what we

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,020
need to improve.

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,060
Not necessarily something you put in an outward facing model you share with other people but if you're

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,620
doing this for internal reasons.

38
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,290
Absolutely.

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,670
But then the question is is that the only way we could use funnels with new works.

40
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,250
Well actually of course not.

41
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,650
You could use it on the operations side like we kind of alluded to last lecture.

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,580
Let's say you had a very particular process for people becoming customers.

43
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,740
Let's say they have to go through an interview in an onboarding session.

44
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,580
Then they have to go through a free trial.

45
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,290
Then they have to start paying.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,760
It might be maybe a little over the top but we can just imagine that it's like step by step process

47
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,130
every co-working space has a similar process.

48
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,520
Maybe they're just not as intense.

49
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,690
So how would you model that process I just described.

50
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,580
Well you know you could just list out each phase and then list the number of people over a given period

51
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,520
that made it through each stage then you can get a percentage of how many of your leads became a long

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,090
term paying customers.

53
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,530
Do you see it when you're modeling something out.

54
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,390
It's a lot easier and more accurate to estimate two things.

55
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,960
The cost of getting a lead and then the percentage of leads that convert then just say getting one thing

56
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,120
calculated which is the cost of getting a converting customer.

57
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,770
It might sound like it's easier but it actually kind of screws you over a little bit.

58
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,500
It won't give you nearly as much insight to use that one number.

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,840
Then if you use both of these metrics separately and then use them in tandem to come up with the numbers

60
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,720
you wanted to stick them together.

61
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,400
You just lose a lot of information.

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:11,010
So in almost any case where you have an outbound marketing effort as people are just streaming to you

63
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,650
from everywhere through word of mouth then you need to build out a funnel or at a very minimum just

64
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,140
think of this process like a funnel in order to correctly get the insight and the metrics you need in

65
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,940
your model.

66
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,300
And if you think it's just limited to marketing.

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,400
Remember in the multi-step process that someone might complete can be displayed and used like a funnel

68
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,820
trying to calculate say the cost of training your employees funnel trying to calculate the cost of recruiting

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,530
new employees funnel.

70
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,650
Try to calculate the number or the percentage of retention of customers over five years funnel.

71
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,420
So in short funnel funnel funnel funnel funnel funnel see in the next Lechter.
