1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,700
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,300
So we had a lot of assumptions that we started off with.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:05,590
Right.

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,700
And then we had model out the different sales opportunity revenue options and then we looked at the

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,230
cost side of things as well as making some of the calculations there.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,140
So when you have something like this what might you show.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,420
Right.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,700
So some of the things that we decided to show in terms of a summary was one well we definitely wanted

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:30,030
to show what the revenues and expenses and I look like over time you know first year second year maybe

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,430
the fifth year once its day was and what would happen if there were some changes to major changes to

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,750
the big assumptions right to revenue to expenses.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,260
I mean the timing of this one is pretty cord's a little thing where what if the period to get it to

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,110
opening took two months longer right than where you're going to see revenues drop a little bit more

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,620
in the first year and maybe a little and second year and you're going to go down.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,070
Right.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,030
So we see that.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,300
But if you do it two months earlier than is going to go up by a good amount as well.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,870
So if we put it back to zero it goes back to the base case.

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,880
Now some other things you want to do in a situation like this where you have a lot of assumptions you

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,480
want to pull out some of the core assumptions right.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,080
So we made a lot of assumptions but a few of the core assumptions were going to be the utilization of

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,710
the sims that dictates pretty much everything right.

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,060
And how long it takes you to get from the initial to stabilize utilization.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,590
So one of the things you want to do is run these scenarios and then look at some of the key stats and

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,550
then copy and paste the values and then do it again but change the core assumptions to say a worst case

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,400
and then a best case right.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,520
So we're kind of looking at three different scenarios.

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,140
This is the base case then you know what's kind of the worst case and what's the best case.

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,050
And then you can kind of see with how that impacts the why and how long it takes to break even.

30
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:57,990
This one is to show the pricing of the sims in the hours of operation this is sources and uses is very

31
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,940
common to put in summary of the startup costs including working capital so there's total capital that's

32
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,820
needed.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,620
And then where are you going to get it from.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,890
Right.

35
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,360
So if you can get some of that from a loan that that's how much you need in terms of equity investment

36
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,230
and you as an entrepreneur might come up with some of that.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,190
But then the rest of it will be sought from an investor.

38
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,310
This is another summary that was used in the report.

39
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,880
There you go.

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:33,180
This is the golf tee lounge called the lounge is kind of like a high end indoor golf range with alcohol

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,960
and tapas style foods and you can see from what we did that there are a lot of elements here that if

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,710
you are thinking about doing some sort of a brick and mortar type of business pretty much all the technique

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,910
that you need to know in order to model any brick and mortar type of business is in this model.

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,420
So I know some of it might be new and some maybe might be a little difficult.

45
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,390
Biggest thing is just go through you know look at what the purpose of this is review.

46
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,140
You know what we discuss in the videos and then if you want to see how it's done then trace it right.

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,520
So you want to know for instance hey I want to know how for example how the discounts are done.

48
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,750
Right.

49
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,780
So then if you want to know how this is done and how it's used in the model you highlight the sell go

50
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:26,040
to the formula and in that tab formula tab right and then go to trace dependence on that does is going

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,500
to give you this little arrow and or if you highlight the arrow you see how the mouse goes from a plus

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,810
sign to an arrow that will click and it will give you the worksheet as well as the cells.

53
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,850
So right here it seems like row 87 in simulation sales uses this reference.

54
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,870
So I'm going to go to simulation sales row 87 grand opening discount.

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,400
OK.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Now when you look at the formula so I can see is checking if the month is less than main assumption

57
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,340
when twenty plus one.

58
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,930
Okay so if it's less the main assumption plus one what is an assumption plus one main assumption the

59
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,780
128 is the duration.

60
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,860
How long is the grand opening discounts will last.

61
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,150
So where are we where so.

62
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:18,140
Oh okay if the month is less than that plus one which is three plus one it was less than four.

63
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:26,160
That means month 1 through 3 then it's subtracting that percentage times the sales revenue.

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,380
So was just calculating that discount rate there.

65
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,970
Okay.

66
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,700
So when it does that it should calculate it in the first three months.

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,150
And that's what it does there.

68
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,870
So any time you want to see how something works go to the actual assumption itself the variable right.

69
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,840
Highlight it and then trace it and look at the dependence.

70
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,700
And then you can trace the formulas back and figure out how it's done.
