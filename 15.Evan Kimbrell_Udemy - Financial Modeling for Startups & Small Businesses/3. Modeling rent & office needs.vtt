00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey guys welcome back to the course and this lecture.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.290
We're going to look at a couple of ways to model rent and other office related expenses things that

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.110
tend to depend on the headcount of your team.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.810
Now there is an easy and lazy way to do this.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.340
And then there is a better way to do this.

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.980
We're going to start off with the easy way the easy way is to just assume some sort of per person per

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.240
month costs as an assumption for that line item then the resulting calculation is just your headcount

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.160
at the time times that corresponding costs per person per month.

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
This is an easy solution and if you don't have a good starting point or where to start.

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.230
This is an adequate solution as well because it makes sure that your model is actually factoring in

11
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.760
those costs even if it might be a little off.

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.680
So in the spreadsheet it's going to look something like this.

13
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.560
All right we're looking at the easy solution first.

14
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.600
So let's start with the top right here.

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
This is just the headcount calculations right.

16
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.310
So we're going to start off with something like this.

17
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.330
You know maybe we all start at 1.

18
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.790
And then there's some sort of schedule.

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.740
And these are the head counts for each month for the total head count and then we go all the way to

20
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.980
you know say four years or something like that.

21
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.300
All right.

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.890
There we go.

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.530
And the easy way to calculate the costs that are sometimes related to the head count is to do something

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.270
like this.

25
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.650
So let's say we have the different categories of cost we may have rent some legal expenses communications

26
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.820
of travel and entertainment equipment supplies you know miscellaneous are budget the easy way to do

27
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.900
it is to basically have a cost per person per month for the legal You may have every trainer that you

28
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.620
pay a legal group to be your advisor.

29
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.080
Right.

30
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.800
So it might just be the retainer per month.

31
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:11.550
So for these calculations super treat for rent is just going to be the total headcount at the time times

32
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.610
the per person or per headcount cost per month.

33
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.200
And its the same thing for all of these.

34
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.420
So as we move up in headcount then the cost goes up and then for rent.

35
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.130
Its the same thing except we have to do one more step which is weve got to calculate how much space

36
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.980
youre going to allocate per person in terms of square footage and then you can do what is the per square

37
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.510
foot cost per month.

38
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.580
You know if you're in a pretty expensive market getting some pretty you know class a kind of expensive

39
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.510
office you might be paying 10 bucks per square foot per month or maybe more.

40
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.470
So if you had 120 square feet per person then you're just by yourself.

41
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.580
You have that times the the rate rate there which is $10 per month and then you have your monthly rent.

42
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.500
So then if we extend that calculation for it then as you have more of a head count you have more of

43
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.900
a square footage need and then your rent goes up accordingly.

44
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.950
So that's the easy way to do this.

45
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.600
And you know when you're just starting out you can start off with this kind of solution because it still

46
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.880
allows you to factor these costs in.

47
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.190
There are some things that are missing which we're going to discuss in the next example.

48
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.370
But you know it's something that allows you to capture these cost items.

49
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.220
So at least you're putting it in your model and you're factoring that in.

50
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.060
Now in real life especially when it comes to having a dedicated office space for your team you don't

51
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.030
get to expand on the men and add space as you add an individual employee.

52
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.700
You need to pick an office space and then only when you run out of space you pick a bigger space and

53
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.910
then move into that.

54
00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:01.290
So these kinds of office expenses like rent they're really working like big steps rather than a linear

55
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.120
pulley.

56
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.460
So if you have something like that where you're paying a certain price at a certain headcount and then

57
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.070
only when you pass a certain level you go to the next pricing tier.

58
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.050
That's something that is closer to reality.

59
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.470
Let's see how that works in the model.

60
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:27.670
OK so now let's look at the better solution the better solution is to do something that is more like

61
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.550
this because the better solution is when it comes to something like rent you don't really get to add

62
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.610
on demand with co-working spaces.

63
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.340
You get to do that a little bit more now but traditionally you get a team you get an office you don't

64
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.660
get to just at you know a little bit of office space as you need it.

65
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.690
You tend to have to start off with some space and then as your team grows too big you get to get a bigger

66
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.560
space.

67
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.430
So we might do something like this in terms of the square footage.

68
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.670
We may say Hey let's start with 500 square feet.

69
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:08.290
And then we're going to add a thousand square feet each time every time we add a head count of six or

70
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.290
more people.

71
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.980
OK.

72
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.010
So then what we see is the first month we start with the starting number of square footage and then

73
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:27.460
we will increment this based on the number of council what we can do then is we can do something like

74
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.940
this if there is both a change in the head count.

75
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.790
And if the total headcount at the time is a multiple of six using the model that way we know we've added

76
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.390
at least six.

77
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.460
If that's the case then add the increment which is a thousand feet to the previous square footage.

78
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.240
Otherwise just take the previous square footage.

79
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.210
Okay.

80
00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.730
Now the reason we got to do both the checks we're trying to make sure that they're they're not the same

81
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.220
here.

82
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.420
It's as you see them not we're saying hey if there's no change if there's no change in the previous

83
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.710
month and the model is a multiple of six then we do the increment.

84
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.430
Otherwise make it the same because reason for that is if we don't make this check if we don't do this

85
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:26.710
and check here then it will actually increment to off then it would actually increment every time we

86
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.670
added new headcount we'd go from 1 to 2 we add a thousand and two to three with that thousand.

87
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.530
So we want to make sure that we only add when it isn't changing anywhere.

88
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.160
So this will give an example here.

89
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.270
Let's see where we can see when it actually.

90
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.470
There we go we've got an increment here right.

91
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:54.550
So here we finally have an increment and it's from you know 5 to 6 and it's a multiple of six here.

92
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.790
So then we're doing the increment.

93
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.150
And these are not the same.

94
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.690
Right so here from 6 to 6 they're exactly the same.

95
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.280
And you know even though it's a multiple Here we don't want to add in a thousand square feet again.

96
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.600
Right.

97
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.710
So that's why we do that check to make sure we only add it once every time we increment to a multiple

98
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.350
of six.

99
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.640
All right.

100
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.670
So now that we have that the other thing we can do is we know that cost over time especially if you're

101
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.290
modeling it out over multiple years costs are not going to stay the same.

102
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.350
They're going to generally go up.

103
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.860
So another way to improve your costs projections is to add something called a growth rate to the expense.

104
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.670
So we may start at 100 percent but let's say we want to grow rent at 3 percent a year.

105
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:45.850
What we can do is every time on the 13th month we can basically increment it by the 3 percent.

106
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:53.380
So what it's saying here is hey when it's you know in the 13th month if it is a 13 month then multiply

107
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.780
the previous rate times one plus that this growth rate here.

108
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.210
Otherwise just make it equal to the previous rate.

109
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:08.290
So then we end up seeing is in any given year it's the same until we get to the next one and then we

110
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.130
increment it.

111
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.710
Now there's an error here.

112
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.690
I checked it in the 11th month instead of the 13 months.

113
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.670
So what we've got to do here is actually we have to do a subtraction and that in addition because we

114
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.490
don't want to add it on the 12 month we've got to do it on that 13 month.

115
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.930
So I'm going to copy and paste that over and then we'll do another check right here to make sure we

116
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.530
got it right.

117
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.280
So the change should happen in the 13 months now.

118
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.080
So we see that from 11 to 12 right here.

119
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:39.410

120
11:49 That's right and then we go check again to see if it's incrementing from month 24 to 25.

121
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.610
So month 24 to 25.

122
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.080
It's right here month 24 and 25.

123
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.710
There we go.

124
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.730
We got that little bump here.

125
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.280
So now you've got that correctly.

126
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.720
So then what we do in terms of these costs now we can do them the same way as we did before but now

127
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:04.840
we're doing an increase we're multiplying by headcount times the cost but we're also multiplying by

128
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.680
the growth rate.

129
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.450
So when it's a 100 percent it's just the same.

130
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:15.420
But as we get to later months if we go to somewhere towards the end here we'll get a formula here.

131
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:22.710
We see that now it's multiply it by 100 9 percent so there's that growth factor included in your costs

132
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.350
projections now.

133
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.790
So then once we do that for all of them all of these are then what we can do is we can add it up again.

134
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:37.380
And now this way of doing it this way the way we did the rents is a better projection.

135
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.020
It grows more in line with what it normally happens in reality.

136
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.850
And then for these other expenses we're also accounting for the fact that expenses tend to grow at least

137
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.660
with inflation.

138
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.200
So this is a good way to account for that.
