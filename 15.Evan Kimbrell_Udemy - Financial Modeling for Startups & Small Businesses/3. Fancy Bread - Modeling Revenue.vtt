00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.910
Are right we are back and we are looking at the revenue worksheet for the fancy bread.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.110
So the first things is we wanted to put in our major assumptions right.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.070
So for this one big things we have the pricing tiers three tiers.

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.160
What do we know about the maximum number of hours for free guests.

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.240
The guests rate though there does seem we're going to treat them as three separate inputs just because

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.250
well if you change them or if the plan changes it's easy to change here.

7
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.700
OK.

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.520
So they may want to change the guest rate so that for these higher tiers it might be cheaper and may

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.890
be $5 here and $3 you don't know.

10
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.810
This makes it a little bit easier to do.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.360
Now the other thing is we're not just making revenue from these customers right that are paying per

12
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.800
month on a subscription.

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.640
We're going to be making some revenue from some of the guests that are going to be paying $6 for each

14
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.260
hour that they're using.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.400
So some other assumptions that we're going to have to make around for the revenue is what percentage

16
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.030
of the customers in these tears are actually going to be bringing guests in and of those who are bringing

17
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.860
guess what percentage of those have guests over ASH that uses more than their allotted guest hours.

18
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.430
Right.

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.470
And then making some assumptions around one of those that are over on average how many hours are they

20
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.950
over.

21
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.480
OK.

22
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.970
So there's a set of assumptions here that we're going to be using in order to generate the projections

23
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.830
for the revenue.

24
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.790
I'm going to zoom out a little bit now here one of the things you always want to start off with is the

25
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.570
timing.

26
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.980
Okay.

27
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.860
So for the fancy bread one we have we looked at the startup costs Earlier we looked at this where we

28
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
have each of the costs assigned to a certain timing during the startup period.

29
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.310
Right.

30
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.580
So we design the startup period to have three distinct stages starting with six months of development

31
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.380
three months of beta 3 months of launch and then this through out means just throughout this entire

32
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.910
period of the startup period.

33
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.860
So in the revenue part we want to look at the timing because the first 12 months whatever these phases

34
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.750
of the start of thats before we have the revenues.

35
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.330
Thats just development and theres beta and then theres launch.

36
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.350
So we are going to assume that we don't have customers coming in until afterwards.

37
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.370
Okay now what are some things that we can do here we can start with driving some atts right.

38
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.420
Maybe we have ads that were driving certain impressions in that were targeting to get on a consistent

39
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.070
basis.

40
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.470
And then of those ads were going to get some sort of a click through.

41
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.910
Now this one we don't want to assume some sort of flat click through rate just like X percentage.

42
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.020
I mean thats an easy way to model it but chances are you're probably going to get better over time.

43
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.250
Right.

44
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.200
So you may pick something conservative and then pick something a little bit better that you try to reach

45
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.580
over a certain period of time.

46
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.060
Hopefully you can do better than that over time right.

47
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.150
But let's say they're only able to start at 1 percent click through rate.

48
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.830
Okay.

49
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.610
And then of those that click through there's a certain percentage that they can convert into customers.

50
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.340
Okay.

51
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.150
So again we're going to say they're starting at some pretty low conversions.

52
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.530
And then eventually they're doing a little bit better still not like super incredible but you know we

53
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.000
can change these assumptions right.

54
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.040
The main thing is we're setting this we're building this model in such a way where we could account

55
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.060
for these changes.

56
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.720
So what we're saying is hey we're going to started off at these rates.

57
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.150
And and then 12 months over a 12 month period they can grow into these newer rates but it doesn't start

58
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.110
in month 1.

59
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.520
Why.

60
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.170
Because it hasn't launched yet still in development so one of the things about this modeling here is

61
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.870
we needed to be smart enough to kick in when it's actually launch.

62
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.170
So when does it actually launch.

63
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.930
Well the first three months here there's going to be some additional spend during that period for the

64
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.650
ad impressions.

65
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.440
So then that's when the click through rates and the conversions start to kick in.

66
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.290
So that kicks in there and we program it to kick in there.

67
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.570
So the way it's done if you look at the formulas very carefully and we pull it up so that we can see

68
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.770
it more clearly here.

69
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.220
If you want to explore how it's done.

70
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.760
First thing to look at is look at what is this big function here trying to do this function is choosing

71
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.870
between one thing and then another thing here.

72
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.190
Right.

73
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.480
So this is the other thing which is a bigger function we can break that down later.

74
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.950
You know this first thing is hey men of one or the other.

75
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.080
So when we use them in we basically again set the maximum value that it could be.

76
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.510
So if we're choosing the minimum between what it's stabilize here and something else that's what we're

77
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.100
seeing is the maximum number that we want to have in here.

78
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.380
Right.

79
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.280
So that's the stabilize that's the max number that we want to have here and that's what it's doing what

80
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.980
we're doing is hey we want to check to make sure we are in the correct period for starting that it is

81
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.470
after the first two periods after that development and beta.

82
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.880
That's why it's calling here.

83
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:16.540
So it's in the launch once it's launch and if it's in that period then it's going to be adding the difference

84
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.870
between this over the 12 month period.

85
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.620
We're going to grow it's straight.

86
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.890
But as it keeps adding You don't want it to get higher and higher.

87
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.280
So by having the men it sets the limit to that.

88
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.050
So that's basically what it's doing.

89
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.240
And that way allows us to see start at where it's supposed to be starting at 1 and it grows and then

90
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.880
once it gets back to seven points and 5 it's flattens out right.

91
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.670
So you see that it gets to influence 5 and it just flattens out all the way OK.

92
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.770
So there's just one decimals are not showing.

93
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.230
Now for the conversions we do something similar.

94
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.190
So anytime you have something where you think you are going to start off at a certain level but either

95
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.940
get better or maybe get worse.

96
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.470
You want to do something like this.

97
00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.670
Now these two are assumed to get better.

98
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.590
So it's programmed to get better.

99
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.470
This formula here.

100
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.570
It's actually not designed for the opposite direction right now.

101
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.700
We're going to see that later on with something else.

102
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.440
But right now these are designed to increase so if we flip these around these formulas you're going

103
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.210
to look really wonky just as an f y.

104
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.930
All right so after that after we have the conversions then we got to make some assumption around what

105
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:30.760
is the breakdown in terms of which customers are fall into which category of the plans.

106
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.050
So we may do something similar.

107
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.110
We may have some plan where initially a lot more people are trying things out right.

108
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.490
So we may have something where it's maybe like this.

109
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.970
And this is more like 65.

110
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.650
But then over time we get some you know more people that fall into the trial and then some other people

111
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:54.730
that just move directly to the high use and then much far fewer people maybe fall in the middle if that's

112
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.130
the case then you can do it like this.

113
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.930
Now the mechanics here are going to be very similar but you'll see that the formula is a little bit

114
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.760
longer now.

115
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.070
It's very similar to what we did before.

116
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.210
We have to determine it to start in the correct month.

117
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.620
But if this is lower or higher we needed to increase or decrease.

118
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.990
Can't you see that for luminary are going from 15 to 45.

119
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.010
But then the x 4 requirement some 65 to 45.

120
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.970
So this model looks the function this equation looks a little bit more complicated but all it's saying

121
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.970
is we've got to decide which you know right here we're deciding if this is greater than that then we're

122
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.380
going to assume that it's decreasing.

123
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.940
But otherwise we're going to assume it that it's increasing.

124
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.450
It's increasing then we're going to set use that as a maximum value if it's decreasing then we're going

125
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.540
to use this as a minimum value.

126
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.210
So we're going 65 to 45 and we're decreasing over time.

127
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.310
We don't want it to keep getting lower and lower and lower.

128
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.790
And here the opposite right just like before going from 15 to 45 we don't want it to keep going higher

129
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.710
and higher and going above the 45.

130
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.650
So that's what this equation does.

131
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.900
It starts it in the correct value starting in month 10.

132
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:15.880
We see that it matches right here right 65 20 and 15 then 12 months later we see that it reaches its

133
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.730
final stabilize rate 45 10 and 40 there.

134
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:28.930
So what if we change something what if we make this 40 and then this is forty five So is still 45 right.

135
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.290
But what do we have now we have it starting at 40.

136
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.320
Now we have the other one starting at 40.

137
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.760
So you see that we don't know which ones can be less or more until we set the inputs here.

138
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.690
So this is designed to account for both kinds of inputs.

139
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:46.420
It doesn't assume that it's growing.

140
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.730
It could be decreasing.

141
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.050
All right.

142
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.180
So I want to get back to that right now.

143
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.490
Now this model looks more complicated study these two first.

144
00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:00.250
I mean this equation looks complicated study the earlier equations first and you'll be able to trace

145
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:00.450
it.

146
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.400
So then once we have the percentage breakdown we can use those percentages to calculate the actual new

147
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.950
monthly customers.

148
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.550
That's just basically the percentage times the total conversions for that month.

149
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.880
And by breaking down by those percentages there.

150
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:20.100
Now the next thing which we've done before is well we probably want to assume that there's some attrition

151
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.110
we could assume similar rate like this and attrition that gets lower and lower over time but we kind

152
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.930
of did that quite a bit already so I'm going to do it this way.

153
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.820
Now if you want to convert the attrition to be something like this that will be a challenge for you

154
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.180
okay try to make it work the same way you have attrition that you know if you get you're getting better

155
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.560
over time or getting worse over time.

156
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.060
It can adjust for that.

157
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.490
Okay.

158
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.380
So that's attrition.

159
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:51.970
And then one other thing we're going to think about like we've done before was well there's probably

160
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.920
going to be some movement right from one tier to another tier.

161
00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:01.750
So one way to do that is since we only have these three tiers this matrix here of movement.

162
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.870
We're just going to whatever the percentages can be read that 2 percent will move from the Creator to

163
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.530
the explorer.

164
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.350
So from from this to this.

165
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:10.700
OK.

166
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.750
So this means 5 percent of the Explorer is going to move to creator in a given month.

167
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.510
And 3 percent of the Explorers can move to luminary.

168
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.810
That means they're basically a percent of the Explorers and to upgrade to the higher tier.

169
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.360
Okay.

170
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.240
And then you know some of the creators are going to downgrade to explorer but some are going to upgrade

171
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.070
and then you know there's some that are going to downgrade from the luminary to the creator here.

172
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.770
But very few are going to downgrade to explore.

173
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.720
OK so we have these movements.

174
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.300
What we can do is and we can calculate these movements.

175
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:40.590
Right.

176
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.330
So we're going to calculate the movements from and then the movements to each of these.

177
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:45.720
OK.

178
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:53.850
So then we it's basically just tracking where those from and twos are going to pay because these are

179
00:10:53.850 --> 00:11:00.930
going to be zero and it doesn't matter what we can do is we can just take the some of these times the

180
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:06.500
actual number of explorers for them because we're moving from right.

181
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.800
So those are moving from and then moving to we're going to have to actually find those two cells where

182
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.220
it's moving to multiply by the correct tiers right.

183
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.400
So there's 2 percent from the creators and then the zero present from the luminary.

184
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.400
And that's what's moving to the explorers.

185
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.110
Now if we look at that luminary it's coming from X floor and creator.

186
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:32.970
So then it's going to have 3 percent from the explorers plus 5 percent of the creators coming in.

187
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.470
Okay.

188
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.590
Now in the beginning we don't have anything because it doesn't start till month 10 but once we get to

189
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.770
month 10 we're going to start this movement as well.

190
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.200
Okay.

191
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.960
From there then we can have our final new customer account.

192
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.490
Okay.

193
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:51.690
And then once we have a final customer account we've got to do also our cumulative customer count because

194
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.120
remember this is a monthly subscription.

195
00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:00.390
So every customer that stays is a customer that pays another monthly subscription for that month.

196
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:06.490
So now we have total's customer account we can calculate the monthly subscriptions by each tier.

197
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.950
Now here after that that's where we're going to do the guess.

198
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.270
Right.

199
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.480
So we have the guests bringing customers based on these percentages and then we have the percentage

200
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:22.830
of customers that are have guess overages and then what does the average guess hours read by each each

201
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.320
group and then from there we have the guess overage revenue.

202
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:33.690
Okay so then we add that up with the direct gross revenue of the customers for their monthly dues Plus

203
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:39.790
the guests overages then we have the total monthly revenue for each of the months for each of the customer

204
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.610
groups.

205
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:46.800
So there you have it that's way for us to model the business model or the revenue side of fancy bread.

206
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.740
Now in the next lecture we're going to look at some of the expenses.
