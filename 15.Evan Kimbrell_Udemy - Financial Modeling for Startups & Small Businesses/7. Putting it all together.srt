00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,740
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,190
All right.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,010
So here we are at the end of our roundabout tour of modeling modeling if you haven't figured it out

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,380
yet it's really just an exercise in getting to understand your business and your industry better or

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,420
in what I call.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,990
Oh that's right.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,080
We have employees we need to include those.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,760
So far everything we've covered are things you would need to see in almost every financial model.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:32,430
This isn't just limited to startups trying to disrupt their eternal nemesis email not a real problem

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,400
by the way or small businesses.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,090
At the end of the day regardless of your aspirations for your business we all share the same components

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,490
and the same need to answer specific questions about our situation.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,800
Every business will have both revenue and expenses.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,630
Every business will need to understand the relationship between these two halves.

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,250
You will have burned.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,640
You will have labor you'll have contingency and you will have unexpected expenses.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,850
For the most part you'll be operating off of a whole lot of assumptions about a whole lot of things.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,330
So now that we've covered the fundamentals the thing that every business has in common We're now going

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,300
to branch out into the things that not every business will necessarily have.

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,950
These are the things that vary by the business model and e-commerce store for instance doesn't have

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,150
to calculate churn but an online SAS tool does the same SAS startup won't have to deal with estimating

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,590
the unit cost and macro facts of hundreds of possible products.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,020
But a food delivery business might so in the next set of sections till the end of the course we're going

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,200
to hit on all the popular models will cover things like e-commerce businesses brick and mortar businesses

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,260
will cover aggregators when you don't even sell anything you just connect people other businesses cover

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,440
businesses that rely heavily on sales to business and sales of very few but high ticket items.

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,010
Now you don't have to watch every single one of these but I do suggest you do well because more learning

28
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,530
is better than less learning.

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,680
But if you don't have the time then just pick out one or two that you think are the most familiar to

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
your business or propose business and they just follow that one.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,080
Also worth mentioning is you can download any of the models at the beginning of the case studies so

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,900
feel free to build off of them.

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,360
Follow along or just modify them as you please.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,860
All right guys.

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,520
I will see you in the next section.
