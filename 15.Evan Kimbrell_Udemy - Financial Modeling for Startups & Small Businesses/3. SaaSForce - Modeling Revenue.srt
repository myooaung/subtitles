1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,010
Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,820
We did the single salesperson economics and you were able to see that there's going to be some more

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,040
expenses from the person it's going to outpace their bookings initially.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,360
There's a general trend where you're going to have some losses in terms of investing in a salesperson

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,950
first and then over time you can earn that back and then gain a profit.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:32,700
Right so now we're going to look at how can we take that process and build it into a revenue model for

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,380
the company.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:42,610
So the only difference here is let's say we have the timing here but now we have a sales team.

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,220
Okay.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,610
And the sales team are going to grow it kind of like the headcounts that we've done before.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,130
Right I say we're going to start off with three sales people starting in month 11 and then we're going

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,950
to add two every two months until we get to a sales team of 25.

13
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,740
Okay.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,330
So if you see this to the right here we're going to see a growing growing and growing until we get to

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,410
25.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,560
Okay that's what that's doing right there.

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,680
Now why in month 11.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,380
You know we have the start up worksheet here is very similar to what you've done before so I'm not going

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,050
to go over it too much but let's say that there's an initial development that took nine months is a

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,360
beta maybe you know period.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,310
And then there's an official launch that has a big marketing push that takes over the course of a month.

22
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,160
And that timing is coming here.

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,680
So we hired the sales team though right around here during beta right.

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,850
So maybe initially just the founding team kind of does their own sales or with the early customers clients

25
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,890
that trying it out but then they start bringing in sales teams when they want to really get ready and

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,200
ramp up for the launch or we can change that.

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,670
That's just what the assumption here is.

28
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,490
Okay.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:00,360
So then what we got to do then is we basically need to do the same thing that we did for the per person

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,820
economics here where we had we tracked their annual contract values and then adjusted for attrition

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,990
converted it to monthly recurring revenue adjusted with churn to get the actual monthly recurring revenues

32
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,930
which is what is actually built and collected right so that's your real revenue.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,030
We did it for one person.

34
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,090
So what would it look like for a whole team.

35
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,970
Now this is where conceptually it's exactly the same as what we did but executing it in the model a

36
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,330
little bit harder.

37
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:37,950
Okay let me explain why we are going to have to track the sales team by cohort of which month they came

38
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,760
in or were higher.

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,750
That's because every cohort has that learning curve that we did right.

40
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,300
This activity curve and they're going to have their own performance straw.

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,240
So it's all staggered somebody who's joining in months you know two months later is going to have a

42
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,250
different curve.

43
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,780
They're not going to just suddenly be 100 percent right.

44
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,300
So each cohort has to be tracked separately.

45
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:07,530
If I'm modeling this out for five years for 60 months Well guess what we're going to track it for 60

46
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,530
cohorts.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,380
You see that.

48
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,630
So what I'm doing here then is I'm tracking the head count by each cohort.

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,870
This is the month where they were hired.

50
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,340
OK so you know we didn't start hiring until the 11th month so guess what.

51
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,280
We hired three people in the 11th month.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,550
All right.

53
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,330
So that's why that cohort size stays at three for the love month.

54
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:27,870
OK.

55
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,700
Now once we have the actual head count by cohort so mean squeeze that down because that's what that

56
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,650
you know here's the total total headcount.

57
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,570
We got to make sure it matches right.

58
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,510
So it does match.

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,760
So we didn't do anything wrong here.

60
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,560
Remember that we try to check as often as we can in our in our models to make sure it's accurate.

61
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,250
OK.

62
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,390
Another modeling practice sometimes you know I have the month up here but because when I'm looking at

63
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,400
all these cells sometimes I just want to put it in the middle as well it's easier to access so I can

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,740
refer to this line instead of having this row all the way back to the top.

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,650
It's choice.

66
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,120
You don't have to do that but if you start building in these building these kinds of models where you're

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,280
starting to get too close to a thousand rolls it's going to come in a little handy when you do that.

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,960
So what do we do first.

69
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,720
Well let's look at total new bookings right.

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,290
The annual contract values first because that's what we did.

71
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,050
We got it.

72
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,040
Hey what was the annual contract value that was booked in that month.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,160
But we got to do it by cohort.

74
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,900
So here we see that each cohort We're tracking the annual contract value of that cohort so that cohort

75
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,880
add more people to first one had three right.

76
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,460
So these could be higher versus the other ones where they're at each of the other cohorts.

77
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,690
Every two months apart.

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,030
And they were staggered so every next cohort is a little bit later.

79
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,460
Right.

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,250
Two months kind of delayed in terms of their productivity and reaching their full sales schedule.

81
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,840
But after a while they're all going to kind of reach the same level when they're stabilized.

82
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,240
Okay.

83
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,650
So that is what we're win here we have the annual contract value.

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,550
And once we have the annual contract value let's look at sales attrition so we can do the sales attrition

85
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,350
again.

86
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,180
We had a attrition schedule too.

87
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,330
Maybe they're more likely to quit in the first month that they join.

88
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,060
And a lot less likely.

89
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,600
You know after 12 months or something.

90
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,930
Right.

91
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,700
So we can't just have a global attrition we have to have attrition schedule that follows each cohort.

92
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,650
You'll see it here.

93
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,920
So basically doing the same thing but I'm tracking it with each row now for each cohort and then for

94
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,390
that after we account for the attrition.

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,660
Now we have the actual net bookings right.

96
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,420
So that's just the sum of these two.

97
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,030
OK.

98
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,070
So then we have net bookings but it's now by cohort we tracked it by cohort.

99
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,920
So then when we have that number we can calculate the total new monthly recurring revenue that's coming

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,520
in from that month and it's going to be tracked by cohort as well.

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,830
So you see that for each of them that is the net bookings the annual contract value divided by 12 because

102
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,630
that's what's actually collected even though that's the contract value that was booked that month.

103
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,540
So now we have that.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,480
But again if we want to track the correct revenues we don't just look at the new monthly recurring revenue

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,680
that's coming in from that month.

106
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,920
We also got to then add in the monthly recurring revenue from all the prior bookings right.

107
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,000
And we do the same.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,480
We can track that for each cohort get.

109
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,190
So we have all the prior month bookings for each of the cohorts here.

110
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,350
So we have something like this where you have a lot of cohorts to track.

111
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,340
Generally you're not modeling it for more than five years out.

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,690
A lot of you can probably do just two to three years out.

113
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,700
But I did this year to show you that you know it can be done.

114
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,470
You don't really need to go farther than this.

115
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,020
So you know about 60 cohorts which one for each month is going to be more than enough for ninety nine

116
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,560
point nine percent of you guys.

117
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,850
OK so now we have the new bookings from that month plus the prior Billings right for the monthly recurring

118
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,350
revenue.

119
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,940
And then we also factor in churn churn for each of the cohorts.

120
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,390
Then when we hit once we have that we can do the total month of recurring revenues which is what's actually

121
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,980
billed because it is exactly the same rates what I want you to do if you're if you're really looking

122
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,570
into this is to look at the formulas for these.

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,170
Okay.

124
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,600
So for all of these big blocks squares here I only put the formulas in the first.

125
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,360
Basically this first left corner here.

126
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,560
And once I have the formula I copy and paste it for you know all of the cohorts all the way to all 16

127
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,260
months.

128
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,150
So just look at this first formula here.

129
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,730
And when you do that you can figure out how it's calculated.

130
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,130
By now you've seen quite a bit rate you see in quite a few formulas if you want me to explain every

131
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,530
single formula here is going to extend the time for this lecture for by a lot.

132
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,000
So I don't want to I don't want to get into the very specifics because you can just dive into them.

133
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,400
The formulas are actually all there for you to look at.

134
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,980
That is the revenue actually you know conceptually is pretty simple right.

135
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:11,100
You know we took the economics of the single salesperson but we just applied it to an entire hiring

136
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,260
schedule for a whole sales team.

137
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,660
Now next we're going to look at the expense side of things.
