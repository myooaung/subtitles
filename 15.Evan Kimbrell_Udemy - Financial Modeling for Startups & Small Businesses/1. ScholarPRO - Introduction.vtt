00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.410
Hey hey hey.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.330
Welcome back to the chorus.

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.750
So to break up the pace a little bit from the let's do a theoretical case study pattern.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.870
I'm actually going to instead go over that in a real case study.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.320
So in the next couple lectures we're not going to review how you would set up a mini putt facility or

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.100
a co-working space or a club pub rip off.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.350
We're going to analyze my last startup called scholar pro Yes we're going to go over a real model we

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.250
created about five years ago to raise a real round of capital.

9
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.020
Everything you're going to see and hear is a retelling of a real startup that went through four incubators

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.190
Yes four and raised three rounds of capital only to fold a couple years later.

11
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.700
Now why exactly did my sort of fail.

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.500
Obviously not a hundred percent sure because I had left about two years prior to this to work in venture

13
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.070
capital.

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.790
But I can guess and I will theorize in the next couple lectures zero set down children gather by the

15
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.100
fire and let me spin you a tale of a horrible a dysfunctional organization.

16
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.090
That was my first failed startup.

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.580
I say dysfunctional because well I won't get into it but let's just say it failed.

18
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.020
Therefore bad.

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.560
I said once upon a time in college I was a young naive lad and I was also a co-founder and a duo of

20
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.040
founders that wanted to solve the problem of higher education costs and specifically the efficient allocation

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.600
of private scholarships.

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.040
So you see when you go to college at least in the United States you really only have four options to

23
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.340
finance your education one you have to have your own money perhaps from a rich uncle or from your parents

24
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850
who just really want to get you out of the house.

25
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.740
The second often is you get financial aid which is calculated based on your lack of resources back in

26
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.270
category 1.

27
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.170
Typically financial aid covers everything for people who are extremely poor and then some varying degrees

28
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.040
of a fraction for ones that have some means.

29
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.100
Now if your family made $50000 for instance you might not even qualify for financial aid and that's

30
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.430
even if it's for a single parent and you have five siblings so considering that some private schools

31
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.440
in the U.S. cost $50000 just a year it doesn't make a ton of sense and you can understand why a lot

32
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.720
of people are in a pinch.

33
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.190
Now the third source of funding you have are loans either from the school itself the federal government

34
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.180
or the guys largely responsible for the financial panic in 2008.

35
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.640
Fannie Mae also known as private lenders.

36
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.550
These are usually just typical loans with OK interest rates around like 6 to 9 percent it's actually

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.160
capped by the federal government.

38
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.730
And sometimes they have things like payment deferment and or other amenities.

39
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.790
And then lastly you have number four for fourth source of income which are scholarships now scholarships

40
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.200
are supposed to be based on a mix of merit.

41
00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.440
I see you do well in school and need i.e. you can't afford college otherwise scholarships come from

42
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.980
either your university or through private lenders.

43
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.370
Now here's where it gets interesting.

44
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.570
Now we all know that the United States has a horrible problem with student debt and college affordability.

45
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.060
I don't need to throw numbers at you because it gets crazy.

46
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.270
I have classmates that estimate it will take them 30 years to pay off all of their debt just in time

47
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:29.350
for them to retire maybe at the same time the government says that every year it is something like $10

48
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.890
trillion exists in what we call unmet need.

49
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.850
Now let me break down what that term means because you don't all work in financial aid when you give

50
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.300
the government via your school your financial information.

51
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.420
They'll make a calculation of your ability to pay for college.

52
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.350
They'll also make a calculation of how much you would need an assistant.

53
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.710
So we just call that your need is essentially your need for assistance.

54
00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.760
They then try their best to give you enough financial aid and loans to cover that amount they calculate

55
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.120
but they never completely cover that amount and add up all of that portion that isn't met and that's

56
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.650
how you get those statistics.

57
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.520
There's about $10 billion a year that the government says students cannot reasonably afford.

58
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.060
But they also cannot help you out with so good luck.

59
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.280
So people are kind of desperate for financing of any kind.

60
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.670
Now here's the twist.

61
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.130
So why is it that at the same exact time when there's $10 billion of unmet need floating out there that

62
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:40.740
there's over $100 billion in scholarship money a year that is actually given back to their donors because

63
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.190
they don't get enough applicants for their scholarship.

64
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.270
Yes let that sink in for a moment.

65
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.310
How many people didn't go to college that qualify for scholarships and they just didn't apply.

66
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.910
Yes.

67
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.200
So few people apply to scholarships that they literally cannot give their free money away.

68
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.490
It's it's ridiculous.

69
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.580
Such a weird circumstance.

70
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.410
So the solution presumably was our startup called scholar Parow not terribly original.

71
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.070
We found out the main reasons people didn't apply for scholarships was because one they didn't know

72
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.880
that they existed and to the scholarships themselves had zero coordination and work would require hundreds

73
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.160
of hours of students time to cover even a moderate portion of their unmet need.

74
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.760
So we decided to create a system that could index all of the scholarships across the country compile

75
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.280
their applications and then create what we call a common application for each student.

76
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.940
If you're someone who applied to college in the United States you might have used what was called the

77
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.060
Common Application the one that worked as instead of filing out 20 college applications and answering

78
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.180
the same questions over and over.

79
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.920
Yes this is my birthdate.

80
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.400
Yes.

81
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.420
This is my father's middle name and this is why I want to go to college.

82
00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.280
You could just do it once and they would send it out to all of the colleges for you instead.

83
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.520
Then any differences in the individual applications and the common application could be called a supplement.

84
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.150
And if the student wanted to say go to Harvard Well then you have to answer a couple more essays that

85
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.370
were part of Harvard's supplement.

86
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.380
So hopefully you are following along.

87
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.320
That's what we wanted to do with scholarships.

88
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.930
And wild guess what.

89
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.320
Eighty five percent of scholarship applications in the United States overlap.

90
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.280
It was like close to 70 percent of their questions to target the whole issue of finding the scholarships.

91
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.760
Wow.

92
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.370
That would be fixed by just doing a better job of rounding them up to begin with.

93
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.800
At this point the only way to find scholarships in the U.S. was to use Google.

94
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.320
And then there's a company called fast web which you actually referred to before which is an insidious

95
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.860
company that helped you find scholarships.

96
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.040
But really there is a search engine that sold your information to private lenders.

97
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.780
So that was it.

98
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.490
You want scholarships you go to our system you search based on your criteria.

99
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.800
It says who you can apply to and it's a common application for you to fill out.

100
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.830
OK so there were a lot of different ways to make money off of this business.

101
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.400
You could sell consumer subscriptions to the individual person applying.

102
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.530
You could charge them every time you send out an application.

103
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.420
You can put up ads to make the whole thing free.

104
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.900
You can also sell data if you're a terrible person.

105
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.630
We tried a lot of these things minus you know selling data because that's sleazy for about two years.

106
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.010
We tried selling seats directly through colleges.

107
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.910
Colleges know how much their students are struggling with financing and they don't really know what

108
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.700
to do their kind of stuck in the middle.

109
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:40.190
It also really sucks when you have someone drop out because of cost or lowers or your school's retention

110
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.970
numbers and eliminates some of the best applicants that could have gone there.

111
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.070
This unfortunately didn't really work out for us.

112
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:51.620
Selling to the colleges he didn't give that to their students because the sales cycle i.e. the time

113
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.100
it takes to complete a sale was insanely long.

114
00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:01.040
They were so bureaucratic that even if you had 10 people in a department saying yes we want it it could

115
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.780
easily take 18 months before they ever pay you.

116
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.540
You can't run a startup off of that.

117
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:11.480
So instead we decided to sell yearly subscriptions and use colleges as a vehicle instead to just promote

118
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.550
the systems.

119
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.270
It's easy for colleges to send out an email and it saves us a lot of money from placing ads everywhere

120
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.030
trying to get students to come to the Web site.

121
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.370
The idea was that the student would sign up then apply and then we would store all their data on the

122
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:30.990
application statuses and then auto reapply them for new ones as they came up.

123
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.410
If we had the information and their consent that's why we were thinking a yearly subscription model

124
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.450
at this time.

125
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.680
Believe it or not you can apply for scholarships year around and while you're in college if I had obviously

126
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.060
to do it all over again.

127
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.810
No I would not have pursued the same model but.

128
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.060
Well such is life.

129
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.360
OK so enter the business model we are about to look over.

130
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:56.120
This model was true story used to raise our second round of capital.

131
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:03.560
We were gunning for 1.5 million and we raised I think is a little bit under a million like 950000 I

132
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.720
think because we wanted to close earlier and get out of that fundraising hell limbo because when your

133
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.650
fundraising can't do anything other than fund raise it just sucks up that much time.

134
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:17.570
So if you think the models we've been going over in this course can't possibly be good enough to raise

135
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.300
money.

136
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:25.070
Actually think again this model is a little bit more complicated because we needed some more like standard

137
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.210
information like profit loss statements.

138
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.130
But we could have easily made it shorter and simpler.

139
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.130
I also did a lot of things wrong which you will see because well I was 21 at the time.

140
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:42.530
OK so let's recap before we jump and scholar was an application online like a web application that you

141
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:49.640
paid yearly to use it connected you to scholarships you're eligible for an expedited the application

142
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.210
process by eliminating redundancies.

143
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.470
Our main channel of acquisition was universities themselves in the reserves it's all try to include

144
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.970
as much literature as I can if you don't feel like you understand this well enough or maybe when we

145
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.590
go out there going to be models it'll come together a little bit more either way I'll see you in the

146
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.160
next lecture.
