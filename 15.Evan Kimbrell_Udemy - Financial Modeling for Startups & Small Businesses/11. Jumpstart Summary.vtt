00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.610
Hey guys welcome back to the chorus.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.160
Long time no see.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.930
Hopefully Simon didn't take you astray and I'm assuming we're still selling lemonade and haven't pivoted.

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.120
Is something weird like buying and selling lemon futures.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.450
OK so we've made it through our little warm up exercise.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.580
Got introduced or reintroduced to what models at their bare essentials look like something that's worth

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.690
understanding especially if you're someone who considers the idea of complex modeling to be intimidating.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.480
Is that if you can wrap your head around that basic version of a model we just ran.

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.640
You can easily figure out the more complex models down the road all financial models follow that same

10
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.080
rough pattern.

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.470
We think about our business.

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.560
We research.

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.390
We write all of that down all the aspects of our business we can think about or think are worth analyzing

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.880
and then we make some educated assumptions.

15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.790
Now every industry is going to be a little bit different but still any time you model you're going to

16
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.350
need to cover the same things.

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.470
We just covered unit economics demand prediction average transaction value.

18
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.100
Planning for expansion overhead etc. etc. it's important to keep in mind that the activity of financial

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.430
modeling is really just an activity of getting to know your business better and doing your best to understand

20
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.090
the logistical and market dynamics that are going to affect you going forward if you improve your skill

21
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.480
at building models you'll improve your overall ability to understand and predict your business whatever

22
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.350
it may be.

23
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.660
The reason we ran through this basic example first is because it's an essential building block that

24
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.650
you can master easily and then quickly grow from.

25
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.320
We didn't even touch things like ramping up sales seasonality marketing campaigns taxes good old taxes

26
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.190
employees training turnover week days versus week ends we can model things like cash flow.

27
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.400
We could model how everything would change if we took outside investment and infuse that into our growth

28
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.300
projections.

29
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.920
We could model the complexity of fixed price licensing for locations we could cover franchising.

30
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.720
There are a lot of different levels of complexity we could add and we'll add throughout this course.

31
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.370
But we wanted to make sure that we're all essentially on the same page.

32
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.650
Before we go forward into the more complex stuff.

33
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.510
All right next section we're going to start talking about the best practices of modeling so you know

34
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.740
them before you start to actually build out more complex systems and start getting into more modern

35
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.580
business models like freemium or SAS or upswelling models et cetera et cetera.

36
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.460
In general you will launch a solid foundation in the best practices for financial modeling if you want

37
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.110
to do modeling in the future.

38
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.830
So I strongly suggest you don't skip the next section.

39
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.250
All right.

40
00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.700
See in.
