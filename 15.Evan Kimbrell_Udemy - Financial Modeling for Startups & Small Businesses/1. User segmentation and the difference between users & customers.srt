00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,220
Hey guys welcome back to the course and the new section where we're going to talk exclusively about

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,180
how we tackle modeling user growth.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,040
Presumably you all want your businesses to grow or at least be capable of growth structurally but the

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,230
way you model your growth and the way you demonstrate the most likely growth trajectory your business

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,260
will take can have a big impact on how you understand your business and what to expect from it going

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,670
forward as well as how convincing you will be should you ever need your model for raising investment.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,830
So in each lecture we're going to tackle one aspect at a time and slowly throughout the section you'll

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:43,590
develop a more well-rounded understanding of the many different factors that go into user growth and

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,280
business growth in general.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,120
In this lecture where we're going to talk about the concept of user segmentation.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,480
Okay so let's say you just created a premium mobile application and you just started to onboard your

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,280
first group of users.

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:06,690
If you were to take the entire bucket of users you gained on each day and use that day to day pattern

14
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,960
to predict your revenue growth in the future.

15
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,710
Do you think that strategy would work effectively for modeling your growth if not how would you display

16
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,900
your users in a more useful way assuming that there is one.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:27,900
So actually trying to think this one through the question we're trying to answer is how much money are

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,270
we going to make in the future and how does that relate to the number of users we have at any given

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,210
time.

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:41,280
If you want you can actually pause the video and try to think through it modeling it by users every

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,520
single day that we gain and then kind of churning it that way.

22
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,130
Does that help us answer the question that we're trying to solve.

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,610
One might be tempted to add this is a common mistake to say yes to the previous question of saying it

24
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,610
is in fact OK to just list out the total users per day.

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,270
Then theoretically what you do is you project your revenue for the future and you might just then average

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,960
out the amount of revenue per user by taking the total revenue for your period of time divided by the

27
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,470
total number of users that were gained and had during that time.

28
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,110
So let's say theoretically you had you made ten thousand dollars total up until this point and you have

29
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,970
twenty thousand users and your user base well you could probably guess that each user is worth about

30
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:30,210
50 cents and then you could use that as a revenue compass if you will to guide how much you think future

31
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,440
users will be worth.

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,710
We project we will get another half a million users.

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,710
Therefore revenues should be something like two hundred fifty thousand dollars but now doing it that

34
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,800
way the way I just described fails at a fundamental level to understand the fact that in this instance

35
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,240
you have users and then you have what are called customers.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,640
Now do any of you guys have any idea what the difference is between a user and a customer.

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,980
Well it's actually pretty simple and it's a great insight into understanding other entrepreneurs when

38
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,930
they speak.

39
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:10,950
Yes that is nice that's your app got 50000 users in its first month but user by definition is someone

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,530
who uses your product but does not pay a customer on the other hand is someone who pays.

41
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,580
This is an incredibly important dynamic that any mobile app based business will have to understand inside

42
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,150
and out.

43
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,330
Trust me when we get to the sections on freemium you'll see again how important this distinction is.

44
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,340
Now the distinction between if they pay you money and if they're just a freeloader.

45
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:42,570
While that has a lot of relevance to this example if 80 percent of your 1 million users don't pay well

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,510
that changes the way you think about the ones you do because now the ones that do pay are worth about

47
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,500
five times as much as what you previously thought.

48
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,280
What about other businesses.

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,630
What if you only have customers and there's no such thing as a non-paying user.

50
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,070
Well you're most likely going to have to introduce a more relevant way of segmenting your customers.

51
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,440
Now the key to deciding how you're going to split up your customers into visible and predictable groups

52
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,350
it's really got to come down to what makes a difference in answering the questions you're trying to

53
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:13,930
answer.

54
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,050
If you want to make a sophisticated accurate model you'll need to segment your customers.

55
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:24,420
And while there are thousands of different ways you could do this it all really depends on what your

56
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,500
end goal is.

57
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,960
Let's say any lemonade stand.

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,230
Example How would we have segmented our customers there.

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,540
Would we segment by let's say customers that purchase three drinks and more and then customers who order

60
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,070
less than three drinks.

61
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,610
Well ask yourself how relevant is that.

62
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:48,990
If we were trying to understand say what implementing a bulk purchasing discount you know something

63
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,020
like buy five cops get one free.

64
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,590
What that might do to the total number of three plus cup buyers.

65
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,810
Well then yeah sure.

66
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:06,120
I guess that's relevant for trying to the average purchase amount per customer but in another situation

67
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,280
not so much if we were trying to figure out let's say which of our locations has the most efficient

68
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
person working at it on the other hand.

69
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:20,190
Well that wouldn't really be as useful in that case we might want instead look at the customer's behavior

70
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,110
and it's segmented that way.

71
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,110
We could split them up by say how many walk bys we had then buy how many stops at our table and then

72
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,500
finally how many ended up actually buying something now.

73
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:31,840
Sure.

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,010
Maybe a good salesman could get a higher ratio of three plus come buyers but if we only segmented it

75
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:45,210
that way we might end up ignoring that one person has a much higher average overall or just brings in

76
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,890
more customers period which is a more important thing to be aware of.

77
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,380
So with that second version help us answer that question.

78
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,160
Segmenting by walk buys stops and then buys.

79
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,350
Absolutely.

80
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,680
It could be very similar if you were modeling for say a Web site property.

81
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,550
You might want to segment by the number of users that see an ad for your site.

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,330
Then the numbers that click through that ad to your Web site then the number that didn't bounce and

83
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,370
immediately leave your page and then finally the number of people that purchased your product.

84
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:22,890
So when we're thinking about growth it's almost always going to be the case that to do it properly we'll

85
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,770
need to segment our customers in some way.

86
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:33,240
There is no template for user segmentation and you'll do yourself harm if you just copy and paste a

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,980
generic segmentation you saw somebody else using their model.

88
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,530
Now think hard about your business why you're making your model and what you're trying to solve by doing

89
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:43,760
it.

90
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,480
If you can figure that out then it's just a question of figuring out which way of slicing the pie is

91
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,550
going to be the most relevant.

92
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,870
It could be behavior it could be purchasing amount it could be free versus paid next lecture.

93
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:03,510
We're going to take this concept and work through the you works model while applying user segmentation

94
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,020
to it and figuring out what's the best way we can do this.

95
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,610
All right see you then.
