Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,420
We cover a lot of good stuff in this course with our examples but we're not going to be able to cover

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,580
all the scenarios for all of you.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,630
We try to provide a good mix of case studies that will help most of you get most of the way there if

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,450
we try to cover the full gamut of specific examples.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:26,510
Then also this course is going to be irrelevant to any given student.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,340
So we try to just focus on the common elements and themes that are important to the vast majority of

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,590
you but there will be times when you want to do something very specific for your situation.

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,750
You'll have a solid foundation and framework for approaching your modeling by taking this course.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,100
But when you need something super specific Your best bet is to go to Google.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,540
Chances are good that someone else out there in the world has had the same issues that you're experiencing

12
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:08,130
and you might find it in forums like stack overflow or Excel or other modeling related discussion boards.

13
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,640
The point is to go look.

14
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,840
There might even be partial or fully completed models that you can build on top of.

15
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:24,720
So don't reinvent the wheel if you don't have to and don't be shy to look to see if someone else has

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,510
already tried.

17
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,900
When you're trying to do.

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,290
And hey if you find a useful case study that you think is interesting Feel free to share in the discussion

19
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,560
board or share and evidence channel for this course.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:37,890
Thanks.
