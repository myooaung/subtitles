00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,230
Hey welcome back to the course and this lecture.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:11,400
We're going to talk about user segmentation Specifically we're going to do an example of segmenting

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,570
users by their usage of a product or service.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,320
Now usage might not be relevant for those of you who are selling one off products where the customer

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,420
either buys it or they don't.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,160
So just focus on the process of segmentation and how we do that in spreadsheets.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,970
You can use these techniques to segment your customers based on different factors.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:44,100
For those of you who might be building an app where how much money you make or how you charge depends

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,860
on how often or how much someone uses your product.

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:56,160
Listen up in this example we're going to look at how segmenting users by usage can help you model a

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,310
business model that has different pricing tiers based on usage.

12
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,080
Let's see what that looks like.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,390
All right let's look at an example of segmenting by usage.

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,590
OK.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:20,130
So let's say this is all given to us it is a user growth figures that have been derived already and

16
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,740
there's some sort of attrition and that's bottom roll.

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,100
Here's the actual active users in any given month.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:34,860
So with that as a given and let's say we want to look at the usage of the users based on how many sessions

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:43,520
they use so this is some sort of service that is a paper use and it is segmented by the usage.

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,240
Okay.

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,500
And let's say that the team that's doing this they've done something similar before they kind of have

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:49,940
an idea.

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,130
They've tested it out they think that the distribution is going to look something like this.

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,600
And then over time they think the vast majority are going to kind of lump in the early parts here that

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,660
are going to use very little versus a few power users here that are going to use a lot.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,820
That's going to make up the bulk of the revenue.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,390
OK.

28
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,130
So how will we model that out.

29
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,370
Right.

30
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,300
So here we have four distributions in four years now with four years.

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,350
We're going to need to know what year we're in right.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,970
And so that's why we have a column here year depending on the months.

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,050
Now this is really easy to generate.

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,340
Right.

35
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:36,450
We know that there's months there so we may just put ones in the first 12 months here and then in month

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,640
13.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:46,860
We go back to the first month and then we add one and then we copy that formula all the way across then

38
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,320
it will automatically add the other years there.

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,100
Okay.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,600
So we have that now and how we correctly you have the right distribution in each of these columns.

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,050
Well the way we're going to do that is through a triple A nested IF statement because we're choosing

42
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,950
between four things here.

43
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,360
Okay.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,390
So it sounds complicated but it really isn't.

45
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,620
When you see it in action.

46
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,880
All right let's see how it works.

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,820
So here we're going to say if if the year.

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,160
Now we want to fix the ROE of the year rates.

49
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,210
We're going to put a little dollar sign in front of it to cause every formula is going to refer to that

50
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,220
row right there.

51
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,350
We'll see if it equals to 1 then we want it to equal to that value right here.

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:30,680
Right.

53
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:38,350
If it isn't let's do another check we go if is equal to 2.

54
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,990
Then I want it to equal to the second value here.

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,850
And if not then let's check one more time.

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,570
If it is equal to 3 that third year then we want to take this one and if it's none of those then we

57
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,670
want it to equal up to that one.

58
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,170
Right now here this formula is going to give us the correct answer for the first year but it's going

59
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,890
to give us an error for all the other years.

60
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,410
The reason for that is we we as we move this formula across to the right.

61
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,370
We want to make sure the references to the this box here stays the same.

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,150
OK.

63
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,680
So what that means if this here would copy it down first row.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,560
It looks correct.

65
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,290
It matches the first year right.

66
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,090
But if we move across now it's going to refer to the second year.

67
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,600
You see that that's because these formulas here have been shifted.

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,420
OK.

69
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,080
So we're going to fix that now the way we're going to fix that is we're going to go to this where all

70
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,070
the values are.

71
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,710
We're going to fix the columns so we're going to put a dollar sign in front of all of the letters for

72
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:49,000
those values that we're pulling from the front of the B C D.

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,560
So all of all of these references here now that we have that we're going to copy that again and you'll

74
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,610
see this is correct.

75
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,910
OK so now that it's correct we can we can do this for the rest of the cells we're in copy and we're

76
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,310
in a piece of formulas.

77
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,020
And just for a sanity check we know that it's got to change from year one to two 2 to three.

78
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,270
Right.

79
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,900
So let's just visually see that looks right.

80
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,720
So in months 12 and 13.

81
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:24,810
OK that changes that change looks right from 24 to 25 years two to three.

82
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,170
OK that looks correct.

83
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,890
And then for the last one month 36 and 37.

84
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,490
OK.

85
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,760
It looks right now.

86
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,080
So you can visually see whether you've done it correctly or not.

87
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,490
When it's something like this.

88
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,460
All right so now that we have the distribution percentage correct distribution percentages for these

89
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,050
uses screws for every month of the projection we start calculating the actual number of users.

90
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,550
And when you're thinking about users and people you know usually we want to do something where it's

91
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,310
a whole person or whole customer not just a partial one.

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,190
What does a half customer mean.

93
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,880
Right.

94
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,840
So one way to do that is through a function call round rounds.

95
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,370
Any number that you put in by to the number of digits.

96
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:20,840
OK but we want to round down so that because you know if it's half a user you don't want to round it

97
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,820
to four users so we're going to round down the number.

98
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,710
OK.

99
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:34,360
What are we going around down we're going to round down the active number of users times the the percentage

100
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,210
that is of that usage group.

101
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,300
OK.

102
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,720
So we're going to round that down and we go around to zero digits.

103
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,310
So that's a whole number.

104
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,840
You see that as a whole number of users and we're going to see the same for all of these here because

105
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,410
if we didn't do that we get all these fractions and it really doesn't make sense.

106
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,550
Fractional customers.

107
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:05,000
OK so now we have that we can copy pace in and now we have these usage distributions actual user accounts.

108
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:13,610
Now once where the user counts you can start thinking about pricing and the number of sessions right.

109
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,550
So let's make some assumptions maybe maybe they are going to give away a free it's free for the first

110
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,920
five sessions.

111
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,180
You know anybody that uses that is is going to be free.

112
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,320
They just want to get people used to it so that they can sign up for Pete Sessions.

113
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:32,750
OK.

114
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:41,540
And then you know but once they get past 10 sessions it's going to be you know a dollar a session.

115
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:50,940
OK so a dollar a session here and this is going to be 90 cents you know maybe then it goes down to 75

116
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:59,490
to 65 to 55 to 45 whatever that is we're just going to put some numbers in here just so we can work

117
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,650
with it.

118
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,770
OK.

119
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,870
And within each group.

120
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,180
This is how we're categorizing them so.

121
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,610
So like let's look at the set group here it means a use at least 200 sessions right.

122
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:23,680
But that bandwidth error that ranges from 200 to 500 So we've got to say make an assumption about what

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,930
is the average usage for that group right for each of these groups.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,550
OK so we're going to make some assumptions here.

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,180
This is going to be one is going to be say five.

126
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:45,700
The average number of sessions here is going to be you know let's say 10 and this one is going to be

127
00:08:46,620 --> 00:09:00,190
let's say from 2015 maybe the average sessions is 30 and this one is going to be 65 125 300 50.

128
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,490
I'm just making stuff up.

129
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:01,820
Right.

130
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,210
But you get the idea.

131
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,020
You know it should be based on what they're seeing.

132
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:08,560
Right.

133
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,500
If they have more data around it.

134
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,700
But right now we're going to make some some stuff up just so we have some numbers to work with so you

135
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,070
can see how this plays out.

136
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,420
OK.

137
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,040
So let's say these are going to be the average number of sessions.

138
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,280
OK.

139
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,200
So then how do we calculate the revenue in this case.

140
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,740
In this case well we've got the actual number of users here and this is the average number of sessions

141
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,900
that's being used.

142
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,660
Now we've got to fix the column and that's the price that we're paying.

143
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,110
Again fixing the column.

144
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,860
So that's the revenue for that group in that month.

145
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,370
And we do that across all the usage groups.

146
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,050
Now we can get this revenue projection here.

147
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,430
We're going to copy and paste that over and there we go.

148
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,950
Let's see what the total revenue looks like.

149
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,950
So now.

150
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,050
OK.

151
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:09,160
So then there we go we have to use our distribution right segmented by the usage groups.

152
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:15,220
It looks like if they have these numbers they're going to be making a whole lot of money later on at

153
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,790
these rates.

154
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,200
OK.

155
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,710
So it's really quite easy to segment if you have some data to go with a ready.

156
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,880
Right.

157
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,140
Otherwise we're going to be guessing.

158
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,940
But you know these this one session five cent it could be anything you could you could label whatever

159
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,020
you want most who you're not going to need this many categories.

160
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:38,710
You know maybe you just have low medium high or whatever that is it's going to be easy for you to do

161
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,010
that.

162
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,900
The main thing is you need to make some assumptions around the distribution and it means that up to

163
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:51,670
100 percent obviously based on your users and then that way your numbers can flow correctly from there.

164
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,080
So you can have the distribution than the actual users in each group.

165
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,200
And then from that we can do pricing and usage to calculate revenue.

166
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,970
Now this year we could have separated this in for better practice.

167
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:14,080
We would separate and just do a whole row on total sessions by each group and then price for the revenue.

168
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,400
Right.

169
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,670
But for simplicity just for this one it's not too complicated it's pretty easy to tell.

170
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,830
So it's you can make that tradeoff.

171
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,960
So why did we model out 10 plus user segments.

172
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,180
Why didn't we just segment by the pricing tears.

173
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:37,180
Well since we have the data and since the pricing tiers might change in the future modeling the segments

174
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,730
that are available gives the model a bit more flexibility if you're pricing to your changes.

175
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,490
The modifications are pretty easy to implement in the model but if you had just a lump the usage groups

176
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:56,140
altogether you may have to and lump them or undo the model or build the brand new one if you're changing

177
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:02,950
things if you change the labels to how we segment the users based on other factors like maybe what channel

178
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,840
they came from or geography or whatever is relevant to your business.

179
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,440
You can segment based on different factors.

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,690
The key here is to make sure you have a separate role and a separate label for each segment.
