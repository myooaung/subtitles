00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.610
Hey guys welcome back to the course in case.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.250
Last lectures a rollercoaster of startup costs and operating expenses didn't satisfy your thirst for

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.410
modeling cost.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.430
I'm here for another round this time.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.880
We're going to dive a little more into that last bit we covered where we touched on.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.730
Oh yeah.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.360
We have to hire people to sell our stuff and all the things that could potentially go wrong with that.

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.820
We're going to cover the cost of headcount and labor.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.530
Do you have to add these into your model.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.500
Well are you going to hire people.

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.520
If your answer is yes or I don't know then yes you need to model this out.

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.390
I would consider your model to be incomplete if it didn't include these two.

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.870
And as you'll soon find out we're going to build our cost into two separate buckets.

14
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.220
One is headcount and the other is labor cost associated with that.

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.050
Now why do we build them out like that.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.980
Well you'll soon find out.

17
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.010
Take it away Simon.

18
00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.390
All right.

19
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.170
We are going to start off with the headcount calculations first.

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.550
Now let's start with the not so good way to do headcount.

21
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.700
The not so good way but it's passable if you don't know where to start is to say.

22
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.130
All right.

23
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.480
Well we start with some months and then let's look at you know how many do we have in each month so

24
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.370
let's say we're doing a line for Bakken engineers just hard code.

25
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.050
How many engineers we have for each corresponding month.

26
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.210
Now if you're not projecting it out you know for more than very long this is an easy way to do it right.

27
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.190
But you got it then input all of the increases you know.

28
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.140
So in this one maybe I want to add one engineer every three months he either entry like that or you

29
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.250
could use a formula and put it now but the problem with doing it this way is you have to visually look

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.090
at the whole formula or the whole line to kind of see what's going on.

31
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.480
And if there are some others rules that you put in the formula would be really hard to tease out what

32
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.520
you were trying to do other than you know being able to see what the outcome is right for that row right

33
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.100
there.

34
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.160
So let's look at a better way to do it better we could be if you did something where you say All right

35
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.570
let's start at some initial starting point for how many headcount for for that particular let's say

36
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.960
for Bakken engineers.

37
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.860
Let me start with one What month are we starting at.

38
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.960
Well in month one.

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.010
The reason we want to have this input is we may have some other line items where you don't start in

40
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.920
March month one you may want to hire them in months 6 or 12.

41
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.010
And then how often do you want to add and how many do you want to.

42
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.310
Right.

43
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.160
So let's say then we go all right well I want to have one every three months and set a maximum to the

44
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.230
most We're going to need is some value.

45
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.280
Right.

46
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.540
So what it does here is when you pull it out as an assumption it allows you to then look at what kind

47
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.300
of assumptions you're making right here rather than have to go into the formulas in the previous example

48
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.130
or just kind of punching everything in right.

49
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.190
So in this one now we're still doing the calculations but this one now is starting in month one we're

50
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.520
going to have a starting value one and it's going to increment every three months.

51
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.830
But it's going to have a maximum value of six or the maximum of headcounts going to get to 6 range.

52
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.380
So we then look at these results for that line.

53
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.300
We see that it's doing the same thing except when once we get past a certain point it is maxed out at

54
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.800
6.

55
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.100
Right.

56
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.250
So it's doing exactly the same thing.

57
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.430
But everything is pulled out here.

58
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.660
All right.

59
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.960
So if we look at the formula for the calculation it's kind of complicated.

60
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.180
It's a little bit long so it's tough to explain the whole thing.

61
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.790
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to break it down into multiple steps and build this up.

62
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.570
Okay.

63
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.850
So let's start with the first part right.

64
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.470
First part is we wanted to start at some value in a starting month.

65
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.670
So the formula for that is we first look at hey if the month.

66
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.910
So we're checking the month here.

67
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.060
We're seeing if the month is less then the starting month then in 0 there's nothing.

68
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.960
And then if the month is equal to the starting month then we want it to equal to the starting value.

69
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.220
All right.

70
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.930
And then for our purposes for this example right here.

71
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.070
If it's anything else we'll just say it's zero.

72
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.880
Okay.

73
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.320
That's that's one way to do it.

74
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.790
So what we have then is the first part just calculates the correct starting with.

75
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.270
So now let's do the second part let's add on a max value.

76
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.470
So adding a max value is we have we have the same formula as before where we're determining when the

77
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.280
starting month should be.

78
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.990
And then what we're doing is let's take the minimum between the max value or whatever the calculation

79
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.660
is.

80
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.800
OK and then what.

81
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:17.610
Remember when we look at min and max you use the min function to set a max value and we can use the

82
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.950
max value to set a minimum value.

83
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:28.020
So what it's doing is saying hey you know give me the smaller number between our maximum headcount or

84
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.610
whatever is calculated.

85
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.950
So we haven't reached our maximum headcount.

86
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.840
Then if we use what's calculated but once we reach it then it will cap it at the max value.

87
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.660
So that's what the min function does and that's how we add this kind of maximum value there.

88
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.590
The third part is adding the increment every x number of months.

89
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.980
Right.

90
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.450
So in order to do that though we need to determine when those X months are occurring.

91
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.990
So here I just did a function to find when those X months are occurring.

92
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.710
So if we want it to occur every three months one way to do that is we want to see if the month is divisible

93
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.510
by three in our case if it is divisible and the Maat function which determines the difference or the

94
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.180
remainder that is left after dividing a number by another number.

95
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:28.590
So my god for two equal to zero because two goes perfectly into the four but maade for three will have

96
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.910
a remainder of 1.

97
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:37.230
So any time is a divisor of the number then the math equation will be zero.

98
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.710
So.

99
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.010
So we had maade 12 in month 12 and the.

100
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.430
And we're using the divisor as 3 then we're going to get zero as well.

101
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:54.240
So we're basically finding if it is evenly spaced in that month if it fits into those months if it is

102
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.500
right here I'm saying yes if not then show me nothing.

103
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.410
So that's where this.

104
00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.260
Yes.

105
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.950
So then what that does then is we look at the formula for that Roe is hey every you know every three

106
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.290
months when it's divisible by three.

107
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.410
You see that is coming.

108
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.810
Right.

109
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.290
It is in the correct month.

110
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.870
Once we have the correct months we can add or do the increment by the incremental value in that month.

111
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.670
So here we're going to do that Sheck right.

112
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:35.360
Now we're going to say hey if is this the month where we want to do the increment if it is then add

113
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.170
the increment value to the previous value.

114
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.450
That's why we have the previous value here plus the increment value.

115
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.180
If not then just make it equal to the previous value.

116
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.950
So then when we do that we see that we're adding that new headcount only when it is the month where

117
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.150
we actually want to make the increment.

118
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.910
So those are the three components that make this way to model it.

119
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.900
It is a better approach although you know if you're just starting out and you just want to be able to

120
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:14.380
make that headcount calculation or the assumption it's okay to start off with something that that's

121
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.990
a good way the bad way to do it.

122
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.880
Okay.

123
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.040
Because you can still see it and it's still usable but the better way will be to do something like this

124
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.380
where you pull out the assumptions so that you can easily adjust this.

125
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.520
And these will automatically adjust for you.

126
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:34.240
All right next step once we have the headcount calculations by month right we have it all here.

127
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.840
Now then what we can do is we can calculate the salary.

128
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.670
Let's start up here.

129
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.550
Here we have the month and we have the headcount right.

130
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:49.450
This is exactly the same we're using the same formula from from the previous example for the headcount.

131
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.400
But once we have the headcount what we can do is we can do something very similar with the compensation.

132
00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:02.270
We don't want to just multiply the headcount times some compensation rate for that month because you're

133
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:09.020
likely to have compensation that's going to change over time as well for you know that those associates

134
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.330
for that group of employees.

135
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:16.010
So in this example what if we had engineers where you know early on they're willing to take a little

136
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:23.900
bit of a pay cut you know and then overtime then we can reach some sort of a maximum compensation for

137
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.420
modeling purposes we can model basically the all in compensation rate.

138
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.560
That way you can put it all in there so you have to know what that is to keep it.

139
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:40.070
Keep it simple or you could separate everything you could separate you know wages from benefits from

140
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.030
other costs if they're very different for each of their roles.

141
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.450
But that kind of adds a lot of extra work for your modeling.

142
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:52.030
For most of you I would recommend just using all in compensation.

143
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:57.620
And as you can see here the structure is pretty much exactly the same right except now we're looking

144
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.640
at how the total compensation is changing over time.

145
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.960
So we see that we start off at maybe 8000 but then over time it reaches a max of 12000 per head count.

146
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:16.850
So then the salary is going to be the then headcount times the then total compensation.

147
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:23.120
This way we have the headcounts estranging And we also have the compensation that's changing over time

148
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.790
as well.

149
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.480
So we look at an example the reason why we're doing it like this is better than kind of putting all

150
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.040
of the hard coding all your assumptions in is because you might you might do something like this.

151
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:43.430
You may have different roles or you may have you know some senior folks who have other types of roles

152
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:49.700
there that you may start at some different starting values that you hire at starting at different times

153
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.890
you might add at different pace and grow at different pace and you may have also a different limit to

154
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.740
the total headcount.

155
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.020
Right.

156
00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.800
And your salaries might be very different as well.

157
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:08.090
So you know usually the big difference for how the salary is calculated is maybe the founding team or

158
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:16.440
some of the senior folk is taking a severe pay cut in the beginning to bootstrap the startup.

159
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.960
You know before reaching some sort of a more market level.

160
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.760
OK.

161
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:30.110
Now this one what we have here is we have all the headcounts based on these assumptions here and the

162
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:36.100
example here I've only done the comp growth for the CEO and the CTO.

163
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.210
So you can see how that plays out.

164
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:46.880
And then for the other roles right here I showed this example using the method that most people do just

165
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.730
straight.

166
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.290
Total compensation for them not growing.

167
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:58.280
Now my challenge for you then is to do something like this for yourself but to then convert all the

168
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.360
roles into something where the compensation is also calculated you have a compensation schedule for

169
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:12.350
every roll and then calculate the total compensation for each group going down.

170
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:21.080
So imagine creating these tables here for all of these additional roles here and then recalculating

171
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.890
all of these.

172
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.480
OK.

173
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.600
Hope that makes sense.

174
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:30.450
And this is one way for you to be able to calculate and project your headcount and salary.
