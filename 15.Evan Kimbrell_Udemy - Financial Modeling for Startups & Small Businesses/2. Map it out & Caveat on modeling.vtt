00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.430
Hey guys welcome back to the course we talked about why having a clear question is really important

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.450
in the previous lecture.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.490
But once you've decided on what your main question is What do you do next.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.160
Well you should map out a rough path from beginning to end for your model.

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.270
Now this map doesn't have to be perfect because financial modeling isn't about starting with a perfect

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.990
solution.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.240
There are always going to be changing it and improving it as you iterate on it.

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.700
So what did we do with our lemonade stand model.

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.050
Well once we decided on the questions we wanted the answer.

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.650
We kind of mapped it out roughly like this.

11
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.530
We started off with foot traffic.

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.670
How many people walk by a particular location in a given time period and then from there we looked at

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.150
the like we hit that it would actually stop at a food or beverage stand.

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.930
They can buy.

15
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.320
They don't stop by a stand next.

16
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.980
Just because they stop doesn't mean they're going to buy right.

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.720
So then we looked at the percentage of folks who stop that actually ended up buying.

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.190
And next we made the observation that some people bought more than one thing.

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
Maybe they're buying it for friends or coworkers back at the office.

20
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.060
So once we had all of this we could then look at the top line revenue figures or how many cups are going

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.920
to be selling.

22
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.430
From there we were able to take out the cost of goods sold and then finally had Crose profits by structuring

23
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.120
it like this.

24
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.910
It made it easy for us to structure a model logically around the same thing.

25
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.980
For some it might be easier to work backwards.

26
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.160
You may want to start with the profits and then work all the way back up to the traffic assumption.

27
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.870
Either way it paints a clear path for you to follow in terms of your model.

28
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.990
Now this may feel a little weird the first couple of times you're doing this but if you know your space

29
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.100
really well and with some practice of building models all of this is going to get a lot easier.

30
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.310
You're going to get plenty of practice in this course.

31
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.610
Another great side benefit doing this of mapping it out before you actually start playing with spreadsheets

32
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.260
and formulas is that it also forces you to clarify your understanding of your business model.

33
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.300
If you have co-founders and partners do this have every person map it out on their own and then come

34
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.150
back together.

35
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.230
You might be surprised that you're not exactly on the same page.

36
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.750
And one caveat about modeling before we go into the best practices in the next session we can't stress

37
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.750
this enough.

38
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.880
Your ability to build a robust and useful financial model is going to depend on how well you know your

39
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.450
space and how well you understand your particular business model.

40
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.740
The key drivers of it because if you don't know it you're not going to be able to deliver it out.

41
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.150
And the model probably won't be very helpful.

42
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.280
Remember all models are going to take inputs and there's a girl.

43
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.770
There is a saying that says garbage in garbage out.

44
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.020
And that is especially true when it comes to models.

45
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.140
If we had put $20 a cup as our price well we're going to have some really crazy looking profit figures

46
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.260
but it would be very unrealistic.

47
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.640
Right.

48
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.990
All right.

49
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.000
Enough about that in the next session.

50
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.870
Let's talk about the best practices with some examples.

51
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.320
If you follow those recommendations in the next section model building building out your financial models

52
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.880
for whatever you're going to be doing later on it's going to be a lot easier.
