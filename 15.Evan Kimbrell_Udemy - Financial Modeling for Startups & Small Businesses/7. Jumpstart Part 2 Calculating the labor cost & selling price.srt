1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,960
And we are back back making the lemon drink extravaganza.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,370
Now before we take our lemonade stand public and cash in on people's retirement funds we need to get

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,110
back to the grind and calculate the cost of labor associated with each cup.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,190
Now are we going to bake in the cost of labor into our model and increase the cost of each cup from

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,480
the eighty nine cents we established previously to something higher.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,850
Well no and for two reasons.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:37,050
One traditionally you want to isolate the gross cost of each item by itself and keep that separate from

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,890
Labor.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,760
Labor can fluctuate and can include many different elements itself.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,320
So combining the two metrics is a recipe for confusion down the road.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,680
The second reason is we're assuming this is a sole proprietorship where it's just you manning the booth.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,990
In that case you're not going to be paying yourself as if you were per hour labor.

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,840
Instead we're going to calculate the cost of labor.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,980
Remember that's due to inform our profit requirements going forward.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,050
Instead if we say profitable but that profitability didn't even cover labor Well that's generally bad.

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,360
You didn't make a profitable business anyway.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,440
Let's get back to it.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,840
If we wanted to theoretically calculate out the costs of labor how would we do it.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,600
Well we do it something like this.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,770
We'd first estimate the time it takes to make a certain batch of lemonade.

21
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,580
We're lucky because this is something we can easily test.

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,400
And it's something that stays reasonably static throughout your business.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,430
And then we need to calculate the time it takes to sell it which to be honest is going to be some guesswork.

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,550
So let's say you drink a case of Red Bull and in your cookie monster like mania.

25
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,570
You find out that you can squeeze in assemble about five gallons of lemonade in two hours five gallons

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,450
again apologizing for overly American izing this.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,010
But it's about 80 cups.

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,040
At 12 ounces each.

29
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:02,410
OK.

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,660
So we have half of the equation now.

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,420
How would we try to estimate out how long it takes to sell.

32
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,590
Well Intel we have concrete data to work with.

33
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,070
We really just have to guess what some people might do is stake out a location and then count the number

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,520
of passers by then try your best to make a conservative guess at what percentage of people might stop

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,200
by the booth and what percentage would then buy.

36
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,160
In this case we're just going to estimate with the idea that we would adjust the model later on when

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,150
we get real data let's say in a good location you could sell 40 cups an hour for a total session of

38
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,200
five hours.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,810
So two hundred cups of lemonade before the streetlights come on and you have to go home.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:57,540
So if you can make 40 cups in an hour of prep you can make 200 cups in five hours of prep.

41
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:06,240
Basic multiplication that's five hours of prep and five hours of sales to sell 200 cups of lemonade.

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,290
If you want you could make a blended rate of one hour prep and sales per 20 cups.

43
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,560
We're not going to bake this into our model just yet but I would write it off to the side.

44
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:25,590
The question then becomes how much per hour would you like to get paid or more reasonably what per hour

45
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,690
rate would make this worth it for you in general.

46
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,640
Because after all there are plenty of other neighborhood industries you could be disrupting.

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,370
We got to optimize our time.

48
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,150
Let's say you thought about it and 30 dollars an hour is enough for you to make this worth it for you.

49
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,980
That means at 10 hours of total time.

50
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,820
Remember it's five hours of prep five hours of selling.

51
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:55,530
You'd need to make about 300 dollars in profits after all of your costs in order for this to be worthwhile.

52
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,320
10 hours.

53
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,240
You want 30 an hour you need 300.

54
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:04,010
And we know that in that same 10 hours we can make and sell roughly 200 cups.

55
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,980
So I think you see where I'm going with this.

56
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,360
If we sell 200 cups then we have to consider our unit costs which end up being one hundred and seventy

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,870
eight dollars.

58
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,410
No.

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,050
Each cup is eighty nine cents at the end of the day.

60
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,070
So just multiply that by 200.

61
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:25,050
So really we need to recoup four hundred and seventy eight for two hundred cups sold in two hours to

62
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,280
both cover the costs the eighty nine cents and that 30 dollar an hour return you want for your time.

63
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,080
And so with that knowledge what do we have to sell our cups of lemonade for anyone anyone.

64
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,660
Four hundred and seventy eight divided by 200 is about two dollars and thirty nine cents and because

65
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,400
we love contingency and planning for the worst let's like round that up to two dollars and fifty cents.

66
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,780
Yes.

67
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,540
Some of the smarties in the crowd are probably wondering if the demand for eliminate is elastic as in

68
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,040
does the purchase rate on any given day they get affected by the increase or decrease in price applied

69
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,710
to it.

70
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,300
And yes it does.

71
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,220
But we're not really going to tackle that right now.

72
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,730
We're just projecting we would actually need real empirical data to do that.

73
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,720
So there you go.

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,050
We have our unit economics squared away.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,250
And we know what we have to charge to get the right amount of profit.

76
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,310
Good times.

77
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,940
Next lecture.

78
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,090
Simon's going to take you through location selection and handling fluctuations in demand.

79
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,340
And you thought running a lemonade stand was simple.

80
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,060
Still is.

81
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,770
All right see you next lecture.
