00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.240
Attrition churn defection whatever you want to call it is essentially the loss of users or customers

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.220
in a given time period.

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.100
If you're an app attrition is when someone who has downloaded your app and previously used your app

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.310
stops using it or uninstall is it if your subscription service.

5
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.230
It's when a customer cancels on you.

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.930
So how is attrition defined.

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:38.260
Well attrition is equal to the users loss during a specific period of time divided by the users at the

8
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.060
beginning of that same period.

9
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.620
Notice that it says nothing about the users that are added during the period.

10
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.600
This is only about the users that you've lost.

11
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.810
So let's say you had a thousand users at the beginning of the month and at the end of the month you

12
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.510
lost 50 users.

13
00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.880
So your churn for that month would be 50 divided by 1000 or 5 percent.

14
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.150
Even if you added 75 new users during that month.

15
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.620
Now let's say you lose another 50 users during the second month.

16
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.630
What is your attrition rate then.

17
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.290
Well your starting point for that month is different.

18
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.260
It was a thousand minus 50 plus 75.

19
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.080
So it's 1025 users.

20
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.420
So your attrition rate for the second month is 50 divided by one thousand twenty five or four point

21
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.020
nine percent.

22
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.340
Now this is more relevant for those of you who have users or customers who will be regularly interacting

23
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.560
with your product or service.

24
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.060
If you have a one and done type of business well this may not really apply to you.

25
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.140
So if you're selling a physical product this doesn't really apply.

26
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.010
So what does this mean in terms of our models.

27
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.930
Well it means that when you model the users your growth you're going to have to make some assumptions

28
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.280
about attrition as well.

29
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.530
So let's take a look.

30
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.170
By doing an example for a subscription business to grandmas cookies.

31
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.420
All right.

32
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.750
Let's look at a simple example with grandmas cookies.

33
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:17.980
It's a subscription service for cookies that are made by a grandmas recipe a different grandmas recipe

34
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.120
every month.

35
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.110
Okay.

36
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.130
And users subscribe for a monthly subscription and they get grandma's cookies once a month.

37
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:37.450
So let's assume that we have some projections for the first 24 months in terms of new customers.

38
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.570
OK.

39
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.210
Now the easiest way and the most common way a lot of you will assume attrition in modeling is they actually

40
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.250
just put in an attrition rate based on what they understood or what they've seen from a small sample

41
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.380
or whatever.

42
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.230
They have some reason to believe that their average expected attrition is something.

43
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.520
So if that's something that they want to go with then the attrition rate or the loss users is going

44
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.580
to be pretty easy to calculate.

45
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.620
So we have total users.

46
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.540
Right.

47
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:21.070
And then the lost user the actual attrition is just gonna be the attrition rate times the total customers.

48
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.060
And I'm rounding it here because it's better to lose a whole customer than to lose a half a customer.

49
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.060
Let me just then we'll just make that.

50
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.970
And then this is the attrition percentage for clarity.

51
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.550
OK so then for the other ones it's the same.

52
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.460
Right.

53
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.200
Then if we know we're adding new customers at this rate then the total customers is going to be the

54
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.890
previous total customers plus new customers gain minus what we lost.

55
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.760
And then we have the total customers.

56
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.890
So each time there's a little bit of staggering.

57
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.090
But then you get the idea here.

58
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.580
So this way with input it's really easy to calculate the attrition.

59
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:13.390
But what if you wanted to model attrition a different way way if you think on average a customer will

60
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.990
stay with the subscription for the cookies for six months and then after that they stop all of them

61
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.280
stops.

62
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.810
So let's see how that looks like in the model.

63
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.720
So let's look at the same thing.

64
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.500
Here is the same 24 months schedule in terms of new customer acquisitions but this time the attrition

65
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.150
is going to be 100 percent after six months.

66
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.700
So everybody stays on for six months and then afterwards they're done.

67
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.110
Right.

68
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.450
So in terms of the actual attrition the users that we lose if we're starting in month 1 and they're

69
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.600
all staying there then we're not losing anyone then in months 7 all of the new users from the first

70
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.840
month we assume we lose them.

71
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.210
Okay.

72
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.690
And then so if we copy the of all the way down then it staggered six months across like this.

73
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.720
The new users here their loss a month to their lost in month 8 and so forth until we get to the end.

74
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.090
So then now here the attrition percentages the attrition rate is zero for the first six months and then

75
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.780
it has some rate afterwards.

76
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.170
Right.

77
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:30.430
This one the attrition rate is going to be the average of the the new customer figures divided by the

78
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.350
total customers over time it should drop.

79
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.340
So over time this attrition rate is going to stabilize.

80
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.580
Right.

81
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.990
Because you're always losing 100 percent of your customers after six months.

82
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:49.870
This is also an easy way to model attrition but it's really also not very good just like the first version

83
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.890
here in the simple.

84
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.050
A better way to think about it is you know especially for a business like this is that there is probably

85
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.590
some sort of a schedule right now the opposite of attrition is retention.

86
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.300
What percentage of the customers are users you retain if we'd look at something like this where customers

87
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.860
once they come in we retain 100 percent of them after one month you lose some of them after the second

88
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.910
month and then you lose almost half of them after six months.

89
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.220
But the rest that stays stay for life.

90
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.620
So if that's the case how do we model that out now.

91
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.300
This one is a little bit more difficult.

92
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.210
So this one we need to track it for each cohort.

93
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.560
Right.

94
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:38.890
Because each month that they come in we need to track then for at least the six months for each of the

95
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.060
cohorts of new customers that are coming in.

96
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.720
So we've got to look at the cohorts here so we're doing 24 months and we're going to track 24 months

97
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.760
off of the cohorts so then we need the retention percentages for each of the corresponding months but

98
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.210
we needed from when that starts.

99
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.190
So in month 1 it's relatively straightforward.

100
00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.600
Right.

101
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.330
It's just equal to that.

102
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.550
And we we copy the formula across and bam.

103
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.510
And you know we can do the same for months to make equal to that but it's kind of tedious.

104
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:19.240
So you could after you get comfortable with modeling you're gonna be able to do this.

105
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.960
Now let's model this formula looks a little complicated.

106
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.870
It's a little weird and wonky but what it does is it allows me to enter that one formula in here and

107
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:36.850
then when I copy and paste it across the rest of this it automatically finds the correct retention percentage

108
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.350
that starts in the correct month for that cohort.

109
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.250
So I briefly explain how this works.

110
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:51.610
Now first of all I need to use some month some figure to pull the correct number out of this.

111
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.810
This formula in Excel called each lookup.

112
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.860
It's called a horizontal lookup.

113
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.830
So if you have some key that it looks up.

114
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.990
So I need to generate some sort of a key.

115
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.060
The correct one two three four five six.

116
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.470
And then it searches the correct number from one of these here.

117
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.030
So basically I'm calculating some number that's going to be between 1 and 6.

118
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.170
For me I'm searching in this table which is this table right here.

119
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.270
And I want to pull the value that is two rows down toward each look and looks down like this.

120
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:30.010
And the faults here just means I want an exact match case that's too I want an exact match that helps

121
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.780
me to find look up the.

122
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:40.510
So the way I calculate that I have the month minus the previous cohort month here.

123
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:40.860
OK.

124
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:46.090
So then for each cohort when I have that then I have the correct one.

125
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:51.790
So in months to two minus the previous cohort one will give me one so then it will pull one hundred

126
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.480
percent fear and three in the second cohort.

127
00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:02.080
That month three in the second cohort minus the previous cohort here one will equal to two.

128
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.490
So then I look up the ninety five.

129
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:03.700
Right.

130
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.240
So the logic here will work for all of this here.

131
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:15.820
Now the the stuff here in front is so that I I want everything else to be blank unless I'm in that correct

132
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:22.180
range of six months with those I don't want it to show other values here because if I just included

133
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.800
this look up what it does is if if it's not in the correct month it would just have an error and it

134
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.110
would kind of look messy on the on the screen.

135
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:36.580
I'll show you what that would look like if I say it took I took this row in I took if I took this code

136
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:42.400
out here and just left the calculation I would get this error here until I get to the correct months

137
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.900
it would calculate it.

138
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.570
Then the other parts would have these errors.

139
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.560
Right.

140
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.580
So the way to get rid of these errors there's an easy way and then there's a better way.

141
00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:01.300
What I did was the more accurate way which is to find hey if it's outside of the range of these six

142
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.980
months then I wanted to show a blank in here.

143
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.480
That's where I did the check there.

144
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.220
OK.

145
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.640
Which is if the month is less than that range.

146
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.620
And also of the month that's more than the range that it's supposed to be for this particular cohort.

147
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.340
Then I want to show a blank.

148
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.700
Otherwise do the calculation and find the look.

149
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.690
Now another way to do that is instead of all of that there's another formula that we can use which is

150
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.170
called if error if there is an error don't show anything.

151
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:35.320
So what it does is try to do this but if there is an error then show that and it would give the same

152
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.970
result say that.

153
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.320
So there you go.

154
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:44.740
You just learn two techniques on how to do this somewhat complicated calculation.

155
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.740
There aren't that many cohorts here and there and then many months.

156
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.990
So it's really not that bad to have to do it manually if you're not comfortable with doing the formulas

157
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.940
yet but you know if you get in the situation where you're trying to do this for hundreds or maybe thousands

158
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.390
of cohorts then you're going to need to understand how to do that.

159
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:01.690
Right.

160
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.970
So feel free to take a look at the formula there's you know I'm going to leave this other formula here

161
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.440
like this for you so you can see the two different ways to generate the same result.

162
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:18.280
Now once we have the correct retention percentages for each of these cohorts then we can do a cohort

163
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:24.320
count of how many users from each cohort actually is staying through the months and the way we're going

164
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:31.180
to do that is we need to find the correct number of new customers that's added for that particular cohort.

165
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:31.350
Right.

166
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.870
So in the first cohort I want to pull the new customers that's coming from the first month.

167
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.370
And that's what this each look up here.

168
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.490
This part right here is doing okay.

169
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.260
And then I want to multiply it by the retention percentage.

170
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:52.600
Now this last part here is just to make sure that it only calculates in the range.

171
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.640
So it only does is look up in the range.

172
00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:01.450
And then if there's any errors then we're going to make it look nice and show blinks.

173
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:08.590
This part here may be a little confusing in how it's executed in you may say Hey Simon that formula

174
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.610
is pretty clever.

175
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.520
You told us not to do clever stuff right.

176
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.300
True.

177
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.430
Now the only thing here is visually it's not clever right.

178
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.200
Visually you can tell if you look at it you know exactly what's going on.

179
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:30.520
So if the only time where you could get clever is if visually the results here is super obvious what

180
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.750
you're trying to do when clever gets in trouble is when it's clever like this.

181
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.740
And when you're looking at this it's not obvious what you're trying to do right.

182
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.710
It's just some numbers and everything is being calculated as well.

183
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.710
But here is pretty pretty obvious what's happening.

184
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.760
And same for here.

185
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.710
So that's the only time you can get clever.

186
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.010
All right.

187
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.920
So then we can actually calculate the attrition by cohort.

188
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.130
OK.

189
00:12:54.190 --> 00:13:00.970
And here is basically just the difference between the cohort counts as we move down the month.

190
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.210
Right.

191
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:07.180
So there there's going to be some sort of attrition for each cohort for a period of six months that

192
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.710
follows this retention schedule.

193
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.660
And then afterwards there's going to be no more.

194
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:18.310
OK so then we have this cohort attrition schedule now for each cohort in for each month.

195
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:23.310
So then when we add it all up we have the attrition for each of those months.

196
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:29.650
So the actual user attrition is going to stabilize once you're getting it to more than six months because

197
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:32.050
then you're going to have some schedule right.

198
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:38.920
Each each part is they're seen with some if there's only five cohorts that are going to be going through

199
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.420
attrition at any given time.

200
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:40.600
Right.

201
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:47.470
So if if on average your cohorts are pretty stable then you you can expect your attrition to be relatively

202
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.040
stable.

203
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:48.280
Right.

204
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.550
But if you're increasing the amount of new users so each cohort is getting bigger and bigger over time

205
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.020
then your attrition number is going to get bigger over time as well.

206
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:05.170
But the percentage attrition the attrition rate is going to be getting smaller and smaller.

207
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:11.050
Because here we're assuming each cohort has some user segments they on forever.

208
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.720
So overall your user base as we can see here is going to be increasing over time and because that's

209
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:24.100
increasing over time and because the overall attrition numbers in any given month is limited to just

210
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:30.550
the attrition from five cohorts your actual attrition percentage is going to be getting smaller over

211
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.680
time and we see that here.

212
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.830
So there's different ways to look at attrition.

213
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.990
You know for modeling purposes for projection you can start with something like this just to have a

214
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.580
place value to know that you're accounting for attrition.

215
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:52.150
But once you have some data once you have cohort information once you have an idea you want to actually

216
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:59.050
you know for tracking you want to track it by cohort and by each thing are eaten by behaviors and that

217
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:06.100
way because if you do that and you notice that there's discrepancies in terms of the churn based on

218
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.200
your segments whatever they may be it may help you pinpoint what's going on.

219
00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.910
Maybe there's some things that are causing a much higher churn for a segment of your users that where

220
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.550
you can actually address that.

221
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:17.800
All right.

222
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.380
Some final thoughts on attrition when we're modeling it.

223
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.400
We're projecting based on an assumption that you have no history you're going to have to make your best

224
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.480
guess based on what you know.

225
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:38.050
But if you have a history of figures maybe you've tested with some beta users and you have some historical

226
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:45.400
figures from three months of usage from the sample of beta users even then the thing to remember is

227
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.350
that your sample could be an outlier example.

228
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:57.620
Now this doesn't happen often but you do do something that is different for your initial set users.

229
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:02.050
They might be very different they might give you an attrition rate that is very different from what

230
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.040
you would actually see.

231
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:09.700
So then if you've projected based on that you could be really off one way or the other for our purposes

232
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.960
since we're starting with nothing.

233
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:17.140
We're just going to make a best guess but for most of you in practice as you get more data you have

234
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:24.730
more users you're going to be able to refine your attrition assumptions some folks will take multiple

235
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:30.430
samples and run what are called beta distributions that are aimed to estimate the true value of their

236
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:36.970
attrition based on the sample data the larger the samples the more confident they can be with the estimate

237
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.280
that they're using that it's close to the true value and when it comes to looking at attrition it is

238
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:52.530
often done with cohort studies or age group studies or even user segments by behavior.

239
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:58.510
When you look at attrition across different user segments it can help you pinpoint areas and understand

240
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.640
why attrition might be higher for a subgroup and not others.

241
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:10.920
Finally attrition could often be AKP Ira key performance indicator to measure and track if minimizing

242
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.950
attrition or reducing attrition is a key objective then.

243
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.490
This will definitely become a caveat.
