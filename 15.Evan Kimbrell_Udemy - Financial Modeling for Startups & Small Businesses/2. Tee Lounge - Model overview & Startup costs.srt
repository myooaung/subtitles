1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,000
All right.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:08,000
Now before I go over the model for this one I want you to download the business plan that's associated

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,520
with this model.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,680
The model and this business plan is actually one of my former clients and I have permission to share

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,510
this and make it a case study for this course.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:25,120
Something I did years ago for a client and this is the business plan they helped him put together.

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,350
Now you know you have to read everything but definitely browse through it to get an idea of the business

8
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,780
model itself.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,520
Definitely look through some of the photos and the idea is to have these golf simulators.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,770
You see the gentleman at the bottom you're actually using real clubs or real balls and you're hitting

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,690
into a high definition screen that has an image that's projected to it kind of like a video game.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,010
You know if you've ever played we in there's the Tiger Woods game where you're using the remote controller

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:01,340
Well instead of the remote controller using real golf balls with real golf clubs and after you hit it

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,880
when the ball impacts the screen the real ball drops.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,080
But the virtual ball keeps flying.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,360
So it's a pretty interesting experience actually I went to actually play it just so I can get a better

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,690
understanding of this technology.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,400
And it's even better now today than it was years ago.

19
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:22,280
So this overall business plan if you just skim through it I'll give you a better idea of what the models

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,110
are trying to do.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:32,030
All of the inputs all of the analysis that's in this business plan came from the model that we're going

22
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,500
to go over in just a bit.

23
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:40,850
You know the model talks about a business case that involves these simulators or the stations that have

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,860
these golf simulators some are going to be semi-private and some are going to be like a VIP private

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,320
in clothes just give you an idea.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,270
The one on the bottom is more of the semi private Stalley.

27
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,770
It can be made for four people.

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,840
There's little barstools there.

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:05,200
So you know a normal foursome can play here and play through the rounds and it would be pretty know

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,690
fun there they actually are able to get through an entire round in about two hours since the virtual

31
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:11,990
game.

32
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,940
You don't have to actually walk to the bar.

33
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,230
Everybody's ready to be able to hit right away.

34
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,130
And then the bar stalls there is meant for food and drinks to be served.

35
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,840
The more private one gets for larger crowds you can fit you know a larger group of people in there.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,030
And for some they may be even planning to have an additional television where some other people can

37
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,910
play other video games or do other things and other activities while also having the golf simulator

38
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,310
there.

39
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,570
So this will give you a pretty good idea of what kind of business model looks like where they're going

40
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,460
to generate their revenues from.

41
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,700
Right.

42
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,520
So there's these simulators in these stations and then there's food and drink as well.

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,840
More top of style.

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,080
Ok now I'm going to go into the model so you can see what the model looks like.

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,500
All right.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,200
So here is the model.

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,810
This model looks quite a bit different from the other models we've gone through.

48
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,220
There's a few things here.

49
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,070
It is a bigger more dense model.

50
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,710
There's a lot of moving parts so it takes awhile to digest so I'm just going to kind of walk you through

51
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,240
the parts in this lecture and then we're going to start going into how it's organized and with trying

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,530
to do now just like the other case studies.

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,190
We're not going to be able to go in and explain every single formula but I think understanding what

54
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,130
we were trying to do with the model in the logic then you could actually go in there and see how it's

55
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,740
implemented because you know what it's actually doing.

56
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,150
First things first.

57
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,720
These yellow highlighted sheets are where the inputs are.

58
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,600
This is where all the mean assumptions all the assumptions around pretty much the whole entire business

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,840
structure is put this one in just a separate page that was used to capture furnishing assumptions and

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,700
all these blue ones were summerise pages that were meant to publish to the report and were meant for

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,340
sharing.

62
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,930
This first one here was just some data that was gathered from a client to get a sense of what the golfing

63
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,300
household market was in the target market.

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,900
They were looking at which was Los Angeles at the time.

65
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,400
Now all these green tabs here these are all of the calculations sheets calculating the different things

66
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,090
that are labeled here.

67
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:26,900
So there's several different sources of revenue there's simulator rental revenue food and drink revenue

68
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,500
and then some other miscellaneous revenue.

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,670
And then from there we're looking at some cash flow calculations this is looking at what the cash flow

70
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:42,170
looks like when we factor in the startup expenses ramp up for revenues to see what the actual capital

71
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:48,730
maximum cash outlay is right to determine what the need in terms of capital would be.

72
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,390
And then there's one for an income statement just because there's a lot of capital that's going to be

73
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,190
depreciated.

74
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,810
We did this to get a sense of what the taxes might look like and some other calculations these this

75
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,880
worksheet was to find out when the business would break even and which month it would break even.

76
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,250
And if there were investors how long it would take to return the equity to the investors given how much

77
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,710
equity was placed into it.

78
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,470
So based on the assumptions however was drawn out.

79
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,140
She would tell the investors have you invest this much and if you agree with the underlying assumptions

80
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,470
about the operations of this business then this is how long it would take us to return your equity back.

81
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,110
OK.

82
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,450
Now let's go through some of the core assumptions.

83
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,300
This one the furnishing this is pretty straightforward.

84
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,630
Right so we have different spaces in that business and we're just basically itemizing What are the main

85
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,150
items.

86
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,030
How much the cost and what was the total cost for the likely furniture and furnishing that we would

87
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,390
need.

88
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,750
It looks like the budget that we estimate at the time was about 20000.

89
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,640
Now the main assumptions page this one has all of the assumptions.

90
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,130
The reason we did this at the time instead of splitting into multiple sections was it would have so

91
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,810
many sections and it was really difficult to see all the assumptions same place.

92
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,400
So we decided to put it all on the same page and just put them in different sections so it was easier

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,830
to kind of go back and forth between the assumptions.

94
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,620
So the top part here is making assumptions around the startup costs and there's an additional distinction.

95
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,250
We decided that there may be two phases of the startup.

96
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,780
Just in case like we the one of the options remember was we're looking at a space for the client that

97
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,150
like a larger space and he would open with fewer with half of the lounge spots first and there would

98
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,490
be some additional space that he could then expand into.

99
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,360
So he was kind of planning for some growth but then he wouldn't need to borrow as much.

100
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:48,990
And if he was right about the revenues and the utilizations and then he would be able to get the self-finance

101
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,530
the growth into that space.

102
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,580
So that's what this part is all about.

103
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,430
Here is some financing for the simulator's the seller or the manufacturer of the simulators.

104
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,020
They were actually providing seller financing.

105
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,990
They wanted people to buy it.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,620
They were kind of expensive.

107
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,420
So they were providing some financing and they were approaching these terms at the time.

108
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,230
Now here in the middle section These are the operating assumptions and looking at assumptions around

109
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,470
what are the operating hours.

110
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,740
How many days versus a week nights and daytime hours versus nighttime hours.

111
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,120
Because you're going to be charging different rates the time rates versus the nighttime rates the amount

112
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,350
of space in-house to add up the payroll.

113
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,700
So this is the amount of folks that they would need to hire at the time the minimum wage rate was lower

114
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,540
at the time than it is now in California.

115
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,470
So this was years back but the logic still makes sense here.

116
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,070
So the thing here was initially that he was thinking about doing a sauf launch.

117
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:55,950
So not a huge grand opening but kind of slowly open testing's out with you know kind of private invite

118
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,230
and then start doing some advertising after they kind of get comfortable with things.

119
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,920
So this is the assumptions for the first three months and then these are the assumptions for after that.

120
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,190
All right.

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:14,370
And then some other assumptions around office supplies marketing expenses and other other assumptions

122
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,280
run insurance and worker's comp and some of it may be having a third party account Accounting Service

123
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,740
to do the books for them.

124
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,230
Some other cost related assumptions.

125
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,990
The there is maintenance that was anticipated for The Sims.

126
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,480
So there's going to be small simulators and large simulators large simulators actually cost more than

127
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:43,100
the small simulators think these were supposed to be like 45000 now now this part right here is the

128
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,460
cell section is about the pricing and the utilization of the simulators.

129
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,460
To think about it in two ways right.

130
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,400
The the some the semi private stations all you need is a smaller simulator so they're going to be smaller

131
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,880
and they're semi private So you're not going to be on charge as much.

132
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,580
And then the large simulator that you're going to put in the private space the VIP room you're going

133
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,490
to be able to charge more.

134
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,590
Now pricing wise can I have to think about weekday versus weekend rates.

135
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,190
And then also night time versus daytime rates.

136
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,730
So that's what all those rates are.

137
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,440
And for some I was thinking about having memberships to encourage some people who are regulars give

138
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,120
them extra discounts to give them an extra deal for the private simulator or the other simulator.

139
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,760
So we're testing different rates.

140
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:33,120
I think at the time we assume that for the private VIP one there was no discount given for the members

141
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,230
the regular rooms the members would get a discount.

142
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,540
Grand opening assumptions here which is basically assuming that the first three months there's going

143
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,470
to be a discount on the rates you know just to encourage people to try it out more.

144
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,200
I hear the membership assumptions how much it costs in terms of the fees you know how many members are

145
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,030
adding per month.

146
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,300
And then what the stabilize membership count would be.

147
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:05,170
And then some sort of annual renewal rate then see we have some other assumptions here around the this

148
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,640
is additional income.

149
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,320
So you know some people don't have clubs when they bring it to this facility.

150
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,330
Then they can rent clubs at a certain rate.

151
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:21,340
This was here for depreciation for tax purposes for the income statement and this one is just looking

152
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,150
at the ratio the number of weekdays versus weekend days in a given month.

153
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,580
So this whole section here now is looking at a totally different part of the business.

154
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,270
This is looking at the Food and Drink part of the business.

155
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,760
It's one of the ways we're looking at it was he wanted one side to be pretty much almost a standalone

156
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,100
restaurant that serves top of style food and beer and wine kind of like a mini sports bar.

157
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:48,730
That would be geared towards Gough's TVs that would show a lot of golf and things like that Golf Channel

158
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,820
and his thought was there's me some people there is going to hang out.

159
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,380
They're not going to play and so there may be some people that will come in just for the food.

160
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,240
So I wanted to make that distinction and look at the revenue potential from both but those kinds of

161
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,320
potential customers.

162
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,170
This last part is some assumptions around some miscellaneous sales.

163
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,450
So like there's merchandising there maybe like lessons for the unrented hours.

164
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,660
So if a simulator is not being used by somebody could be potentially used by an instructor would use

165
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,540
it to give private lessons because then these kinds of simulators actually gives what's what are called

166
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,670
launch measurements for when people hit and when they hit a ball it measures things like swing speed

167
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,930
the launch angle.

168
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,390
All of those things that are useful for an instructor to help the students who are trying to learn and

169
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,610
improve their swing.

170
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,470
So it's actually a great learning tool as well and they thought maybe there's an opportunity to do some

171
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,650
of these kinds of to take advantage of these open slots by working with local golf instructors giving

172
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,810
them certain dedicated time slots where they could teach and it would then they would just charge the

173
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,670
instructors 25 bucks an hour.

174
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,620
Well you know typically those instructors for private lessons are charging over 100 bucks an hour.

175
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:09,210
Also the gaming experience playing on the simulators they can actually be programmed to show like a

176
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,660
five or 10 second advertisement in between certain number of holes.

177
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,120
And so he was thinking about that see.

178
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:21,490
That would be significant or not if there was enough customers that came in you know just enough ads

179
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,730
where it could make some revenue but not so often where it annoys the experience so it can be set like

180
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,520
as in like loading time between when it loads for the next hole.

181
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,760
OK so those are the assumptions.

182
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:40,780
Now in the next lectures we're going to show you how it was structured and how it is actually modeled

183
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,220
out to reflect all of these assumptions.
