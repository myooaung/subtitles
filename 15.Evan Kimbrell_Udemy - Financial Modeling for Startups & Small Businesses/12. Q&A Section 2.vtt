00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.170
So this lecture.

3
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.660
Simon and I are actually just going to do a Q&amp;A session.

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.000
We're going to cover what we talked about in section 2 Section 2 obviously was the lemonade stand or

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.850
we did that jumpstart to kind of get everybody on the same page.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:22.260
Well we had some questions that we thought we wanted to explore but not obviously in the strict curriculum

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.450
of the course and we also just figured there are probably some questions we could anticipate that you

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.230
might have.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.710
So guys consider these lectures completely extra credit watch them at your leisure.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.990
They're not really required and that's why we're probably going to put them at the end of the course.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.980
So if you guys really want to deep Take a deep dive then well just sit through this and we'll cover

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.340
whatever we or whatever I find interesting in whatever.

13
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.460
Simon thinks that we might have left out in the lectures.

14
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.360
Yeah absolutely.

15
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.120
Very cool.

16
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.580
So I wrote down some questions.

17
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.190
I see this is a question I found interesting not necessarily something that you guys might run into

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
one of the things I noticed when we were making the lemonade stand was that we were just guessing on

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.140
price.

20
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.410
And I understand a lot of what we were doing was just guesswork because you know we couldn't spend 40

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.970
lectures making a lemonade stand.

22
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.770
So my question was if we let's say wanted to build in some ambiguity towards our pricing into the model

23
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.010
would be a good strategy for doing that.

24
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.540
I mean in the sense of price testing right like we don't remember we are charging for today like $3

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.300
or something like really nice eliminated the limited garnishes or whatever.

26
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.210
What would happen if we charged $5.

27
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.410
And what would happen if we charged too because we don't actually know what's the optimum price and

28
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.010
we know that the demand is elastic for the Econ. nerds out there that just means that as the price goes

29
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.460
up demand goes down price goes down demand goes up.

30
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.320
But we don't know how elastic it is.

31
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.900
So do you have any good ideas for how we could run with that.

32
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.990
Yeah one idea is if you have a guess as to what the last 50 of the pricing is you could create a elasticity

33
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.620
table.

34
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.990
We're on one side you have the price of the lemonade on the other side could be the metric that we were

35
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.980
using for demand so it could be the start percentage or it could be the purchase percentage rate for

36
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.250
given the same amount of traffic maybe at a higher price you're going to assume a lower start percentage

37
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.540
and maybe a lower percentage of people that actually will buy.

38
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.590
So if you have that schedule what you can do is then every time you put in a new price that's from that

39
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.270
table you look up the percentage and you look up the purchase percentage automatically from that table

40
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.160
and you can pretty much pass across various combinations of prices.

41
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.910
Okay yeah that would make sense because then if you get a table you could do a lot of miniature gases

42
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.180
so that you know if you change your price you wouldn't have to revamp the whole model exactly.

43
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.870
Yeah.

44
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.150
I mean one other thing Tony I was thinking of and in my case study that I did with my old startup we

45
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.590
covered just the Excel concept called Pivot Tables.

46
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.830
I am obsessed with Pivot Tables total like nerd out on these things but what you can do is you can set

47
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.430
up all of your assumptions in one sheet.

48
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.870
Right.

49
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.190
So you put like your price and you put a percentage of how many people stop by based on how many people

50
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.380
walk by.

51
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.880
And then this is doesn't really necessarily fix the problem of price testing but it allows you to change

52
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.020
it very quickly.

53
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.120
So you could do is just literally that one sheet change those numbers as you go.

54
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.570
Right so you could get $3 one day you could go back and for the next day maybe $294.

55
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.080
So you literally just change three to four and it changes all the way throughout your sheet.

56
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.950
We cover that a little bit and the scholar paroquet studies so check that out.

57
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.790
If you want to add a little bit a better idea of what I'm talking about.

58
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.970
All right time you got a question yeah another question that I think some of the students might be asking

59
00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.360
especially early on looking at the lemonade example was hey you know I'm actually really interested

60
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.990
in doing more of a tech related startup so you know there really is Lemonade work.

61
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.580
And the answer is yeah we really think you should because if you don't have a lot of background and

62
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.520
financial modeling the lemonade stand example isn't to teach you about Lemonheads or the lemonade business

63
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.160
itself.

64
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.960
You don't really know too much about that but it's to show you the process of modeling and creating

65
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.520
the models progressively.

66
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.630
So you get a feel for you know what that process is like.

67
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.610
The thinking process that structure thinking and whatever model you're going to be building for your

68
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.340
start of that process is going to be very helpful for you as you go through it.

69
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.060
Yeah.

70
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:52.530
And another concept I kind of tried to touch on was that all models and this is the way that we kind

71
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.530
of designed a curriculum that all models start off from looking the exact same right.

72
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.620
It's kind of like babies like we all kind of look like baby shrimp at the very beginning and then we

73
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.580
start changing as we get more and more complex terrible analogy I'm sorry.

74
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.180
So it's kind of similar to that.

75
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.470
Right.

76
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.450
Like if you wanted to do the most ridiculous pay what you want.

77
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:21.850
Business Model start up for God only knows like some new solar panel that you know you finance and you

78
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.900
have to raise money to pay for it.

79
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.580
You always start off at the very beginning like you're always going to start off with the most basic

80
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.690
stuff like What are your startup expenses.

81
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.770
What are your ongoing expenses as you operate and how roughly do you see revenue.

82
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.320
Right.

83
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.400
And then then you'll get into more specific stuff so you have to have a solid foundation raise.

84
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.630
You're going to have to do that stuff regardless so you might as well make sure that you have that 100

85
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.180
percent like under wraps What if I don't know the foot traffic yet.

86
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.980
What if I don't know what kind of price and what price I want to charge yet.

87
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.680
Right.

88
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.790
You can still build the motto because the mechanisms of how it works doesn't have to change.

89
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.890
It's more of you're building it so that it can account for those assumptions.

90
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.610
And so that when you do find out it's you just plug it in rather than you know you kind of not doing

91
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.330
anything and then you still have to build it later.

92
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.370
Yeah yeah.

93
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.180
Yeah.

94
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.370
And I think it's kind of like I think of it kind of like a three point process by which you can kind

95
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.850
of solve this.

96
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.360
I don't know any information about how many people walk by.

97
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.780
Right.

98
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.830
Like I think one if you Google and look for someone else's template that might be somewhat related you

99
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:43.670
can find that they might have some kind of number that you can you can take and then to oftentimes you

100
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.440
can find industry benchmarks.

101
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.670
Right.

102
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:51.650
So there are a lot of companies that just publish marketing information and they'll publish like here

103
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.380
are the statistics of how many people walk into a retail shop at this given location based on the category.

104
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.970
I know it's a lot of work but you can kind a Masters together to get at least a somewhat sane idea.

105
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.510
Right.

106
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.900
And then when you actually get out there immediately adjust it we're just trying to make sure you don't

107
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.730
blow up the model at the very beginning and then a third thing is if you can't do either one of those

108
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.140
really just comes down to guessing.

109
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.630
I mean I feel like you just really got to sit down and actually try to think about it.

110
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.170
Remember you don't have to get the right answer.

111
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.010
You just have to get something that is not insane right.

112
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:31.120
So that's the standard just not absolutely crazy you know hey I'm nervous.

113
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.790
I really have no financial modeling background I have no finance background.

114
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.180
The stuff looks really complicated even for the lemonade example.

115
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.750
Do I really need to learn this.

116
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.920
You know I think if you're starting a business or if you're going to be making business decisions for

117
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:54.120
even a business unit just being able to connect your choices are visitants choices with the impact to

118
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.390
the business is going to be really helpful.

119
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:02.120
Now are you going to you know have to be able to build super complex financial models.

120
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:07.230
Probably for most of you you don't need to but being able to understand how you go from assumptions

121
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.310
to how it impacts your business is going to be something that will be useful for all of us.

122
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:19.030
One question I had when going through the lemonade stand was so we value our time.

123
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.440
Right.

124
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.320
So that was kind of our profit baseline.

125
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.010
We were saying well we only get paid $30 an hour and that's how we're going to work backwards and figure

126
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.540
out how much money we have to make.

127
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.760
Therefore how much we have to charge.

128
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.240
So my question was clearly there's two phases of this right.

129
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.700
They're running the business and then there's the starting up of the business.

130
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.030
Right.

131
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:47.380
So how do we value our time during the startup phase and not the ongoing phase.

132
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:47.600
Right.

133
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.010
And should we actually do that.

134
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.080
Because presumably if it takes you six days of work to set up the lemonade stand.

135
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.030
Well I mean that's a pretty big sunk cost.

136
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:03.700
So you should probably think I actually probably bake that $30 into that too as well.

137
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.190
Jimmy thoughts on that.

138
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.900
Yeah I think I think so.

139
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.570
Surely if you're just going to be doing like a test initially to see if you really want to stick with

140
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:19.350
it you may be able to find out how many days you need to test it out in order for you to make that early

141
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.580
sunk cost time worthwhile.

142
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.260
Yeah I mean I don't I don't think it's I think we didn't get to it just because a lemonade stand it

143
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.090
was like we just want to get the basics down.

144
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.910
But I would probably yeah I'd suggest that you have some type of a corporation into that.

145
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.890
You know one thing you have to understand is that when you're starting a business specifically there's

146
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:45.590
kind of this feeling that oh if you're factoring in your salary into it then you're not really an entrepreneur

147
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.610
kind of thing like entrepreneurs.

148
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.490
They work for free and they just kind of make everything work eventually by they own like sweat of their

149
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.430
brow and that's only really partially true.

150
00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:03.210
I mean one thing you have to understand is that if you don't bake in your time into your models early

151
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:03.890
on.

152
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.860
Well that's great.

153
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:11.010
I mean you might might end up happening is you might end up making a business that makes sense financially

154
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:17.580
but it's only making sense because you have this goes to labor right you have this person it's you who's

155
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.350
doing everything for free and that's not scalable.

156
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.020
I have seen that happen a lot where people are like oh man my margins are 20 percent.

157
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.370
This is fantastic time to scale.

158
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.550
And then they hire someone and they find out their gross margins are now negative.

159
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.760
Right.

160
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.820
Because they just never thought Oh right I've been doing everything.

161
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:43.320
So in general I think it's something you should try doing earlier on don't really worry about that stuff

162
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.140
when you get to fund raising.

163
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:51.300
And I know give you a tip when you go to a venture capitalist or a savvy angel right after to qualify

164
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.870
that they will look for this stuff right.

165
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.150
They want to make sure that you are valuing your time.

166
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.630
I've never met a venture capitalist I have met an angel investor but I never get venture capitalists

167
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:11.550
who is who thinks it's completely normal to go raise two years of funds and have no incorporation of

168
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.100
your salary into it.

169
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.520
Right.

170
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.590
So they would think that's ridiculous.

171
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.340
Like oh you're just going to burn out.

172
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.970
But they're also you just assume that you're an amateur like they'll just assume you've never done this

173
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.900
before and this is unrealistic.

174
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:30.480
Make sure you have enthusiasm but if you're not thinking about burnout and the fact that you have to

175
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.930
pay bills at the end of the day.

176
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:37.410
Well you know I mean that's often a it's all like a soft red flag.

177
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.790
You have you don't have money to pay your rent or to get food they're going to be worried about their

178
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.360
investment in the business.

179
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.210
Yeah.

180
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.950
Yeah exactly.

181
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.280
And it makes sense you know.

182
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.540
I mean that's and is totally off topic but a lot of times you see companies raise tons of money like

183
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.070
the raised $100 billion.

184
00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:56.510
Right.

185
00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:03.870
Let's say Groupon for instance Groupon you know a company that was like daily deals and they grew rapidly.

186
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.620
They had a billion dollars in 18 months.

187
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.410
Well they raised a billion dollars at one point and people were like wow it's Groupon going to do with

188
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.530
the billion dollars.

189
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.750
Well Google didn't get a billion dollars.

190
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:20.940
About 600 million of that went to the board and the founder and people think that's weird but it's actually

191
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.470
pretty normal.

192
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:31.220
People when you raise later on people want to make sure that you get rid of the what they call the money

193
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.890
question.

194
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.980
So they want to make sure like hey that's great that you're raising $50 dollars but if you're not taking

195
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:42.590
care of yourself how can I possibly expect you to be pulling 60 hours a week 80 hours a week running

196
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.250
this company.

197
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:43.640
Right.

198
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.500
You have to get a part time job at Chipotle.

199
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.320
Just to pay your bills and then I have a part time CEO.

200
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.410
So this is actually something you'll see through out the business and the startup life cycle back to

201
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.340
the lemonade stand.

202
00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:02.660
And if we decided to take our limited drink memory like we had premium and we had regular How would

203
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.040
we reflect this if from the get go.

204
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.140
We wanted to work with like five or six different types of lemonade.

205
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.210
Right.

206
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.520
I would imagine you get very messy.

207
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.550
But what's the best way of doing that right.

208
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.020
Because we're guessing on all of these things so what if we day one we're like we're going to peach

209
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.550
strawberry Lemon called pure sugar and like two other ones.

210
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.250
How exactly would we do that.

211
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.830
Do you know of any easy ways to do it.

212
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.140
Yeah.

213
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:39.610
Well I mean I'm just thinking strictly in terms of the lemonade stand business then but I think there's

214
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.950
a lesson to be drawn from that.

215
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.370
And you're thinking about multiple different lemonade options and maybe there's like a very a Kiwi or

216
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.450
a mango or whatever the different options to start off with.

217
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.440
You may want to try to get some data point like simple data points right.

218
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.480
You may just have the names of those things and the prices and just do a simple survey to get an idea

219
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.510
of what the interest distribution might be.

220
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.850
And so then in your model if you have the traffic you can then at least have a starting point for how

221
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.690
that traffic might be distributed in terms of interest for what's available at your table.

222
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:18.770
Yeah I don't I don't know if any of your students are in my MVP course we go over like hundreds of ways

223
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.380
not hundreds obviously but tons and tons of ways that you can get that really quick customer feedback.

224
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.880
You know I mean in the case of a lemonade stand you might be going to the locations and just with a

225
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.290
flyer and just talking to people.

226
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:37.370
But there's one hundred and 101 other ways to get very quickly be like oh no one's interested in my

227
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.720
beer or sugar lemonade idea.

228
00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.820
Maybe I should scrap that.

229
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:48.290
But then also looking at the yeah again the proportion right because it's not like you have six Skewes

230
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:56.300
S-K use meaning like six different items that you sell that that's going to increase the number of people

231
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.700
that are walking by the area to begin with.

232
00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.410
Right.

233
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:06.560
Really you're just dividing that same amount of people down across the six new different types.

234
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:14.540
So it doesn't change the top line revenue potential or customer potential It just changes the way that

235
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.560
you divide it up.

236
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:16.490
Yeah I think more.

237
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.810
More so dividing it up.

238
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:23.390
Yeah I mean there could be a possibility where somebody seeing more options maybe there's some people

239
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.460
that are willing to stop by the table whereas if you only have one option they don't stop by the table

240
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.440
but it's probably not going to be a big percentage of the flip side where these studies are people have

241
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.290
to make choices they end up buying less.

242
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.020
Yes.

243
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.280
Oh boy.

244
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:44.050
Yeah the restaurant that has like 400 things on its menu versus the one that's five what is I'm curious

245
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:49.580
I mean what is the most complicated or elaborate thing you've ever had to model out.

246
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.100
Ooh.

247
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.430
OK.

248
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:57.950
When I was doing some underwriting for the pain or restaurant for the group that all the pancakes for

249
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:07.550
Express stores throughout America are one of the things I had to do was do a projection of the purse

250
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.730
or financial projections.

251
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:18.340
But basically I had to do a goal seek for all the all of the store based on I think like 100 and different

252
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.700
factors for each of them.

253
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.880
So they all had their own set of assumptions for the stores because a lot of them had prior history

254
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:31.510
and then I had to do that in a way that was bought that where I wouldn't go insane doing every single

255
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.520
thing.

256
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.890
So it was it was kind of a little bit tougher at the time because I wasn't super experienced with VBA

257
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.100
scripting.

258
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.200
So once you kind of learn to do that it becomes a little bit easier to do some like automated stuff

259
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.540
and do it at a larger scale.

260
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:52.120
I think that's probably one of the harder things where you have some complexity at an individual kind

261
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.060
of a unit or store level already.

262
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.900
And then you also have some layer of additional complexity.

263
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.810
We're combining hundreds or thousands of them together.

264
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:01.350
Yeah.

265
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:02.030
Yeah.

266
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.990
So it's like depth versus kind of breath.

267
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:05.490
Yeah.

268
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:11.470
Also one thing anyone was worth pointing out is that when you model there is infinite complexity you

269
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:16.810
can add right like we could take that lemonade stand and go to town with it like we could talk about

270
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.250
we could have modeled out the temperature on a day to day basis.

271
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.980
And building in a correlation to our sales based on that.

272
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:29.450
Right like we could have built in a training module we could have built and taxation and labor.

273
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.110
You couldn't make these things infinitely complex.

274
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.690
But the question is how far do you have to go to answer those questions that are are most important

275
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.680
to what you're trying to figure out.

276
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.230
And that's obviously we cover in the next section.

277
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.800
So you just understand that like you can model all day long.

278
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.800
I remember seeing a model for a startup that is in an incubator they're making like they're doing like

279
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:58.510
financing plans for photovoltaic like solar panels and opening up their model and just it just was so

280
00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.310
overwhelmed I really like 40 tabs at one point time.

281
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.770
They're modeling our climate change.

282
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:12.190
And like you know it's like universal predictions that climate scientists make that like in five years

283
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:17.050
will be negative six Celsius from our baseline and they were like charting that out and the likelihood

284
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:17.930
of hitting that.

285
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.450
And if it's worse than what was going to happen then this would affect their demand in effect.

286
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.470
They're saying holes and they're even like doing all this crazy stuff.

287
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.490
But like our main markets in California and California is not near the Arctic shelf so they're due to

288
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.540
be less affected.

289
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:37.090
But if we still like Massachusetts it's it's not like it was not necessary right at that point you're

290
00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.890
probably wasting time unless you have a hundred person company and you literally have an intern that

291
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:47.560
you love torturing and then it's not a waste of time but otherwise man I don't know.

292
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.660
You just have to solve is it absolutely necessary.

293
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.330
Yeah.

294
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:56.560
I think like a good question asked is it really going to factor into your decision making right now

295
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.750
or your upcoming decisions.

296
00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.380
Ok cool.

297
00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.620
So that's all my questions for Section 2.

298
00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:10.860
Guys if you have any questions just actually put them in the Q&amp;A or preferably the slack chat please.

299
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.410
We get to those a lot faster than the Q&amp;A Q&amp;A.

300
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.050
Man I just I don't know about you but like I lose those answers all the time.

301
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.150
I see this question of like I'm going to answer this and then I go back and you know my system is like

302
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.310
somehow hidden it or deleted it.

303
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.190
It's really hard to use.

304
00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.560
So if he in a slack.

305
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.150
Ideally any questions you have we can definitely come back and address these if we think it's something

306
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:38.410
that people you know have questions about often enough but otherwise let us know your thoughts and we'll

307
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.320
see you in the next section.
