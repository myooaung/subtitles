1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,050
You guys will come back and we're going to talk about the last sections of the financial model graphs

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,110
charts simple revenue and then two different scenarios.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,630
See the graphs and charts over here.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,150
Is this a reflection of what we covered in these three.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:22,140
So right here we just seen a graph of three years and showing our cash balance.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,420
And then the expected profit to the cash balance is the red as you see here it's like we spend spend

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,500
spend spend spend.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,530
Then we start making some revenue and then we start kind of evening it out and then we get another school

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:41,880
and it kind of just has a bunny hop effect here and it starts compounding as we keep adding schools

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,460
and schools kind of continue to promote them because once you get them on it's not really a one and

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,000
done thing.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,550
They keep advertising so that's kind of a factor that worked well for us down here.

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,950
Revenue year one by month again it's just spike down then spike again and these are just based off those

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,080
numbers before we assumed half as many people in the second month would would sign up as the first one

15
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,130
and then half of that and then half of that and half of that descrive essentially just to show them

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,640
that we understand the function of how our revenue is going to work if we're doing B2B that then essentially

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,180
advertises to students because then it's B to C that's what this is going to look like.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,970
And then this is more or less just to show them hey look we have a graph and it goes up and this is

19
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,210
what it should look like we should have more cash as we go along.

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,020
And then this is since this is a month by month that's why this doesn't.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,040
You don't really notice it's going up to the right because it's literally one month is how much you

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,260
make the money you make per month per month.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,940
We put this into a year then we start seeing it kind of go up or at least like a cumulative quarter

24
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,550
even.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,340
All right so this is really not much to say about that great here.

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,850
I feel like we just had to get a graph in here somewhere.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,880
Here's a simpler revenue.

28
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,660
And this is just a concept that you can use and I generally suggest you do it.

29
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,110
Now you noticed how we had a monthly income statement and this thing was blown up and had all sorts

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,490
of detail and stuff in it.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,480
Then this one was a contracted version that you could look at very quickly.

32
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,850
Now people who are looking at this model need to be able to get the information they want relatively

33
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,160
quickly without having to really kind of weed through the forest here.

34
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,190
So this is the idea.

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,580
We put it down here.

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,140
We really tried to distill down this is how we grow.

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,070
And this is where we're going to get our money from.

38
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,370
Total one year is 106.

39
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,160
How many we're going to add schools or an add 88 all the way across and you can start seeing that.

40
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,260
Well here's the cumulative effect.

41
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,700
And here is the available student market as it grows.

42
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,270
We could have done this in one long line but visually it is just easier to stack them like this.

43
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,570
These are really just the same stats we used before we just pick the ones that were the most important.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,250
And then just showed kind of the totals down here and then and as you can see it goes up.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,640
That's really the main point.

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:57,990
Yeah.

47
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,570
Not much else really to say on that.

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,860
It's just a simplified version.

49
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,820
It's really like the regular condensed income statement version of this or this is just only focusing

50
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,340
on revenue growth and nothing else.

51
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,630
Now the scenarios over here what we did and I explain this in the first lecture we picked out two scenarios

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,030
that we had heard people say or had gotten pushback on and we modeled out what would happen in those

53
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,530
scenarios.

54
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,670
And these are both two scenarios that are bad.

55
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,470
We're an early model of the ones that we're good.

56
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,640
We could have done that.

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,540
We'd rather show we can protect ourselves from the bad things that happen.

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,780
Now the first scenario was a missed deadline and I believe the way that this was set up was that if

59
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:48,000
we started off and we didn't have the application ready in time to start having the first batch of schools

60
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,500
advertise like I think we're saying that is going to take four months to make it.

61
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,780
So this is assumption that maybe it takes eight months or nine months to make it which is actually more

62
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,910
reasonable than anything what would happen.

63
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,020
Well really all it does is it just pushes everything out.

64
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,400
So then if you look over here we just don't have that first hump that you would expect around here.

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,880
It just gets pushed out to our break even is later.

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,840
And our cumulative revenue for the first year is smaller.

67
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,470
But in the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter.

68
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,020
And now it's kind of something we were trying to show them.

69
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:28,460
Our cash still never hits the ground so we are for the most part fine.

70
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,060
And then also down here we just are a quick income statement.

71
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,740
I think we kind of rushed to this one because we probably should have put this in a separate.

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,580
Not just a tab made this little bit easier to read.

73
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,020
So really there's just Year One if this is income statement for one year.

74
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,310
If we had that issue and we didn't end up doing it for two or three because the deadline really only

75
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,510
affects the first year.

76
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,830
OK.

77
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,310
So that's it.

78
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,840
People say to us hey what happens if your development takes longer than you think of getting scholarships

79
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,060
on Zong and then you think well here you go.

80
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,560
This is what happens and it's as you conceive are grasses it's not that big of a deal.

81
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,170
And this one is the pushback to what people would sometimes say is they thought our sales was too aggressive.

82
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,850
What if we get into it realize it's way more complicated when we try to scale we can't possibly add

83
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,180
that many schools or you know we end up spending the money on other things not sales mostly on development

84
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,080
or something like that.

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,770
So what we said here was OK well why don't we just make a model saying that we're only going to get

86
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,260
15 schools for the first year.

87
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:38,010
So just 15 and then we wanted to show them what that looks like if we were really on a slower sales

88
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,840
trajectory.

89
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,130
So that was the case then you can see right here that our subscribers are smaller.

90
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,520
They come in later.

91
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,140
But it really kind of has the same structural impact.

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,830
The only difference is it's the revenue numbers are lower and then the costs.

93
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,580
Over here the ones that are more variable end up being lower like our data entry.

94
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,710
So we just we kind of adjusted it in the sense that if only adding three well then we can kind of slow

95
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,030
down probably data entry and probably slow down account management and sales.

96
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,430
So that's one way of doing the only thing that doesn't change most likely is the management rights of

97
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,340
management doesn't change.

98
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,790
Well that's I mean that's one way of showing the impact if we could only put on 15 schools in the first

99
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,660
year as opposed to what we were saying before like a hundred something like that.

100
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,200
So we're shown them wow this is the scenario if we totally bomb the sales estimations.

101
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,960
And again it looks pretty much fine.

102
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,940
I think we just didn't.

103
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Honestly I don't think we just finished it over here but we would probably just keep going putting zeros

104
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,400
there.

105
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,790
And so then you can see here again our cash goes down but we never really run into a situation where

106
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,950
we're hurting for cash and need to raise again which is really what we were trying to avoid.

107
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,490
Again investors they like that they generally like seeing that hey you're not going have to get more

108
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,620
money just to make our first investment work.

109
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,910
OK guys so that is the entirety of the scholar pro financial model.

110
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,250
This again was what we use to raise our second round of one and a half million that we ended up actually

111
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,530
only raising a million because the fundraising around it took so long that we kind of closed what we

112
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,010
had just moved on and adjusted the numbers accordingly.

113
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,620
Again we just kind of fiddle with numbers over here and that's how we had a new operational model.

114
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,260
You guys have any questions about this.

115
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,860
Feel free to ask again.

116
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,930
This is rather it wasn't like a structured lecture.

117
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,910
I just thought it would be interesting to show you guys what a real one looks like and kind of look

118
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:42,480
over the shoulder of kind of an autopsy of a company that went up and then went down and and this is

119
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,930
kind of what it looked like during the middle where it looked like we're doing fine.

120
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,480
All right guys I'll catch you later.
