1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,050
All right so now we're looking at the revenue worksheet so we're looking at something like the standard

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,420
Assembly we might have some products like this.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,990
Right.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,700
We have some full time bootcamps some part time bootcamps and online course offerings in and we want

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,770
to think about it is you're going to start off with a certain number of these courses for each of them

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,330
and you're going to be adding some over time.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,240
So but there's a limit to how many you can do.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,000
Right.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,180
So depending on the space the only rooms you have there's really a limit for how many full time bootcamps

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,270
you can do and how many part time bootcamps you can do.

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:34,890
OK.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,770
And how how often you can.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,400
Adam So when we did think about that is we think about some starting value.

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,380
How many there starting off with.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,670
And then we think about eventually what is the max number of courses that we can do and how often are

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,080
we going to be adding a course for each of these.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,150
How many seats are available for each class.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,870
So we're looking at the spaces before we can fit about 100 chairs and some tables and so the max capacity

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,900
we're going to say for these courses these in-person courses is 100.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,180
Technically the online courses don't have an upper limit.

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:18,040
However this business model requires that there is a tutor and that does one on ones with with the students.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,720
So there is going to be a little bit limit.

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:26,590
And so we're going to put a limit of 500 for now and there's going to be a price for each of these products.

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,920
Right.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,870
And there's going to be some cost of acquiring a student.

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,590
OK.

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,150
So right now we're going to make some assumptions here but we can change this later we're just putting

28
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,300
some dummy numbers here where basically if you're able to charge 13 grand you better be able to spend

29
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,660
a few hundred bucks to acquire a student.

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,430
So the other thing that we're going to think about for these products is you know we're going to start

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,590
off with a certain number of seats available for those courses right but we're not going to start off

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,830
100 percent sold or utilize initially it's going to take us some time to ramp up and do marketing and

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,730
kind of fill things up so we may start with much lower utilization rates.

34
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,840
On day one when a launch is slow you get to higher utilization.

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,430
We may be nearly fully utilized for the full time 2 cans for the part time is a little bit last money

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,360
for online even less than that.

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,840
And how long is it going to take us to go from here.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,380
The starting point to the stabilized point.

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,700
Right.

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,510
So that's where this is and the length of the program the way we're going to model it to keep things

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:39,290
simple is because we you know if you have length of a program they're paying for three months of the

42
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,560
program for this price.

43
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:40,830
Right.

44
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,640
But then you don't get to collect that every month.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,010
It's a one time payment and then you have them for three months now over time as you run this program

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,010
we're going to be able to do is we're just going to take that and assume you get it evenly across the

47
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,080
length of the program.

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,560
Just to simplify the model.

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,620
Right now now we're going to also assume that there is some sort of a refund rate not all students are

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,520
going to stay there.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,560
So then when we have these starting assumptions then we can start to kind of build things out a little

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,010
bit.

53
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:16,390
Now this right here the timing of it this actually came from what we were doing before and the start

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,100
of work.

55
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,670
Right.

56
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,630
Remember more of this and this year.

57
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,290
So net Let's see how that works now.

58
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,810
So here we have the months and for the permitting.

59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,400
We're doing everything here we're doing something called the dummy numbers.

60
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,620
We're either putting a 1 or 0 or a 1 is means that we are in that period a period permitting period

61
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,830
in months 1 to three because what the assumptions are.

62
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,070
And once that's done see how construction kicks in for our assumption I think we had it at six months

63
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,000
so then it goes from four to nine.

64
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,180
And then the launch happens after construction.

65
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,730
And I think we set it for another three months which happens.

66
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,170
So then total happening throughout during the build that period on launch is 12 months.

67
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:07,230
And then once we're active we will get active post-launch starting in month 13 here.

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,210
We don't we just care about putting ones and zeroes in these for just to know where they're at.

69
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:12,650
Okay.

70
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,350
And we're going to see how this is relevant to later because we need to keep track of things because

71
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,380
the active part we're not going to be able to have students paying students while you're getting Permatang

72
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,110
And while you're doing construction right.

73
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,230
But during those periods we're still need we still need to track it because we're actually spending

74
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,120
money at that time.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,160
OK so now that we have the timing let's start with how we can start thinking about the courses.

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,760
Right.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,020
So we may start with thinking about how many courses do we have and we all know what that kick in though

78
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,440
after we actually go active we see that so see here it kicks in when we start going active and it kicks

79
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,720
in at these starting values that we started with.

80
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:57,620
And the way it's modeled here it allows us to go from the starting point and then to grow at the rates

81
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,260
that we put put there where a certain number of courses.

82
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,530
Right.

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,280
So we're adding online courses a lot faster than we're adding full time boot camps.

84
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,460
And we see that we slowly at the course count until we reach some sort of a stabilized rate for 9:24

85
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,130
which actually came from the column D here.

86
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,230
See that great.

87
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:22,530
So once we have the course count then what we're going to have then we can start tackling the total

88
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,760
available capacity.

89
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,830
So this one is pretty easy it's going to be the number of courses times the max capacity for each course

90
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,260
right.

91
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,770
We have the assumptions earlier right here.

92
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,450
A hundred.

93
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,760
One hundred and five hundred.

94
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,340
So then we just have the number of courses times the capacity.

95
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,780
And sometimes in modeling there's a reason why created left so much space here is because sometimes

96
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,060
when you have these different assumptions it's easier to pull them to the side here.

97
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,540
So the 100 500 you know pull them here and so I can look at it when I do the modeling.

98
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,600
At this level.

99
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,420
So I can just refer to those values.

100
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,550
If you look at this I'm just referring to this value here rather than having go back to the top.

101
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,930
All right then utilization remember from here to here we're doing the same thing right.

102
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,580
So we got to wait till it's the correct month when we launch and when we launch we're starting at the

103
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,180
initial utilization and then we're slowly going all the way to the stabilize utilization rate which

104
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,530
is like what we set here.

105
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:25,390
So then based on a realization then we have the actual number of seats sold for each of these programs.

106
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,560
That's going to be the utilization times the seats that are available.

107
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,620
So initially it's not going to be as high.

108
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:30,960
Right.

109
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,610
But then afterwards it starts to get higher then the revenue becomes easier.

110
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,900
Right then the revenue for us is going to be the number of seats sold for each of the programs times

111
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,030
the price but divided by the length of the program so that we're not overcounting the revenue.

112
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:54,690
Now there's a harder way to do this the harder way to do this is to track when it's paid and then only

113
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,820
only have it come in for one hour of the length of the program.

114
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,350
So if it's one out if it's three months then it only paid in the first month not the second and third

115
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,120
but if you're running this on a monthly basis what you can do is just divide it by the length of the

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,620
program because it kind of averages out to be the same.

117
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,640
If you if you have multiple classes from.

118
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,370
So it's like three if you get a third of the first month a third of the second month a third of third

119
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,340
month and you add it up.

120
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,020
You basically have the full price right.

121
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:29,040
And it would be the same as having the people paying just the full rate in that month.

122
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,030
So the difference is pretty insignificant.

123
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,130
And to model it the other way is a lot harder than what the formula is a lot harder to explain as well.

124
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,460
So there's ways a much simpler and you pretty much can use resolve say you can work with.

125
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,630
So that's why we do it that way.

126
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,510
Now once we have the girls revenues then we can say hooray we will Let's see what the refunds are right.

127
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,680
So we take away the refunds and the refunds because we want to visually track that it's a negative number.

128
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,830
We're going to make it negative.

129
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,550
So then then the combination of the two the gross revenue minus the refunds equals to the net revenues.

130
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,480
Okay so now we have the revenue here in the next lecture.

131
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,780
Let's see how the expenses are model.
