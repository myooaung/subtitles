1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,170
Hey All right let's get started.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:09,620
Now what you were looking at first is just some brainstorm ideas that I had before I started building

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,780
any models sometimes just gathering your notes on what you know about how you want to model it.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,520
Business model revenues expenses overhead anything that is just things that you want to make sure you

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,490
remember as you build it you can put it in a brainstorm worksheet just to make sure that you remember

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:28,840
them.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:35,510
OK so once you have that one of the first things that's easier to build that is start up related assumptions.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:42,830
Now for a start like this where we're going to be converting some space year you got to furnish some

9
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,020
space.

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,850
We may want to break out some of the startup costs differently.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,610
So we'll break out.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,320
For instance the buildout for the space and how we're going to furnish all the spaces.

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,530
Right.

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:02,540
So this right here is we get the total size of the facility and then how are we to allocate the space

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,250
based on these breakdowns.

16
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,860
So then we have the square footage.

17
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,820
Now that means we'll have different number of units for some of them right.

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,900
We may have two big rooms and we have multiple number of breakout rooms maybe some other bigger common

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,770
space and then some offices and reception area.

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,130
OK.

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,670
Now the build out for each of these spaces might be different.

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,380
Right because a big room that's just filled with chairs you don't really need to put a light in there

23
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,520
but break rooms.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,720
You probably don't need a lot in there either just some tables and chairs and some other things but

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,310
offices and common space.

26
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,930
You've got to make it a little bit nicer.

27
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:43,820
There's going to be more of fixtures that are going to cost a little bit more.

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,280
So the build out for that space might be a little bit more.

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,560
So that's why we're going to break out the build out costs separately and so we can get a sense of how

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,470
each of the space is going to cost in terms of getting it to the point where you can start renovating

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:57,770
it.

32
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,770
Now for this one we're going to assume that they're taking a long term lease on this.

33
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,980
And so they're leasing it and they're they're putting down a secure deposit and then they're doing some

34
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,930
of their own build.

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,230
Ok for those costs.

36
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:15,890
Now in terms of furnishing the spaces one way to do something like this is to create a little grid a

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,340
matrix like this.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,710
OK.

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,480
So on the vertical axis we have the things that you can fill any of the spaces with.

40
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,270
So I have large table small table chairs desk chairs projector TV and just all sorts of goodies and

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,840
left a few other spaces for miscellaneous things.

42
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,630
And then on the horizontal axes we have the different spaces right.

43
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,780
Then what we can do is we can just put in the number of how many of each of these things we want to

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,330
put in there.

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:49,330
So a large table we don't need it in the classrooms but we want to in the breakout rooms each breakout

46
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,830
room is going to have one large table and three small tables.

47
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,770
So that's how we do that.

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,690
And here this is just the per cost of a per unit cost of all of these.

49
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,870
So then from that once we have all of these puts in there we can calculate the total furnishing costs

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:13,280
for each of the rooms and the way we do that is we basically take a product of these right the product

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,290
of each of these and then sum it up.

52
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,050
So we do the same product and then we multiply by how many number of units of those spaces there.

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,830
So it's these ones we're classrooms and we only have one.

54
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,170
So we're just going to leave it as is.

55
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,230
But if we change the number of units it would be different.

56
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,070
It would cost a little bit more because we have to furnish more.

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,300
So we see this come in a lot more for the breakout rooms right.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,730
It costs a lot less to to furnish one of them but because there's 15 of them the total cost is going

59
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,600
to be more than furnishing the other spaces.

60
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,630
We have something similar for the common and open spaces because we're putting a lot more chairs a more

61
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,150
big tables and such.

62
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,500
Okay.

63
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,690
So based on these assumptions we can have total cost of furnishing.

64
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:00,500
Okay so this here this worksheet then tells us how much we need for build out and how much we need for

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,620
furnishing and just kind of getting the space ready.

66
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,160
Next what we can do is kind of look at the actual startup related costs.

67
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,350
Right.

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,700
So I see that the build out and the furniture.

69
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,950
So this is not quite true anymore.

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,390
All right.

71
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:21,190
So the build out and the furniture and equipment or something like that is pulled from our build out

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,030
and furniture furnishing worksheet.

73
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,540
But then there are other things that are going to required for doing this kind of business.

74
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,930
You still need to get permits you may need to get some architecture and engineering to help you you

75
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,900
know make sure that you're doing everything to compliance as well as it looks nice and you're going

76
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,450
to need some initial marketing budget.

77
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,520
Once you have the space ready to really launch this thing you may be paying someone to help you build

78
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
a nice web site.

79
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:57,950
You're paying your first month's rent and security deposit you're getting a you know some setting up

80
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,960
some other expenses that you need to pay throughout the launch period and you know you're getting some

81
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,150
funds ready for early hiring and training you've got to hire associates and train them and get them

82
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,970
ready before you actually have the opening.

83
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,590
So you're going to have to pay them for that and maybe you want to set aside some additional construction

84
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,600
contingency.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:17,990
OK.

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,900
So then when we add it all up then we have these totals start up costs there.

87
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,670
Now one thing about the start of kaso is that's not all that you're going to need in order to get things

88
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,530
going.

89
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,500
You're going to need some working capital capital that you're going to need to keep paying for the lights

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,520
to stay on and the utilities and the wages before your revenue starts to outpace it and you're able

91
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,800
to break even and start making a profit.

92
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,190
So we're going to revisit this at the very end because we're going to calculate this at the very end.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,620
It requires us to actually model everything else out first before we can calculate what these are.

94
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,270
OK now what's this stuff over here.

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,740
Well this stuff over here is just to help us understand the timing of when these startup costs occur.

96
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,710
They don't all happen on day one.

97
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,310
They happen over time and some of them happen first before the other.

98
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,840
You're going to have to make sure you're permitted and you did do all your Any stuff before you can

99
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,380
actually do your construction or rehab.

100
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,660
Right.

101
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,700
So we're looking at these periods in and threw out just means it happens throughout all of this all

102
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,230
the permitting construction and the early launch.

103
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,020
OK.

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,340
So what we then do is all right for each of these timings we've got to determine how long they last

105
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,320
and in what order.

106
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,560
Right.

107
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,760
So we're going to have a permitting may take three months and then after it's done then we go into a

108
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,650
construction or rehab period where you're doing all the build out and making sure everything's furnish.

109
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,140
And then after that there's three months of launch that's when you know we're actually spending these

110
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,110
amounts of money.

111
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,500
Right.

112
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,330
So this will allow us to model out when these expenses are going to happen.

113
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,690
And in the next lecture we're going to see how we use the timing for modeling also for some of the revenue

114
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,860
related things.
