Hey welcome back to the course when it comes to financial modeling.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,510
You don't want to just sit down and start putting formulas down in a spreadsheet that you like champagne

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,850
in your car for a long road trip without having any destinations in mind and just going wherever the

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,220
day takes you.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,280
Now I sounds like a lot of fun but not when it comes to building a financial model.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,490
So before you actually start building your model you should have a very good idea of the overall structure

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,400
and flow that you're creating.

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,180
In order to do that.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,180
You need to have a clear idea of exactly what questions you're trying to answer what sort of decisions

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,190
will this model help you with for entrepreneurs and startups.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,160
Those questions might be hey what are the key drivers of revenue for my business.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,680
What business model is better.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,040
What pricing model should we use.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,990
How would revenues look like if we did X versus Y versus Z.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,910
How quickly do we need to grow in order to hit our profit goals.

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,090
There are tons of questions that a solid financial model could help you with.

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,120
But don't try to answer too many at the same time and definitely not at the very beginning start with

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,560
one key question.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,830
What is the one question that you're trying to answer first and what information would you need what

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,670
assumptions would you have to make in order to answer that question.

21
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,340
For example if you're deciding on which pricing model might work best for your startup your financial

22
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,940
model might compare different projections that are based on the same growth assumptions but with different

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,130
pricing models.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,540
So it doesn't really matter what question it is.

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,800
As long as it's clear because having the clear question we'll tell you what you need to build or account

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,950
for in your model in our jumpstarted example with the lemonade stand business.

27
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,340
We started off with creating a simple model to select the best location to use and we use the same methodology

28
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,680
to compare three potential locations by looking at the potential profits based on their traffic figures.

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:16,680
We did the same thing as we added more complex questions to models things like what if we added a premium

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,940
strawberry add on how would that affect the revenue and gross profits.

31
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,000
Finally we looked at what it would look like if we expand it to multiple locations.

32
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,780
If for example our question was Schweder open a lemonade stand or coke press juice stand.

33
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,270
Well then this kind of model would look very different.

34
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,410
We'd need to build two models one for each type of business and then compare the results.

35
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,420
Co-present uses my have very different economics.

36
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,270
They might require different laborous options different storage spaces different varieties maybe a higher

37
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,050
price point.

38
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:58,080
So it doesn't matter what question you're trying to answer you just need to be clear on what that is

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
up front before you start building your model.
