00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.070
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.950
Next up in our case study o rama.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.430
We're going to take this back to the basics.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.900
We're not going to focus on the Internet or businesses that can only be operated by Millennials are

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.320
disappearing photo app.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.310
This case said we're going to do a brick and mortar store going straight old school something that exists

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.610
in actual space might have a Web site but primarily lies on people coming in through the door and paying

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.580
you money.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.050
Yes.

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.470
You know that form of business that represents like any percent of the economy that we've kind of ignored

11
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.390
up until this point.

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.330
Now the obvious question is are we going to do a restaurant.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.050
And the answer is No.

14
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.270
Restaurants are popular Yes but they're incredibly complicated.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.610
If you guys really want to know how to do a Swedish meatball food truck or a lacto ovo gluten free fast

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.360
food chain restaurant just chime in in the comments or preferably in the slack group and we might do

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.570
it.

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.180
We're planning on adding more case studies at the end of this.

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.380
If you guys find these valuable so let us know.

20
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.570
Now what are we going to cover in this section here.

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.680
Clothing no restaurant no office supplies no we're going to cover Putt-Putt.

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.820
Now not technically Putt-Putt but we're going to do an indoor golf kind of facility.

23
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.730
The idea is you come here to play golf either by seeing a metal stick hitting a ball against a net which

24
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.840
actually is popular in places that have really high urban density like Japan or you can use a simulator

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.780
we hit a static ball and then the computer just tells you how well you did.

26
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.630
So yes we couldn't completely get away from technology.

27
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.460
But then again that's kind of where all the business opportunities are.

28
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550
So that is the name of the game.

29
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.960
We have a facility and we sell sessions of simulated golf.

30
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.520
I can't obviously play golf on account of being too athletic and way too good with my hand singular

31
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.000
but millions of you can see the appeal to a business like this.

32
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.910
Real golf courses take an enormous amount of space simulated golf courses do not take an enormous amount

33
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.690
of space.

34
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.490
And also there's a novelty factor to it.

35
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.990
So if you are opening an indoor golf store what do you think you might have to model.

36
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.560
Well we're probably going to have to charge per session outright or maybe we offer a subscription for

37
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.170
the regular simulated golfers.

38
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.930
And like a lot of businesses we're going to sell food in tandem with these sessions.

39
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.180
It's not going to be like a movie theater where 95 percent of the profit if not more comes from the

40
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.950
food sales.

41
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.640
But a large portion will their food will be a big deal but you'll also do fine on the sessions themselves.

42
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.170
Oh and you better believe we're going to have to plan out and chart how exactly we're going to pay for

43
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.630
the facility and all of the equipment.

44
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.570
So in this case somebody will even go a step farther and look at how financing the building and getting

45
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.150
a small business loan will affect the numbers.

46
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.800
We'll definitely have to address things like utilization a term that in another case he might have been

47
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.860
called like vacancy or downtime if you're talking about servers if the equipment sits there than it

48
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.890
isn't making money so we'll need to our best guess at what those rates might look like.

49
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.550
OK.

50
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.560
So get your head into the mind of a 10 professional golfer and we will see you in the next lecture.
