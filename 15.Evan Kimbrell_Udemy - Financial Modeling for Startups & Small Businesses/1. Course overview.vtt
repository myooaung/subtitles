00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.050
Welcome to a first not actual real lecture of the course we're just going to talk real quickly about

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.190
what we cover and what you should expect to get out of the course.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.260
We're going to start off with a lemonade stand business just to get your feet wet a little bit.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.360
And then in the next section we're going to talk about what are the things you need to know before you

5
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.070
start modeling as well let's go over some best practices that are going to help you with your modeling

6
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.360
after that.

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.560
Then we have a section where we work on modeling out your user growth and then followed by that we talk

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.620
about revenue growth in general.

9
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.680
How do you model revenue after that.

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.690
Then we wrap up by covering things like startup costs and just general business expenses.

11
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.680
And then after that we have seven different case anything at seven different case studies.

12
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.120
Each one we focus on an individual business model.

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.830
So we're going to cover things like coworking spaces.

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.220
That was one that those interesting we're in a cover online sace businesses.

15
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.540
We're going to cover restaurants and won one of them also covers my old education software startup called

16
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.320
scholar pro that was in about five years ago.

17
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.400
We also have a case study where you have a mobile app that you can book co-working spaces.

18
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.440
We call that one fancy bread.

19
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.020
We also have one where it's a golf course but it's got an interesting tech twist.

20
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.510
We also have a case study on a programming boot camp that is similar to the General Assembly.

21
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.560
They call it standard assembly because they're funny things that keep in mind about this course and

22
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.270
it kind of set your expectations.

23
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.660
We start off very simply.

24
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.670
We're going to start off by modeling a lemonade stand because it's so ubiquitous.

25
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.260
Everyone knows about that business but we're going to actually take it from the ground up and actually

26
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.750
get somewhat complicated with it.

27
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.650
Then later on as you get towards the end of the course we get into more complicated concepts and then

28
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.830
we'll end in the case studies where we get really specific into actual business models that might only

29
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.660
apply to one of your businesses and not all of yours.

30
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.310
And keep in mind that when you're doing the exercises there are two files for those lectures are the

31
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.310
exercise files and there are the reference files the exercise files have a lot of blank cells for you

32
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.490
to do your practice.

33
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.470
Then you get stuck.

34
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.750
You can check it against the reference files that have the solutions.

35
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.950
Now if you have a financial modeling background or you're very comfortable working with spreadsheets

36
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.050
some of the stuff may feel like a refresher for you so feel free to skip around and jump to the more

37
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.900
advanced stuff later in the course.

38
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.120
OK guys without further ado we will see you in the next lecture Sonia

39
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.030
because I want to read to

40
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.480
that.

41
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.960
We also have a case study on a brick and mortar business that involves putting a golf simulator with

42
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.120
a restaurant.

43
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.020
Dun dun dun.
