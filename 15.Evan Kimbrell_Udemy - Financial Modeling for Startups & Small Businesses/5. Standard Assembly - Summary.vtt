00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.180
Right finally we can look at the summary then you know we've Maatta out the revenue and the expenses

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.980
ready.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.740
Now it's useful to kind of pull everything together.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.040
Right.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.920
So in summary I'm kind of pulling everything from the revenue part of it so we can see it right.

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.420
This is what was calculated and the revenue worksheet.

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.950
And we have this breakdown and we go all the way to the total net revenues once we have that we start

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.150
looking at the expenses or the cash flow that's going out.

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.520
So we have the total start up line that's going out then we have the headcount then we calculate all

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.630
the compensation.

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.900
Some people are getting paid during the build out and some people are only hired after the launch.

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.110
Well the instructors primarily are paying some rent and there's other overhead and other expenses.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.590
So then we have the total spend in terms of cash flow out at that time.

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.670
So then the net cash flow will just be the difference between what's coming in versus what's going out.

15
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.430
We have sort of like this and pretty much all startups you're going to have a net cash flow of negative

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.390
initially for the initial months until some point where it turns around and you're making more money

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.760
than you're spending.

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.390
So we can see that that's where the turnaround is as the break even point.

19
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.010
Then the way we look at the actual cash flow needs though.

20
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.780
So we have all this to calculate what your cash flow in Csar the total net revenue that's that's cash

21
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.600
flow that's coming in.

22
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.540
Now all of this is the cash all that's going out right including your startup expenses are.

23
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.700
So when you take the difference and look at that collectively and cumulatively that's how you can see

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.800
a maximum cash.

25
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.450
So we have these net cash figures for each month.

26
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.440
When we look at it cumulatively right where we say we just keep adding them and what we can do is we

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.400
can see that there is some point where we have a maximum negative number.

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.000
And then after that we start to turn around.

29
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.400
Right.

30
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.110
That maximum negative number is your maximum cash deficit.

31
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.870
So your maximum cash need now now this rate here this maximum cash need since the negative we use the

32
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.900
min function to do that to find it.

33
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.940
And once we found it remember we're doing the startup part here's where we put it.

34
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.480
We have a max cash deficit.

35
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.690
And then just for good measure you may want to add an additional contingency on top of that a little

36
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.690
extra padding right.

37
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.480
Maybe 10 percent and then that calculates your total funding ask.

38
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.490
So then when you have this total funding ask you can calculate everything else in order to get there

39
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.190
outside of your initial startup costs is basically working capital parts for a ramp up and everything

40
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.070
like that so that's how we calculate your total funding need and calculate the working capital from

41
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.320
is when you look at the combined cash flow and find the maximum cash deficit.

42
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.990
All right we hope you've had fun with this model.

43
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.540
Now for all of the case studies we're not going to dive into each individual formula because that would

44
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.730
be super tedious to do that.

45
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.460
So just want to remind you that we're just going to go over it at a high level with the built out walk

46
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.730
through the logic and if you want to see how any particular model or equation is implemented you can

47
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.390
always go to the file and then look it up with all of the formulas are unlocked and you can see how

48
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.960
it really works.

49
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.400
But because you understand what it's trying to do then you can look at how it's done to actually make

50
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.840
it work.
