00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.280
Hey All right let's take a look again at the New Works business case we looked at that earlier.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.330
But this time we're going to build it out a little bit more.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.950
Right.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.770
So let's get started now.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.370
We didn't talk about startup costs and build out and things like that before.

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.740
So for you works we're going to think about the start costs first right now for start up costs.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.580
We want to always track the square footage if you're ever working with something where you have something

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.750
that you need to buy and you need to spend money on building it out.

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.400
OK.

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.390
So we may have something like this where we are looking at the 50000 square foot as before.

11
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.280
But it's going to cost us something to buy it.

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.460
So this purchase cost is just that but we're also going to have to spend quite a bit to build it out

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.670
and we're going to show you how that's calculated and we're going to be spending some money on furnishing

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.310
it and any equipment to it and getting it ready and here are the other related expenses during startup.

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.580
So there's can be personally involved you're going to need some architecture in engineering where there's

16
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.510
some initial marketing budget.

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.210
When you're launching it you may pay someone to build out a good web site and other things setting aside

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.510
some miscellaneous and professional services maybe some funds for early hires and training.

19
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.750
And another space for just for some other things.

20
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.360
Okay.

21
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.690
Then for each of these expenses we're going to decide when they're happening during the ramp up period.

22
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.790
So is it happening during purpling.

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.350
Is that happening during the construction.

24
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.390
Is it happening during the launch period or is that happening kind of throughout this whole early part

25
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.430
of the pre before the business actually officially opens.

26
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.660
Right.

27
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
So this is going to come in a lot more in the next couple of years.

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.090
Now this is an easier way to do the startup things but you do need to calculate the rest.

29
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.470
And also just because it's a start up costs that's mean that that's what you ask for.

30
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.700
Right.

31
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.760
You're going to have some work and capital needs just to ramp up the business.

32
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.730
When you first launch and again we're going to look at how that's calculated later.

33
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.140
So let's first start with how do we get to those right.

34
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.080
So we've got to build out in furnishing.

35
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.210
So we have 50000 square foot right.

36
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.720
And then we have the certain amount of space that's different for you works really to have some common

37
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.120
space shared as private desk just like what we did before and we're going to split them up and then

38
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.660
we're going to calculate how many units that we need for each of them for the common space.

39
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.220
We only have one but you know shared desks only takes up 25 square footage.

40
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.060
So then the total square footage divided by that we have 300 units of this range.

41
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.280
There's only some certain costs of building the space out.

42
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.660
It's going to look pretty nice so it's a little bit more expensive and the office is even more costly

43
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.340
than just the open desk and the common spaces now that calculates the total build up costs.

44
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.190
So that's kind of how we arrive at that in terms of furnishing.

45
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.070
So what we did here was have the list of items you can build those as long as you want.

46
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.590
We have the costs for each one of those items and then we just put a matrix here for the different spaces

47
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.520
and then just put how many of those things we want to have in that space.

48
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.850
So in the Commons space and put 20 big tables and 20 small tables and so forth for all these other things

49
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.770
you can have 20 plants that cost 100 bucks each whereas a shared desk and private.

50
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.070
We're not going to have any plans.

51
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.510
But for the offices to be plants that we're going to give to the tenants.

52
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.900
OK.

53
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.390
So from this matrix then we can calculate the total furnishing costs and the cost times and number of

54
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.240
them that we need times the number of units that there are.

55
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.360
So for the private or small office we have a lot of units.

56
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.660
Lot of small office space so we're going to be able to sell a lot more it's going to cost a lot more

57
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.470
to furnish that.

58
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.070
OK.

59
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.760
So that's how the total furnishing costs is determined.

60
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.370
Now again for those of you who are just looking at this as your first case study for all the case studies

61
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.980
we're not going to go into the specific formulas so much because you've kind of had a lot of practice

62
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.850
with that and also we want to focus the case study on explaining the logic and how it's structured.

63
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.300
So then if you want to see how it's done because you understand what it's trying to do you can look

64
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.220
at the formula and understand how to execute on that in order to go through all the formulas.

65
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.350
Each case study would take like 10 hours to actually go through each formula.

66
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.770
All right so that's the startup in the build out for this.

67
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.580
And once we have this what we can start looking at is looking at the revenue and the overhead the revenue

68
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.230
should be pretty easy right because we've done it before.

69
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.050
So let's see what that looks like in the next lecture.
