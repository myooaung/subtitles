00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:03,985
In this module, we've learned a lot about Spring Data REST,

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:08,005
and the topics I'm going to teach you more about during the course.

3
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:12,597
One neat feature that should stand out to you is that Spring Data REST exposes

4
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:17,695
data already accessible through Spring Data repositories as a RESTful

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:22,409
microservice without a lot of extra work on your part.

6
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:24,939
First, we looked at Spring Data REST,

7
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:28,487
and we talked about hypermedia driven RESTful APIs.

8
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,548
Next, we looked at the learning path.

9
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,082
Now remember, at a minimum,

10
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:37,089
you need to have a thorough understanding of Spring

11
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:41,386
Data to be successful in this course, which includes JPA.

12
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:45,396
Then, we looked at prerequisites and dependent technologies,

13
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:48,744
remember that you can run Maven from the command line

14
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:54,937
or within your IDE; and lastly, we looked at our fun case study TrackZilla,

15
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:58,461
our cool bug tracking application that you will be

16
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:04,000
working with during this course. Next, I will teach you more about the microservices architecture.
