00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.381
So we've built microservices so that the users of TrackZilla

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:07.510
can get their data out of this system.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.484
We've exposed information about applications, tickets, and people.

4
00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:14.609
So what's the best way to communicate to users of TrackZilla

5
00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.675
about the microservices and how to use them?

6
00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:20.869
We will use Swagger.

7
00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.834
I will teach you how to describe and document your

8
00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:27.341
microservices REST APIs using Swagger so that users of your

9
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:30.112
REST APIs know how to interact with them.

10
00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:33.275
I will also teach you how to access the generated

11
00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:35.290
documentation via a web browser.

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.034
We will add the Swagger dependency to the TrackZilla maven pom file,

13
00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:48.000
we will configure Swagger and the necessary Swagger annotations to describe our microservices REST APIs.
