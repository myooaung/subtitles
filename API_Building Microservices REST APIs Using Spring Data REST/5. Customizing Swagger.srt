1
00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:08,465
It's not always desirable to expose the documentation for your entire API.

2
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:11,523
You can restrict Swagger's response by passing parameters to

3
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:15,124
the APIs and pass method of the docket class.

4
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:18,139
Swagger also provides default values in its response,

5
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:21,594
which you can customize, such as API documentation,

6
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:25,995
CreatedBy contact email, etc.

7
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:29,882
To change these values, you will use the API info method.

8
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:32,871
The API info class contains custom information

9
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:35,860
about the API that you can modify.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,446
Swagger allows globally overriding response messages of HTTP methods

11
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:44,261
through docket's globalResponseMessage method.

12
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:48,950
First, you must instruct Swagger not to use the default response messages.

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,569
Suppose you wanted to override the 500 response message for all GET requests.

14
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:02,258
To achieve this, some code must be added to docket initialization block.

15
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:07,562
Additional code from this example is excluded for clarity.

16
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:11,593
So in our demo, we are going to look at the SwaggerUI,

17
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:16,585
open it, and see operations exposed by the ApplicationCatalog management service.

18
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:24,000
We will also use SwaggerUI to test our microservices, specifically the ApplicationCatalog operations.
