00:00:02,346 --> 00:00:07,085
TestRestTemplate is a convenient alternative to Spring's RestTemplate,

2
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:11,207
which is used to make HTTP REST calls.

3
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,298
TestRestTemplate is useful for integration tests.

4
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:17,324
With TestRestTemplate you can use a vanilla template or one

5
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,319
that sends basic HTTP authentication.

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,709
In either case,

7
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:25,494
the template behaves in a test friendly way by not

8
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:28,457
throwing exceptions on server side errors.

9
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:31,625
If you are using the SpringBootTest annotation,

10
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:39,000
a TestRestTemplate is automatically available and can be auto wired into your test.
