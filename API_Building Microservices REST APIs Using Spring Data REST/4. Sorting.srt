00:00:01,456 --> 00:00:05,161
Spring Data REST recognizes sorting parameters that are

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,437
supported by the PagingAndSortingRepository.

3
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:10,251
TO have your results sorted on a particular property,

4
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:13,527
add a sort URL parameter with the name of the property

5
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,552
you want to sort the results on.

6
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:21,041
You can control a direction of the sort by either

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,236
appending ascending or descending.

8
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:27,184
This first example sorts by description descending.

9
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:34,632
The second example sorts by description ascending.

10
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:37,116
To sort the results by more than one property,

11
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:40,110
keep adding as many sort property parameters as you need.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,149
They will be added to the pageable in the order they appear in the query string.

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:54,000
In this example, we are first sorting by description descending, and then by title ascending.
