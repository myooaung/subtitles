00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:09.128
All query methods are off of the search resource.

2
00:00:09.128 --> 00:00:11.654
For every query method declared in the repository,

3
00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:14.912
we expose a query method resource or endpoint that

4
00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:18.351
executes the query exposed through an individual query

5
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.962
method on the repository interface.

6
00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:24.875
Don't forget that the top level search resource returns links for

7
00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.953
all query methods exposed by our repository,

8
00:00:27.953 --> 00:00:31.582
and we'll look at this during the demo.

9
00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:34.649
So invoking the default search resource shows how

10
00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.110
each custom finder method is mapped.

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.768
So findByDescriptionIgnoreCaseContaining is mapped to this endpoint,

12
00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:48.922
findByApplicationId is mapped to this endpoint,

13
00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:53.998
findByTitleIgnoreCaseContaining is mapped to this endpoint.

14
00:00:53.998 --> 00:01:04.000
The values in curly braces represent parameters that will be passed in. As the search resource is a read-only resource, it supports GET only.
