1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:02,881
In our RepositoryConfiguration.

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:03,757
java file,

3
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:08,078
we've set up Spring to create proxy instances for the

4
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:10,211
query methods on the interface.

5
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,050
So now let's look at the query methods.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,482
So let's open TicketRepository.

7
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:17,943
java, so here in the ticketRepository,

8
00:00:17,943 --> 00:00:23,604
I've added three custom finder methods; findByDescriptionIgnoreCaseContaining,

9
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:26,851
findByApplicationId, findByTitleIgnoreCaseContaining,

10
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:30,994
and notice they each take parameters.

11
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:35,672
The application is already running, so let's test our endpoints through Postman.

12
00:00:35,672 --> 00:00:38,287
So let's invoke our top level search,

13
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:42,425
and remember this shows all of the endpoints available,

14
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:48,591
and so here we should see three endpoints that map to

15
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:51,544
our three custom finder methods, and we do.

16
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:56,023
So let's invoke a few of the custom finder methods.

17
00:00:56,023 --> 00:01:00,327
So let's click on this, and let's look at the endpoint.

18
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:05,408
So notice we are using the search URL and we are

19
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:06,591
invoking descriptionIgnoreCaseContaining,

20
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:12,322
and we're passing in the description that we're looking for,

21
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,376
and it's urgent.

22
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:18,608
So we should only see tickets with a description containing the keyword urgent.

23
00:01:18,608 --> 00:01:31,935
So let's click send, and notice all of our descriptions contain the word urgent.

24
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:37,640
So let's do a quick search using titleIgnoreCaseContaining.

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,500
So notice we're looking for the title that contains App12,

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,045
that's what we're passing for the title parameter,

27
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:54,000
and let's click send, and notice we have response with the title containing App12.
