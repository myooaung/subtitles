00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.130
This is a look of what we are going to build in this upcoming set of videos.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.440
We're going to build a running track application where the user can log each day,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.510
how many miles they've ran.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.980
For example, we could add a value for today such as 1.9,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.160
and this is then added to the end of this array.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.335
Each day we can add a value,

00:00:22.335 --> 00:00:25.980
and we'll record the values for the last seven days.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.850
Each time I add value, we will replace any of these placeholders,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.860
let's add the new one inside of here,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.825
and these all pushed off the edge here,

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.345
so we got the latest seven days.

00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:40.130
Scrolling down, we have an area where we can check out all of our stats.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.510
So just the total,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.430
which will run in this particular week,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.145
the average distance, and also the highest recorded value for this particular week.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:50.960
Right at the very bottom,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.765
we can also add a target inside the code

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:57.530
where we can say how many miles we want to run for that particular week.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.785
This is then updated each time I add a new value,

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:04.280
and then we see this nice progress circle down at the bottom.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.215
Let's add the new value,

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:11.720
and this is then added to our total and also updating the progress circle.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.189
We're going to start in this video by creating the user interface with HTML,

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.565
and to do this we can also use this image up at the top,

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:21.250
which is in SVG.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.970
You can of course find your own,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.755
but if you want to use the same one,

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:26.300
which I'm using in the course,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.950
head over to this link on GitHub, which is chrisdixon161/fun-javascript-projects.com.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.630
In this repository, you'll find all of the finished code for each one of these projects.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.685
If you head into the Running Tracker,

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:47.380
you'll also see a runner.svg.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.580
To use this inside of our project,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.935
we need to click on the code icon,

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.985
and this is the code which we need just here.

00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:59.795
We're going to now begin by creating our project and we'll come back to this very soon.

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:02.285
Let's go over to the desktop.

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.595
I'm going to create a new folder.

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:08.070
I am going to name this the running-tracker.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.320
Open up Visual Studio code and then we can drag over our projects.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.380
The first thing we need is to create an index.html page,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.900
this is going to be for our user interface.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.450
Let's create a new file inside of our folder,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.825
this is the index.html.

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:38.810
If you're using visual studio code,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.804
you can make use of the shortcut,

00:02:40.804 --> 00:02:44.335
which is html:5, and hit Enter.

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:49.800
This will then give us our starting points for our HTML page.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.065
I can also open this up in the browser by clicking on the tab,

00:02:57.065 --> 00:03:00.965
copy the path, and then paste this inside of the browser.

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:04.805
As always, you can double-click on the index.html file,

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:08.320
which is also contained inside of our project folder.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.105
Working from the very top we're going to include this SVG right at the very start.

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:16.670
To do this I'm going to create a div section,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.420
which is going to have the class of logo.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.829
Inside of this section we can now make use of our SVG.

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.500
I'll copy the code from GitHub, paste this in.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.205
Moving down; the next thing we need for our project is the input section.

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:37.045
We're going to create this with a label and then a number input,

00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:39.940
and then a button to submit this form.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.595
Just below our logo section,

00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:46.520
or the wrapper div, create our form.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.650
We also don't need the action,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.605
we're going to begin with a label.

00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:56.850
This label is going to be for a input with the Id of entry,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.070
and then the text is going to be number of miles today.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.049
You can also change this to be kilometers,

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.235
or any other value which you want to use,

00:04:07.235 --> 00:04:10.910
that's completely fine too and it won't affect this application.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.000
A break tag, put this onto a new line.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.150
Then our input, which is going to have the type of number,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.850
the id of entry which is going to match our label,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.445
and then a step attribute of 0.1,

00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:32.840
which means our values inside of the number inputs will increase by the value of 0.1.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.820
After this, a new break tag,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.415
so we can then add our submit button.

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:45.105
The button needs the type of submit which will allow this to submit our form.

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:48.340
At the moment, we don't have any JavaScript in place

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.624
to take advantage of the numbers which the user inputs,

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:55.720
but for now we can add these dashes as placeholder values.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.945
We're going to do this by creating a wrapper for the section,

00:04:58.945 --> 00:05:00.730
creating an unordered list,

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.600
and each one of these values is going to be a list item.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:12.400
Below our form, a horizontal rule just to divide the section.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.940
The section elements on the class,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.580
so we can use this inside of the CSS is going to be the entriesWrapper.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.330
The title of the last seven days.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.440
As we just mentioned, and unordered lists to store all of these values,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.950
which can also have an id,

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.370
so we can target this inside of JavaScript.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.490
For now our placeholder value is simply going to be a dash.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.190
Since we work in with the previous seven days,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.240
I'm going to duplicate this to grade seven list items,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.620
and let's check this out.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.835
Next we have a data section which is going to be all of the stats for our application.

00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:05.825
We're going to create a section and three separate divs,

00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:10.640
and each one of these divs is going to have a title and also a value.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.990
We can also write this in a new section in our HTML.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.595
A section can have a class of data,

00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:23.660
and then our first div for our total section.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.115
But each one of these titles on the left I'm going to to wrap this in a p elements,

00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:30.665
and then a span over on the right.

00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:35.760
The first p is for the text of total and then a colon.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.570
The first span, you can even live is empty,

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.775
or put in a placeholder value,

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:43.170
this will also need an id,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.089
so we're going to update this in JavaScript.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.175
After this div, we can then concentrate on our average distance section.

00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:55.865
New div, the p elements,

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:59.310
and the text for this one is average distance.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.710
The span for this one is also going to have a unique id,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.660
which is going to be the average.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.660
Again, you can also add a placeholder number,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.775
but this is completely optional.

00:07:13.775 --> 00:07:17.970
The third section is for the weekly high-value.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.930
Our p elements, we headed this weeks high.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.695
Our span with the id,

00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:30.970
which is going to be high,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.200
and then a default value.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.700
Let's take a look at this.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.250
Most of the user interface is now in place,

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.695
but we just need to take a look at the bottom and then add our progress circle.

00:07:44.695 --> 00:07:50.480
All of this progress circle is going to be dependent on the JavaScript and also the CSS,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.535
which we'll add in future videos,

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:56.285
but for now we can create a label and also a div section,

00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:59.370
so we can use this later on in the course.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.375
The final section down at the very bottom,

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:07.120
you can add a class of progress.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.540
Then our level three heading up at the top which is weekly target.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.255
This weekly target section is going to have also two separate values.

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:25.930
We'll have the total number of miles for this particular week,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.570
and then also a slash followed by the target.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.965
To do this, I'm going to add two separate span elements.

00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:39.290
The first one, this is going to have an id of progress total,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.280
a placeholder value of zero after the span,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.170
add a forward slash.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.510
Then a second span element,

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.880
let's add a default value of 25,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.130
and also an id which is going to be equal to target.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.930
After both of these spans,

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:07.190
we also need to add the text of miles right at the very end after our last span.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:13.465
Let's add this onto their own line so it's more readable, there we go.

00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:18.475
Also make sure that all of this is contained inside of the level three heading,

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.515
save, and reload the browser.

00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:24.520
We have a heading, and the very last thing to do below

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.430
the level three heading is to add a new div,

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.075
which is going to be for our progress circle.

00:09:30.075 --> 00:09:34.940
We can add this just with a class of progress circle wrapper.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.385
As we mentioned earlier, we don't need to do anything else with this section,

00:09:42.385 --> 00:09:44.640
this is simply going to be a placeholder div,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.895
we'll deal with this later on using CSS and also JavaScript.

00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:50.910
For now we'll call this video done,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.990
our user interface is now in place,

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.780
and in the next video we'll make it look a lot nicer using CSS.
