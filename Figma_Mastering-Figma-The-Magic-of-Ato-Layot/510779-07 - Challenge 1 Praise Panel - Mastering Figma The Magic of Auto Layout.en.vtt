00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.375
All right, We're going to go all freestyle from here on out.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.570
You know all the theory and little details about all out.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.375
And there is nothing new left to tell you.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.970
But I know that it's one thing to know something

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.670
and another to use it in a practical case.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.105
So from here on out in the course, I will show you,

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:28.215
demonstrate to you some components that I'm using in real-world projects.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:33.705
And I'll challenge you to rebuild those on your own using Figma auto layout at all.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:35.760
I'll also be building them along with you.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.435
So you'd have one reference and watch along, you can do that.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.560
And here's what we were really in this video.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.845
In this video we're building what I have just given the name of praise panel.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.645
Okay, So in my new project,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:48.785
which was a website,

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.365
I have good things that people have said about my word,

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:52.865
list head like this.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:54.890
There's a thing that someone said.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.680
All right, There's the praise then who said it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.950
and the name of the article or the piece of work they set it for.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.680
Now we are going to make a version of this component in this video.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.490
So make sure you're inside the magic of bodily outs

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.185
totter file and in the praise panel paint challenge when praise panel,

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:14.825
now inside this page you'll find three sections.

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:18.335
K, The first is the anatomy of the entire component.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:20.285
A, look so beautiful.

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.525
I mean, it has textiles listed,

00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:25.520
the padding values listed,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.320
and the color is listed, et cetera.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.690
So that when you're building this component on your own,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.810
you can only focus on the functionality and not worry about,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.610
okay, what padding value should I give here,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.170
and what color should I choose here,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.495
and what typeface should I use?

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:40.715
None of that. Everything is listed right over here,

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:42.905
and in the end there is a triangle that I have

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.295
put that is the only extra part that you're going to need.

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:50.000
The rest of it is just going to be frames and text. So yeah, there it is.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.950
There you have everything and in the middle you have

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.680
the finished component which you can play around with.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.770
For example, I can increase text,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.085
write more text here and write more text over here and see how it resizes.

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:07.745
And then I can stretch it and find out, oh yeah, great.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:09.215
So you can do that, play around,

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:11.630
research a little, See how it functions,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.815
and then go ahead and somewhere again in this same page,

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:18.410
somewhere here, start working on the component.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.855
So I'm going to pause now and you can start working.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:22.460
And if you're not in the mood,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.275
if you're not in the mood to do that,

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:27.035
you can just sit back, relax and watch me do it.

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:29.420
Well, let's go to the way that I'm seeing

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.945
this component is that it broadly has two parts.

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:36.980
The top part is if I will just drag and hide it, the bottom part like this.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.970
So this is the top part and then it has the bottom part, the triangle.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.585
And this little written for in the name of the article part.

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:47.645
So the bottom part overall is a little more complex than top part.

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:50.180
So let's start with the top part, which is simple.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.330
That common mistake or not really a mistake,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.440
but a common thing to do before frames and reframes was 0.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.340
You see a rectangle.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.890
All right, let's go ahead and press the press R and get

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.530
the rectangle tool and start drawing a container known.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.360
And that's not what you're gonna do.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.170
Like a, I have previously explained in the beginning videos

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.920
that we just need the content and then we can add a frame around it.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.870
And a frame can have properties like

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.215
Bagram color and shadows and rounded corners and whatnot.

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.775
Let's start with the content here.

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:22.880
So let's say this carbon right here is right, your appraiser.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.710
So let's press T on the keyboard and get the textual click on a canvas and start writing.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.860
So write your grades here and let's look,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.195
have this tile to this.

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:36.170
This is white and color in this tile of the text is body bolt.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.010
So let's do that.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.240
So I'm going to select the text,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.640
choose the textile to me body bold and change the color to right.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.590
Okay, one done.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.090
Number 2 is the author,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.040
so I'm just going to go ahead and press Option.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.690
Drag a copy of this text here,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.230
double-click on it and type AUT.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.700
Got a UTI is your author and it has a textile of body normals.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.105
So I'm going to select this and change this tile to body normal.

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:04.340
Okay, there's also a hyphen in front of the author,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.705
so let's go ahead and do that.

00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:08.330
Oops, not that, just this. Okay, great.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.530
So now that we have this,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.300
we can put them together in a frame.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.785
So how do you put something in a frame?

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:13.910
Again, you select them,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.760
press Shift a and D are inside a frame now,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.440
which is frame five.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.450
Figma has automatically given that main.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.105
Let's double-click on it and rename it to TOP,

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:24.650
top and press Enter.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.600
Okay, So far, so good.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.255
Now let's look at the padding that is,

00:04:29.255 --> 00:04:33.410
that it has, it has a padding of 32 units on all this heights.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.880
So I'm going to select the frame,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.555
go right here in gift-giving with 32 and all of the sides.

00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:41.840
The next thing that I'm going to do is give it a background color,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.030
which is blue 0 to like mentioned here.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.350
So let's give it a background color of blue, 0, great.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.690
And what else is remaining?

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.360
Okay, though, the spacing between your praise here text and all three text is eight.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.405
So how do we make sure that it is eight little select this frame,

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:04.190
go to spacing between items and change it to eight from four.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.870
So now if I go ahead and click on any one of these press Option and hover than other.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.570
You can see that the spacing between them is eight.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.520
Okay, great, good.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.020
And now let's look at the rounded corners.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.545
So this all rounded corners are eight pixels or eight units.

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:20.585
But, but notice that in the top part,

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:25.489
only the top-left and the top-right corners have rounded radius,

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:28.520
whereas the bottom right and the bottom left did not have that.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.940
So we're going to go ahead and make sure that that is also the case

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.555
with what I am creating or when we are creating together,

00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:36.815
if you're following along.

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:38.645
So if you want to give different,

00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:41.720
if you just go ahead and press eight here and the rounded corner radius,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.195
it'll apply it to all the four corners.

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:47.870
But if you wanted to split it as if he wanted to give different corners,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.910
different radius, you can go ahead and click on

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.325
this icon right here it says independent corners.

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:57.560
And let's change the bottom right and bottom left, alright, to 0.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.410
So how do I know that this is bottom left and bottom right?

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.460
These two boxes?

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.630
Well, if you hover over them,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.930
you can see that and even in this icon right over here,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.330
it represents which corner we're dealing with.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.355
So again, so far, so good.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:12.980
We've got our top hot almost ready.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.460
They'll only thing that we need to make sure that it resizes properly.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.965
So I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go ahead and stretch it and

00:06:18.965 --> 00:06:22.430
see the width or the dimension of the texts that inside it.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.705
So again, there are still small,

00:06:23.705 --> 00:06:26.060
they didn't respond to the resizing.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.430
So let's select both of them and change

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.640
their resizing constraints from HUD contents to fill container.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.400
And now that we go ahead and resize it,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.195
you see that the width of the text also changes.

00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:41.870
So right here, we are done with that top part.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.595
Now, let's move to the bottom part.

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:46.955
So again, we have this triangle right over here,

00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:48.590
which I have just saved here for you.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.305
So I'm gonna go ahead and press Option and drag a copy out.

00:06:51.305 --> 00:06:53.630
We're going to need it in bed.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.715
So I'm going to leave it here.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:58.190
It's called flat by the way, and the layers panel.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.800
So again, I'm going to go ahead and leave it over here.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.995
And if you see in the finished component,

00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:05.090
we have the triangle, we have the flap.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.395
But there is also,

00:07:06.395 --> 00:07:09.065
there is also a little bit of spacing between these.

00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:10.850
You see this whitespace right over here.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.630
It's called, it's not called as has height

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.560
of 16 here and it stretches here and goes for a 16 year.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.970
So we're gonna go ahead and do that.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.460
But first of all, let's make this small part,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.245
this real part which contains working for and the name of the article or the course.

00:07:27.245 --> 00:07:29.900
So again, I'm going to go ahead and press T and write,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.710
read 104, and let's see the textiles for it.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.310
Okay, this is body semi bold and it has a color of white.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.110
So I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.700
So I'm going to select this bought a semi bold and a color of white.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.130
Okay, So I think I forgot an n over here,

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.515
so just going to go ahead and write n. All right,

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:50.795
then I'm gonna go ahead and drag a copy of it out

00:07:50.795 --> 00:07:53.570
and type in the name of the article is slash course.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.740
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.050
Name of the article.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:02.285
Slash courts and the textile for it is body normally.

00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:07.070
Select it and give it the textile of the normal. All right, good.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.170
And the spacing between them is 0.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.840
So again, to make sure that is the case,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.100
I'm going to select both of them.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.380
Fresh shift a, putting them in an auto I frame.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.495
Go ahead and reading the frame to,

00:08:17.495 --> 00:08:22.820
let's say bottom details about that because this is not the entire bottom part,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.635
that's just the details part.

00:08:24.635 --> 00:08:26.075
Okay, So I'm going to select it again,

00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:27.260
the bottom details frame,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.960
let's look at it's got padding of 24 on left and right and 16 on top and bottom.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.510
How do we do that? We go ahead and click here.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.160
We select any of the four boxes here and start writing the padding values.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.230
So 16 on top and bottom in 2004 on right, left.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.100
How about that?

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.430
Okay, and it has a background color of gray 0.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.460
So let's give it a background color of gray 0.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.200
And now we need to make sure that it has eight units, eight points,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.960
eight pixels, rounded corners for the bottom left

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.870
and the bottom right and 0 for the top-left and top right.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.920
So I'm going to select this,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.195
go ahead and split.

00:09:05.195 --> 00:09:07.850
I mean, not really split but glyph here,

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.210
I imagine it as flipping radii of different corners.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.815
So whenever you want to call it,

00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:15.575
so top right is 0 good,

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:17.630
top-left is 0 good.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.985
And bottom-right should be eight,

00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:21.800
and bottom-left should be eight again.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.790
So I'm going to click it.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.870
And that looks very good the way that it's supposed to it.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.200
And then again, Let's go ahead and make sure that it is

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.160
the text that's inside the frame has the resizing constraints,

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.600
so filled containers so that it fills everything as everything is resized.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.860
So yeah, pretty good.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.240
They resize properly.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.730
Now we're done with the parts that we're going to need for the bottom part, alright,

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:53.225
so the next thing that we want to make sure is that there is this spacing around this,

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:54.845
around this little bottom parts.

00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:55.955
How do we do that?

00:09:55.955 --> 00:10:00.425
We do that by taking this frame and putting it inside another frame.

00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:03.260
Now if you've been watching the whole course so far,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.515
you know that we can always nest frames inside of frames.

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:08.240
So that is what we're going to do here.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.015
We're going to select this frame and again press Shift

00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:13.940
a to nest this inside another auto-layout frame.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.230
So I'm going to press Shift a.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.140
And now this is another insight and other auto ion frame,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.490
and I'm going to call this frame grabber and w are a PPR.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:27.259
And again in the layer panel to make sure there is rapper and there's bottom details.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:31.760
Now to make sure that there is only 16 pixels of padding on the

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.140
left and top where you're gonna go ahead and select the wrapper frame.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.700
We're gonna go ahead and click here.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.635
Gift top, a padding is 16,

00:10:39.635 --> 00:10:43.295
left at bending a 16 bottom and right to a panning 0.

00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:46.610
Now if you go ahead and look closely at this, you see there's a 16.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.045
Pixels are 16 points padding on the left.

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:50.780
Top.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.845
And the next thing that we're going to do is we're gonna take this triangle or a flat.

00:10:54.845 --> 00:10:57.920
I'm going to place it next to the wrapper frame,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.115
select both of them and put them inside another auto-layout frame.

00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:01.985
How do we do that?

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:03.110
Select both of them again,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.805
press Shift a, my now,

00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:09.980
you think the shortcut Shift day is just drilled deep into your heads,

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.420
which is good, which is nice.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.650
So again, we have I think they put them properly.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.730
I think I did a little bit of messing up here,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.790
so I'm going to press Command Z a couple of times and then again go

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.970
and we'll go ahead and put them in a frame again.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.700
So select the flaps like the wrapper redshift day.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.120
And now they're insight of different frame.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.670
And I'm going to go ahead and name this frame B O T,

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.720
T O M, bottom.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.305
All right.

00:11:36.305 --> 00:11:38.825
And what this frame needs as zero-padding,

00:11:38.825 --> 00:11:42.860
grade and 0 spacing between items because

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.880
we just want this and the rapper frame to be sticking together.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.790
And because of the wrapper frame is just empty space.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.275
There'll be a 16 pixels of padding or 16 pixels of space between them.

00:11:54.275 --> 00:11:56.525
So I'm going to select bottom and change.

00:11:56.525 --> 00:11:59.090
You see what happens when I do this, when I drag it around.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.340
So I'm going to change it to 0.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.345
So there you are.

00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:03.590
This is the bottom part.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.740
Now, the final thing to do is select

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.790
top and bottom and put them together in another auto-layout frame.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.035
So select both of them,

00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:14.480
press Shift a, and now they're inside a frame.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.320
The one thing that we need to make sure is that spacing between them is 0.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.550
All right, like this,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.265
we're going to make sure that the top part has

00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:26.375
a horizontal resizing constraint of Phil container so that it fills everything.

00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:28.085
And now if I resize it,

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:30.320
you see the bottom part is not resizing.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.540
So let's again go ahead and make sure that it

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.800
has horizontal resizing constraints of Phil container.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.120
So let's do that.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.785
Okay, it's filled container.

00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:41.630
And this thing right over here,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.550
it should be a fixed width and height,

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.695
and this should be a fill container.

00:12:45.695 --> 00:12:50.450
And then again, I'm going to click again a couple of times often what happens is that

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:55.820
the nested frames for the nested elements have a fixed width, horizontal constraints.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.830
So even if you have set as something like

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.350
folk container on the wrapper, it doesn't respond.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.370
So you have to double-click,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.220
go inside and make sure that whatever you are selected,

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.630
whatever you have selected has resizing constraints to fill container.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.425
And now if I go and resize and you see everything just works nicely.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:15.665
And if I go ahead and put a bunch of text here like this,

00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:19.445
and everything just moves like it's supposed to.

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:21.620
All right, this is great, this is great.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.140
We just finished creating the component together.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.900
And I think everything that we learned so far in

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.125
the course actually just convoys together into this.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:34.595
We saw how we can create any number of frames that we want on the go.

00:13:34.595 --> 00:13:37.100
And that's great in the end, I hope you're,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.850
you've been following along to this or you've been just trying

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.630
to create this on your own without watching me do it either way.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.980
And the end of this video,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.330
I hope you have a functioning nice auto-layout component.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.650
In the next one,

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.210
we'll practice a little more.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:58.865
It'll be slightly, slightly more complex than what we did here.

00:13:58.865 --> 00:14:00.590
A little bit more complex and,

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.985
you know, take a break.

00:14:01.985 --> 00:14:06.210
Now let's move on to challenge number 2, game card.
