X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.045
Okay, So buttons was pretty straightforward.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:11.760
We only use one or two features of auto-layout,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.870
like how to create an auto layout frame or how to add auto-layout to a frame.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.420
And how does set padding inside the frame will

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.885
unwrap a few more auto-layout features in this video.

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.960
And let's quickly have a look at what we'll be doing together in this video.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.810
So what you need to do is go into mastering Figma them

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.870
magic of Ottaway on finished and click on dropdowns,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.775
dropdowns pages right below buttons.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:34.470
And often, you know, if you're not familiar,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.205
very familiar the Figma user interface,

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:40.100
sometimes the pages is, is collapsed,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.590
so you have to click on this button right here,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.970
and then it shows up.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.865
And then you can click on drop-downs and look at this.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:48.200
Look how the component look at

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.350
the user-interface element that will be designing together in this video is how

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.700
this is a selector component that you know that this is the name that I gave to it.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.225
You can call it a list or you can call it a card or whatever you want.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.530
And it works beautifully.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.865
Look, I can add more of this and then I can resize it properly.

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:07.235
Look how the button always stays at the bottom.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:11.090
And if I resigned his horizontally loci, everything resizes beautifully.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.160
So this will be a little bit of a step up

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.890
from everything that we designed in the last video,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.125
which was just very normal buttons.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:22.205
So, all right, let's go back here and let's get to work.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.190
So make sure you're inside the starter file

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.730
and then make sure you're inside the drop downs page.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.045
So click on the drop downs page and it'll be totally empty

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:36.770
because we're going to fill it with a bunch of cool auto-layout UI stuff.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.030
Okay, Now in the last video,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.660
you saw me do a bunch of maneuvers to finally create an auto layout element.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.745
The button that is, and like I promised,

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:45.380
you don't have to do those maneuvers,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.715
so there is a shortcut for that.

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:47.105
Okay.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:49.460
And I'm going to show I'm going to show it to you right now.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.105
Okay, So the first thing let's do is write some texts on the canvas.

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:54.275
And how do I do that?

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:57.050
If I either click on the Text tool or just press D and then

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.870
click on a Canvas anywhere and start typing.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.190
Now I'm going to type in,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.695
let's say option, okay, Now,

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:07.985
make sure the option has one of the textiles that I have defined applying to it.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:12.140
For now, I'm going to choose labeled large for it so that it looks like this.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.885
That looks great. Okay, Now to nest this

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:17.705
and that's this text inside and ultimately on frame,

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:23.795
all we need to do is make sure the text is selected and press the shortcut Shift plus a,

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.060
OK, Shift plus a.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.930
And there you go.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.365
It is inside and auto-layout frame. How do I know that?

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.705
Look, look, look at free written over here.

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:35.060
Look at the icon layers panel and look on

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.015
the right side where the auto-layout thin strip,

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:40.970
the match will thin strip is now activated.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.750
How cool is that?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.030
Now let's give the frame that we've just created,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.710
a background color, okay,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.660
We'll pick a color from the color styles.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.565
How about grey 0, okay, great,

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:52.565
and we'll change the color of the text to white.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:53.495
And how do we do that?

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:56.405
We just click on the color styles and we choose white.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:58.025
Just like that.

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:00.935
The next thing that we want to do is they wanted to and just the padding.

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:02.405
Now if you're following along,

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:05.510
what you need to do is give it 16 pixels

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.260
padding on the top and bottom and 32 on the horizontal.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.400
So go ahead and see if you can do that while I do the same.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.900
All right, so let's give it a padding of 16 on top and bottom, just like that.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.040
And on left and right,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.335
we're gonna give it a padding of 32.

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:26.465
Next, what I'm going to do is give this frame a corner radius of eight.

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:30.470
And let's press an eight and click Enter and look at that.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.500
And the best part about all of this is very doing so much.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.960
We're giving spaces were giving colors and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.155
rounded corners and all of this as just one single unit.

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:40.160
How beautiful is that?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.105
Look at the layers panel.

00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:44.720
No clutter at all. It's just one single unit.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.650
And now let's go ahead and check if it's resizing properly.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.095
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and stretch it horizontally.

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:51.995
And yes it is.

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:56.360
And remember, unlike button where we would like the label to be aligned at the center,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.960
we want this UI element to have text always on the left.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.625
However, the frame is stretched in resized now to make sure that it is happening.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:07.910
And by the way, figma has already set it to left by default,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.175
all you need to do is click on this,

00:04:10.175 --> 00:04:12.860
click on the same square where you're adjusting the padding.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.235
And remember that it says not just padding but alignment,

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:19.625
alignment and padding, which means you can also adjust the alignment.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:22.280
So for now, the alignment is center and left.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.260
There are other options, three on top,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.280
three in the middle,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.555
and three on the bottom.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:31.970
So for example, this is top and left and I'm going to choose left and center.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.930
So that's it.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.970
And now if I resize it horizontally,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.335
you see it stays on the left,

00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:39.320
like it's been chosen in the alignment section here.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.600
And if I resize it vertically,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.125
you see that it's still remains in the center as it's been chosen.

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:46.760
And it's been just been said,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.420
it's been directed to stay in the center like this and feel

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.380
free to play around with the alignment a bit and get a better hang of it.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.250
For example, if I'm selecting this frame and I change the alignment to center,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.300
it behaves like the button that it stays in the center.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.110
Minutes resize.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.295
So again, I'm gonna go ahead and select here and put it on the left like we want to.

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:08.780
You can, you know, as I said,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.170
play around if I keep it on the top and the left and I resize,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.790
it stays at the top and the left side.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.795
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:18.695
Okay, So I'm going to go ahead and set everything through as it was,

00:05:18.695 --> 00:05:23.465
where the alignment was at the at the middle and on the left. And I'll leave it there.

00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:26.345
And let's continue developing our UI element.

00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:31.145
Now so far, we have only made this part of the entire component, this option part.

00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:36.080
We also need to build the wrapper and notice that it will lead multiple of these options,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.800
which means reusability, which means we will convert this,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.975
this right here to a components,

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:44.135
this reading this two option.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:49.250
And that will turn the text layer and we'll change the name of the text layer,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.415
I mean, and call a and LA the l label.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:55.640
And then again, I'm going to select the frame and to convert it into a component.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.675
You know what to do. Click on this icon right over here and bam, it's that component now,

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:05.900
which means I can go into assets and pull as many of Ed as i1, 1, 2, 3.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.190
And if I make the change,

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.340
make some change to my main component,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.840
like change the background color.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.235
It'll be reflected in all the copies so far, so good.

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:19.940
Now I'm going to show you a workflow that you will find

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.675
yourself using over and over again in your UI design routine.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.475
I already, like I said,

00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:29.510
you can drag out an instance from the assets panel of this component like this.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.850
And there's another way to drag out an instance.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.080
It does my holding Option and dragging a copy from the main component.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.490
And earlier, like I showed you,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.315
if it was a normal rectangle or something that is not a component,

00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:43.820
you can Option and drag to create a copy of it.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.740
But if you do the same action option,

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.300
drag on a component,

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.150
you'll drag out and instance and look at the layers panel,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.200
have the instances appear with a 45-degree rotated square.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.370
It's also called the shape,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.900
I believe is also called a rhombus.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.580
And look how the main component appears,

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.935
but four squares stacked like this.

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:01.715
Okay, great.

00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:03.830
So with these two components,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.100
these two instances of the MainComponent out, I can put them here.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.255
And the next thing that I want to do is to put them into an autoplay on frame.

00:07:11.255 --> 00:07:14.750
And this is the routine that I was talking about often what happens is we have

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.260
instances of a component and we want to arrange them together,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.855
like for example, in this case we wanted to put them in a list.

00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:24.050
All right, so I'm gonna select these two and press Shift a and look at

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.230
how automatically it's put inside an auto layout of components.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.835
So select both of them,

00:07:28.835 --> 00:07:30.695
press Shift a and look at that.

00:07:30.695 --> 00:07:33.935
It's inside a frame and look in the layers panel is inside a frame.

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:36.080
So I'm gonna go ahead and first of all,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.075
reading this frame to something like dropped down.

00:07:38.075 --> 00:07:39.425
Okay, pretty cool.

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.595
And look at this.

00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:43.040
Since these options, these instances of

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.010
this option component are inside an auto, auto layout frame.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.090
What I can do is press Command D and they'll automatically be added

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.380
and the spacing between them would be kept pretty pretty,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.590
pretty consistent because they are inside an auto layout frame.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.600
So another thing that I can do,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.055
which brings me to

00:08:01.055 --> 00:08:06.260
the spacing between part of the auto-layout strip is that you are getting out.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.769
You can just you can adjust it by dragging and this changes.

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:12.440
I think the name is very so X self-explanatory.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.880
It would just space between items,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.260
datas, and signed the component.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.390
And for this one, we want to keep it at 10.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.375
So I'm going to type 10 and press Enter and look at this,

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:21.920
the spacing between each of them,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.020
each of the options is 10.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.895
How, how, how will that, how cool is that?

00:08:25.895 --> 00:08:28.430
And the next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to select the frame and give

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.070
it a background color of gray one.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.270
So there you go.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.665
Now it has a background color.

00:08:33.665 --> 00:08:38.570
And the next thing that we want to do is give it a padding of 12 on all the four sides.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.940
So instead of, instead of going inside here

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.360
and typing 12 four times, what I can do is just,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.885
I'm too old ones here,

00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:47.030
press enter and the padding of 12,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.800
there'll be added on all tags.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.340
Look at that.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.330
That's great, isn't it?

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.200
That's pretty cool.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.430
And while we're at it,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.320
what I'm going to do next is give it a rounded corner of 12 pixels.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.105
So 12 Enter.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.215
And now look at this.

00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:03.650
We're going to how cool it looks like a proper Lists dropdown.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.295
And the best part about this is I can add components, add,

00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:11.030
sorry, add instances of option inside the list.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.825
I can remove them and the height and everything is auto adjusted.

00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:16.805
All right, pretty good.

00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:20.180
Now, just to reminder that this is an auto-layout frame and

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.405
the options are also created using auto-layout,

00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:28.295
which means you can nest auto-layout frames inside auto-layout frames,

00:09:28.295 --> 00:09:31.325
and you have no idea how powerful that is.

00:09:31.325 --> 00:09:34.505
We'll look at some really cool such examples later in the course.

00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:35.915
But for now, notice this,

00:09:35.915 --> 00:09:38.240
if I resize this frame,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.490
this drop-down frame horizontally,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.545
the options don't resize.

00:09:42.545 --> 00:09:43.400
Why is that?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.410
Now, if I select an option,

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.040
if I select one of the options from inside the auto-layout frame,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.500
you'll notice that there is this resizing stress that

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.230
appears right below that auto-layout strip.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.680
If I look into the horizontal resizing constraints,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.405
which means if it's resized horizontally,

00:09:59.405 --> 00:10:01.925
it says fixed width, which we don't want.

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:04.505
We want it to fill the container that it has insight.

00:10:04.505 --> 00:10:07.730
So I'll click here and choose Fill container just like that.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:12.470
And now you see that the frame automatically stretches and fills the container.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.530
There's another option called hug contents here,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.155
which means the option will only take up space

00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:21.095
enough to hold the content that's inside of it,

00:10:21.095 --> 00:10:23.135
which we don't want in this scenario.

00:10:23.135 --> 00:10:24.890
We want it to fill the containers.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.630
So let's go ahead and select Full container,

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.630
and we'll do the same for the rest of these options here.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.940
So select all of them and go ahead and change

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.485
their resizing constraint or the horizontal resizing constraints to fill a container.

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:38.510
And look at that and if I resize it now,

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.014
okay, now beautifully resizes.

00:10:41.014 --> 00:10:42.215
Now you can say,

00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:45.350
why can't I just said resizing constraints on the main component

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.695
here of which these are basically just instances of and be done.

00:10:48.695 --> 00:10:52.310
Well, you see some things in instances over rideable,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.500
like the background color or for an instance,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.470
for example, I can go ahead and change the background color of this instance

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.545
and it'll affect just this particular instance.

00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:04.520
Or I can go ahead and change the detects that is inside,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.300
for example, let's just call it a laptop or whatever, you know, random words.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.940
So these things are over writeable.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:17.630
And just like these to resizing constraint is also over writeable because we cannot

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.780
anticipate the context in which a particular instance might be

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.260
used in Figma gives us a choice to choose resizing,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.020
constraining for each instance individually.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.795
Now, again, if I go ahead and resize the frame,

00:11:29.795 --> 00:11:33.395
look how beautifully it resigns as like it should.

00:11:33.395 --> 00:11:36.335
But what about vertical resizing?

00:11:36.335 --> 00:11:40.460
As you know that the height of this auto-layout frame as calculated by

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.615
the elements it holds and the space between each of the elements,

00:11:44.615 --> 00:11:49.100
which we have set right over here in spacing between items.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.350
And it obeys that because look here,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.785
if you click on the last square and look at the bottom part,

00:11:54.785 --> 00:11:57.200
the bottom most part, it says pact,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.249
which means it'll calculate and pack the content tightly.

00:12:01.249 --> 00:12:04.489
And hence, if I resize this frame vertically,

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:07.595
you see that the elements still remain packed,

00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:11.330
but I can change the packing right here

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.095
from packed to space between and look at what happens.

00:12:15.095 --> 00:12:18.500
The space between items is set to auto.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.200
And if I resize this vertically down,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.844
everything just spreads as the frame is resized,

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:29.300
relook at an actual use of space between packing in a bit.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.305
But for now let's roll everything back as we work.

00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:36.095
Okay, great, We are almost done here.

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:38.285
The next thing that we want to do is to drag

00:12:38.285 --> 00:12:40.820
out and button component from the assets panel.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.870
Remember that this is the button component that are created in the previous two lessons.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.690
So I'm going to just drag it out and put it right beside it.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.985
Now, this is a large size button.

00:12:49.985 --> 00:12:52.745
We would look better beside it,

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:54.290
probably a medium sized.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.165
So yeah, they look better together.

00:12:56.165 --> 00:13:00.980
And the next thing that we want to do is put the button inside this very frame.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.150
So to do that, all I have to do is to just drag it in like that.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.065
And there you go.

00:13:06.065 --> 00:13:09.725
And I can tell that inside the frame because when I drag this frame,

00:13:09.725 --> 00:13:12.755
look at that, it also drags around.

00:13:12.755 --> 00:13:16.175
Now this is a very common scenario while using auto-layout.

00:13:16.175 --> 00:13:19.550
Often what happens is when you put something inside or, you know,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.059
make a change and suddenly notice that the frame is not resizing.

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:26.600
This is because we often do some changes which results in

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.335
the resizing constraints to change to fixed width and a fixed height.

00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:33.290
And whenever we encounter scenario like for example,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.615
right now the height isn't properly adjusting.

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.670
All we need to do is to go here,

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.935
select that and click on HUD contents and look at that.

00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:43.130
It just already is inside it and again the button.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.970
The next thing that I wanna do is have the buttons stretch this entire width.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.430
And again, how do we make sure that it does?

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.200
We again go into resizing constraints.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.510
And right now it says hug contents,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.140
which means it will be only wide enough to fit the content that's

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.025
inside of it and do make it fill the container that it's inside.

00:14:01.025 --> 00:14:02.675
What do we have to do is go,

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.030
go here and the horizontal resizing constraints

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.295
and click on Fill container and look at that.

00:14:07.295 --> 00:14:09.845
It fills up the entire thing.

00:14:09.845 --> 00:14:12.530
And we have a problem here that the button that

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.590
the text inside the button is not in the center.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.745
And I guess I may have missed that.

00:14:19.745 --> 00:14:23.480
I may have not chosen the alignment properly.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.005
So let me go ahead and see that in this,

00:14:27.005 --> 00:14:30.200
in these components that I created and of course Read,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.090
the alignment is not in the center,

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.550
so I'll wait, I'll select all three of them and

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.175
make sure that they are all centrally aligned.

00:14:37.175 --> 00:14:38.750
And if I go back to drop-downs,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.680
you see that the text is now in the center for the button.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.375
You see these fumbles of it.

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:45.710
Auto-layout often happens.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.870
Sometimes you forget that there are constraints,

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.609
sometimes you forget the alignment,

00:14:49.609 --> 00:14:51.650
but they are very easy to fix.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.815
Like you saw me do just now.

00:14:54.815 --> 00:14:55.760
Okay.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.740
Now, the only thing left to do if you've if you'll follow me to the finished file,

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.865
is to arrange everything in a way that they behave like this.

00:15:04.865 --> 00:15:09.905
You say even a vertically resize whole element.

00:15:09.905 --> 00:15:13.415
The button stays at the button whereas the list stays around it at the top.

00:15:13.415 --> 00:15:15.650
And even when I resize everything horizontally,

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.650
everything just resize as, as a chip.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.980
So you can go ahead and try doing this,

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:27.980
replicating this behavior if you are falling along or you can just do as I do, okay,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.840
So the first thing that we need to do is we need to

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.350
separate the lists and the buttons right now these options,

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.075
I mean, the options on that button,

00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:39.095
right now these options and the button are in the same frame.

00:15:39.095 --> 00:15:41.480
So the first thing that we'll do is we'll select

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.930
all the options and put them inside one frame.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.830
And how do we do with that?

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.910
We just wiped everything,

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.750
make sure that every option is selected and the button is not selected.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.120
Once everything is selected, all the options are sort of like that.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.410
Press Shift a.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.525
And what this will do is put it inside,

00:15:56.525 --> 00:15:58.985
put the options inside of their very own frame.

00:15:58.985 --> 00:16:00.275
And I'm going to select this frame,

00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:03.455
double-click on it and call it OPT I ON options.

00:16:03.455 --> 00:16:04.880
Okay, enter, great.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.185
And now the next thing that I wanna do is we want to select the options,

00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:10.610
this frame right here,

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.155
give it some padding.

00:16:12.155 --> 00:16:14.630
Okay, so let's go ahead right here.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.120
You know how to give padding to an auto layout frame.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.250
Again, I'm going to go ahead and give it a padding of 12.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.625
So click there to add 12, and that's it.

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:25.445
You see, right now it looks a little jumbled up,

00:16:25.445 --> 00:16:29.000
but we're going to set then adjust this a little bit.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.950
The next thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to select

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.900
the outermost drop-down frame and change its background color to,

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.360
let's say gray to, okay.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.300
And this options frame right here,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.230
I'm going to go ahead and set its background color to,

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.700
let's say gray one.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.525
Okay, Great.

00:16:47.525 --> 00:16:48.995
And while I'm at it,

00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:51.845
I'm gonna go ahead and give it a rounded corner of 12.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:52.730
Okay, great.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:58.370
The only thing to fix right now is the resizing of the outermost frame.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.630
And like we just saw,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.505
it often happens, dad,

00:17:01.505 --> 00:17:03.500
the constraint is said to fixed.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.715
And all we need to do to fix that is click on it and click on HUD condense.

00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:11.810
And right now it says very clearly visible that we have an outermost frame.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.540
We have a frame incited that contains options,

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.000
and we have a button right over here.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.690
Now, let's go ahead and every time you do this, every time you create a frame,

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.980
your nested frame, It's good to resize and check if everything is working properly.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.780
Now this button to resizing properly,

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.295
but this frame is not.

00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:29.795
Again, how do I fix that?

00:17:29.795 --> 00:17:34.040
Like this frame go right over here and so I feel container,

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.810
okay, great, Now this fill set,

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.850
but the options are not.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.280
So I'm gonna go ahead and select all of them

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.445
again and go ahead and change this to fill container.

00:17:43.445 --> 00:17:45.065
And now if I resize this,

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:48.020
you see everything how beautifully race scientists

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.170
not remember that it is very easy to get frustrated.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:56.225
Then the auto-layout frames that nested frames don't work as you anticipated them too.

00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:59.000
But remember that what do you have to do is make

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.420
sure that the resizing constraints are set properly.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.915
All right, now for vertical resizing,

00:18:05.915 --> 00:18:07.415
I'm going to select dropdown.

00:18:07.415 --> 00:18:10.595
And if I look here, it says packed.

00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:12.650
And like I said,

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.150
and like I explained earlier,

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.355
what Pack means you should be able to

00:18:16.355 --> 00:18:19.625
anticipate what will happen if I resize it vertically.

00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:21.725
Of course, everything just remains packed.

00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:26.195
Now if I go ahead and change this to space between,

00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:27.965
look at what happens now.

00:18:27.965 --> 00:18:34.685
Great, This stays right here and a space between makes sure that everything just spreads,

00:18:34.685 --> 00:18:37.700
and then the whole element is resize vertically.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.950
The space between is just automatically adjusted, like it says here.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:43.715
Auto.

00:18:43.715 --> 00:18:46.010
Okay, this is great. This is great.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.720
We learned a lot in this video,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.755
even though for the small amount of options that auto-layout has,

00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:53.360
There's a lot of complexity in it,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.844
and there's a lot of beautiful,

00:18:54.844 --> 00:18:57.320
powerful components that you can create out of it,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.580
like we saw just now.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.305
And now, if you're using this as a component or you know,

00:19:03.305 --> 00:19:07.040
you want to reuse it anywhere in your user interface design.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.555
What I suggest you do is go ahead and turn it into a component so that,

00:19:11.555 --> 00:19:14.255
so that you can drag multiple of these out,

00:19:14.255 --> 00:19:18.215
over, multiple of these out and use anywhere you want.

00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:19.700
And with that, with that,

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.350
we're done with this video.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.105
And in the next one,

00:19:23.105 --> 00:19:24.725
we're gonna do something really cool.

00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:29.490
So I hope you'll stick around and hope you learn something, and I'll see you soon.
