00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.285
All right.

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:10.320
It's time to take you through the files that we will be using in this class and

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.760
also show you what you'll be submitting to Skillshare At the end of this class.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.590
So let's do it.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.990
Inside the resources that you download,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.080
you will find two Figma files, finished and starter.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.680
I want you to load both of these files into your Figma.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.775
If you have the Figma desktop app installed right here like I have,

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:33.630
and you can download the Figma desktop app right from here.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.720
You can search in Google Figma Mac app or Figma Windows app.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.400
You know, it's all the same in that you can

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.335
download the app for MacOS or Windows from right here.

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:43.130
If you're using the Figma desktop app,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.360
you can just directly click,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.710
double-click on either of these files to open in the Figma app,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.360
or you can right-click and go to Open With entries Figma and open both of these files.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.685
But if you're using Figma in the browser,

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:59.090
you can log in into your account and creating a Figma account,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.085
if you're not aware, is very easy.

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:04.310
All you gotta do is go to figma.com and click on Sign up.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.025
And the best way is to sign up with Google.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.230
And after just two or three clicks,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.700
you'll end up with something like this and entire Figma user interface.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.280
So when you're inside the browser interface,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960
if you are in the browser interface,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.765
you can just drag both of these files into the browser and it'll import both of these,

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.105
you know, into your Figma.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.415
So we'll wait for them to finish importing,

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:31.835
grade both the files have finished importing and inside your Figma,

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:34.550
you will see the finished file and the starter file.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.880
You'll be working in the starter file throughout this course.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.450
And the finished file is just for your reference or in case,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.290
let's say we make something together in a video and later in a different video,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.150
but we'll need what we created earlier.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.755
But for any reason,

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:49.865
for any reason at all,

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:51.710
you didn't create it along with me.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.050
So you can pick it up from the finished file,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.460
paste in the starter it at an appropriate place and continue with the class.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.290
Okay, Now let's look inside the starter file to open it and just double-click on it.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.900
The first thing that I want to talk about in

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.455
this file is this page calls tiles and colors.

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:10.655
And for any reason,

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.910
if you're not seeing this and make sure that you expand

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.350
the pages View by clicking right over here so that you can see all the pages.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.090
So the page that I want to talk about,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.440
the first thing that I want to talk about,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.764
talk about as tiles and colors.

00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:28.520
Now so that we can focus exclusively on auto-layout and the UI components that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.140
we make with it and not worry about the colors and what font sizes to use.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.905
I've already defined all of them for you in this page,

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:38.960
the styles and colors page.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.889
And also you can look on the right panel in Figma when nothing is selected,

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.170
all the styles that I have defined for you.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.860
And if finding global styles and colors and Figma is pretty simple,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.050
I believe you already know how to do that,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.060
but for those of you who don't,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.585
here's a quick one-minute one down of how to do that.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:58.640
Now let's say just like these colors,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.590
if I click on it and sort of seeing a hex code,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.035
I see a custom name that I've given to this color,

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:04.430
let's say like these colors,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.675
I want to create a new global colors tunnel that can be used anywhere in this file.

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:12.050
To do that, I can just press R on my keyboard or

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.605
click on the rectangle tool and draw a rectangle of any size.

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.440
And then I'll give this rectangle a random color, right?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.600
So let's just go with this color, okay?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.890
Now if I select this rectangle,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.650
you can see that it shows a hex code of this color,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.930
which is 362, 565.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.095
Now if I want to convert this color to a global style,

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:34.400
all I can do is click on this icon right over here that says tile,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.535
and then click on this plus icon which says Create style.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:38.810
And once they click on that,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.600
it'll ask me to give it a name and I'll just call it temp

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.540
colors since I am using it to demonstrate to you,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.565
to demonstrate the process to you.

00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:48.830
And then I'll click on Create style.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.970
And once I've done that,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.350
you can see that Tim color becomes

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.460
visible and global styles panel on the right when nothing is selected.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.830
And if I want to use this style again,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.000
is this color again,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.340
all I can do is click here and then pick temp color

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.175
ranked from here and it can be used and reused.

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:08.930
And if I later this site to change the value of temp color by doing,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.655
by doing this, by clicking on it,

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:13.715
then clicking on Settings and then adjusting the color again.

00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:17.510
It will be affected Throughout the file,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.220
wherever this color is used.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.160
Now that's the process to create a global course tile.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.320
And since this was temporary and no longer need it,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.435
I'll pick it from the styles, you know,

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:28.610
make sure nothing is selected and it's visible.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.245
You can click on it, right-click on it,

00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:32.330
and then click on Delete style to get rid of it.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.520
And similarly, and similarly,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.380
like we created the color style.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.100
If you want to create a textile like these that I've created, all you,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.365
all you've gotta do is press T on your keyboard,

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.125
or you can select the Text tool and type something random.

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:48.920
Or you know, you can type in something not random, I don't care.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.520
And then you can go ahead and give it random font-style.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.170
And right now you can see as tau is if line,

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.535
but I don't want that.

00:04:55.535 --> 00:04:58.985
I'm going to go ahead and give it a random font-style, whatever I want.

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:01.610
And then to convert it to a style to a textile,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.800
I click on this icon again, click on plus,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.380
and then I'll can give it any name that I want.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.000
I'm going to give it temp texts,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.320
It's tile name and then I can go ahead and create a textile and then it will be

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.670
visible and this can be reused again anywhere in the entire file.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.590
All right, so let's get rid of it.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.325
And that was your quick rundown of how to create a color,

00:05:22.325 --> 00:05:24.980
style and a textile.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.625
Now, once you've followed along and finish the class,

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:32.510
you will have right now at the beginning of your starter file will be empty.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.925
Every page you will be essentially empty.

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:36.545
So at the end of this class,

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:37.940
inside your starter file,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.775
you will have all the user interface components that is prison inside the finished file.

00:05:43.775 --> 00:05:45.080
And as a final project,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.430
what do you can do is this.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.055
You can create a new page by clicking right over here and naming the page final project,

00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:55.070
all right, and then everything that you've made,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.550
you can start collecting them into your final project page.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.054
And you do that by simply copying,

00:06:01.054 --> 00:06:04.790
by pressing Command or Control C and pasting it in the final project.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.365
So this drop-down is something that will make in the third chapter after buttons,

00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:14.105
you know, you have just collected it here by pressing Command C and Command V.

00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:18.125
Now similarly, I can bring the other things that I've made.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.420
And then once you've brought everything together,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.780
your final project page will look something like this.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.565
Not exactly like this,

00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:28.070
because I've already used it to

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.535
my liking and you can arrange it in the way that you like,

00:06:31.535 --> 00:06:33.605
but it'll look something similar to this.

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:38.360
And the final project is just some mission of a screenshot, this page.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.770
So you can take a screenshot of it and submit it as the class project for this class.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.389
And also in the comments,

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.665
be sure to copy this link by clicking on Share.

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:54.020
And then you can go ahead and choose anyone with a link can view and then copy

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.645
the link and submit it as a comment to the submission that you're making to this class.

00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:01.715
And yeah, that's it for this video.

00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:03.155
That's all we will be making.

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:06.410
And I've showed you the setup and I've also showed

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.845
you the project that you are required to submit for this class.

00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:11.390
And I'll see you in

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.740
the very first actual lesson of this class in the next video. See you then.
