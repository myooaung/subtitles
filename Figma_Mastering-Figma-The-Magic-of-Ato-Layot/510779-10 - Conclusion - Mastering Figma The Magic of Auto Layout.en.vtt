00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.655
Well, that's all for this class.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:12.900
We went from knowing nothing about auto layout in the first video to making it work at

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.970
our own whims and meeting and do stuff that is really meant to do in the last video.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.585
So we went through a lot and relearn a lot of stuff in between.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:25.200
I hope you see that how powerful the simple feature can be,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.950
and I hope that if you aren't already using it, you will.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.570
Now, if you liked this class,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.630
you can go ahead and leave a review here on Skillshare.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
That would mean a lot available on Twitter at Nashville,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.910
you can find me,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.010
shoot me a DM or a class requests.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.190
I'm all open to that.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.810
And with this, I hope that I will see you soon in another class.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.380
Bye.
