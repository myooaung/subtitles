00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.640
All right now we understand how we built all this stuff here how focus on below the line items here.

2
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.560
And so this tab here is really simplest just images and text.

3
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.020
Again keep the images as small as you can.

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.240
OK.

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.810
Especially the ones like these where you don't have to zoom and keep the resolution low otherwise it'll

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.480
make the file size massive OK and secure this file.

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.070
Same thing as text settings.

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.720
This was more complicated.

9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.850
So this one here what we're doing is a couple of things what we're putting just a ton of data from a

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.090
massive array an array is just kind of a big sort of database thing.

11
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.600
And we're doing it based on a few things.

12
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.390
Number one is country Number two is currency.

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.290
And then here you just type in your nickname it says your name.

14
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.290
And I did that.

15
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.410
Over here I can say congratulations you've finished this much of the course that sort of thing and if

16
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.440
you want you can just enter toll progress message in here.

17
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.290
Copy and paste it there.

18
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.960
It'll show you the logic behind that.

19
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.660
Basically the bottom line is it just looks at what percent of the cost you're done.

20
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.420
And it put up a custom message like congratulations John or whatever whatever your name is which you

21
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.840
put here.

22
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.150
And so the countries here these two are pulled from a list and I'll show you how he did that similar

23
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.670
ratio before.

24
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.640
So if you go to data and then you go to a data validation you just do a list and then it grabs down

25
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.400
here these countries here.

26
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.910
I'll get back to plaques in a minute.

27
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.380
And then what you do is the same thing with the currency.

28
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.490
It's actually getting from another list.

29
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.730
So if you go to data validation here it pulls it from right beside.

30
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.110
These are mutually exclusive.

31
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.380
And each of these two looks OK.

32
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.470
All right.

33
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.790
And that's where I pull the data from and that's it.

34
00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:03.220
And then what I did was I basically I pulled in this rate here based on whatever currency you have.

35
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.700
And then I put a hyperlink here in case you wanted to change what the Canadian dollar rate is right

36
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.390
now.

37
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.770
And it's just using a V Look-Up which is like a database and kind of like how much before.

38
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.950
OK.

39
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.670
And then here is just a button or an image you know how to do that or.

40
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.490
And then here you'll notice.

41
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.310
Like I kind of hit some of these if if it was a country right didn't have all the data.

42
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.790
What I did was it was you wouldn't even know it but it would appear like a blank like that.

43
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.710
And then here in the city black as well.

44
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.280
And so this cell here I named it.

45
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.910
And this still here is called on online resources in your country and the reason I named it was because

46
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.390
I referred to it in one of the links.

47
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.030
I can't remember where but I think that maybe in here the first one and I just said equals on my resources

48
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.760
in your country.

49
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.310
If it's I have to go there right now.

50
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.220
Scollard yet.

51
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.170
OK.

52
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.900
See online resources in your country.

53
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.060
Hold on a second.

54
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.200
Yeah here you go.

55
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.740
So here there's just logic behind this here.

56
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.760
It's saying the Canada government should figure out a way to say Canadian.

57
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.130
That's right.

58
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.600
And then what I did was I just there's a formula here I threw in basically saying if that cell that

59
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.800
we looked at on that previous tap wasn't blank then do something otherwise do nothing.

60
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.130
And that and that's basically it.

61
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.000
So it grabbed the data and threw it in here.

62
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.620
And there's a bunch of other stuff here that's thrown at him when ever see seen and it's because attaching

63
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.890
a

64
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.050
a field that you named to something else.

65
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.110
So it's really cool that we go over here to show you this is really powerful.

66
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.640
There's people People.com strings so I could say equals

67
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:13.300
I can say equals open Hi there and then I can say your name or some are your country like this.

68
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.120
And if your country is filled up with something you will say hi there Canada.

69
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.120
I think in this case.

70
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.430
Hi there Canada.

71
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.330
So what you got to do though is you've got to make sure you put a space here because it's not smart

72
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.120
enough to tell you.

73
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.750
And this is just telling Excel hey get another field and they can attach something else to it as well.

74
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.950
So I want to do something else and add.

75
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.120
I don't know why I'm not that creative.

76
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.680
And then we'll do another one your end and we use Windows and you'll see a drop down based on what you've

77
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.960
entered and which is awesome doesn't always work on Mac.

78
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.250
I think Windows is a lot better when it comes to excel because you know Microsoft makes makes that so

79
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.560
your country is true your currency Hi there Canada and then the high Canadian dollar.

80
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.080
There we go.

81
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.650
Good Stoller's not dollars dollars.

82
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.280
So we said good.

83
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.730
OK.

84
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.230
That's a strength.

85
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.810
All right.

86
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.850
Now let's go back to settings and now you understand strings and you can just do if then statements

87
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.300
as well.

88
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.580
Well by saying if something is empty then do this how do see that.

89
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.410
And the way you say something is empty is you make equal to just two quotes together.

90
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.890
And you'll see a bunch of that too.

91
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.550
All right.

92
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.680
So here this is saying please click the links below.

93
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.980
Blah blah blah oh just text 3 seconds.

94
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.350
Let me get back Saro here if err on the outside just in case there's an error right which happens sometimes

95
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.550
with these cells.

96
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.260
I assume he'll say what the hell man by country national up here.

97
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.700
Should get the country and stuff.

98
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.470
OK.

99
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.510
So if it looks that up there it's basically saying if that field is full do this otherwise do something

100
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.850
else and something else is there basically saying show nothing.

101
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.290
Right.

102
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.610
So those quotes.

103
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.590
OK.

104
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.590
Otherwise it says your country the Canada government provides helpful resources and that throws in the

105
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.440
hyperlink as well cap and hyperlinks a pretty cool function if you just go to another field and type

106
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.620
in equals hyperlink open brackets you'll see what the fields are.

107
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.880
Within that there's the hyperlink and then the friendly name straitly click equals hyperlink and then

108
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.950
here you ignore that the font that the link location and the friendly name the friendly name is you

109
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.970
know high there and the link is HTP whatever you can.

110
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.950
All right.

111
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:41.750
And so all this stuff here it's pulling this year from a massive massive array and I called that array

112
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.320
all country data so I'll show you.

113
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.260
And we know from the course that we can always take one of these items and then paste it over here to

114
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.280
find that item.

115
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.920
And these are all reserved words.

116
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.390
OK.

117
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.790
So this here all country is a massive block of data.

118
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:05.560
So here and all I did was I basically I had a couple of guys a year ago I had a guy actually enter a

119
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.380
lot of information here and then really helped out now as well.

120
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.270
He's been great.

121
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.170
So basically it pulls off of all of these cells here it looks up the top here and pulls it down.

122
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.760
And this is getting out there but explanation wise.

123
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:30.070
But in order to tell the top row and the array what this data is and this wasn't the smartest way to

124
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.180
do it but I had tried try right click here sorry.

125
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:42.820
I said that I actually created this row arrays can and all this doing is it remembers that name.

126
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.430
And so here it's just it it kind of translates it for me it's easier for me to solve this way so call

127
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.220
one is the country name.

128
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.840
And then I added here FDIC equivalent name.

129
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.540
And this was just for another course I had a deposit insurance and this stuff all the data here actually

130
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.460
got from my complete personal finance course I believe.

131
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:12.500
But a year ago and I've I'm building on this slowly so this I use this engine here like the Unreal Engine

132
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.750
but it's an engine my courses are used for crypto of course from mothers.

133
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.220
OK.

134
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.900
So I think we're basically done with settings.

135
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.650
I knew it through.

136
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.510
I know I threw a lot at you to just kind of go through it and delete certain cells.

137
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.480
And then when you look at that formulas build on slowly like I showed you in the last lecture like just

138
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.950
throw one book at one level.

139
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.570
Sorry it's late night for me.

140
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.380
Build a break down these these formulas by just looking at one little statement each.

141
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.660
OK so what you do is this.

142
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:57.660
So for this one here find the innermost brackets and then delete everything else and build out from

143
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.370
that and play around the numbers well.

144
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.120
So this year all these are named fields and you know how to name fields.

145
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.160
And I've got a ton of them.

146
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.220
And what was really convenient was that the fact that all these names fields existed I created all of

147
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:15.660
them because what I can do is I could have you Jump's them automatically within the course which I thought

148
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.880
was pretty cool.

149
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.170
Yeah.

150
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.600
So that is basically this.

151
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.700
And you can go and look at that huge array called all country data belove if you care now.

152
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:34.840
When it came to and the reason I said don't add any rolls columns earlier in the course.

153
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.010
See right there because this could really get messed up.

154
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.430
You do it.

155
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.940
But it should be fine Excel Spahr enough to link to the right cells and stuff just in case you know

156
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:44.920
I wasn't sure.

157
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.930
So you know.

158
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.250
But that warning out there.

159
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.880
So I'm going to try to remember to see how I did this entire flag thing now.

160
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.880
So we'll run the settings page that's why that the colors green there.

161
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.920
So we just pulled a flag here and I think I'd name it as well.

162
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.720
OK.

163
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.210
It's coming.

164
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.990
I think I call it flag pick.

165
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.710
Come on.

166
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.720
I got you.

167
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.560
So I made it equal the flag pick OK.

168
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.840
And that's not a reserve word I created that.

169
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:22.290
And then what you do is you can actually go to formulas define name and please you if you have Windows

170
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.400
as well use Windows for the stuff because Windows makes it so much easier to delete multiple ones like

171
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400
this on a Mac.

172
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.800
You've got to each one individually.

173
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:29.310
OK.

174
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.560
So I'm going to go down to flight deck.

175
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:31.860
OK.

176
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.990
I assure you I have made all these Dominika.

177
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:40.830
So I had a flag pick here.

178
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.140
So all I did here was I named this.

179
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.980
You have to do it in here.

180
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.600
You can't do it up there like you do here.

181
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.840
So that and then what you do is I basically named it here.

182
00:10:53.860 --> 00:11:00.070
And the bottom line is that I said look at the country that was selected that dropped that box.

183
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.710
Then after you look at the country look at the index which means the very first column here and whatever's

184
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.960
in that box throw it there.

185
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.280
And so it didn't work that well here on my computer.

186
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.530
Whenever about I'm sure it worked better when you were working there once except for the teachers in

187
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.660
this case.

188
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.730
And that's all I did.

189
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.200
So you play around that and it will make much more sense I promise you.

190
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.780
It is a pain the neck close to can always flex and I learned a lot there's a lot of countries you know

191
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.360
existed that's how ignorant I am.

192
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.570
OK.

193
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.150
That is done there.

194
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:37.660
And I think I've got everything here showed Fauria up up up up up up up it's OK.

195
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.220
And then what I want to do is I want to show you that on every single tattoo I went to what I did was

196
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:53.760
this I would make the link here go to the top left most cell and I did that in case you were way way

197
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.010
down on a page and you got lost and came back when you're still way lost down there.

198
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.770
So I was I made it here OK so I called this little cell here I named it.

199
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.070
I clicked on here and then I named it this go to stuff I processor's it puts in the top.

200
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.930
And then what happens is when somebody clicks on this.

201
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:21.230
So say we're over here and you're about to click on this the code is this all it does it points to that

202
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.400
that name rage.

203
00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.950
Go to Bob over there.

204
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.480
That's it.

205
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.730
And it's smart enough to remember it's right there.

206
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.340
And then I didn't screen tap here for each of them.

207
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.760
And we're interested in that.

208
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.650
Good.

209
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.770
Anything else here to explain to you.

210
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.440
I think I understand all this stuff.

211
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.520
It's a name.

212
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:37.930
Oh.

213
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.330
The naming convention came in.

214
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.230
Really helpful man when I was doing the financial stuff.

215
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:51.030
Really really helpful especially when when when I want to highlight certain areas to you know to copy

216
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.270
and paste.

217
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:52.730
Right.

218
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:59.460
So I think that was over here on the outputs here on all issues it was on the open for the whole thing.

219
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:07.200
So if we go here you'll notice that I actually quite often I would make you paste in stuff here from

220
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:13.320
the Word documents and all I did was I highlighted a bunch of cells and then I need them up here.

221
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.250
That's it.

222
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:20.160
And that's how it linked to there and then by accident I discovered rufous going to work actually on

223
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.900
this version.

224
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:27.370
It worked beautifully when I was showing you the financial section on Windows version of Excel.

225
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.620
The C works here.

226
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.910
I don't think it will be Microsoft always favors or operating system even now.

227
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.140
That's OK.

228
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.900
Back in oh here it is good.

229
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.620
It works sort of not as good but it was.

230
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.990
There you go.

231
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.350
OK.

232
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.110
That's dope.

233
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.850
Look at that.

234
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.130
How cool is that.

235
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.190
So amazing.

236
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.040
So if you type that in.

237
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.730
Equals final BPB or Iara.

238
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.040
That stuff will come up here.

239
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.380
OK.

240
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.710
Good.

241
00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.890
And then I think that's basically I don't know if there's much else to show you.

242
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.600
Mean see here

243
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.720
yeah you know how to name rows and cells.

244
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.840
And it came in really handy.

245
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.360
I would do it.

246
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:18.180
I had no idea where this was from year one revenue unless I named it financials input first year revenue

247
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.400
you know.

248
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:25.550
So and then you can hit the command open square breaker close square bracket and jump back there.

249
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:25.770
Right.

250
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:31.060
So if I do this here it would jump there eventually.

251
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.060
Yeah.

252
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:38.150
So and So as you can see the arrow back and forth or up and down until it actually shows up there you

253
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.370
are right there.

254
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.380
Yes a total revenue year once you're are here which I butcher by typing that that close or open parenthesis

255
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.760
that's their financials.

256
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.150
First year revenue.

257
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:50.690
OK.

258
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.480
So you know I torche that but.

259
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.990
But you got the idea pulled it directly from there.

260
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.250
And then the spark lines.

261
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.600
I think I just went to insert charts spark lines and then what else do we have here.

262
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.750
Yeah that's basically it.

263
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:15.750
And then grouping on groping you know you highlight them then go to data group for data on group that's

264
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.280
it.

265
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.150
And then up up up up up up.

266
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.110
I think that's it.

267
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.490
This was a best to make this page here but I enjoy it it's fun.

268
00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.450
I like a challenge.

269
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.520
All right.

270
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.160
And we'll see what else I have.

271
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.690
I think I've showed you everything.

272
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:43.780
That's a lot of if then statements before I showed stuff so here I referred to this here so if the text

273
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:47.070
here is please click get out and then do nothing otherwise do something else.

274
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.530
That's it.

275
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.050
Inputs for the first page.

276
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.860
Oh this was fun here.

277
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.960
So here was right here.

278
00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:03.060
I named this here cover page selected and I made it equal the page selected later.

279
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:10.300
So if you select the cover page I don't go to than I told you which file to download and I'll show you

280
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.590
how.

281
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:11.500
So if you go here

282
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.930
OK here and you can read that right.

283
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:25.900
Get hundred and then hear what I did was I basically said if cover page whatever is equal to that long

284
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.790
string please enter stuff that do this I that.

285
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.770
So here see if cover page flexibles please click me.

286
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.350
I know then something's going to happen.

287
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:42.580
Otherwise it's pretty long here but it's basically saying whatever you selected you added in a number

288
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.990
right from an array.

289
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.730
So I'll show you the cover page.

290
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.380
It actually is kind of neat.

291
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.900
So all I did was whatever cover page you select.

292
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.420
I just basically made it more intelligent like a name.

293
00:16:54.430 --> 00:17:00.350
So if you if you picked covered table 1 OK it's kind of hard to see then this is going to come out.

294
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.870
Business Plan template which should tell you which one to download.

295
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.210
And then if you just you could just go right to my Squarespace Web site.

296
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:12.620
So if you click here this go to it to get the template directly here.

297
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:15.910
And then I got a credit really with this you did a great job at this.

298
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.280
So that's that.

299
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.640
And then I think that that might be it.

300
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:28.230
So we see if there's any deals to show you I think I've showed you everything pretty much.

301
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.330
See here.

302
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:35.170
I mean there's probably some advanced formulas that that I put it.

303
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.440
Oh OK.

304
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:36.900
OK.

305
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:42.400
And the next lecture I'll continue with the checkboxes and a couple other minor things which are which

306
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.220
are a lot of fun to make.

307
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.520
Thanks.
