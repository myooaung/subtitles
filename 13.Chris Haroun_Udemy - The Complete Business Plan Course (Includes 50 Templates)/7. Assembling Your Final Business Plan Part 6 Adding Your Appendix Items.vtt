1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.260
Continuing from The Last Lecture.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.420
So let me just make this back to normal.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.370
Ninety five percent which is what I use on my Mac on Windows.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.180
I use 70 something different.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.390
So what we're going to do now is we're going to do the last part which is the appendix.

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.730
K and it's just going to be sent your resume.

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.720
If you have a resume that you want to include and then product details as well maybe a brochure and

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.940
all the resumes your employees if you want tell your call and you can even have resumes for people that

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.410
are part time or consultants.

10
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.330
It just helps to make your product look more therof my goodness rather than a thousand throw now.

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.110
Amazing.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.950
OK good.

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.720
So here's what we're going to we're going to go back to the Word document I got install this.

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.580
This is dope and if you've done this yet on a Mac but it use dark mode.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.360
But I'm recording Mac sales.

16
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.020
OH MY GOD ALONE.

17
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.070
OK.

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.690
So here's what we're going to do.

19
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.620
We're going to go down here to the end of the document.

20
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.430
Correct.

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.940
And if you were with me during the last lecture you saw that what we did was we turned this document

22
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.500
in from Porcher into landscape mode.

23
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.460
And we did that so our financial statements all appear in landscape mode completely optional.

24
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.940
So here's where we did it.

25
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.920
And I'm showing you all this for a reason.

26
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.580
I mean turn this on and you can see here that I have a section break.

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.030
So if I go here double click that section 1 that section to.

28
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.170
So we're going to add another section section 3 and Section 3 is going to look just like Section 1.

29
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.670
So we'll have to insert another section break and recall that we made this wider as well.

30
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.350
We may have to change that back to that in the new section and we want to make sure the new section

31
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080
continues with the page numbers.

32
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.030
OK so let me scroll down here.

33
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.110
Wow.

34
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.420
And a lot of pages automatically.

35
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.730
Weird.

36
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.480
OK.

37
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.190
I'm going to go back here and we're here to pass.

38
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.220
So here's we're going to we are going to insert a section break so the S.M. new sexual star on the next

39
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.980
page.

40
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.810
So what we're in is we're at a new section right because right now we're Section 2 is in landscape we

41
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.730
want to go back to portrait.

42
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.860
So here's what you do.

43
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
You got peer insert and then you go down to break.

44
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.330
And when you put it in the section break.

45
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.780
And we want to be on the next page and on this page on an expert next page.

46
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.620
There you go.

47
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.430
All right.

48
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.840
And this is now Section 3.

49
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.600
And I know because I don't like this that's to this history OK.

50
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.170
Becker now we're into this we're going to make the layout difference allowed here.

51
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.410
And then when going go to orientation.

52
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.820
Go back to portrait and say that's what I'm talking about.

53
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.860
Is that great.

54
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.430
All right.

55
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.820
And then what we'll do is I don't have a header but maybe you do if you just double click and change

56
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.140
it there but the footer here OK.

57
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.790
So it continued with the page numbers.

58
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.710
If it doesn't continue with your page numbers you just click it here go to page number format page number

59
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.220
and you say continue from the previous section if it's finnicky and it doesn't.

60
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.050
Then you start at page 42 or whatever your number is.

61
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.600
I leave it at the pencil.

62
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.650
OK.

63
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.720
Now here's what to do.

64
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.180
I go back to two previous sections so I can get the footer here for page 42.

65
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.280
I mean that nice line that's here.

66
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.050
So I didn't go there.

67
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.780
I don't go there when I go the previous action.

68
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.340
OK hold on sir.

69
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.320
There you got.

70
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.940
OK.

71
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.610
Copy that hit copy I got to go back to where I was next.

72
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.270
No not there not there right here.

73
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.480
And I'm going to paste this in.

74
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.680
Whoops wants to be above here so let me see if I can go above.

75
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.440
I may have to manually do it.

76
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.840
All right.

77
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.330
Manually do it.

78
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.420
So going to drag it up there and it should look good.

79
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.190
Now to use the up and down arrows to make it look perfect.

80
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.450
And let's just go back and make sure it looks good enough.

81
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.690
One two three ok good looks like I found a mistake here too.

82
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.660
Good.

83
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.940
OK.

84
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.520
So we go to next here.

85
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.720
See what this is.

86
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.750
That is it nine inches.

87
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.150
So we can go back now and the header and footer back there previous.

88
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.950
And then I don't know I did that's fine.

89
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.370
And go back here and make it 9.

90
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.730
Don't hit the up or down buttons.

91
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.300
It takes eight million years to get the

92
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.470
seriously.

93
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.160
All right.

94
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.830
Whatever it's going to be you're going to be like that where are you going to be like that.

95
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.550
That's fine.

96
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.110
Can we drag it down here and we're going to go and let's just make sure it looks consistent.

97
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.390
Previous sir good that's good enough.

98
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.930
It's fine.

99
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.680
Actually it's a millimeter off.

100
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.750
But it's fine I'll care.

101
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.570
OK.

102
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.780
And this one got changed as well because it's linked to the previous So I'm not going to say I don't

103
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.290
want you link to the previous anymore.

104
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.340
OK.

105
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.540
And let's see what happens in its

106
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.840
go back here.

107
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.520
This here is

108
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.770
6.4 am going to copy that.

109
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.570
I know it's tedious.

110
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.470
What we're doing here.

111
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.030
But I want to be perfect because this can change your life.

112
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.160
Having a great business plan.

113
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.160
OK.

114
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.490
And this is going to change this right here.

115
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.900
Shape form at that this make sure it didn't change that previous one.

116
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.090
Good good good good good good.

117
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.970
All right I think we're good man.

118
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:29.190
Let's go back to the previous section work smarter not harder by hitting previous.

119
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.350
Good good good.

120
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.980
OK good.

121
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.910
We're getting there.

122
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.900
Almost done it.

123
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.000
Let's go back to the appendix.

124
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.600
Make sure it works make sure that page numbers are good.

125
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.280
Good.

126
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.000
Great.

127
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.310
Perfect.

128
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.590
That's what I'm talking about OK.

129
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.270
And let's hide all this stuff there.

130
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.690
All right.

131
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.700
No word can be so much fun.

132
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:59.750
OK so what you can do here if you want is you can paste special your your resume here and if you have

133
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.420
a PTF you can copy the PTF do a screen print so if you're using Windows just click down the corner here

134
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.850
on the start button and then type in the word snip.

135
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:14.780
And you can use the snip tool or just go to command your search for the word snip tool or even if you

136
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.950
have charm's you can write.

137
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.760
You can right click on Windows 8.

138
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.200
I hope not.

139
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.260
Windows and Windows 7 just so you don't have that.

140
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.850
If you are Windows 8 you can swipe on the right there and grab the Charmes and type snipp and use the

141
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.010
step tool to copy and paste.

142
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:37.790
If you are using a Macintosh you can hit the command shift 4 button and you take a picture and then

143
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.140
it saves on your desktop.

144
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.960
And so what you do is you go insert pictures OK from file and he grabbed from your desktop and you insert

145
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.770
it here.

146
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.160
The image here OK and just play around the images and make them shadow if you want like we had here

147
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.120
your call whatever.

148
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.440
And for those you that up.

149
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.950
Upgrade to Mojave Mojave.

150
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.320
You pronounce it.

151
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.440
If you're you can command shift 5 and I don't have it on mine.

152
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.680
But no matter Mac.

153
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.440
What happens is you can customize that when you do that screen thing.

154
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.260
This thing here that it will actually copy in your clipboard instead of put it on a desktop or somewhere

155
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.850
else.

156
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.400
So that's what I would do.

157
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.220
I'll put them all in here.

158
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:29.820
And let's say that we have a couple of resumes here you can write down on a John Smith resume for now

159
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.150
that sounds more foreign for you that way.

160
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:41.810
Resume full the British accents sound smarter for John Smith good bass good and then you can do a couple

161
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.560
different resumes.

162
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.820
If you have them whatever resume for months go to scar.

163
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.090
Let's in Jozen.

164
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.090
And after you Antron all the resumes here if you scroll the photo in the footer is not perfect.

165
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.330
Words a little finicky this probably won't happen to you but if it does you just kind of copy this and

166
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.810
you can paste it again in here.

167
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.990
I'll leave that up to you though.

168
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:11.870
And if you want to have a different header use double click and you can change your head around as well.

169
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.190
And sometimes I'd like to have for some I-Reports.

170
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.630
I'd like to put a bottom border here in the header and then you can type in the name of the file.

171
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:24.240
Here you can see a business plan for every name your company has just typed in here.

172
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.510
That's all just kind of a pretend text and then what you do is you make it italicize and a little bit

173
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.540
smaller as well.

174
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.320
If you want to Casso controls you don't do that.

175
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.550
And then go back here so I would just insert all of your images here.

176
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.510
OK so you go.

177
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.330
Insert image from the desktop or just paste it if it's in the Clipboard.

178
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.400
For all you different employees let's say we only have a couple of employee so obsolete the rest of

179
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:49.970
them here.

180
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:59.900
If you want soc error that's then after Scarlet's resume and use insur it in the middle there and make

181
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.370
it nice and white as well so it looks nicely centered and if you want you can.

182
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.790
You can even have a bleed over into the footer just above the number there.

183
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.000
Your call your call I'd like to be consistent Plus just me.

184
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.370
You can have a part time a person's resume here as well.

185
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:23.890
If you want etc. and then just get rid of it just to make it more simplistic.

186
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.440
And then here you can have your ups.

187
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.240
You can have your marketing materials right below that if you want to paste that indirectly and then

188
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.510
you can always go to 5 or dot com and get somebody to create marketing materials for you if you want

189
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.620
it to.

190
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:45.220
So after I have this page there we go back in here so I don't read the paragraph marks or customer testimonials

191
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:51.310
or references and just anything that will help the reader understand you know what you're putting in

192
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.940
here.

193
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:58.470
You can get rid of it if you don't have it and then just make sure that there is no page at the ends.

194
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:04.320
Play around with your footer if you want your call and then what you do is and everyone's different

195
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:04.910
your.

196
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:11.980
Your document might be long and might be short or whatever but you can scroll up and you'll see how

197
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.860
nicely formatted it is.

198
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:20.320
See how this here is landscape and then this here is a nice portrait's.

199
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.740
You can send it out if you want your call.

200
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.180
Most look greats looks good.

201
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.830
You'll have more data than yours and mine.

202
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:32.710
I said Dummy data here for titles and then this is just some of my employees.

203
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.190
If I want I can make these little smaller put all three on one page.

204
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.320
Call it whatever you want it to.

205
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.360
The product image example.

206
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.520
And then you can get it all nicely bound at Kinko's or wherever you are in the world.

207
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:50.230
I know a FedEx Kinko's is not everywhere and then.

208
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.690
Yeah yeah get a nicely printed you can go.

209
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.720
You can go online to a bunch of places and get it bound as well.

210
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.710
And the reason we spend a bunch of time and don't worry about this you won't see that that gap and if

211
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:08.560
you might can fix it whatever it is that bothers you whatever doesn't matter and then you'll know what

212
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:16.630
you'll do is you'll you'll right click on this your contents and update the field and then do it twice

213
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:22.020
and tell you why in a second because this option comes up and you won't update the entire table.

214
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.360
I mean headings as well as the page numbers and so if we scroll down we see here that everything is

215
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.640
updated for us.

216
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.680
This here.

217
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.920
We just get off there.

218
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.110
That's executive summary from step 3 in the course.

219
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.480
Man team up for in the course it's all context sensitive you can double click and go directly to those

220
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.440
step.

221
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.790
Step 5 in the course of products and services and if you want you can actually.

222
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.340
That's a lot of detail there.

223
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.780
You can break this up and have subheadings like for example if you want a section on pricing.

224
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.460
You could do that as well and make these heading threes.

225
00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:00.730
I shall show you that right now if you want be kind of fun to do so we can do a sub section here on

226
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.560
the go.

227
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.820
Pricing like that.

228
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.940
Once pricing you can move things around if you want is that there is a heading to the scullery.

229
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.930
Here I'll show you how to take it and then we'll make these heading threes.

230
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.470
If you want.

231
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:20.350
This is completely optional and so I mean just double click to paint brush a few times and will paint

232
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:28.930
brush paint brush paint brush and then financing is something else and you can even ups.

233
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.210
Bingo here we're done with that and then we go back up here and we repaginate.

234
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.470
I used to be a new word for me.

235
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.880
I know what that means now right here.

236
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.970
You'll see that the pricing is its own kind of subsection it's a heading 2 and 3 needs will be indebted

237
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.220
so you right click go up the field update entire table.

238
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.340
There ya go.

239
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.660
Scroll down.

240
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.080
There you go.

241
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.220
So pricing here has got its own low section.

242
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.810
Let me just get rid of the grey so I can just show you the white side OK.

243
00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.420
So that's the section or Step 5.

244
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.680
If we scroll down in a lot of the stuff you won't have right there may be like optional fields you get

245
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.060
rid of like customer survey research or whatever it is and if you new customers or research like I mentioned

246
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:16.080
before with Survey Monkey markup you want to include that stuff in your appendix as well.

247
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.320
Then we did step 6 was competition.

248
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.010
I think we can go back here and double check on that.

249
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.380
Kolpak here to the top is slick.

250
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:32.840
Any random page and then it's going to go directly here.

251
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.000
So step six was customer and market.

252
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.650
OK right.

253
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.840
No that's right.

254
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.980
Septic's was a customer.

255
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.910
And in markets where is that do I have that.

256
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:43.600
You see what happened.

257
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.170
OK Kustra and market for some reason and I'm going to show I'm looking to correct this because this

258
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.610
happens every now and then with Word.

259
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.160
OK.

260
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:55.120
So this is supposed to be a heading one but it went normal for some reason even though it looks like

261
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.130
adding one.

262
00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.500
So I have to go here and select heading once again and then I'm going to repaginate can I think cut

263
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.050
a check and excel there.

264
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.050
But word is finicky and it can do that.

265
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.620
All right.

266
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.000
I've been working with the word for decades now that's how old I am.

267
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.870
All right let's go and see if that works ok it worked.

268
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.040
Great customer.

269
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.890
And market commentary and let's have a clean look here.

270
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.480
Wait.

271
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:21.760
All right.

272
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.750
That's six.

273
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.740
Is his customer.

274
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.140
Seven is competition.

275
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.980
Let's make sure it's right.

276
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.880
Competition good.

277
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.570
Eight is go to market strategy.

278
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.250
Make sure it's indented properly.

279
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:39.130
Good eight nine is sales and marketing sales marketing.

280
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.940
And you you might not have sales force structure in Europe and it's fun.

281
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:47.080
We talked about the 10 is milestones future milestones you might have passed milestones we've talked

282
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.490
about that we've got other and after other we have financials that step 12.

283
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:59.700
And if you wanted to you could even have subheadings here so you can even have your revenue income's

284
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:06.160
take forecasts balance sheet cash flow and in separate entries if you want to H1 H2 them in the way

285
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.250
you do that you just kind of DoubleClick here and you put another heading here.

286
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.860
So this year for example you have to this is completely optional.

287
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.670
We can make these h 3s if you wanted to.

288
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:26.550
And then you could create a new one for cash flow statements I'll show you here.

289
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:38.460
Completely optional overkilling no cash flow statements statements and you can make this bad boy here

290
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.300
in H2 and I just same for the balance sheet in the state.

291
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:47.040
If you want and I'm going to update this and show you what it looks like so I am moving around a lot

292
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:50.120
okay.

293
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:56.420
So what will happen is we'll have cash flow put in here in other words this will be an H 3 and the H2

294
00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:02.390
will stay here and New-Age to update fields on tire table doesn't doesn't show up you get a right click

295
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.060
again.

296
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.970
And there you go.

297
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.220
Well I don't know why you do that word.

298
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.350
That's the word right.

299
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.380
There you go.

300
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.460
So see here you can do that and do same thing for belge income stay if you want whatever completely

301
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.250
up to you I want to create a for everybody here.

302
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.330
Appendix we got these resumes other documents and whatnot.

303
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:30.210
So you know what we are done and you want to triple check and obviously make sure it's perfect.

304
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:35.930
Make sure the formatting is creates a feel like it is mid term paper.

305
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:43.670
And if you want you can play around with shadows over kilogramme but I try to be a perfectionist shadow

306
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.120
see how that looks.

307
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.280
Whatever.

308
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.210
Probably not but play around with it.

309
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:56.180
If you if you have time to save it and obviously change the name here to whatever your business plan

310
00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.020
is called.

311
00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.710
All right.

312
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.740
And we are done with this.

313
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.200
And let's go back here.

314
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.060
Ines let's see we're over here on business plan.

315
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.820

316
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.810
Wait for it wait for you ready.

317
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.890
You get to click this final box.

318
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.620
But we got to open this up here because I want to watch the number change because I want you to see

319
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.590

Just getting in.

321
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.080
And there's a lot of data here so taken a second opened up your computer is probably me faster might

322
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.440
have got this editing software stuff open that loading it says loading up here not actually loading.

323
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.880
I just made that text just in case people are wanting it was gone.

324
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:36.800
All right.

325
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.240
So ready wait for it.

326
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.640
Right now we're showing 92 percent or so 93.

327
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.830

Good job.

I hope you enjoyed this.

338
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.920
I have a couple more lectures after this one but if you want to learn how you can tell I enjoy all this

339
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.760
stuff it's a lot of fun.

340
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.520
I love teaching and I love it so I love software as well.

341
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.560
So if you're curious how I made this from scratch you can watch this part here and I always throw what's

342
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:29.180
called a lower third here when I'm doing post or editing and I can teach them scratch how I made all

343
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:29.740
of this stuff.

344
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.130
And these are not buttons.

345
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:32.580
OK.

346
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.500
I want to decode and here these are just images.

347
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.340
That's it.

348
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:41.730
All right so I will teach you how I made this entire spreadsheet from scratch and hope you learned a

349
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.300
little bit about Excel too and maybe word as well and you enjoyed this.

350
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.110
But thanks again for joining me on this long term.

351
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.490
We've gone through together.

352
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.540
We've had fun.

353
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.910
I certainly did.

354
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.690
And if you want to learn how I made this Excel spreadsheet you can click here and if you're doing the

355
00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:03.720
optional section on presentation slides then you can watch that that lecture which is right after this

356
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.030
one here or on the next part here on presentation slides.

357
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:12.090
And if you want to look at presentation slides you can actually insert all the slides that that are

358
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.300
made for you that I'll make with you into your appendix.

359
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:22.840
And if you insert your appendix they'll be 10 different images.

360
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.870
And if you want.

361
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:28.970
You don't have to actually put all the images on a separate page you can do a couple at a time we show

362
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.750
you actually.

363
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.050
All right.

364
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:35.150
So if you want to put in your slides as another exhibit and you can skip the rest this lecture if you're

365
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:43.340
not going to slide but what you do is you go into your appendix and we'll go right here at the end and

366
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:51.600
then you can hit Control enter and then you can say investor presentation

367
00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.920
slides and make sure this here is a Heading to go.

368
00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.720
It's great.

369
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:59.390
All right.

370
00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.300
And then what you do is whatever slides that you create and I'll show you how to do it in this lecture

371
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.750
here the presentation slides but what you'll do eventually you'll do a screen print.

372
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.570
And you know how to use screen print if you're using Windows and Mac until you're ready.

373
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:21.500
But you screen print all the slides in PowerPoint and then paste them directly so I'll give you an example.

374
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.120
And this is not the final one here but we're just kind of working on it right now.

375
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.700
It'll look better in this trust me.

376
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:35.050
OK so if we grab this that's actually wrong that should be Bill William Gates William I think.

377
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.830
OK.

378
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.480
That's called Dad humor.

379
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:44.450
So what you do is you could kind of copy it like this and then you can insert it from your desktop or

380
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.510
if you're using Windows you can paste it whatever.

381
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:55.280
And sometimes Max will paste as well and then you can make these smaller even include you know eight

382
00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.710
on one slide here or two on each.

383
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:58.620
Or S8 not sly.

384
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:04.820
I see two images on each so I can go copy paste it right there like that.

385
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.650
You can have two per page that sort of thing.

386
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.730
Obviously not the same image you'd have all 10 or you can have 4 per page whatever.

387
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:16.520
And the way to get rid of this whole image here on the site you can always go to a picture format which

388
00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.640
will Peary's like this.

389
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:22.730
And you go to a crop and then you just kind of go here and pick her up into little bits and then do

390
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.260
the same thing with that one there.

391
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.000
Or if you want to get a little artistic whatever.

392
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.710
And a lot of the backgrounds won't be white in the ones in the templates I give you but you can always

393
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.010
go here.

394
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:41.750
And then you can put a little shadow of one on one side like we've done before anyway so if you want

395
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.950
to learn more about how to do the presentation slides please watch this part here.

396
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.850
Of course if you want to learn more about Excel then please watch this part of the course.

397
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.150
Thanks.
