00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.910
Please click on the output button for milestones and this will be a short lectures not much to talk

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.870
about here.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.650
I just pulled through all of your future milestones.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.480
If you've written them down they'll appear here.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:19.110
If you don't want to include this additional future milestones options here you can click it and de-select

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.870
it.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.100
And if you've completed the profit margin Geographic milestones etc. I include it here otherwise just

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.690
disable that and then down here you can turn off past milestones if you want or turn them on whatever

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.190
completely your call.

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.680
I know it's not a placable that everybody and we've got just other geographic and other milestones that

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.080
are automatically populated here.

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.420
We are making amazing progress.

13
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.090
Wow.

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.330
We're almost done the entire qualitative part of the course.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.960
So I will see you next in the Step 11 other category and puts in analysis.

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.380
Thanks.
