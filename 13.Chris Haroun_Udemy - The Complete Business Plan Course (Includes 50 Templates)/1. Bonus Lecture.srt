<v ->Hi. I'm Chris Haroun,</v>
3

3

00:00:06,220  -->  00:00:09,400
and this MBA degree program is not what you think it is.
4

4

00:00:09,400  -->  00:00:10,404
It's better.

(gentle acoustic guitar music)
(pencil scratches)
6

6

00:00:14,470  -->  00:00:18,340
This program is more than 25 years of business experience,
7

7

00:00:18,340  -->  00:00:22,370
all rolled into one easy to access online program.
8

8

00:00:22,370  -->  00:00:24,280
I've sold over one million courses,
9

9

00:00:24,280  -->  00:00:26,460
in every single country.
10

10

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:27,990
I worked at Goldman Sachs,
11

11

00:00:27,990  -->  00:00:30,690
I have an MBA from Columbia University,
12

12

00:00:30,690  -->  00:00:32,550
and I've work in the venture capital,
13

13

00:00:32,550  -->  00:00:35,500
hedge fund, and consulting industries.
14

14

00:00:35,500  -->  00:00:37,650
I've also started many companies,
15

15

00:00:37,650  -->  00:00:40,230
and my courses have been featured in Forbes,
16

16

00:00:40,230  -->  00:00:43,193
Business Insider, CNN, and NBC.
17

17

00:00:44,100  -->  00:00:47,080
If you're ready to nail your next interview,
18

18

00:00:47,080  -->  00:00:48,630
get a better job,
19

19

00:00:48,630  -->  00:00:49,680
get a raise,
20

20

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:52,610
start that business you've always dreamt of,
21

21

00:00:52,610  -->  00:00:54,610
improve the one you currently run,
22

22

00:00:54,610  -->  00:00:57,050
or better manage your personal finances,
23

23

00:00:57,050  -->  00:00:59,900
then, this MBA degree program is for you.
24

24

00:00:59,900  -->  00:01:01,760
I can't begin to tell you
25

25

00:01:01,760  -->  00:01:04,670
how comprehensive this program is.
26

26

00:01:04,670  -->  00:01:06,300
It's got everything,
27

27

00:01:06,300  -->  00:01:09,980
including more than 300 hours of on-demand video.
28

28

00:01:09,980  -->  00:01:10,813
I would have to do
29

29

00:01:10,813  -->  00:01:13,490
one of those dramatic opening title crawls,
30

30

00:01:13,490  -->  00:01:14,760
from a certain space movie,
31

31

00:01:14,760  -->  00:01:15,722
just to show you.
32

32

00:01:15,722  -->  00:01:19,472
(thrilling orchestral music)
33

33

00:01:24,460  -->  00:01:26,720
And check out all the amazing reviews,
34

34

00:01:26,720  -->  00:01:29,090
from students who have already enrolled
35

35

00:01:29,090  -->  00:01:31,396
in this MBA degree program.
36

36

00:01:31,396  -->  00:01:35,146
(thrilling orchestral music)
37

37

00:01:38,870  -->  00:01:40,810
This on-demand version of the program
38

38

00:01:40,810  -->  00:01:42,183
is only $499,
39

39

00:01:43,489  -->  00:01:45,000
and it's more up-to-date
40

40

00:01:45,000  -->  00:01:48,260
than many of these old-fashioned MBA programs,
41

41

00:01:48,260  -->  00:01:50,393
which cost you well over $100,000.
42

42

00:01:51,540  -->  00:01:52,500
Not to mention,
43

43

00:01:52,500  -->  00:01:54,920
they don't even teach you the practical concepts
44

44

00:01:54,920  -->  00:01:56,293
included in my program.
45

45

00:01:57,770  -->  00:02:01,020
Last but not least, there is a 30-day
46

46

00:02:01,020  -->  00:02:03,530
100% money-back guarantee.
47

47

00:02:03,530  -->  00:02:07,060
And because you can access this program from any device,
48

48

00:02:07,060  -->  00:02:08,910
meaning a desktop computer,
49

49

00:02:08,910  -->  00:02:10,290
or a laptop computer,
50

50

00:02:10,290  -->  00:02:12,850
or a tablet, or even your smartphone,
51

51

00:02:12,850  -->  00:02:16,210
it means you can comfortably fit it into your schedule.
52

52

00:02:16,210  -->  00:02:18,693
Even if you work full-time, it's no problem.
53

53

00:02:20,250  -->  00:02:23,840
So, if you're ready to unlock the key to your potential,
54

54

00:02:23,840  -->  00:02:25,514
then, I'll see you in class.
55

55

00:02:25,514  -->  00:02:28,431
