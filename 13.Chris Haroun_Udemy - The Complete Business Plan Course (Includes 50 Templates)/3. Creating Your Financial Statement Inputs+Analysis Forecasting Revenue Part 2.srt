1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,760
Okay now that we're down with units or number of hours billed and you can read that comment there if

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,580
you want to but I'm setting this up so that services based business models can use this financial model

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,890
and product based as well.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,770
Okay good.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,350
So now that we got the number of units we have to enter in how much it's going to cost to buy a single

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,120
unit or how much we're selling each one for which is called The average selling price or people on Wall

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,680
Street called the HSP and if you're doing a services model you would enter in here the hourly rate charged

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,790
and kime And if you're doing the services model you're allowed to have half numbers here if you want

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,700
like you my bill a half an hour whatever.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,620
Ok so here you'll enter in how much you going to bill for.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,520
So let's say that the the goggles or product or whatever it is you're selling.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,340
Let's say you sell each unit for $99.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:49,920
OK.

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:58,140
So and let's just keep that constant for the first year whatever it is you're selling it's nine bucks

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,790
and they're not going to pay just the value here so you can go to space special and then you like values

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,450
and do that because if you're using a Mac this is what it looks like.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,550
OK good.

18
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:19,550
And let's say that the average selling price goes lower after the first year let's say that we figured

19
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,530
out how to produce this thing on a much cheaper basis or for some reason your bill your hourly rate

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,310
at a lower rate.

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,420
So let's say that we dropped by 5 percent lower.

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,710
So I'll just take this time.

23
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,730
Point eight point nine five for a 5 percent drop.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,850
See what that gets to that amount.

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,610
They're not around number but it's 5 percent drop just for fun.

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,530
So I'm gonna to copy this now.

27
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,240
And then I'm going to paste it just for the rest of this year.

28
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,470
And this is just dummy data but I think this will help you understand or use this and how to model financially

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,410
okay.

30
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,600
And then you can just paste special the value and can do that the value.

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,570
Okay great.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,780
And then what we can do is let's say that by the third year that's the pricing point drops to.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,110
I'm just going to make a number up here seventy nine dollars.

34
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,280
Okay we're getting more efficient competitors.

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,950
And for the industry and we charge a lower pricing points.

36
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,620
So I'm going to go here and enter this amount here.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,200
Right click and I'm just going to pay special just about you get good.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,460
And then let's say that the pricing point drops to $69 here for whatever reason.

39
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:42,110
K and I get a copy this and I can pay special just about X I don't mess up the formatting like the borders

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,800
in different places and stuff.

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,600
Right click and pay special that done.

42
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,060
And then we see hold on a second and you'll see it the spark lines are up in there.

43
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,650
And then let's say here that the pricing point drops to $54 for whatever reason you could change on

44
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,810
a monthly basis as well I just want to have a dummy date in here so I can show you trends and the fun

45
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,530
part about financial modeling in general is you look for high level trends.

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,650
It's so fun like accounting isn't is a science.

47
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,950
It has to be precise.

48
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,020
But finance when you're predicting the future is a bit more of an art.

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,120
It's fun.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,810
And a lot of these answers might be based on what you entered in for milestones for example earlier

51
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,130
in the course or when you plan to release products that sort of thing and so I'm not going to enter

52
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,800
in the rest of the data here hear I'm saying leave that empty for now.

53
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,470
So now that we have the average selling price or the hourly billing rate depending what kind of business

54
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,190
you have.

55
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,050
And now we have the number of units sold.

56
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:44,070
So if we sold 100 units in January of 2013 for example at 9 bucks each that our revenue is obviously

57
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,980
going to be 100 times 99 which will be reflected up here.

58
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,960
So 100 times 9 9 9 thousand nine hundred Now I did not put curtseys here on purpose.

59
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,200
I didn't put Yahn in front of it or a pound or whatever but all the currency stuff will be reflected

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,350
for you if I click here.

61
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,420
See here it says revenue and net income forecasts are in Canadian dollars.

62
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,070
And if you were to change this back here and I'm happy to see my beloved Canadian flag appear here on

63
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,120
the Windows version.

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,290
But if we were to change it say leave the country like that for now.

65
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,070
But this has changed.

66
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,070
I'm going to pick a random currency ready going to go here.

67
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,710
Boom boom boom.

68
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,830
That one whatever currency that is there appears here.

69
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,880
And if you want you can click here to get an update on that currency if you want a more recent version

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,360
of it.

71
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:34,870
OK.

72
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,110
So that's why I'm so ignorant.

73
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,910
I don't even know where that is first.

74
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,310
I'm so eager and I'm going to change it.

75
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,600
Please don't give me negative rating if you're from there.

76
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,610
So I only go to Gibralter pants.

77
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,200
OK.

78
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,300
So that's the exchange rate for Jabalpur pants.

79
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,920
OK.

80
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,950
And it updates here at your Balter pants.

81
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,010
And the reason I say that is because if we go back here to financials and just click it there then we

82
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,970
go here at all.

83
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,640
You'll see that it updates here.

84
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,770
The revenue net income aren't Gibralter pounds and you'll see that revenue appears because I've engine

85
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,770
in revenue I haven't answered any expenses yet.

86
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,050
Okay.

87
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,310
And I'll explain this more detail soon.

88
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,680
That's why net incomes are the same as the revenue which we're in the rabbit and cat.

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,690
And but you see revenue here and I just entered in the first five years.

90
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,440
Right.

91
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,820
So you see steady growth then for some reason it plateaus there.

92
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,920
And if I click here on the home and I scroll down you can see that that data is starting to populate

93
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,240
through here on your 1 pager as well.

94
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,750
Here at the okay it's not accurate yet because I have Tenterden expenses and other items but I just

95
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,810
wanted to show you that it appears here.

96
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,280
And also here it says Gibralter pounds at this rate and again and you can update that rate if you want

97
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,990
to by going to here.

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,960
And then just clicking directly one on that that thing there.

99
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,480
Okay.

100
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,090
Let's go back now to financials.

101
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,420
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to make this a bit wider for us so we can read the numbers

102
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,500
there is getting bigger in the second.

103
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,610
Okay.

104
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,660
So he can just go here and DoubleClick My take a second or two for it to open up.

105
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,300
But there you go.

106
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,730
Good.

107
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,850
And if you want you can get rid of decimals as well by going here highlight all the items and get rid

108
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,260
decimal system make it smaller if you want and every currency is difference.

109
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,380
It looks like this made a little bit too high that's fine.

110
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,180
But for now we're going to do and this is optional as you can enter in the number of returns you had

111
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,430
or hour or hours that were refunded if it's a services model.

112
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,970
OK.

113
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,910
I don't leave this blank for now but if you want you can do that actual and say hey we had a big product

114
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,050
recall that we see in a proxy we have shipped over here to put into a disaster scenario for a couple

115
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,300
of months over here.

116
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,630
We had a big product recall here.

117
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,480
And let's say that 100 units were returned.

118
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,990
And you're going to see the chaos this creates.

119
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,470
And for those of you that are creating a product.

120
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,720
Please be careful with inventory inventory can destroy a company for those as old as I am.

121
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:14,050
I remember when I was a kid in the 80s and Atari big video and company released this video game for

122
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:24,460
E.T. and it was the worst video game ever and they actually had to literally bury the Barry E.T. video

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,430
games bury the inventory in the deserts.

124
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,590
And it's interesting a lot of them are now big collectors and there it is that's what it looks like.

125
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,540
And I mention this I know it's a little bit off topic and nostalgic for me.

126
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,920
There's the box along with starburst.

127
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,440
I'm hungry for starburst but I'm showing this because inventory can destroy a company and I want to

128
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,480
impress upon you the fact that please be careful when it comes to inventory and only build stuff.

129
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,420
The second before you want to sell it.

130
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,990
And if you buy books from Amazon like paperbacks look on the last page of the paperback because it will

131
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,270
show the day that it was printed which is usually a day or two after you ordered it anyway.

132
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,730
So I will include just a disaster scenario here for a couple of a couple of months just for fun and

133
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,950
you'll see what that does to revenue and the company it could actually own almost bankrupted.

134
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,880
OK we're going to stop every 20 minutes.

135
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,660
All right.

136
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,330
Great.

137
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,840
So let's scroll down now.

138
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,930
And I provided another revenue line item for you Kate in case you wanted to add another revenue line

139
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,250
it totally up to you.

140
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,930
But I want to name this now.

141
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,630
Whatever product is you're selling.

142
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:40,180
So all right here just's VR goggles and that will get reflected everywhere as well.

143
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,160
Case It says here.

144
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,150
Now if your Go-Go's sees now the spark line it's all done for it's pretty cool.

145
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,060
And you can call it consulting hours if you want depending on kind of business you have.

146
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,040
And then right here this is an optional revenue line item and in here there's no math behind it if you

147
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,130
want you can creates insert a couple of rows whenever or just scroll them in the of the spreadsheet

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,700
and insert a couple of more calculations.

149
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,140
Let's say that we had a a services business model like a lot of software companies sell the product.

150
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:18,210
And then there's a services or maintenance line item sales code maintenance and then a lot of the time

151
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,290
it's 20 percent of revenue.

152
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,830
I'm just going to go up here actually and make it 20 percent of whatever I sold here I know it's not

153
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,020
perfect don't do it up here because it will create a circular reference because or don't do I should

154
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:37,580
say at the top here it will create a circular reference because it's is going to be this plus this next

155
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,620
revenue line every day.

156
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,820
But I'm going to make my maintenance 20 percent of my goggles revenue.

157
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,710
OK it's not perfect but a lot of business balls are like that.

158
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,580
OK so let's go up here and see you at my goggles revenue.

159
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:59,590
So 20 percent of $9900 is is this here Khalilah so I'll just do that or copy this formula all the way

160
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,420
across.

161
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,840
It's not perfect but I just want to basically appeal to everybody that's taken this course that would

162
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,780
also be a little bit different.

163
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,230
And I'm just going to highlight all these guys here.

164
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,520
Bear with me for a second.

165
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,180
Here

166
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,230
over here

167
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,980
and then here

168
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,710
cut and paste here the formula

169
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,980
great.

170
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,550
All right.

171
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:39,060
And that's this year is just December 2022 it's 20 percent of revenue line item 1 which in this hypothetical

172
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,560
example is this dude here which is the goggles 20 percent of that amount.

173
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Is that all right let's go back here we're now done with revenue completely.

174
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,430
OK.

175
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,210
And then we have to discuss the costs of revenue.

176
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,830
Now if you double click on any cell you can see what the math or logic is.

177
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:06,540
So this year total revenue is just that revenue line item one plus this revenue line item I'll get there

178
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,340
in a second I'm trying to scroll line item 2 down there.

179
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,740
That's all it is.

180
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:18,690
So I've got to have line as most you might have one and if you have one and not to then you can completely

181
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,050
ignore the second line item here by clicking that to hide it.

182
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,170
If you want but I don't include it so I'm going to unhide it now as well.

183
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,880
OK good.

184
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,650
All right.

185
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,640
Great.

186
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,490
We're now done with revenue and what I'll do is actually in the next lecture I'll talk about the cost

187
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,590
of revenue meaning how much it costs us to Bill one hour of our time meaning how much are you going

188
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:48,770
to pay your employees or how much it costs to make one of these products that we're selling for 9 bucks.

189
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,940
OK so and this will feed into our margin structure which I'll explain from scratch starting in the next

190
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,410
lecture.

191
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,790
Thanks.
