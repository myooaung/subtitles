00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,600
Welcome the step of the course where we'll discuss your go to market strategy which means how you will

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,640
reach your customers meaning.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,240
How do you distribute your products and or services in terms of the what why and how of Step 8 are kicked

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,410
off of the what.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,550
What are we going to learn.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:25,610
Well if a pluggable to your business model will talk about what our direct to consumer strategy is and

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,690
what that means is do we talk to the customer directly when we sell to them.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,780
Meaning there is no middleman.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,410
We will also discuss our indirect distribution strategy meaning if we sell the wholesale and then others

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,510
sell our products or service for us meaning that there is a middleman.

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,390
And also if a placable is always going to discuss our online sales distribution strategy our online

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,990
distribution strategy and other distribution topics.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,160
Let's move on to why.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:05,670
Why are we dedicating an entire section to the distribution of our product and or service because you

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,060
might realize that you might want to increase your revenue by selling through third parties instead

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,890
of through your own sales force distribution.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:22,080
And please note that we will discuss how your sales force is if a clickable is set up in Step nine when

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,610
we talk about sales and marketing.

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,150
Lastly how how are we going to complete.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,260
Step number eight.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,310
Meaning the go to market distribution part of our business plan will answer questions here in the inputs

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,490
and analysis tap Were you will notice that I included this large green shaded box here so I can humbly

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,820
challenge you to expand your thought process about how to distribute your product.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,000
