1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.590
We are making great progress so we're done with revenue now.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.450
And we spent a lot of time and revenue because with most line items in all financial models in all financial

3
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.080
statements the income saving bouncy cash flow etc. all that stuff is driven off of revenue.

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.520
Pretty much there are some exceptions.

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.760
So we have to revenue line items that we just discussed.

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.830
We have the goggles and the maintenance.

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.540
So we're going to move on now to discuss how much it costs to make the revenue and that's called the

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.350
cost of goods sold and we're going to focus on all other expenses in the company after this party is

9
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.340
done so after we talk about costs it's all then we'll talk about salaries and tons of other expenses

10
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.420
tons of them.

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.720
OK so let me scroll back up here for Coskata salt now.

12
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.420
I explain what gross margin is in a second and it's one of the formulas that we have to calculate which

13
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.910
will automatically be placed on our homescreen as well as on our report.

14
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.790
And there is I think there's four or five formulas we're going to use.

15
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.970
So cascode sold is the cost of making both products now.

16
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.330
If you only have one revenue line item and your model is more simplistic.

17
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.650
It should be for most people taking the course when you started a company usually only have one revenue

18
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.720
line item.

19
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.790
But I've included two here just to make it a little bit more advance in case some people have to read

20
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.960
the linages product and outsource and so let's first of all talk about cascode sold for the goggles

21
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.620
and if you double click this here you see that it just pulls in the revenue line item 1.

22
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.960
So cogs are costs get sold for B 13 and B 13 is VR goggles.

23
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.490
So again we're only talking about the cost to make the goggles right now so recall that in the previous

24
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.180
lecture we talked about the number of units that we sold and the price.

25
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.220
So we're going to pull that data down here when we calculate costs get sold.

26
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.210
Now if you just have a simple financial model and you don't have to multiply units times the cost to

27
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.540
make the product then just hard code right here meaning type over top.

28
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.950
But I've got another formula here just to make it a little bit more advanced.

29
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.270
Some people want to model this with and so the cost of goods sold.

30
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:36.520
The cost of goods sold for January 2019 for the goggles is a multiplication of how much it costs us

31
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.160
to manufacture one item times the number of units that we sold.

32
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.400
So if we scroll up here we can see that we're pulling in the number of units sold up here.

33
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.970
So in order to calculate the cost of goods sold for the goggles all I'm going to do is I'm going to

34
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.620
answer right here.

35
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:07.800
The cost to manufacture one to and automatically appear the caskets will be created which is going to

36
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.060
be the cost to manufacture the goggles times the number of units.

37
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.050
See 19 again.

38
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:24.020
So we know that it costs us or we sold the units for nine bucks each for the whole first year and a

39
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.110
lot of companies that just start out end up losing money for the first year or two sometimes longer.

40
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.090
I don't assume we're losing money on every single one of these we make just for the first year.

41
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.080
So let's assume for the first year and this is normal for a lot of startups.

42
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.780
So for the first year let's just assume that it's going to cost me ups.

43
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.710
I want to take that I want to go down here sorry.

44
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.350
I want to.

45
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.810
It's going to cost me 120 bucks to manufacture one.

46
00:03:49.990 --> 00:04:00.570
So when I hit enter or washer happens up here OK since we're making 100 units and we're we're selling

47
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.970
a hundred units in the first month and I'll go up here and show you where I got the data from 100 units.

48
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.460
And it costs us 9am we saw these weren't frightened by it but we made a hundred units and sold a hundred

49
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.730
units.

50
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.190
I should say in January of 2013.

51
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:23.500
And and what we did was it actually cost us a hundred twenty bucks to make each unit.

52
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.040
So the cost of goods sold for January of 2008 tene for the goggles is $12000.

53
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.900
The revenue for the goggles for that month is $9900.

54
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.100
So we're losing money.

55
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.720
We're losing money.

56
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.010
We're losing a lot of money that month.

57
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.610
And what I want to show you before I build out the rest of this line item is something called gross

58
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.860
margin and gross margin percent and so I want to explain this here in a little bit more more detail

59
00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.300
so we can look at the gross margin for the goggles only and don't get intimidated by models.

60
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.910
Just think of everything as one line as a matter of time it's a lot of fun this way.

61
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.310
It's like a little puzzle.

62
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:16.470
And so the gross margin is basically a calculation of the revenue minus the cost to make that stuff

63
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.090
divided by the revenue and higher is better.

64
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:33.210
And so in this example here our gross margins are negative 21 percent because revenue minus that divided

65
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.490
by revenue equals a negative number and so gross margin the higher the better the lower the worse obviously.

66
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.370
And I actually made a little chart I want to show you over here.

67
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.430
I included it in a couple of places in this presentation to some documents but I'm going to scroll over

68
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.940
here and you can ignore the stuff here is just this is where I calculated all the items where I pulled

69
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.110
it forward somewhere else.

70
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.300
Look if you want your call you can.

71
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.290
So if I were to scroll down here I want to show you this little chart.

72
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:15.460
And I put it all the way to the right of your sorry your gross margins case over over here so you can

73
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.310
always come here a little cheat sheet for the.

74
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.250
And so there's five items that we're going to look at when it comes to is one more below that.

75
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.400
When it when it comes to profitability.

76
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.810
OK.

77
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.210
So basically these ratios are going to show you will tell you how profitable is your company for every

78
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.470
$1 of stuff they sell.

79
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.880
So the gross margin is how much revenue you have minus the cost to make that product divided by revenue.

80
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.680
Okay that's a higher level margin perspective not as important as the next couple of line items.

81
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.810
After this and I'm going to only mention just briefly I'll come back to this later.

82
00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:02.290
But we're going to look at the operating margin which basically means how much what percent return we're

83
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:10.110
getting on running our company including almost all expenses and I'll make more sense.

84
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:17.980
And net profit margins the bottom line net income divided by revenue and then below that we have two

85
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.600
other things which are a little bit more advance.

86
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.580
And I can almost assure you that most people that read your business plan won't care about these line

87
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.050
items because your business models very young and we don't tend to look at the balance sheet cash flow

88
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.490
statement that much.

89
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.470
When you started a company it's more income statement but I'll mention it quickly so this is return

90
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.200
on assets which comes from your income statement and your balance sheet.

91
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.630
I'll explain that more later.

92
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:46.210
Which basically means how much money are we making for one dollar in assets we have and then return

93
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:52.640
equity is how much money are we making for every dollar an equity have.

94
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.470
And so here.

95
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.330
Think of it that way.

96
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.380
For every dollar in revenue how much operating profit are regenerating or for every dollar in revenue

97
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.770
here.

98
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.530
Also how much income are regenerating.

99
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.010
And it's all in present terms and this will make much more sense later.

100
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.940
But I wanna explain that you put that on your radar screen so to speak right now because if you scroll

101
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:21.030
down on the home page here you'll see it the data is being updated for you here.

102
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.090
So we've got revenue we already understand revenue here ignore net income for now because we haven't

103
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:33.470
insured all expenses yet but we've got revenue here and then we're going to have gross margin update

104
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:33.920
here.

105
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.570
Now I want you to ignore what gross margin you see here because that's for the whole year and we've

106
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.850
only done expenses for one month.

107
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.190
Okay let's go back.

108
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.260
Okay.

109
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:53.170
So we've only done one month for one product for the cost of goods sold so I'm going to assume that

110
00:08:53.170 --> 00:09:01.230
for the entire first year every month it's going to cost us 120 bucks to make each one of these units.

111
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.240
So we're obviously losing money because we're selling it for 9 bucks.

112
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.060
And then let's have some fun here and this is obviously all hypothetical.

113
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.900
But in year two let's just see what we're selling prices here.

114
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.030
We're selling it for 94 bucks each month.

115
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.270
It was Nine-Nine last year.

116
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.740
And year to year.

117
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.740
Ninety four bucks.

118
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.410
And I'm going to make our costs get sold come down a lot.

119
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.310
Let's just say that for some reason we got really efficient at making these things.

120
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:36.080
Maybe we we were we placed that big big order for lothsome and because the law of large numbers and

121
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.150
economies of scale is cheaper for us to make these I'm going to say that it's now 80 bucks to make one

122
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:48.030
obviously very hypothetical copy and I'll assume that's what it costs for the first year to make the

123
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.720
cut for the second year.

124
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.660
All right.

125
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.420
Reichlich special.

126
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:56.270
This is fun.

127
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.880
OK.

128
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.380
And then let's say that it costs us only 50 bucks.

129
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:10.080
To make one item and add a copy this year pay special

130
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.900
and then for this year we just have followed us Sumate cost us 20 bucks to make one.

131
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:31.580
The reason I'm showing these extreme declines here is I want to explain margin expansion to meaning

132
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.220
your profitability percent going up a lot and we'll look at those ratios couple those ratios and analyze

133
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:37.530
them.

134
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.430
Lady Tilson based on what I'm doing now

135
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:50.130
and just for fun let's assume it only costs us 10 bucks to make each pair of goggles by this year and

136
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:56.920
I mean Google makes those cardboard VR goggles so I'm sure those don't cost very much to make of our

137
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.080
hypothetical obviously.

138
00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.530
OK.

139
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:59.820
And this is the last year will do.

140
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.340
And then the quarterly stuff 2023 and beyond mostly the empty side.

141
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.350
We could build it out but I want to.

142
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.840
It'll take me forever to explain it.

143
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.690
Great.

144
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.160
Okay good.

145
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:18.460
Now let's go back and I want to close all these.

146
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.660
So we're going to look at stuff on an annual basis and we can see here at some of the annual Stouffer's

147
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.760
is his fund so and it's growing here.

148
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:33.410
So the cost to manufacture these items has gone down a lot.

149
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.140
OK.

150
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.980
It's pretty cool.

151
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.530
It's amazing.

152
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:43.430
And the spark lines that spark lines for annual spark lines for Coralee you can't see because I get

153
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.090
all this stuff.

154
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.080
But if you open up here you'll be able to see the spark lines for the Coralee stuff as well.

155
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:55.250
And the yearly stuff when you open these up and please make sure that you open all of these by hitting

156
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.470
to open everything and hit it open everything this way.

157
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:05.210
Because later on if you don't then some of your charts will not update properly because Excel can't

158
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.990
really see hidden stuff all the time.

159
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.230
A little bit of a off topic there sorry but OK great.

160
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.230
So we're now done with the cost of goods sold for the goggles.

161
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.570
We have one more thing we want to do now here for you for maintenance.

162
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.150
Ok for the Costco It's all then I shall show you one more quick little thing here before we go there.

163
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:29.960
So let's check out how our gross margin for the goggles changes.

164
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.390
OK.

165
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.420
So watch what happens.

166
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.570
It's negative gross margins here.

167
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.770
Right we're losing money we make them.

168
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:40.180
And then by January 2019 had taken speaking we're actually making money on them.

169
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.020
Right because it costs us 80 bucks to make one.

170
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.850
If you scroll up we sold each for like ninety four dollars and 10 cents.

171
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.880
And that means that if you take ninety four dollars and 10 cents minus the cost to make it which is

172
00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:02.450
80 bucks divided by ninety four dollars and ten cents that equals 15 percent so our gross margins are

173
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.790
now positive at 15 percent.

174
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.340
Watch this leverage just rocks.

175
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:12.170
This is doper's as people would say then you'll see here gross margins went negative but for only three

176
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.300
months what is going on there for months.

177
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.570
Why is that negative.

178
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:22.230
Well before I showed you E.T. and making too much inventory and whatever.

179
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.630
So this was disastrous because what happened in these four months.

180
00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:32.630
I think the thing is we had a lot of returns maybe there was a defect in the product.

181
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.480
So I don't remember that but for the previous lectures I had here.

182
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.560
These are the units that were returned see returned we had returns for four months so we had 100 units

183
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.410
that were returned each month.

184
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:50.410
In these four months here and let's see how many units we actually made

185
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:54.880
here.

186
00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:01.510
So of the 330 units in May of 9900 were returned 100 hundred hundred.

187
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:08.950
So for example here although we sold 319 is August 19 we got returns for 100.

188
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.720
So only 290 people kept units.

189
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.930
The others return it for whatever reason and that is a disaster.

190
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:17.360
OK.

191
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:25.040
So but it's okay though because those are only four months and we fixed the production and addressed

192
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.040
that issue and now we go to September 2013 there is no returns.

193
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.440
We're back 15 percent margins.

194
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.810
Okay good gross margins Let's keep going.

195
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:40.380
So for the whole year 719 you see our margins are 6 percent that's gross margins for just the goggles.

196
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:47.700
If we go back to 2008 for the whole year they were negative 21 percent because we lost my audience but

197
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.430
we wanted to get 15 percent gross margin for the entire year for the second year here but we didn't

198
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.220
get it because we had negative gross margin because the returns for four months there had 6 percent.

199
00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.400
This is where leverage kicks in.

200
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.320
This is where it gets exciting.

201
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:10.050
Now in January 2020 our gross margins are 37 percent because it only costs us 50 bucks to manufacture

202
00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.090
the goggles.

203
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.960
But wait there's more.

204
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.700
It gets better because watch this the year after that.

205
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.290
Our margins are 71 percent which is amazing.

206
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.480
Because only cost is 20 bucks to make each one.

207
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.110
And even though the price for selling all those four came down a bunch.

208
00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.290
I'll show you here.

209
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:36.250
We're incredibly profitable because the cost to make it went down a lot as well so we're selling them

210
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:41.290
for 69 bucks them in this month and this year.

211
00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:46.920
But it's only costing us 20 bucks to make each one so the gross margin goes through the roof.

212
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.470
It's amazing.

213
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.280
It's awesome.

214
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.330
OK.

215
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.620
So 71 percent gross margins.

216
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:59.790
And in the software industry for example your gross margins can be well over 95 percent because distribution

217
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.780
of software costs you nothing.

218
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.510
People just download over the Internet or they they buy it on CDs or whatever.

219
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.650
Actually they don't do that anymore.

220
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.670
That just dated me there.

221
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.290
Sorry we site mentioned floppy disk.

222
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:11.250
All right.

223
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.850
So gross margins now for the next year because I'm in Iraq so I stop.

224
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.280
81 percent gross margins for that one product.

225
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.980
Good okay.

226
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.400
And then I didn't do the quarterly stuff here or the annual stuff later.

227
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:25.840
OK.

228
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.710
And you'll notice here that you see how it gets wider.

229
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:37.780
It's because we have all these these ungrouped look at and you can always flag something if you want

230
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.970
as I explained before in this I let them go back though.

231
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.390
OK.

232
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.880
So what we're now done with the cost of goods sold for that one product.

233
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.840
Now we're into the cost of goods sold for the other item.

234
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.620
So the cost to look at the costs gets sold now for maintenance.

235
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:56.880
Okay.

236
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.450
And there's no formula here but this a lot of times what happens if if if you sell a product and then

237
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.320
you charge 20 percent maintenance per year.

238
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.970
That's pretty normal and the margin structure on maintenance is usually pretty high and it can be technical

239
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.030
supports or whatever it is or free downloads of patches whatever.

240
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.450
If it's if it's a tech products.

241
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.350
Or you can make this just a services line item to a consulting So you sell a product and you have consulting

242
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.350
so we're going to merge.

243
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:31.560
We're going to have to line items here one is if you want you can think of this as a billable consulting

244
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.000
hours or just mean.

245
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.400
So let me just keep it simple though.

246
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:40.220
So recall that maintenance for us.

247
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:46.710
I want to show you how we calculate this so maintenance was basically 20 percent of the product and

248
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.120
that's that's kind of normal for a lot of industries.

249
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:57.950
So we charge our customers 20 percent of what they paid every single year for product maintenance.

250
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.720
All hypothetical of course and let's assume that the maintenance is basically just software downloads

251
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.620
updates for them.

252
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.630
And you think of this subscription if you want to whatever.

253
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:13.040
And what you want to do is I'm going to make the cost of goods sold for maintenance and you'll see it

254
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.800
this is just pulled directly from up there.

255
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.220
The word maintenance is here.

256
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.320
So if you enter a different line item it'll be pulled here.

257
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.850
And I also had that it filled in here automatically for whatever my name it's called.

258
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:31.850
So let's assume that it only cost us 5 percent for the cost.

259
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.220
It's for me.

260
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.040
So I going to go equals

261
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:45.870
our maintenance item here times zero point zero five five percent.

262
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.310
That's a wonderful margin structure.

263
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:54.190
Ninety five percent gross margins here you see that and recall all of that.

264
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.630
Is is Miss club it seems a bit more and you could follow this logic here if you want as well.

265
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:11.260
All this is is the revenue from maintenance minus the cost of providing that maintenance or whatever

266
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.970
item line item this is divided by the revenue for maintenance.

267
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.830
Look here.

268
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.510
And please don't memorize this stuff.

269
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:22.220
Understand if you understand it you'll never forget it and it's much more fun to.

270
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.910
So we've got that margin profile here.

271
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.440
Ninety five percent is amazing.

272
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.920
So I think going fast forward bowed down is going to make this 5 percent of maintenance every single

273
00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:42.910
month for the next five years so fast forward to.

274
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:43.810
Okay great.

275
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:49.930
So we kept the gross margin for maintenance at 95 percent for all five years

276
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.100
and we can now look at the blended or total gross margins for both Lance.

277
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.580
So here's that right here.

278
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.940
Here's the total cost console for both line items.

279
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.640
Okay.

280
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.520
And I put it in English terms up here if you care so.

281
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:17.450
Total cost goods sold is the cost revenue line item one plus the cost or of Coskata off it and line

282
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.030
item to right here.

283
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:25.980
And recall you can always go right here and go to every single line item which is pretty powerful.

284
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.250
So if I hear me just go to that its like no.

285
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:33.930
So if I were to go here you could scroll down to financials look at all this stuff.

286
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.980
So amazing.

287
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.130
So a lot of these guys we haven't talked about yet but we'll get their ICCA great.

288
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:46.820
So if I went here watch this total financials and put total cogs is that line item there.

289
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:53.680
And this is just financial input cogs for reading to line item 1 plus cogs for line item 2 and you can

290
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.920
double click and get it color coded if you care you can go up here at whatever 60 percent of what Okay

291
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.880
great down here sorry.

292
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.540
Yes you see that the blue line that plus the red line color coded recall is great.

293
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:13.830
And the blended gross margin this is gross margins for both products.

294
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:21.690
So the math of this is just total revenue minus told old that total revenue thats total cost get sold

295
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.820
and total revenue is up there.

296
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.940
Its color coded as well and you can zoom out if you want as well.

297
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.180
I don't have the best I say anymore I apologize but you can do that if you want to be able to see the

298
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.550
blended mathematics from a higher level perspective in your model.

299
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.000
So the total gross margin were negative for the first year so we're actually losing money on making

300
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.760
the product and we haven't even accounted for for salaries and R&amp;D and other expenses which we'll do

301
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.560
in the next election.

302
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.860
But you can see our total gross margins was negative 1 percent and then it started getting more positive.

303
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.740
And I'm going to close all this just to show you the annual numbers so we can see the force and the

304
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.750
trees Okay.

305
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.630
So and again ignore the spark lines here because and this one too because it's just the change over

306
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.620
year and because we close all these these boxes here.

307
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.340
These these were relying on annual basis now.

308
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.120
They'll.

309
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.370
This or it change that's why you will see it there it's fine actually.

310
00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:21.970
So we got an 81 percent here for 2013 the next year 20 percent gross margins 47 76 85.

311
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.720
Investment bankers love to see that.

312
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:31.670
And if this happens to your company and your company makers will be begging you to go public do an IPO.

313
00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.260
That's why we have the exit strategy in our business.

314
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:34.640
All right.

315
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.020
And so here we have the total cost of goods sold.

316
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.110
And then the year over year change.

317
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:47.450
So we're now we're now done with the cost of goods sold and so in the next lecture what I'll do is we're

318
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:53.210
going to continue now and talk about the other things that come into expenses when you're creating financial

319
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.580
statements so we already cover the costs of goods sold.
