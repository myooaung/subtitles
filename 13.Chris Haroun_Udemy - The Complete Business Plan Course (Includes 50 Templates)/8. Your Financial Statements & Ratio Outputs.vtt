1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.630
Please click on the button called all L-L to go to the outputs for the financial section.

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.500
So we're done completing all the financials.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.740
And please click this little option here to mark all of Step 12 as complete and as always you'll see

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.300
that this updates here to 100 percent and this updates here.

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.990
We have one flag added Just as an example.

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.720
And by the way you can always go back here and then find out where your flag was.

7
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.980
So I have it right here and we can always scroll wherever to the right and flag that if if we wanted

8
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.450
to I'll just leave it like that for now it's fine.

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.120
So let me now click on all to go back all right.

10
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.160
All right.

11
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.560
So we have made incredible progress we're now 86 percent done which is great.

12
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.920
The appendix is going to be really easy and the final output is the amazing part I love it.

13
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.530
It's fun.

14
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.300
OK.

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.490
So this here is just informational for now and this is the stuff that we're going to put into our business

16
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.850
plan.

17
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.540
This will make a lot more sense once we get it done here.

18
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.040
And so if we scroll down we'll just see all the information that we've already talked about.

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.450
And here's just a little warning to please open up all of the ones and twos on all of these tabs here

20
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.810
so we can see all the information here properly.

21
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.630
And so here we see the first page in our business plan which which will look like this for financials.

22
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.890
And let me actually go here and show you what it's going to look like once we assemble the final thing.

23
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.010
So I'm going to scroll down to where is it financials down here.

24
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.920
Well here you could get.

25
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.140
So if I click here it's going to look like this.

26
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.970
And I set it up so that when we copy and paste it you won't see any outlines.

27
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.320
So sometimes you'll see a on here and I'll come back to the top in a second.

28
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.430
But sometimes you'll see little white borders that are that are kind of changed around the final output

29
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.080
in the business plan part you'll see that the white bleeds over here a bit more.

30
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.520
And this make a lot more sense later.

31
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.290
So if you were to click here on the business plan output you'll notice that there's a little bit more

32
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.260
white boxes in the side.

33
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.030
So the copy paste special works best.

34
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.570
But don't worry about that ex-spy.

35
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.870
I'll explain that a lot more detail when we do the business plan.

36
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.200
Final output leisure.

37
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.770
So if we scroll down we'll see here that we have all the data that was brought over.

38
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.340
And if you click on the home button that data is already pie plate here is well if we were to scroll

39
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.370
down.

40
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.840
I mean just get a little bit more real estate here.

41
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.950
Good.

42
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.160
So all of your data if you don't answer them will automatically be updated here.

43
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.640
And lo and behold we have our information updated here directly.

44
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.840
And if I most over here can see it now.

45
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.560
It's I guess I have to really scrolling closely to see that number.

46
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.990
That's fine.

47
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.280
Does matter let's go back here to all.

48
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.380
OK.

49
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.620
And if you wanted to you can click here on one Ill take couple of seconds update but I'm going into

50
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.340
anyway.

51
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.480
And we'll just condense everything on this slide takes a second there you go.

52
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.420
So here's what's on the slide.

53
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.420
It's got all that information from.

54
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.790
We're going to put in our final business plan here.

55
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.600
You got the revenue net income highlights page financial ratios.

56
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.730
Then we've got revenue numbers from the RSV.

57
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.970
Then we've got operating expense stuff that we've got the income statement and the balance sheet and

58
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.440
the cash flow statement.

59
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.460
So let me just expand all of this.

60
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.680
I'll take a second.

61
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.050
As you can see I've got the update here.

62
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.550
Hundred percent done in that little home.

63
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.960
But if you want to go back and you can't find out where you are give it a second update.

64
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.660
Come on.

65
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.930
So

66
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.610
all we have to click to hear sorry about.

67
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.550
All right.

68
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.370
It's come through.

69
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.930
Okay good.

70
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.010
And that chart will show up in a second it's calculating.

71
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.740
Here we go.

72
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.770
So this will be the first page our business plan and I'll explain exactly how to copy and paste all

73
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.930
this stuff over again.

74
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.590
Once we click on this button here later on and do the lecture or associate with it.

75
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.350
So we got revenue net income and we don't really show much information on balance sheet or cash flow

76
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.520
statement ratios because usually with early stage starts you don't care as much.

77
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.020
But I have included all the information anyway for you right here.

78
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.170
So if you're curious how all these virtual ratios are and this is the second page and here we've got

79
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.580
financial ratios we've got gross margins operating margins net profit margins which we talked about

80
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.470
and return assets to bring home equity equities.

81
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.880
I mean did I create this little cheat sheet here for you.

82
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.340
It's just a little image and I explain what all the ratios here mean and the best way to think about

83
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.370
it is how profitable is your company for every one dollar and stuff that you sell.

84
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.010
And we talked about gross margin for every dollar of products that we make and sell.

85
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.370
This is going to be our margins before all the major expenses here then operating margins which people

86
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.840
call on margins as well.

87
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.170
So I think is going to be operating profit over revenue and member this doesn't end for you but that

88
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.720
margins we get rid of depreciation non-cash expenses then net profit margins is the very bottom line

89
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.310
of your income statement that it can divide a very top line because the rabbit higher is better obviously

90
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.920
for all this stuff.

91
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.430
So you get the bottom line on an income statement.

92
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.680
When people say what your bottom line.

93
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.380
Well the bottom line of the same is that income what your top line.

94
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.490
That's revenue the top.

95
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.100
Then you've got return assets for every one dollar in assets we generate this much in income.

96
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.510
So 99 percent that's pretty damn good.

97
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.070
Percent basis and for every $1 in equity we generate that much.

98
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.890
So.

99
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.940
Again I put in dummy data for all that stuff and not for the tenth year which is right here OK.

100
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.030
So this will be the second page of our business plan output which will look like this is page 1.

101
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.930
This is page 2.

102
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.700
And I tagged it as well and you'll see why.

103
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.800
But if you were to take this copy and paste in here please expand this.

104
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.010
It will take us directly to where that is al-Shehri for fun actually is going to here to take a second

105
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.100
to go there but this is going to jump see here.

106
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.820
So this jumps into the business plan output and that's how we know it highlights here and you see how

107
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.660
there's there's there's I got rid of the border here and over here as well.

108
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:25.010
Don't worry about that just because when you copy and paste special into from Excel into Word this this

109
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.220
kind of mess things up a bit.

110
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.750
So don't worry about a minute just the easy way for you to understand that I'll show you that more detail

111
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.580
once we're there.

112
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.980
OK.

113
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.430
Back to the all page which is why it's green.

114
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.540
Look at all that.

115
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.860
Hundred percent.

116
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.030
That's what I'm talking aboot tactic.

117
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.660
All right.

118
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.560
So we've got the second page done here.

119
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.540
That chart will show in a second there we go.

120
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.300
Gross margins operating margins.

121
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.660
And again that's you little cheat sheet.

122
00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:03.550
And if we scroll down here here we got Page 3 on page 3 we've got these here net profit margins return

123
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.150
assets and I threw out return equity there.

124
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:13.450
And again if we go back here that is going to appear on the third page you're right there and we'll

125
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.710
address if you zoom in closely and it doesn't look that great we'll address that later.

126
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.970
Don't We're all pretty that up for you.

127
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.070
All right.

128
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:28.050
Now on the next page and I'll explain exactly how to do this in great detail over here.

129
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.950
But I want to show you here it's informational page 4 is going to be D and this this information is

130
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.430
all directly based on what we created nothing is hardcoded it's all linked nicely.

131
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.970
It's awesome.

132
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.090
So on the fourth page we're going to have over here this is going to be our monthly revenue.

133
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.510
Okay.

134
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.970
And we'll we'll justify this and open these up a little bit more when we're on the final business plan

135
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:50.340
and page.

136
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.480
You can see all the data I can.

137
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.960
And so this is one picture.

138
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.610
It's monthly revenue for 2018 and it pulls all the information over.

139
00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:58.930
Okay.

140
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.230
So just the first year.

141
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.960
Monthly revenue for 2018.

142
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.120
Remember we had this is just the revenue numbers here so we've got the VR goggles here in that hypothetical

143
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.210
example.

144
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.770
And then we've got here the maintenance costs are seven second revenue line.

145
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.890
And all the stuff.

146
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.060
If you DoubleClick is stuck on showing here it's actually linked directly back to the inputs for financials

147
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.100
page which we talked about in detail in the previous couple lectures.

148
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.750
Okay great.

149
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.500
And you can look at the percent changes and whatnot it's pretty cool.

150
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.910
I love looking at things on a percent year over year month over month quarter on quarter basis.

151
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:43.940
Speaking of quarterly the next page here Musco here is Page 5 of the financials business plan.

152
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.440
So here you have a monthly revenue.

153
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.610
And you'll be able to change this as well and make it you know sideways if you want to.

154
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.000
We'll cover all that later.

155
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.840
Okay if you can't read it.

156
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.850
I think that's fine like that.

157
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.160
So we're going to have the quarterly revenue forecast and this is tagged as well.

158
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.740
Okay.

159
00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.720
And the Annual is well what's way.

160
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.710
Okay great.

161
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.950
And I'll explain all this stuff later.

162
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.990
You could put on one page or two it doesn't really matter.

163
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.770
But this is just pulled directly.

164
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.550
This is on a quarterly basis.

165
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:16.430
So when we did everything monthly before but this here just takes it makes a quarterly.

166
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:23.500
Okay and here we have one line and the second line and and both these are add up to that amount up there.

167
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.150
So you don't hear something there and live you will only have one Raban line item so you might even

168
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:36.070
want to later on I going to show you in the final present in the final business plan here how to hide

169
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.240
this or we actually need to hide it we're going to copy and paste just the first part.

170
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.210
The first revenue line item and not the rest of it.

171
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.710
This makes more sense to you though when we get there get here you got annual for all years.

172
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.900
Remember we didn't do the last five years.

173
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:55.370
In our example we did for one is that 2009 we go back and fix that.

174
00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:04.660
And I want to teach actually how to go back quickly so you can hit option or command in the open and

175
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.750
close square brackets and that will bring you exactly over here to where all this stuff is is linked

176
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.590
from to where it links to.

177
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.330
So I'm going to stay with you in real time.

178
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.920
And if you want you can fast forward to this part here to skip over how I'm going to try to resolve

179
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.820
this issue.

180
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.050
OK.

181
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:28.570
I want to show you how we're going to work through this so that you know how to jump quickly so fast

182
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.190
forward if you want to skip what I'm about to do.

183
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:39.130
This is here actually on this page so I'm going to go open square brackets jump there ha.

184
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.140
So it's pulling the air from here.

185
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.370
But this is like somewhere else we're going to go command option control whatever works for you and

186
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.390
a win is a little different.

187
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.730
And I'm going to go the open square brackets jump there directly

188
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.850
I don't know where I'm going to go back and forth.

189
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.510
So Year Nine and this year links back somewhere else.

190
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:06.160
So I'm going to go command open square brackets to jump to this

191
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.820
and right here.

192
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.990
Looks like I hardcoded to here instead of linking directly.

193
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.630
OK.

194
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.640
So anyway to drag this over there.

195
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.330
Nash go to those 26.

196
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.660
It's going to be real good.

197
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.670
Great.

198
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.230
So that was hard coded there.

199
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.870
No it's not.

200
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.800
It's actually linked back.

201
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.320
I'm going to go in and open square brackets slink back to where it was great.

202
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:32.840
OK.

203
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.440
So link to here now.

204
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.380
All right let's get back on track.

205
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.380
Go back to all.

206
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.340
So use that commands an open and square bracket close to her back.

207
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.420
Ill jump back to where you were before.

208
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:52.290
And I love to have everything in just one centralized location so it's easy from version history perspective.

209
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.260
OK great.

210
00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:02.600
So we've got monthly revenue quarterly revenue annual revenue monthly expenses and these ones here.

211
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.730
I can tell you how to hide that later what we'll do is we'll copy everything up until that cell.

212
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.900
And if you namely something else will appear here.

213
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:17.050
And this is just as Junee and I got R&amp;D in the bottom depreciation and then here you've got this is

214
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.730
just an annual operating expense report.

215
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:27.990
If we go back here and you revenant annual operating income annual operating income expense forecast

216
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.850
and then we've cut here quarter income statement annual income statement Coralee balance sheet and your

217
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.730
balance sheet cash flow of Corley cash for emule.

218
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.610
And then we are done with that section.

219
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.770
Let me just scroll the I'm sure the rest.

220
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.520
Okay.

221
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:51.550
Is our quarterlies and these are just the rest those page I just showed you page 8 and Page 9 page 10

222
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.460
and that is it's and 0 6 I had page 11 as well.

223
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.030
Okay good.

224
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.100
Okay there's more.

225
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.510
There's so much in this it's amazing.

226
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.820
All right 13 pages there you go 13 pages.

227
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.510
Lucky 13.

228
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:07.850
Great.

229
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.180
All right so we click that we're done with this.

230
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:16.210
And so we're almost done man almost done and we could go back with top you guys.

231
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.030
All right.

232
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.130
And we are almost done.

233
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.850
Okay great.

234
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.240
So I will see you in the next lecture when we will talk about the appendix inputs.

235
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:25.580
Thanks.
