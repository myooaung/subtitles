1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.660
All right we're making great progress.

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.280
Please click here on inputs and analysis for Step 4.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.070
This is my favorite part of the Course.

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.430
This is where we discuss our management team in a lot of detail and we find out where the gaps are with

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.400
our skill set and how to plug or address those gaps and so there's a lot going on here so I'm going

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.770
to make a little bit more room real estate wise up here by clicking this if you want you can minimize

7
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.880
this as well.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.900
Take a second or two for that too to get smaller.

9
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.960
Or you can click here to get more room on the spreadsheet.

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.190
All right.

11
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.310
So first question here is basically it's it's asking you what your employee recruiting strategy is and

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.630
the more thorough you are with this section the more chance or a higher chance you'll have of making

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.350
the reader of your business plan really happy or potentially investing or just having a more favorable

14
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.940
outlook in general and a lot of these questions are optional.

15
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.720
You don't have to answer them.

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.530
But I recommend doing so.

17
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.980
Cath and the whole goal of this business plan process is to answer every single question every kind

18
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.670
of investor.

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.210
Ever think about asking us because it really reflects positively upon us and shows how thoughtful we

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:25.010
are with our whole process and gives our reader better a better confidence in our ability to execute

21
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.270
you know ideas are commodities.

22
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.210
Execution is not as Mark Cuban who once famously said so so the reason that management is here and not

23
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.640
way later on is because a lot of the best investors know that a great company comes down to a great

24
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.040
managed team first and everything else.

25
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.330
It doesn't really matter.

26
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.590
Relatively speaking OK.

27
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.220
So let's jump right in.

28
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.380
So the employee recruiting strategy how do you recruit employees if you want to you can read my answer

29
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.510
and write something similar with your own spin to it.

30
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.560
Obviously Next up we've got employee retention strategy.

31
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.460
I mean how are you going to deal with potential turnover and how you can incentivize people so that

32
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.600
everybody works together as a team.

33
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.250
You might talk about stock options here if applicable.

34
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.760
OK.

35
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.490
And so as always enter your answers please here in the white box and I wrote here and this is just kind

36
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.010
of informational Did you look at the profiles of the competition's employees on LinkedIn or in other

37
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.100
web sites in general even on the company's own Web site if you can get it there.

38
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.870
What do you think about the skills that your competitors employees have when when you look to build

39
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.790
out your team or articulate what your team has skill wise.

40
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.710
And this is going to help us a lot more with the questions that we have below.

41
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.650
Okay.

42
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.790
It's this part is kind of tricky because you have to humbly criticize yourself and your management team

43
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.820
and people that work with you to find out what the weaknesses are because I promise you that anybody

44
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.910
that's going to seriously consider investing in your company or partnering with you etc. that's reading

45
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.460
this business plan we'll have those questions anyway or those thoughts.

46
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.800
And if you kind of nip it in the bud early on then we will be able to deal with those gaps.

47
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.130
I'll explain how in a second.

48
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.810
Okay.

49
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.720
So I'd given your strengths.

50
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.980
Again this is all fictional stuff here.

51
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.010
I did not get in the HB.

52
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.270
That's Harvard Business School and two thirds of HB is b.s. by the way.

53
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.170
But I wrote it down there even though I rejected it.

54
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.480
All right.

55
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:41.640
So I wrote down what my weaknesses are and this is just weaknesses of Tony shark or sample entrepreneurs

56
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.470
here.

57
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.180
What's your job title.

58
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.610
And this is for you.

59
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.100
So I'm assuming you're CEO and founder co-founder and here is where we write about our employees.

60
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.820
OK.

61
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.430
So our first employee.

62
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.740
OK.

63
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.280
So I pulled this directly over from what we wrote in in the beginning part of the Course here.

64
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.570
All right.

65
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.200
So I wrote down Scarlett Johansson or hand-wrote and sorry sorry.

66
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.700
There are lawyers listening.

67
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.370
I it's housecarl Joseph Knot's Carl transend and I clicked it and I went back to where I wrote that.

68
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.240
Isn't that pretty cool.

69
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.880
Pulls effen there and the logic and what you see in your cells will look different because you have

70
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.160
different employee names.

71
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.770
If you have employees at all.

72
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.740
OK so let me click here to go back.

73
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.600
Or I can actually go over here to go directly there to step 4.

74
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.720
And I like clicking here because sometimes it can get lost in the document.

75
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.280
How.

76
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.310
So if I click this it always jumps back to the top.

77
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.820
OK.

78
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.820
So if you ever lost way way down here click that goes back to the top.

79
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.050
If you don't want to jump back to the top the tab and you can just click these tabs down here.

80
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.830
OK.

81
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.240
All right let's go back down here to where we had scarlet.

82
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.240
Hint hint Jozen for example.

83
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.440
And you can click here to go back to where you entered in information about these employees so this

84
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.250
person here used to be married to Scarlett Henchoz hurts Johanson Ryan Reynolds.

85
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.370
But I'm using Ryan Reynolds by the way.

86
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.100
But if you click here it goes back to where we entered in this employee's information right here.

87
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.080
OK.

88
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.510
No more jumping around Chris.

89
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.870
I'll get right down to it.

90
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.290
And Ryan Reynolds by the way is a fellow Canadian acap.

91
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.060
Then you have to write down what the strengths are and weaknesses of all your employees.

92
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.940
If you have employees and if you don't have employees then this box here is going to tell you to please

93
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.490
scroll down and ignore that question OK this logic based on whether or not you wrote the name of somebody

94
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.250
here on this previous tab I clicked that by Access sorry.

95
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.340
Let me go back here.

96
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.420
The older I get the better I was.

97
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.900
Here we go.

98
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.730
I know I use that joke too much.

99
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.390
OK.

100
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.770
And these are just you write in the title for each employee if you have entered employees earlier so

101
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.780
scarlet and Joe since title is Vice President of Sales and Marketing your title or my title in this

102
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.010
case there are 20 sharks as CEO and founder.

103
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.650
And this is just dummy data pulled directly from that previous or this is just Armide I'm sorry that

104
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.890
I entered in strength to weaknesses too I can't spell as you can see.

105
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.690
So Ryan Reynolds title is this entry in your tiles there.

106
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.480
And then just go all the way down and if you have people that is that you know that are filling those

107
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.710
roles again everybody is different when they when they write these business plans.

108
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:48.270
OK so I wrote down a couple of other sample titles here and if you enter in sample titles real tiles

109
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.690
I should say then you will see them appear in the next part here and I'll show you that there's a lot

110
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.250
going on here but a lot of fun too.

111
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:05.540
OK so for example here if I click here you'll see that it's got here the name of the person in the title

112
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.400
and that title is populated here.

113
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.680
If you entered in on that previous tap.

114
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.280
OK.

115
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.990
So for here because they entered into a bunch of sample employees they appear here and that's your sample

116
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.430
name here.

117
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.150
But I don't see any titles because you read them yet.

118
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.380
In the previous tab and you haven't written in the BIOS either yet.

119
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.340
I'll get to that in a second.

120
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.940
OK.

121
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.220
But whatever employee I select here the buyer is automatically going to be pulled through here.

122
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:39.000
So if I go to Ryan Reynolds and I click that it pulls in Ryan Reynolds and his sample bio there that

123
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.850
picture doesn't change.

124
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.550
OK.

125
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.750
Let's go back to Seow there.

126
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.570
Let's just it.

127
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.510
Let's go back to inputs now for management.

128
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.000
And so enter all that in.

129
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.330
And once you have entered it in the strengths and weaknesses in the titles of every employee.

130
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.180
And again it will be pulled over here automatically for you.

131
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:09.500
So Syria could then again by accident but once you do that these fields here will be populated for you.

132
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:15.260
And if you have an engine and names for those employees and click on this again which I want to for

133
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.640
all your employees this is the ninth employee for example.

134
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.170
Then what happens is if you don't click on it this field will look different it'll say please skip this

135
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.920
question.

136
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.700
OK.

137
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.780
OK.

138
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:34.560
And then for this question here based on your answer above do you think there are any gaps in the skill

139
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.000
sets of the people on your team including yourself.

140
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.430
Okay so what are you missing.

141
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:45.240
And this is important because again whoever is reading this document will uncover that anyway or might

142
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.680
think that you want to be preemptive it's the son suing the art of war one liner.

143
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.300
It's kind of cheesy but every Battlezone enforcement thought you want to be preemptive and just anticipate

144
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.210
what questions that readers might have.

145
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.990
And remember who your target reader is on this business plan.

146
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.270
OK.

147
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:08.860
And you can click here to go and change your target reader is back in step one so fun I can play with

148
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.170
those.

149
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.940
This all in itself is neat.

150
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.880
All right.

151
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.120
And I didn't answer all these questions.

152
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.240
It would have been just a dummy day anyway.

153
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:22.490
But based on your answer to that previous question meaning what the gaps are that you might have a good

154
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:28.460
idea of which kind of people you want to hire or bring on to your teams that will fill those gaps.

155
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.090
Okay.

156
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.940
And and what I'd like to personally do I run a pretty lean company always I always have very few employees

157
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.250
and I outsource a ton of stuff whenever I'm not good at.

158
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.700
I outsource if I don't believe that it makes sense to have somebody come in in-house and work with me.

159
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.930
I outsource a lot of stuff.

160
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.690
It's part of my whole whatever lean methodology you teach their own.

161
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.330
OK.

162
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.300
OK.

163
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.070
So you can read that.

164
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.540
OK here's where it gets fun.

165
00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:03.680
Ok now that we know what skills we need to add we can start to network to get people to be on our board

166
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.920
of advisors.

167
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:11.390
And so what I recommend doing is if you want to download a book I wrote on how to network and I promise

168
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.950
you I put my reputation on the line.

169
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.550

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.680
So you can go to Hoeren ventures dot com that's all lowercase slash actually is the home page Harroun

171
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.500
venture's dot com all lowercase and you can download a book there you'll see called networking and it's

172
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.200
over 200 pages and there's a couple of hours of free YouTube videos it's all free.

173
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.600

174
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.380
OK.

175

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.610
You can go here like how to get mentors in when you watch this.

It's a really cool methodology and simple way I have here I can meet with any CEO and so can you.

180
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.390
So can you just watch that video if you care to learn about that.

How do you get free publicity.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.370
This will help you with your marketing strategy a lot.

183
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.330
A lot of this is just you know side no details on what to do to help you.

184
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.050
What is the board.

185
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.830
How does that work.

186
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.370
You can click there and learn more about that as well.

187
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.270
How do you save money with taxes with your business.

188
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.830
All that stuff there's there's a lot a lot of cool stuff in here that I've learned through failure over

189
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.030
the years that I really think can help you how to motivate people on your team.

190
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:40.010
What are venture capitalists doing all that stuff to do before your next meeting.

191
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.080
It'll just help actually.

192
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.560
Please watch this if you get a chance because it'll help you a lot before you meet with anybody in business.

193
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.880
I promise you your promise.

194
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.610
OK.

195
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.910
And this is part of I create a blog every day and I promised my students I would do it every day for

196
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.860
the next 10 years.

197
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.970
And because I said it I have to do it now just like my weekly webcast if you want to join me ask questions

198
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.100
about your business model.

199
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:05.300
I'm doing it every Thursday for a couple of hours every Thursday at a minimum every single week for

200
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.060
ever.

201
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.260
It's all it.

202
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:15.170
I want to help you cut in so when you think about border advisers and you want to add them and you start

203
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.320
setting up these networking meetings using the methodology I taught in my book.

204
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:27.620
Just just remember that people that maybe are older and you have a similar background or and that are

205
00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.000
even more successful than you are because they're old and you whatever they want to help you you just

206
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.990
have to ask them.

207
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:37.490
And so do an advanced search on LinkedIn if you want to actually do that.

208
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.990
Go to LinkedIn with you here.

209
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.210
And again we go to LinkedIn to show you how to network.

210
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.980
I have this set up so that all these different tabs open up so I can send my daily blog and all these

211
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.130
different places whatever.

212
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.780
So I'll just go here to let's go to Linked-In

213
00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:02.280
it so here what you can do in LinkedIn if you want is you can search for people that are connected to

214
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.530
you or not connect to you a lot of times they use second degree meaning people that are going to be

215
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.990
meeting people that I'm not connected to.

216
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.080
And I'll do a search on people that have something in common with me.

217
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:21.920
So let's just say that I want to get a customer or somebody on my board that works at Facebook for example.

218
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:22.570
OK.

219
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.910
And having that logo will look amazing on your slides your presentation slides if you want to do that.

220
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.130
And also in your business plan document.

221
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:38.740
So let's say I want people from Facebook to be on my board and let's say that I don't know I went to

222
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:46.770
McGill University so I'll click here and click Apply and I'll do a quick search.

223
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.920
OK.

224
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.810
And these people have McGill somewhere in the resume or in their LinkedIn profile.

225
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:59.520
So let's click through list click here on this person Dan for example looks like he went to McGill University.

226
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.330
OK.

227
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.650
And I went to McGill University as well.

228
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:09.640
And if I send a message out to him maybe he'll meet with me and then maybe we can meet up and while

229
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.970
he graduate four years before I do I did at McGill.

230
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.630
And so what you would do is you can connect with them or you can message them.

231
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.560
I recommend messaging them.

232
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.470
OK so say I want the enemy of my board.

233
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.190
So the subject line I write is this high tech that I write this.

234
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.140
Exactly.

235
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.970
OK.

236
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.000
I'm sorry his name is Ian KIPP Believe.

237
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.860
I read that wrong.

238
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.840
So sorry about that.

239
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.530
I say it's not that great.

240
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.920
Keep it real look here.

241
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:33.760
Container record here.

242
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.870
All right Ian.

243
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.460
Hope all is well.

244
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:46.380
I also went to McGill and I live here in the Bay Area.

245
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:55.950
Please let me know if you have time for a coffee in the next few weeks.

246
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:04.290
Thanks a lot press and in order to send these you have to pay.

247
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.350
I think maybe it's a 20 or 30 bucks a month.

248
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.930
I can remember I pay the premium once so I can do this 45 times.

249
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.790
And if you send a message to somebody and they answer then you don't get it doesn't count as one in

250
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.720
meals that you've used.

251
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.810
And so I'm not going to click send.

252
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.740
This is just an example.

253
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:26.430
But if I sent this to Ian dance or if I said and he would read it because I.

254
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:32.040
I promise you you have opened every single message that's ever been sent to you on LinkedIn because

255
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:37.770
it how a little flag here I read all my messages is the best way to reach me and actually on my webcast

256
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.300
to the weekly.

257
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.720
And I love that method.

258
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.010
But I would send this to him.

259
00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.820
I would write the words please.

260
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.730
Thank you.

261
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.100
And something we have in common.

262
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:52.950
And he'll likely answer hopefully knock on wood knocking on my head and we'll meet up.

263
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.290
And then during that meeting you know for the first half we'll talk about what we have in common.

264
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.680
You know McGill University we went to whatever up in Montreal We'll talk about maybe some restaurants

265
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.220
that we used to go to there yada yada.

266
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.900
And then he'll probably and this always happens with me.

267
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.860
They'll probably very politely half way through the meeting say why are we meeting in a nice way.

268
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.490
And then this is where I can tell him about my business model and then ask for advice and then ask him

269
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:20.670
is it OK if I maybe add you as an adviser and that people say yes because they want to help you they

270
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.320
want to help you.

271
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:28.240
And so if you just picture yourself 20 years in the future and you're 20 you're more successful you

272
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.770
are now in somebody 20 years younger than you.

273
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.750
Reaches out to you that reminds you of them are you going to meet them if they if they reach out.

274
00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:39.380
Probably yes because you'd love helping yourself and helping others.

275
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.750
You just got to ask and most people don't do this and that's a wonderful thing because from a competitive

276
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.800
perspective you will stand out versus anybody else.

277
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.300
So try this to add people to your board.

278
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:50.930
OK.

279
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.320
I promise you it works exceptionally well.

280
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.580
I'm not going to send that to to Ian.

281
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.490
Sorry for calling you Dan. I don't know you I.

282
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.420
Anyway I'm insulted by the way he's written his name.

283
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.330
All right.

284
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.450
Keep it real and keep it fun.

285
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:10.520
And then what you can do is before you select who your advisers are you can write this optional.

286
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.120
What sector do you want them to be in.

287
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.030
Well maybe it's technology what companies would be ideal for them to be.

288
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.150
From Facebook all right here looks good right.

289
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.960
The Logos and all that stuff whatever.

290
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.170
And every company is different.

291
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:29.350
And then Antolin and so a couple of people so I put in here and a bunch of others I'd look at I'd send

292
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.440
in mail said like I showed you there over LinkedIn.

293
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:40.450
And then when they say yes you put their name down here and so there's this guy I reached out to named

294
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.290
Gates William and he worked at this company called Microsoft.

295
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.400
And I'm just kidding.

296
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:53.470
But anyway this is just sample and what you can do is you can get these logos from Facebook LinkedIn

297
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.910
you paste them here and there images as well and use link to images.

298
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.350
I going show you is pretty cool.

299
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:07.930
And the show's whole process so let's say I search for this is not the same guy as Gates Bill but so

300
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:14.890
and then what you do is you you you can click on this can and then you copy it's and when you copy that

301
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:21.960
image let's say that this person is said and said yes don't paste it yet in here because this is Amerge

302
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.930
cell next I will get all confused and stuff you know scroll over here.

303
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:32.380
Pick any self as a matter and then click paste and then it will paste in that picture.

304
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.130
Obviously it's a lot bigger.

305
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:39.070
We make it smaller and then we get it ready to put on our business plan and our shop run through this

306
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.510
to be kind of fun.

307
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:48.790
All right so let me just scroll down here and I'll drag this guy that looks like Bill Gates over on

308
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:56.560
the side here and I've selected and just make it smaller or whatever and then just kind of drag it over

309
00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.630
here.

310
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.870
I know there's probably an easier way to do it.

311
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.390
But anyway I want to show you live how I'm doing it.

312
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.990
I want to make mistakes too in real time just to show you.

313
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.450
How I'm trying to keep it real.

314
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.210
OK.

315
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:16.020
So you bring this over and we do this for every single employee to show you how in a second.

316
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:21.310
And for every single board advisor or board member whatever that says yes.

317
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.150
And to learn more.

318
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:29.130
The tween board advisory board mentor and staffing go up here and watch my video I made on on boards

319
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.840
and so here we go.

320
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.630
So right so I got him here.

321
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.480
And what I recommend is keep it try to keep the size the same as the ones I've done so you know you'll

322
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.230
put it in there.

323
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.560
Right.

324
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.190
So.

325
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.230
And there's many other ways to copy this stuff as well you don't have to paste it into Excel you can

326
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.030
use other programs if you want to change your pictures around a bit.

327
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:56.520
And I just kind of drag and drop it and make it the same size make them all the same size just for consistency.

328
00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.540
And you'll see where I'm going with it since that's pretty cool.

329
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:05.850
And then if you wanted to you can even select the image I have and you can find out what the dimensions

330
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.200
are.

331
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.230
1.10 pipe one point seventy five.

332
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.480
OK so maybe I'll make this the exact same size for all and see type here.

333
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:18.390
One point seventy five and make sure that that is selected there.

334
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.300
And then there he gets close enough it's good enough OK.

335
00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:26.090
So we've got a picture of the first board advisor that said yes after we met with him.
