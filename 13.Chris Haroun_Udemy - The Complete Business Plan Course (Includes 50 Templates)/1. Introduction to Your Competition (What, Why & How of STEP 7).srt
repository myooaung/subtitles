00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,580
Welcome to step 7 in terms of what why and how of Sept. 7.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,010
I'll kick it off the what.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,820
What are we going to learn.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,340
We will analyze and document the description strengths and weaknesses and much more of our top three

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,740
to five competitors.

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,920
We will also discuss our strengths and our weaknesses with our business model compared to the competition

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,280
as well as how our management team compares to the competition.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,210
We'll also compare our pricing policy pricing policy to the competition as well.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:43,110
In addition we will discuss other optional things to consider like when we go to our competitors websites

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,080
for example.

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,930
What areas do they post jobs for and what.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,060
And this is actually important.

13
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,700
That may actually signal what they're looking to do in the future from a product strategy or service

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,910
strategy perspective.

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:04,210
We'll also look at weaknesses or risks that are mentioned if applicable in our competitors annual reports

16
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,540
which are all free to access online.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:13,940
If our competition is trade on a stock market we also look at who your competitors follow on Twitter

18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:20,810
meaning who their customers are because all people that use Twitter that have really big customers they

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,970
follow their customers over Twitter.

20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,120
This could signal something.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,770
I'll talk about that more detail soon.

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,350
We're also a look at what other people are saying about our competition.

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,390
If a couple like what employees are saying about their management team on Glassdoor dot com if applicable.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,750
Also you can look at Yelp and you can go to the Better Business Bureau Web site of course if applicable

25
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:53,270
and you can learn a lot about your competitor from online ratings like teachers for example on me might

26
00:01:53,270 --> 00:02:00,890
look at my terrible 1 2 and 3 star reviews in my courses so they can make better versions of my courses.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,200
OK let's move on to why why are we spending so much time addressing the competition.

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Because the beauty of today's online documentation digital reality is that we can make a better product

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:21,320
and a better service by simply analyzing what customers have to say about our competition which it's

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,800
feedback.

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,030
That's almost in real time.

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,070
It's really cool.

33
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,380
Lastly how how are we going to complete Step 7.

34
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,590
Well we're going to answer a lot of questions in the inputs and analysis tab and you'll notice they

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,980
include a lot of optional things to think about when answering the questions in Step 7 per this green

36
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,040
shaded cell here.

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,650
Now on the step 7 competition outputs tabs here I included a checkboxes.

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,220
So you have the option to turn off topics that are just not relevant or of interest to you including

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,790
the omission of competitors 4 and 5.

40
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,850
Meaning only if you want to discuss three competitors.

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,270
Thanks.
