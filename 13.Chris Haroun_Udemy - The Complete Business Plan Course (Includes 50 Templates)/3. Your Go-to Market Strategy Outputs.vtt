00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.470
Please click on the outputs button for Step 8.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.970
And we'll look at what our go to market strategy reps going to look like.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.120
If you've written anything it will appear here you've got your online distribution than your online

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:22.440
distribution your direct or indirect and then your costs to distribution it's pretty short section.

5
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.060
We'll talk about the expenses for everything of course.

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.440
In Step 12.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
And if you want what I've done is I've kind of set this up I've modularized it so if you want to and

8
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.700
it takes awhile to minimizers there's a lot of details in the spreadsheet but you'll be able to see

9
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.010
them all stacked on top of each other like this which will come in helpful when we look at the final

10
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.680
outputs where I allow you to stack in group and ungroup everything in your document so that we have

11
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.080
a really nice high level perspective of what our final business plan will look at we'll see the forest

12
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.010
for the trees.

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.220
I will see you in step 9 where we will talk about sales and marketing.

14
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.680
Thanks.
