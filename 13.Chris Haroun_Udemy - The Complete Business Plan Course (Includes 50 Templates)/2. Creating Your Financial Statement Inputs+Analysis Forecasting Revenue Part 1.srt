1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,410
All right let's mix it up a bit.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:09,140
And I want to talk about doing the financials and I'm mixing up because I want to use my own is my old

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,110
Think Pad laptop.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,150
I just love the keyboard here on the fly came through on this one.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,060
OK so I'm using this on Windows.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,070
It should be the same thing.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,140
I've also test this on the Mac obviously.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,890
All right cool.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,220
So there's going to be a lot to this part.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:23,600
OK.

11
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,840
And there's a bunch of different tabs I've set up for you.

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,180
And basically I say is the one that you should be on now so please click that if you're not already

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:44,340
there in a stands for inputs and analysis and everything for all your financial statements.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,960
I set this up by architecting this so that everything we enter on this one tab here called the inputs

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:57,720
analysis tab will automatically feed through and populate all these financial statements.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,260
And then this here is called all and it has a combination of all of the statements.

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,360
So let me just show you from a high level perspective what I'm going to do and then I'll explain it

18
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,470
in a lot of detail.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,330
And if you're already very knowledgeable about finance and county you might want to skip some of this

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,720
but let me run through it anyway.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,680
So this here is the revenue tab.

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,550
Okay.

23
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:30,620
And this all this statement has here are this this this tab is just details on revenue and what drives

24
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,980
financial statements is usually revenue.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,500
Okay revenues the top line and most items on a financial state when your forecast and the future are

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,260
based on a percent of revenue that's revenue.

27
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,900
Okay.

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,710
Next up we've got I guess which is the income statement and revenue feeds into that and I'll explain

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,820
all this in lot more detail and then I've got the balance sheet then the cash flow statement and then

30
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,650
I've got something called all day and you can always navigate this way in that way if you want.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,550
I like cooking these things.

32
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,790
The same thing.

33
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,050
So all is going to be an output.

34
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,650
And when we make this a bit smaller

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,810
now I miss my Mac.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,560
OK so all is going to be an output of everything that we create together and kept in these pages here

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,560
are going to feed into our final output as well.

38
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:31,100
But we're right now we're we're talking about all of these financial statements on this little tab here

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,460
hopes.

40
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,710
Sorry about that.

41
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,710
OK.

42
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,660
A quick click the watch a video of this section.

43
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,220
All right.

44
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:43,460
So if I scroll down a bit you're going to see that financial statements are being created for you and

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,600
the revenue net income highlights are at the top there.

46
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,070
And c c right right here it is.

47
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,380
And then below that is a chart and you'll see the chart has nothing in it because we haven't created

48
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,630
any data yet.

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,430
And I while all this is really important.

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:05,290
Please make sure that you don't minimize or close any of the data in the columns.

51
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,580
If you want to look at what's in the charts.

52
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,660
Otherwise you won't be able to see it on the chart because it will be hidden.

53
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,950
So if I went like this then Year 2 you wouldn't see that information in the chart.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,640
Just leave these open you can close in if you want just when you look at the data but if you want to

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,100
look at the charts and especially for when we export all the stuff for our fight or file a business

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,110
model document you want to make sure those are all open decks.

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,430
Okay.

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,170
And again this stuff will populate automatically.

59
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,250
So this year is going to be the first page and this will make a lot more sense to sync as with the first

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,700
page is just a little snapshot of of our financial section revenue net income and then a chart of revenue

61
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,570
and net income.

62
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,620
Okay scrolling down here is where your financial ratios are and create if you automatically and I added

63
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,740
this here from actually one of my other courses my introduction of finance and then of course this year

64
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,650
we'll just remind you what each one of these ratios mean.

65
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,920
And I'll talk about them all at length as we go through this as well.

66
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,370
And then I have as you can see here a chart of gross margins.

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,060
Again I'll explain everything from scratch.

68
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:17,770
And then below that you just stop scrolling so it can populate helps to stop operating margins.

69
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,020
I'll just use the arrow keys.

70
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,120
And then I've got.

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,610
Net profit margins and all this stuff will automatically populate and then I've got return on assets

72
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,410
return equity which most people won't look at initially anyway.

73
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,450
Okay.

74
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,060
And then here I've got the monthly and this is automatically to be creative for us you'll see this is

75
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,850
awesome.

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,190
The monthly revenue for year 1.

77
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,530
And then I've got the quarterly revenue for year 2 for year 1 every every single quarter for them for

78
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,570
the first three years.

79
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,540
And this will look a lot better too don't worry.

80
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,840
That's how we put it into our our final output it just looks a little bit jagged here but it'll look

81
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,130
good.

82
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,830
And then here we've got the annual revenue and these will both go on a page together which is why I've

83
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,930
got them here right there.

84
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,630
Garrett is there their get away.

85
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,350
Okay so page 5 will have these two statements here the Coralee an annual revenue.

86
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,940
It's a lot.

87
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,030
I'm showing you but don't we as well make a lot of sense soon you're going to love it.

88
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,600
Okay.

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,730
And I've got operating expenses here for every month for for year one and don't worry if these here

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,050
are or are cut off a little bit they'll look really good by the time we're down to this I promise you

91
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,390
rights and I put in a bunch of other categories in case you want to add other items or we could just

92
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,040
remove that.

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,700
Okay.

94
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,800
And then I've got annual operating expenses than I've got here.

95
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,870
Your quarterly income statement from your once your 3 and then strolling down here I've got the annual

96
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,270
income statement from your 1 to your 10.

97
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,740
And then I've got and don't feel overwhelmed please this is all going to be fed from one tab.

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,530
It's so simple you're in a lot of it then I've got the balance sheet here.

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,200
And this is quarterly.

100
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:11,410
You can see here from your once a year three and then I have got the annual balance sheet from your

101
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,450
once year 10.

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,550
And they're all zero because I don't put any data in.

103
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:25,730
And then I've got the cash flow statement for I've got it for the first three years here quarterly.

104
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:33,210
And then after that I've got the annual cash will stay in for 10 years and then that's it.

105
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,740
It's a lot.

106
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,790
That's it.

107
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:42,200
So let's go together to I.A. and everything is going to be fed into here that we're sure everything

108
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,480
we enter is only to be here has all we fed into all of these awesome little tabs here.

109
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,380
I know I'm a finance nerd.

110
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,730
OK great.

111
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:58,560
So we're now on the inputs tab here inputs and analysis case should be green.

112
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:08,010
Make sure it's green and what you want to do is I'm going to go through this in a lot of detail and

113
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,360
again if you're really good at finance and count you might want to skip this.

114
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,740
But every single line item that's going to feed directly into all financial statements will be done

115
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,780
below on this one tab and the naming convention.

116
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,460
I've got the set up here as a member in this course we only answer stuff in white cells to but I also

117
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,140
made the items that you can change that are in the white cells blue just so you can see a little bit

118
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,830
better because that's like gray there.

119
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,230
So only change blue white cells.

120
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,530
Ok cool.

121
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:48,510
And one more thing I want to show you is is this whenever items are linked from a previous tab or another

122
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,150
tab.

123
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,640
They're green.

124
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,250
See here if I go to the revenue and if I get the balance sheet green and then cash flow statement is

125
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,110
basically almost all green.

126
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,330
So again you scantier stuff in this one tab here which should be Greenall inputs and analysis.

127
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,140
All right let's do this.

128
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,660
So I don't know if you're running a services company or a product based company but I set this up so

129
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,030
that you can answer data for both.

130
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:24,700
So if I were to go here and click one you'll see that all these tabs are shown or all of this information

131
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,630
is annual and I can open up each year if I want to that's monthly.

132
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,940
OK.

133
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,710
So I go monthly for the first couple of years and then after a couple of years I just went to quarterly

134
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,350
because what happens is you tend to model monthly for the first couple of years and then you do have

135
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,720
most big companies do which is you just do quarterly.

136
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,860
So the first four years or five years we see here looks like it at five years look gets like five years.

137
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,350
Oh yeah.

138
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,380
And then by year 6 I just did quarterly.

139
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,140
Can all of this data works.

140
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:00,040
And then I did annually after that because it's so hard to forecast what's going to happen in the future

141
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,900
between Year 6 and year 10.

142
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,860
I mean this year is hard enough as it is.

143
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,740
And if you've never done financial modeling before one thing I want to tell you and I've done a ton

144
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,120
of financial modeling on Wall Street when I worked has finished venture capital center.

145
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,110
But you have to be comfortable with uncertainty and explain that when we make a lot of assumptions and

146
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,790
where we forecast in the future and it's never going to be perfect.

147
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,890
But just be comfortable with the fact that it won't be perfect.

148
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:31,360
If everybody could forecast the future perfectly then stocks would always be priced perfectly and stock

149
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,250
markets wouldn't exist.

150
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,220
So I hate to show you a methodology I developed over the years having worked on Wall Street work the

151
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,710
hedge ministry work in much of the street.

152
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,810
I've done a lot of modeling I love it.

153
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,910
It's a lot of fun and I love doing.

154
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,400
I think pagen pure outswim business but this work on Mac as well.

155
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,720
OK.

156
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:54,240
So what I want you to do now is before we get started entering all the data down below are we to close

157
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:02,340
all of these capped and what do you do as I want you to name the years it's blue with white tech so

158
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,320
you can name it and see how my recording is going.

159
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:05,870
OK.

160
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,320
I'm still recording I'm using Powerpoint by the way record books like this.

161
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,470
I insert a PowerPoint screen.

162
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,390
You can only do the screen recording on Windows.

163
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,410
All right.

164
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,800
Otherwise quick time in Mac.

165
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,370
So your name all of these and this will filter through everywhere and this will be awesome you'll love

166
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:20,810
it.

167
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,230
So I'm going to name these just based on the years today.

168
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,800
So 2018 and you might start this course in January 2019 so it all depends.

169
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,010
Or you might want to throw on some historical data as well.

170
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,460
Tally up to 19.

171
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,110
And then I can do 2020 and I'll go into high speed mode.

172
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,820
This is software

173
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,000
OK so I have all 10 years entered in and you never after 20 years again will automatically be done for

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,650
you.

175
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:58,330
So if I open this up we've got January of of 2008 teens it's automatically fed in directly.

176
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,860
Okay great.

177
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,130
And let's open them all up now.

178
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:13,580
And then if I were to scroll over here you see January 19 all the months and then all automatically

179
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,370
done quarterly after year 5 meaning you're six.

180
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,060
OK.

181
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,640
And then I'll be done annually for the last 5 years on this model four years as a model.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,770
So there's the Coralee one that's year six and then year seven eight nine 10 11 or the.

183
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,650
That's right yeah.

184
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,190
This year is quarterly based on these numbers tell us 23 and these are the last four years.

185
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,900
OK good.

186
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,990
Now that everything is open I want to scroll over here and show you a couple more things.

187
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:47,930
These down here what's automatically be creative for you is something called Spark lines and this is

188
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,450
a really cool feature can and I've added these everywhere on this.

189
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,060
This tab here and this is great.

190
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:01,570
So you've got the top line is going to be the currency change like the actual dollar or currency amount

191
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,490
changed.

192
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,260
OK.

193
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,210
And then the bottom line is going to be the percent change and this will allow us to look for trends.

194
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,920
And once the data gets popped.

195
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,600
So make a lot more sense to you.

196
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,200
And so if you were to scroll down you'll see that I've got spark lines all the way down that will be

197
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,810
created for you.

198
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,550
OK great.

199
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:30,560
And this here is optional but you can enter in comments here notes if you want us on why you assume

200
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,780
certain numbers will be the way they are or whatever just just little comments here and there.

201
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,530
And then here is where you can flag stuff as well so say I want to come back to revenue line.

202
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,270
One I would click here.

203
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,520
And then what happens is that flag appears there.

204
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:50,840
And then if we go to any other part in the spreadsheet outside of this you'll see that right there I've

205
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,740
got one flex yet there.

206
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,940
Okay got to let me go back here to I.

207
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,730
Okay great.

208
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:04,750
Now if scroller me here again you can enter in comments and you ignore what you see over here by the

209
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:04,930
way.

210
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,580
These are just inputs for me to make some charts for you.

211
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,220
Okay.

212
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,800
And you can look if you want to but I'm not going to talk about the course.

213
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,980
All right.

214
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:21,680
So now let's go all the way back here and let's start insert in putting the data together and I don't

215
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,990
know what business model you have signed to keep this very generic but what I'm going to say is going

216
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,210
to apply to any type of business model services based or product based.

217
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,200
So a lot of you will only have one revenue line at it because there's one type of product you're selling

218
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,600
but some you have to.

219
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,860
So let me start off with one.

220
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:45,960
OK so if you want you can just hard code on topis it's blue and white so you can type on top of it.

221
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,580
So say revenue in January 2013 is $10 and you go up to $20 or whatever it is.

222
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,820
I'm going to hit Control Z to undo that.

223
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,100
Now I also made a formula to do what I'm about to show you.

224
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,210
And if you don't track things on a unit basis you can ignore when about to do and just entering your

225
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,330
revenue here.

226
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,260
Okay.

227
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,690
Here yes.

228
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:17,410
So now let's say that you sell units like virtual reality goggles and let's say you think that you can

229
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,750
sell 100 in this period or you have sold in that period and make this the future if you want or use

230
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,390
whatever data you want and then say we sell 120 units here and then business gets cooking we're selling

231
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,110
140 this month 150 this month.

232
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,090
And I'm going in a bunch of dummy data and you'll see why in a second.

233
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,570
And the reason why there is a decimal here you might think yourself Chris hucking sell half a unit.

234
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,690
We included that because a lot of people won't be using this for a product based business model.

235
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,240
They'll use this financial model for services so if you have a firm where you build by the hour if you're

236
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:58,460
a lawyer or a doctor or consultant and you build by the hour you might have a half hour.

237
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,880
OK so here you're an answer in either the number of units or the product that you sold or the number

238
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,410
of hours that you've built for service.

239
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,780
A lot of consulting firms work that way.

240
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,620
So let me go ahead and then just change this around a bit and you can even assume that you're going

241
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,080
to grow by 10 units month over month.

242
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:25,250
And let me just say this and all of that plus 10 cases that were growing by 10 per per month over month.

243
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,230
And way I can do is I love Excel.

244
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,740
You can highlight this stuff here go all the way here.

245
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:35,770
You can't change out it's not blue and I can right click and I can pay special as a formula.

246
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,780
OK.

247
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,430
So I pace and special that as if formula some of you might want to use the other way of doing it which

248
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:49,270
is you go up here and then you go paste and then you select Paste Special and then you select formulas.

249
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:54,210
I know the Mac version looks a little different but this is how you do it there formulas it can get.

250
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,150
Okay great.

251
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:01,840
So we've now got the units or number of hours done for the first year and I'm going to do the second

252
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:10,230
year now and let's just say that things spike and we got 20 20 units or hours increase month over month

253
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,150
I had to skip remember that's an annual one.

254
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,360
Right.

255
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,730
So if you double click on anything the beautiful thing about Excel is it highlights all these numbers.

256
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,590
OK.

257
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,720
And also I've set this up so that certain items are tagged as well like here if I highlight that says

258
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,380
financials input revenue line item 1.

259
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,190
And so I can even go here as that was limit him to take me down.

260
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,210
It's pretty powerful.

261
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,600
I named all stuff.

262
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,490
OK.

263
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,970
So now let me go back here.

264
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,060
Go back up to revenue line item one.

265
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,730
OK.

266
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,910
And this is so much easier to do find his accounts easier to do if you look at it in a modularized perspective

267
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,820
meaning one thing at a time and we build on this logic as well so that longer term we have this eureka

268
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,450
moment where we're like oh my gosh this is amazing we're actually modeling from scratch.

269
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,830
We understand it all but a lot of people get intimidated because they look at all the data the same

270
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,130
time.

271
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,780
We're not going to do that.

272
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,930
We're going to break it down.

273
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,870
OK.

274
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,310
So now we're in increase.

275
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,170
That was 20 units and let me double click here.

276
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,460
Good that's 20.

277
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,060
And those can do the same thing here with that plus 20.

278
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,530
And then I got a copy

279
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,960
and then I'm going to pay special here.

280
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,780
And then I just know that's formula.

281
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,010
And you can use other methodology up here I showed you before if you want.

282
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,640
OK.

283
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,730
And then I'm going to assume just for fun I'm going to grow this by another 20 units every single month

284
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,030
for the next couple of years so I'm going to copy this

285
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,430
and then I can actually get the pace that in there I know I should pay special but it's fine.

286
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,040
That was OK.

287
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,300
See there you go.

288
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,520
And then going to do it again for 2021 for our units or the number of hours that we're building if it's

289
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,070
service and where we do this slowly and build upon it.

290
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,200
And then you're like oh my god I get it so makes sense to me.

291
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,660
OK.

292
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,730
Get.

293
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,620
It's a wonder when that was an update.

294
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,220
Somebody said it takes time.

295
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:15,200
OK now read it one more time for this year here.

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,170
OK.

297
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,960
Paste and that's going to update I'll take a second or two.

298
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,410
That data will work don't it give it a second to think.

299
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,020
Come on.

300
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,530
Think it's coming.

301
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,320
It'll work during

302
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,230
that update.

303
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,400
I don't know why it's taken a while.

304
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,120
I'll come back to you at work.

305
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,760
OK.

306
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,780
And then now it's on a quarterly basis.

307
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:43,540
And if you want you can model quarterly here completely or call.

308
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,720
This should be updated.

309
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,670
Come on.

310
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,210
There we go.

311
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,980
Finally add up that took a second there all right.

312
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
And then here you can do quarterly as well.

313
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,810
And I'll just leave this out for now.

314
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,420
You can do annually as well which is which is pretty self-explanatory.

315
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,030
Now I want to show you something cool that got created here.

316
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,420
Whoops sorry about that.

317
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,210
OK.

318
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,350
So we have the number of units has been created here on an annual basis.

319
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,640
OK.

320
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,580
So that's Year One two three.

321
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,830
It increases like that.

322
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,080
Okay.

323
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,860
And this would be the other end all year so we didn't do.

324
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,440
And this is the percent increase year over year change which is still growing but the growth rate is

325
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,340
declining.

326
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay.

327
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,310
Because we're only growing 20 month over month on a larger number.

328
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,720
So it's still positive growth but the rate of change is slowing.

329
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,940
I ignore what's over here because I mentioned information there.

330
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,400
OK.

331
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,270
Now let me go all the way back here before Answer other stuff.

332
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,990
One more cool thing

333
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,950
there you go.

334
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,720
All right.

335
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,720
Now you see what happened here was this spark line was created in this SPARC line shows that you've

336
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,630
had growth of 20 units or so or 10 years or so month or month if I delete these you'll see that there

337
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,900
will be a change here in this chart.

338
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:05,800
Ill update and everything will be impacted see here that the growth rate dropped were a lot lower now

339
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,620
so me do controls the controls that if you're in Canada or England or anywhere else in the world that

340
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,490
really goes back.

341
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,030
Okay.

342
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,410
So that SPARC line was created there now as well.

343
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,380
And the sparkling chart was automatically created here as well.

344
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,010
See here pretty cool.

345
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,100
Okay great.

346
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:30,260
So now we're done with with units but before we move on I want to show you what happens here with these

347
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,970
numbers and so we always look in finance at the mix we're still recording.

348
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,540
Good.

349
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,230
Okay.

350
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,410
We always look in finance at the rate of change.

351
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,010
Okay.

352
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,130
And so in year one there's no year over year which changes this year once there's no formulas here.

353
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,180
And then here we look at the month over month right.

354
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,970
We grew here by 20 percent Mohon 220 and then we grew twentieths which is 17 percent.

355
00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:00,620
And then a smaller growth than we look here at quarter over quarter growth and create a formula for

356
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,590
it here.

357
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:12,100
So this amount here is 480 this amount here is 364 and 80 is growth over 3 or 60 33 percent.

358
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,330
So you get quarterly growth there.

359
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,350
Okay.

360
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,610
And I've got sorry less space here.

361
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:22,640
Let me just scroll back up here quarterly and then what happens is here we got yearly.

362
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,180
So this year we've got and this is smart enough to skip that annual thing again.

363
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,740
So here I've got 150 percent growth year over year.

364
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,240
So you're going from 100 units there and now we're at we're at 250 that's one of percent growth.

365
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,450
And then growth here you can see yada yada all the way over here.

366
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:40,760
Okay.

367
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:48,950
So we're now done with with with units and because this is taking a lot of time I have to break this

368
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,780
lecture up because you know you're allowed to have much more in 20 minutes in lectures and in the next

369
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:59,150
lecture we'll do is we'll then talk about the average selling price per unit her hourly rate charge

370
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,630
backs.
