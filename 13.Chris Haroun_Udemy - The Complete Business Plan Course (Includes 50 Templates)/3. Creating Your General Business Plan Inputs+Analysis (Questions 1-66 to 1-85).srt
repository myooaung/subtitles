1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,620
This question here it's just informational.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,760
It's optional as you can see it basically says.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,470
Have you thought about attending local free meetup events in your country.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,480
This is a great way to network in your industry to understand more about your customers.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:20,860
Maybe your competition and business partners so if you were to go here to meet up dotcom this works

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,580
for every country in every industry and every city on the planet.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,810
This is awesome.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,080
So you just do a search here of what your industry is and you can attend meet ups.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,450
This course is not going to be tech focused only but here's a number of tech little meetings you can

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,090
go to locally here in the Bay Area.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,520
OK moving on let's go back here.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,160
OK.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,380
Here you write down what your company's mission statement is.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,720
For example I wrote down Google's mission statement which is to organize the world's information and

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,110
make it universally accessible and useful.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:56,490
If you want what you can do is just make this the exact same thing of what you wrote above here in step

17
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,280
one point three which is your little 15 word tagline or you can you know write something a little bit

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,150
more elaborate if you want completely your call.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,400
As always you can see the example of what I wrote for that section in that question here so I wrote

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,180
here to make all visual media content ever created powered by shark virtual reality and it make virtual

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,190
reality universally accessible cap.

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,730
All right.

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:28,750
Next up I want you to list and this will really help you a lot to later on in the business plan a way

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,990
to write down what's your number one strength compared to the competition then your number two strength.

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,300
And number three.

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,300
OK and so here I wrote we are the lowest cost producer that's my number one strength.

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,720
Number two I wrote we own a patent it quickly renders all movies and video game content into 3D.

28
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,960
And then here I wrote that we have an exclusive contract all pretend of course with Marvel Studios to

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,270
render all Marvel Studios movies into 3D using our patented virtual reality software so just write down

30
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:02,390
whatever your three strengths are there and I made those required and then here these are optional if

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,750
you have four or five strings to one list.

32
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,360
Then I want you to also list your three biggest weaknesses because I'm going to challenge you in a nice

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,760
swift chorusing and challenge us to really think about weaknesses of our company and address them and

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,570
so here are three weaknesses that I wrote down Caye weakness one weakness to weakness three.

35
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,470
Number one I don't have a large cash balance.

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,510
Then below it I ask how do I decrease the risk with number one.

37
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,110
Okay.

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,070
And I wrote here to raise capital by creating an incredible business plan.

39
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,730
My second weakness is I don't have any presence overseas.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,900
How do I address this week.

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,320
Number two I wrote here by raising capital and using part of the proceeds raised to open an overseas

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,510
office.

43
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:53,240
And lastly for Week Number three how do I address weak December 3 which is I don't have the same experience

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,590
as the CEOs do or senior management teams do.

45
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,820
Of my competition and they wrote here we intend to create a fantastic board of advisers which will assuage

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,830
any Curran's any concerns of our relative lack of manager experience.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,850
And I'm going to teach you in the management section in a lot of detail how to create a board of advisers

48
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,700
from scratch so you can have amazing people on your board for free which will make your business plan

49
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,310
and your presentation slides.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,720
If you have slides much much better when investors or whoever the reader is of your business plan or

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:32,850
your presentation looks at your materials OK and number four and five I made optional a can this one

52
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,690
here is optional.

53
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,870
Why did you choose to locate your company where it is.

54
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,970
And I wrote down my sample answer there.

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,580
And you can see I have a typo here.

56
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,210
Don't worry if your grammar spelling is not is not perfect ok because later on when we go into Microsoft

57
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:53,910
Word together and we update our template from scratch and this is all going automatically up to the

58
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,090
table formats it's going to love it.

59
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,780
But you're going to see all of your spelling mistakes here automatically underlined and grammatical

60
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,150
errors as well which will be in green.

61
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,860
That sort of thing if you forgot a comma.

62
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,230
More on that later.

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
OK.

64
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,340
It's this last one here I wrote.

65
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,540
It's optional but I really recommend doing it.

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,010
If you're serious about taking this business to the next level and I go here have you set up a one hour

67
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,860
consultation with a tax lawyer where you live.

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,170
And you know tax lawyers charge a bunch.

69
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,870
It's a pain in the neck but they can save you a fortune later on if you read your copy of the right

70
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,350
way.

71
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,120
Initially again I'm not a lawyer.

72
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,160
Please seek legal advice.

73
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,330
If you want to do this optional step here.

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,700
And if you're in the United States whenever you can go to legalzoom.com and set up a one on one meeting

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,880
for for half an hour with any kind of lawyer for 30 minutes.

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,560
If it's a business lawyer meeting or $15 for 30 minutes if it's a personal lawyer meeting again just

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,660
check it out Legal's dot com if you want and they'll even help you register your patents trademarks

78
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:04,200
and copyrights overseas using what is called the Madrid protocol which is a little bit off topic but

79
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,110
if you're curious about the Madrid protocol and registering your trademark or copyright or whatever

80
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,660
in different countries it doesn't matter where you're located you can watch this lecture right here

81
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,710
which is just going to if you click on it's going to open up a new YouTube window.

82
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,530
Again it is completely optional.

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,590
OK so once you're done with this and I didn't answer all the questions here for you I did just a couple.

84
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,750
And I've only asked it and it's 17 percent but this once you answer all the non optional questions.

85
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,230
OK.

86
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,890
Like like these ones here you'll see that that will that will increase from 17:2 to a higher number

87
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:50,190
and you can always just override that completely by selecting this option here so I've got 22 percent

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,680
done for step 1 and 2 percent the whole course.

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,330
But if I click this and make it go from 22 percent to 100 now or 7 percent done the course and the needle

90
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,180
has moved here on the total course progress you can always minimize this as well if you want more space

91
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,050
which I explained here in the get more space in this spreadsheet button here.

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,020
It takes a second or two for it to minimize the first time.

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,970
And I want to make this universally accessible to everybody regardless of if you're using Windows or

94
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,430
Mac with Excel and based on whatever screen size you have.

95
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,020
And again to get a black back you can click there or you can click here and take you to the home screen

96
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,740
as well.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,070
OK.

98
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,040
But I'll just open this up.

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,860
So we're now officially done with step one of the course.

100
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,340
If you have any questions at all please let me know what you can do is you can always scroll over to

101
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,880
the right side and enter in comments.

102
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:53,330
Takes a little while to enter in comments for for every single question that you've entered.

103
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,280
If you want and then later on you can come back and you can filter based on comments that you've entered.

104
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,830
Again it's completely optional hence the word optional but because it's in white it means you can feel

105
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,180
free pleased to answer those those answers.

106
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,840
OK if you have any questions about this please let me know.

107
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,260
If not I will see you in step 2 where we talk about the cover page.

108
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,680
Thanks.
