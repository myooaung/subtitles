Belong to plan is planning to fail.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.230
Many companies fail as they don't write a detailed business plan.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.890
This will be you after you finish this course.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.180

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.370
You're not only the student in this course you're also the customer and the customer is always right.

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.170
So please let me know if you want me to add new lectures covering new topics as my goal is to not only

14
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.590

15
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.410
business planning course.

16
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
And as you take this course if you want me to add more lectures covering more topics just please let

17
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.700
me know and I will work around the clock to add new lessons for you.

18
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.560
Thank you.

19
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.730
And let's begin in terms of my background.

20
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.070
I have 25 years of business experience.

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.710
I've been investing in startups and starting companies myself and on the boards of many companies in

22
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.580
my career I've raised and managed over a billion dollars and I've worked in venture capital and I have

23
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.250
read hundreds and hundreds of business plans.

24
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.040
I've also written many business plans and I mention all this stuff because I'm going to provide you

25
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.390
with a 13 step process to create your detailed business plan from scratch even if you have no business

26
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.750
experience at all and this course is based on my real life practical experience and not based on theory.

27
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.580
OK let's talk about how to take this course Confucius said.

28
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:11.250
I hear and I forget I see and I remember I do and I understand as such I think that the best way to

29
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.390
learn is by doing exercises and there will be a lot of exercises in this course that we complete together.

30
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.600
Now when you write a business plan you have to try to be an expert in all major business topics and

31
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.520
so you have to wear a lot of different hats.

32
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.300
And what we're going to do is we're going to wear more than 13 hats in this course.

33
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.190
You'll be a lot of fun you'll see.

34
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.320
And so there's 13 steps that we will do together in this course and many exercises as we go on this

35
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.620
thorough and fun journey together.

36
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.220
Now I want to humbly inspire you to reach your full potential in life by launching a company.

37
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.700
I also want to help you create your business plan so you can decide whether or not to launch this business

38
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.090
full time or not.

39
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.450
This course is for anybody that wants to start a business or for anybody who has already started a business.

40
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.180
And anyone that works in a large company that wants to start a new business unit this course is for

41
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.180
everyone in every sector that is launching a product based or a service based company.

42
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.040
Now there's two tracks in this course.

43
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.230
One track is the fast track and the other track is the complete course track adds.

44
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.590
If you see the word optional at the start of the many questions I will ask you in the exercise wheel

45
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.980
to get we'll do together then what you can do is you can decide to skip that question or go through

46
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.790
the course quickly or not.

47
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.400
It's up to you completely.

48
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.320
So if you don't want to take the fast track then please answer as many questions as you want to.

49
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.370
That applies to your business model and this will make a lot more sense once we start our exercises

50
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.550
together.

51
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.750
Now in the next couple of minutes I will discuss the 13 steps of this course and the 13 steps in your

52
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.030
Excel business plan dashboard file which is attached to this lecture here and looks like this.

53
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.610
Now I will always tell you when and how to complete all of the mini exercises and questions in this

54
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.140
course.

55
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.110
So let's take a look at your business plan dashboard Excel file this Excel file is attached to this

56
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.570
lecture and it works with the Windows or Mac versions of Excel.

57
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.780
And if you want please open the Excel document which again is attached to this very first lecture now.

58
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.080
There are no macros in this Excel file and when you open it if you see this message then please select

59
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.470
enable editing.

60
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.230
I recommend having Excel version 2013 or later installed on your computer.

61
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.690
Now if you don't have Excel you can access the contents of the Excel dashboard and the mini exercises

62
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.140
in the Excel dashboard.

63
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.730
In many PTF files which you can access at this location here.

64
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.350
If you are using the Excel file which I strongly recommend please that I've also given you the option

65
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.780
of accessing the PBX for each exercise by clicking the PBF icons here in the course and once you have

66
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.230
your Excel file open if you want to change the viewing size of the document.

67
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.770
I mean the entire Excel file then please click this button here called get more space in this spreadsheet

68
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.240
for instructions.

69
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.010
OK so let's go back to the course.

70
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:46.450
Navigator dashboard by clicking on this home button here OK let's discuss how to use this Excel dashboard

71
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.280
file and the 13 steps of the entire course.

72
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.280
So please make sure that your home button is selected and you'll see that whatever tab or location you're

73
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.780
on.

74
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.350
In this comprehensive spreadsheet wherever you are the button will turn green like this home button

75
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.370
after I click it.

76
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.600
And I will always tell you exactly when to click on different buttons in your Excel dashboard.

77
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:20.910
Now at the top of almost every single tab we see that we can track our course progress in the entire

78
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.810
course and also for all 13 steps.

79
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.940
And as you complete the exercises your progress will automatically be updated right here.

80
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.400
And I also included a Flags option for you in every single section meaning every step of the course

81
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.600
so that you can flag any questions that you want to come back to later.

82
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.180
And I'll explain that much more detail once we start the exercises together.

83
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.250
And if you ever want to understand how to complete a certain step in the course you can click on these

84
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.040
questionmark icons here to watch a video explanation of that particular step.

85
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.760
And I will always tell you exactly when to access each step in this course but you can also press the

86
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.810
forward or back buttons to go to the next lecture or it's or to go to the previous tab in the spreadsheet

87
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.890
which will guide you through the entire Excel file in order.

88
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:26.100
I will always tell you exactly when to access each step in this course but you can also press the forward

89
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:33.090
or back buttons to go to the next exercise meaning the next tab in this spreadsheet which will guide

90
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:39.890
you through the entire Excel file in order and right here you see the resources section which is completely

91
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:47.450
optional but you can click it access many videos and resources that I created on topics that are helpful

92
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:55.030
for people starting companies now below the resources tab we have a different inspirational quotes on

93
00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:00.670
every single tab in the course and you can click on these quotes if you want to learn more about the

94
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.380
incredible entrepreneur that created that quote.

95
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.530
It's optional of course.

96
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:11.200
Now many of the entrepreneurs that are quoted had a huge impact on me when I created this course for

97
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.530
you.

98
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.940
Let's now talk about the 13 steps in this file from a very high level perspective.

99
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:25.460
You will see that there are blue buttons called inputs and analysis inputs analysis get the blue answers.

100
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:33.950
And there are green buttons called outputs and I'll always tell you when to press these buttons but

101
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:39.440
the blue input and analysis buttons are the questions that we will answer together.

102
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.800
That will help us create our business plan.

103
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:48.760
Then you can click on the output button to see what that section of your business plan will look like

104
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.750
based on your answers and the inputs.

105
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.960
There are many questions to answer but many of them are labeled as optional.

106
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.660
So again if you're in a hurry you can skip the optional questions.

107
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:08.520
Now I've also created many on and off switches to turn off outputs that might not be relevant to you.

108
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.330
Like biographies to include for many employees in the business plan or whether or not to include a board

109
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.450
in your business plan.

110
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:25.300
You'll see that all 13 Steps fit into your final business plan output right here and I will make it

111
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:32.620
really easy to understand how to put all the information here into one of the 50 business plan templates

112
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.240
that I provide you with.

113
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:42.820
Now as an added bonus you can also click right here on the presentation slides button and based on your

114
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.400
answers to the many questions in the course.

115
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:52.750
What I did was I created a 10 slide presentation deck automatically for you which you can also create

116
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.510
using the mini PowerPoint presentation templates that I have provided you with in this course.

117
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.950
Of course the presentation slides part of the course is optional.

118
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.680
And you can also minimize that to the top toolbar by clicking this button right here.

119
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:16.880
And your status in the course will be shown also in this blue rectangular box here and you will see

120
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:23.030
this small home button here on all the tabs on this blue rectangle here.

121
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:29.680
In case you want to go back to your home screen and I provide you with many many different ways to navigate

122
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:35.620
this entire Excel document including the buttons on the toolbar that I created for you or what you can

123
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:43.120
do is you can click the tabs down here or you can even click this feature here in Excel to go anywhere

124
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.940
you want in this comprehensive spreadsheet.

125
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:52.960
And what I did was I architected this as a modularized process which will really come in handy as we

126
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.480
build your business plan together.

127
00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.670
Now if you can't see this feature here then please go to view in the menu and then select formula bar

128
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.510
and you'll see that on most steps on the left there is a blue shaded part right in the middle on the

129
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.160
left here.

130
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:17.240
And on the right there is a white shaded part the blue shaded part is to show you an example of how

131
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.800
my pretend company called Shark virtual reality would answer the questions and the pretend entrepreneur

132
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:31.550
that started shark virtual reality is named Tony shuk which I've also used in one of my other finance

133
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.400
courses.

134
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:38.360
And you can learn more about shark virtual reality by clicking this optional button right here.

135
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.010
And if you click it there's a short video of him to learn more about him completely optional.

136
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:48.490
Now since we have to think like a great entrepreneur does when we create a business plan what I want

137
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:55.020
to do is I'm going to wear another hat throughout this course which is Tony sharks hat and I also want

138
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.890
to show you Tony's product.

139
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:07.470
So right here are two demo versions of his groundbreaking fictional virtual reality products which will

140
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:13.600
revolutionize which will revolutionize how we watch movies and how we play video games.

141
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.720
Prequel.

142
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.410
All right we'll come back to this later.

143
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.340
All right.

144
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:25.260
I promised my son DIL and he gets both those mock products after Rhadamanthus course.

145
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.330
All right so Tony needs to write a solid business plan.

146
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.090
So what we're going to do is we're going to help him write it which will be a fun simple case study

147
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.810
for us as we create our real business plans together.

148
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:45.270
Now you don't ever have to bother clicking this Excel option up here but if you wanted to find out where

149
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.660
in this business plan excel file that would cover certain topics than what you can do is you can look

150
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:59.400
look on this list up here and select the business plan topic for example to see where we cover in the

151
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.510
financial section employee salaries expenses.

152
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:09.150
We would select this option here and I will always tell you exactly when to access everything in this

153
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.290
course as we go on this business plan document creation journey together.

154
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.640
And all the white sheet is cells are for you to update.

155
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.120
So only update stuff in the whites white case.

156
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.120
And of course I'll tell you exactly when answer every single question.

157
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:33.530
Now for all steps when you watch the videos in the course of how to complete them I show you a menu

158
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.240
like this here so you can jump immediately to that question in the video so I can save you time.

159
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.520
Or you can just watch the entire video if you want to.

160
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:50.830
Your call and if you want to secure this file with a password please click right here and I recommend

161
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.140
just saving this file on your computer and not online.

162
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.250
I also again didn't put any macros or code in this file at all.

163
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.970
It's secure.

164
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:06.150
And if you want to see how I created this file from scratch you can watch the optional.

165
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:11.380
How did I create this Excel file section towards the end of the Course and what I'll do is I'll explain

166
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.440
in that optional section how I created the Excel document.

167
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:22.130
In easy to understand terms so you will be able to create a similar document to this one here from scratch.

168
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.180
If you have no Excel experience at all.

169
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.340
Again that part is optional.

170
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.600
Now I want to talk about the settings button right here.

171
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:31.900
Please click it.

172
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.470
And I want you to select your country and your currency and entering your first name or just your nickname

173
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:45.140
it once you select your country and your currency what I've done is I've them actually updated the course

174
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:51.910
based on where you live so that it is customized for you and it's a better customer experience.

175
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.650
And this works in every country in the world I have students in every single country.

176
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.170
It's customized for all of you.

177
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:04.260
Now if the exchange rate is not accurate based on your currency you can always change it after you select

178
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:04.890
your currency.

179
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:12.420
In this white box right here if you scroll down you will see helpful links for you based on what country

180
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.150
you live in.

181
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:17.550
And I wanted to make this course applicable to everyone in every country and for every type of business

182
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.760
model.

183
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.120
So please don't add or remove any rows or columns the spreadsheet.

184
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.960
Thanks.

185
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.680
OK so before we we complete Step One of the course.

186
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.650
I want to quickly mention what you see here on the home page.

187
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:36.250
I mean the home button if you scroll them what you see here is completely optional to look at.

188
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:42.820
But if you click the home button and you scroll down you will see that I created a one page summary

189
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:50.720
report of brief highlights of your entire business model and this page will automatically be updated

190
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.700
as we complete the course.

191
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.720
And what I did was I set this one page snapshot here for you.

192
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:03.810
So if you print this page to paper or to a PTF it is already formatted entirely for you.

193
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:04.870
And this is free.

194
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:11.600
Free for informational purposes if you ever wanted to assess how your business plan looks from a high

195
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:18.740
level perspective and you can even scroll down here and what you can do is add or remove your contact

196
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:25.220
details and illegal disclosure in case you want to share this one pager with anyone that's important

197
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.180
to you.

198
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.390
And this one pager is different from the executive summary part of the course which we will talk about

199
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.660
in much more detail.

200
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:42.740
In Step three now in the next 13 sections of the course were discussed the 13 Steps and the first lecture

201
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:51.520
of each of the 13 sections will be an overview of the what why and how of that particular section.

202
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.570
So what we'll do is we'll start with a generic imprint.

203
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.490
Instead we get my hat

204
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:07.170
what we'll do is we'll start with generic inputs and step 1 then step 2 will select which of the 50

205
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:13.740
templates I made for you that you want to use as well as the design of your cover and your logo and

206
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:19.540
more than in Step Three we create your executive summary.

207
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.600
Moving on to Step 4 we make the management team part of your business plan.

208
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:31.210
And it's important to leave that earlier in because what happens is a lot of very successful investors

209
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.260
venture capitalists and people that might be in your business plan.

210
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.210
They know that the most important thing is your management team and don't worry if you don't have much

211
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:45.190
experience because I'm going to show you how to create a board instead for for free.

212
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.380
The easy way.

213
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.340
OK.

214
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.680
Moving on to Step Five.

215
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:55.360
What we'll do is we will make your product or service as part of a business plan and then after that

216
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.610
we're going to cover the customer and the market.

217
00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:03.670
Then the competition part of the business plan then the go to market strategy meaning how we distribute

218
00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:10.130
your product or service then we discuss the sales and marketing strategy milestones.

219
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.610
Other items then financials and then the appendix in step 13.

220
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:22.560
Then after we're done with all 13 steps we'll create your finace your final business plan document together

221
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:29.640
to populate your Microsoft Word document meaning one of the 50 templates that you decide to download

222
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.240
and use.

223
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:37.650
And don't worry as I will make this very easy and fun to do and I will guide you on every single step

224
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.160
and on every single question and answer that you create in this course.

225
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.420
And so I want to stress that this course will not be us or only tech focused.

226
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.560
It will also be global in nature.

227
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:57.450
So it doesn't matter what country you're in and it doesn't matter what industry your startup is in.

228
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:05.970
Now I want to I want to do what ever it takes to humbly help you create the perfect business plan.

229
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.790
And I hold a three hour webcast.

230
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.770
Office hours call for my students every single Thursday on my YouTube channel and you can always click

231
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:20.760
this Kuna image here to join the Web cast and asked me an unlimited number of questions on this weekly

232
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.360
office hours call and the call never ever ends.

233
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:30.450
Each week until all questions have been answered even if it means that the call ends up being eight

234
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.140
hours long I will do whatever it takes to help you.

235
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:40.620
And I've created and I've read hundreds of business plan documents in my career in venture capital as

236
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:45.600
an entrepreneur when I worked in consulting and while I worked on Wall Street and I humbly know what

237
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:53.370
it takes to make an amazing business plan which we will do together and I poured my heart and everything

238
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:59.010
I've got into making this course and I had a lot of fun making the course and I really hope you enjoy

239
00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.900
it.

240
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:06.770
And so let's start creating your business plan together in the next lecture where we discuss step 1.

241
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.510
Thanks again and let's get.
