00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.390
In order to get started with step one please click on this button called inputs plus analysis.

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.660
And as always whenever you click a button you'll notice that it turns green.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.750
And so when you see this blue column here in the middle on most of these entries here most of these

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.090
tabs those are my sample answers for Tony Sharq from shart virtual reality and you can click here to

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.530
learn more about Tony.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.180
It's fictional Of course.

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.260
And here are your answers and please only input stuff in this entire spreadsheet in white cells and

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
I'll tell you exactly went to to answer any answers in any cells.

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.210
And so before we get started helping you answer some of these questions.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.840
You'll notice that a lot of the parts of each question start with these underscored characters together.

11
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.140
And the reason is number one if you want you can click here and go to any entry anywhere in the entire

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.430
course that you've answered.

13
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.880
So for example let's say you answered a question about a cancer seal and don't worry if you don't have

14
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.390
faience experience I'll explain everything to you from scratch.

15
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.930
But you would select that you'll see here that it appears right here accounts receivable and we can

16
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.470
click here to go back to the home screen or we can go here and go to the home screen.

17
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.360
There's many different ways to do stuff in this course.

18
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.460
Or you can just click on these tabs here.

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.230
Now if you can't see this please go to View formula bar or up here view formula bar as well.

20
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.900
Okay great.

21
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.200
And another reason why you have all of these different underscored characters is because later in the

22
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.980
course right here in the final outputs part we're going to put all of our fields into the appropriate

23
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.710
fields here on whatever business plan template you choose and we'll get to discussing this a lot more

24
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.970
detail later in the course.

25
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.720
Okay.

26
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.360
Now on the right side here if you scroll over and this is optional you'll never have to look here if

27
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.530
you don't want to.

28
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.420
But right here I created this optional column here so you can select to red flag certain answers so

29
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
everything is defaulted towards This is my final question but if you want to come back to a question

30
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.220
you can always go here and select come back to this question.

31
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.460
And you'll notice that right here when you do that a red flag will appear and you'll see up here that

32
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.690
there's one flag for this part of the Course here.

33
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.500
Step one and it doesn't matter where we go in the entire course because wherever we click we're in to

34
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.810
see that up here in the menu we have one flag left.

35
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.600
OK let's go back now to inputs and analysis.

36
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.300
OK great.

37
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.720
And one more thing I want to mention here is if you haven't answered a question yet and you want to

38
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.900
filter you can do so right here by selecting the filter based on questions that have not been answered

39
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.850
yes meaning the word no.

40
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.080
And a lot of these are optional.

41
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.630
As I mentioned before there's two tracks a fast track and the detail track the detail track is just

42
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.480
answering everything.

43
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.310
The fast track is ignoring all the optionals.

44
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.920
OK.

45
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.630
And as you complete each question him watch what happens.

46
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.160
So let me pretend your name is John Smith.

47
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.690
OK.

48
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.990
So right here you're going to see that step one has now been updated in case 6 percent done 6 percent

49
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.560
done.

50
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.240
And this needle for the whole course will move as well.

51
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.830
As you complete your answers and you can override that for every single step by going here and clicking

52
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.890
right here that you're done with that tab and that will change that to 100 percent see 100 percent done.

53
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.950
And we're now done 7 percent of the questions in the entire course this needle moves as well.

54
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.640
And I set it up so that if you minimize this you can actually see your whole progress as well.

55
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.300
OK.

56
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.750
Let me de-select that and let's move on.

57
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.930
So after you enter your first name obviously entry the name your company here as well and then enter

58
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.560
in 15 words or less about what your company does.

59
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.750
And again you can always use my examples here in the middle and blue for sample answers.

60
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.100
Make sure the first words capitalize and don't put a period at the end you'll see why later is a lot

61
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.010
more sense as your business plan is created automatically for you from scratch.

62
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.420
OK so here we have our first optional question which is is this company name of yours used or not.

63
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.370
And you could search the internet to see if it's used or not.

64
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.140
And here you just select that and select yes or no or not a playable.

65
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.720
Here you enter in your e-mail address and your Internet address if you have an internet address that

66
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.960
is if you don't have an internet or a web page set up then I suggest going to Squarespace dot com and

67
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.450
setting up a page there if you want to.

68
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.690
And there's other places online as well that you can do so if you have questions about this please let

69
00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.110
me know.

70
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.440
But the Web site for Harroun ventures on my Web site whatever was was created using Squarespace as well

71
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.350
as shark virtual reality dot com which is for the the case.

72
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.900
OK.

73
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.030
So and here you slack.

74
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.740
Have you done a web site created web site or not here.

75
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.600
It's optional but you enter in your business address because it's going to feed into several areas in

76
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.230
your business plan as well as on the cover page and I'll show you that more detail soon.

77
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.370
OK.

78
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.310
And here and this is optional but you can write down if you want why you chose that address.

79
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.710
You know if for example I used to work at a venture capital firm on Market Street in San Francisco in

80
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.490
the Tenderloin District because we were given payroll tax incentives by the local government to locate

81
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.190
there and sometimes you're your investors or whoever is reading your business plan might ask you why

82
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.650
you selected to live or or start your company a certain area.

83
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.950
So just be ready for that.

84
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.650
And this is a very comprehensive exercise here this entire spreadsheet is so that when you submit your

85
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.610
business plan to whoever is going to read it we have left.

86
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.310
No.

87
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.340
No stone unturned.

88
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.380
Answer your phone number here make your cell phone if you want here entering what country your business

89
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.910
is in and make this the primary one where you get a plan to file taxes.

90
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.900
If you're going to file taxes at all.

91
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.180
A lot of times people taken this course will read the business plan but not launch the company.

92
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.580
My goal here is to make sure that we've covered every question you can possibly think of.

93
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.650
So you can decide to weather launch whether you launch your company or not.

94
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.650
This one here is important and I didn't make this optional.

95
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.950
I won't answer this one.

96
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.120
I want you to select who is reading this.

97
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.430
OK and if it's an investor select that if it's you select that if it's your team etc. You can read the

98
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.790
rest of these or not applicable.

99
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.620
And I'm doing this because I want you to tailor how you answer these questions based on who your customer

100
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.740
is.

101
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.980
I mean who's reading this reports.

102
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:07.060
OK so if you select That's what happens is on every single input tab I always remind you who the reader

103
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.980
is.

104
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.210
Can I also remind you what your business model is so that we don't become victims together of style

105
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.040
drift meaning writing a business model about something that's not important to our core business model.

106
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.950
So I'll give you an example.

107
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.890
If I right here our core product what is it.

108
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.440
Let me just copy and paste what they have here for fun.

109
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.110
Copy and paste and you'll notice that it doesn't matter where we go in the course later we're always

110
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.650
going to be reminded who is reading this business plan and what our business is can this is optional

111
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.000
be you can read this here every tabun says this as you answer all questions keep in mind two things

112
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.610
number one.

113
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.330
What business are you in.

114
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.620
And then number two who's the target reader.

115
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.800
And then here I put it in for you.

116
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.580
Virtual reality software that puts you in movies and video games or whatever your answer is there and

117
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.590
then you wrote that the are you select you the primary reader is its investor.

118
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:14.320
In this case and I do that also because if you're going to create presentation slides and I won't talk

119
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.980
about this much until we get there in the course but let me click there for a second.

120
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.170
If you're going to create presentations slides and by the way everything that you enter in and all the

121
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:30.450
questions and steps 1 through 12 will be answered here not 13 but 12th and it'll automatically be populated

122
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:37.510
you'll have 10 slides here based on your answers that you can use to copy and paste into a number of

123
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.080
different templates that I will provide you with for powerpoint templates.

124
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.700
Click here to get those online.

125
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.760
Or you can get them in the course as well.

126
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:51.460
And then when you're here you can just click on any area that take you back to where you entered that.

127
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:57.190
So it's it's hyperlink so if we click there we'll go back to the industry problem part which is covered

128
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.630
here in in in Step 6.

129
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.930
And again if you're ever confused about where you answered something you can always go here and then

130
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.990
just scroll down and look at the answer.

131
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.650
OK.

132
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.310
And I include a lot of sample answers as well.

133
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.980
Explain that.

134
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.530
So if we go up here to back to our first step one turns green.

135
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.030
OK.

136
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:31.860
And we're not sure if if we entered in an email address then what I've done is if you look here when

137
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:38.340
I select Here you see here this is your email address that just tags this field and that's mine.

138
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.410
Sample.

139
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.940
So if you go up here you can go down to sample and see what was Chris's answer again for for all these

140
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.070
things for our email address Oh what was Chris's employee recruiting strategy answer.

141
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.240
And I clicked there and it goes directly here.

142
00:09:53.250 --> 00:10:00.060
So the employee recruiting strategy which is step four inputs and then here is your employer recruiting

143
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.670
strategy.

144
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:07.740
So you can always get into the bottom and then scroll by your to find out more details on what you entered

145
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.720
in if anything for those those those those answers.

146
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.360
OK.

147
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.950
Let's go back here and make some more progress.

148
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.710
And there's always different ways to access each tab.

149
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:24.540
You can click on the buttons or you can click on the tabs down here or you can click here and go to

150
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.230
whatever tab.

151
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:32.590
So if I want to go to the Home tab I go there and you get the idea or you can click here to go backwards

152
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.450
or forwards whatever it might be.

153
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:40.240
Again I like to always provide me different ways to access information in my templates here.

154
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.790
OK.

155
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:41.370
Moving on.

156
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.880
And if you ever get lost and you're way way down on a certain tab you want to go back to the top.

157
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.680
Just click here and I'll always take you right back to the top here.

158
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:54.010
Now here this is optional but I won't answer if you're using this business plan to raise money or not

159
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.050
because it will help you later on with how you write your business plan and how you might create your

160
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:05.230
slides if you do that here you select from the dropdown what your your company was founded and these

161
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.290
fields will fill in will play.

162
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:13.930
These fields will fill directly into an incredibly intuitive and easy to use process so that your business

163
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:14.860
plan is created for you.

164
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.660
You'll see and do your business or industry name here.

165
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.290
And here is this is optional.

166
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.540
But select your legal structure here.

167
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.860
Now I'm not a lawyer so I'm not going to give legal advice but going to tell you how I do things.

168
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.450
But I always suggest you speak with a lawyer in your country who understands your laws much better than

169
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.250
I ever will.

170
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:38.480
But I recommend that if you're going to start this company for real and generate revenue to register

171
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:45.410
your company because what happens is it protects you and your family from people suing you for whatever

172
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.220
reason especially as you get really successful you'll see people who see you they always do.

173
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.190
But this will protect you so that they can't come after your stuff and you know hurt your standard of

174
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.840
living or take your house away and so a limited liability corporation is called different things in

175
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.460
different countries.

176
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.820
But it's all similar which basically means that your liabilities are limited.

177
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:11.690
It's called Elsy that sort of thing so I'll let you worry about that if you want and it's all optional.

178
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:17.300
Now if you're going to file patents now explain what all this stuff means in a second but if you're

179
00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.560
going to file patents or copyrights or trademarks you want to select here.

180
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:21.940
Yes.

181
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.520
No we're not a placable.

182
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.770
Now really quickly.

183
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.100
A patent is a way of protecting the way to do something.

184
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.350
So for example Amazon tried to patent their one click shopping experience.

185
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:39.550
Right that's a way of shopping if you want to copyright something that means if if you want to create

186
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.940
legal rights for you to own something you can't see feel or touch like music or software code etc..

187
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:54.070
You can get a copyright done and here a trademark if you want to protect a brand or a slogan like Nike

188
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.690
did with just do it that sort of thing.

189
00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:03.970
So when you file for a patent because the patent court's globally are so backed up you'll notice a lot

190
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:09.820
of people will say patent pending and legally in many countries patent pending is just as good as patent

191
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.820
filed and received.

192
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:17.920
And if you want more details on how to do these three things here and again I'm not a lawyer but you

193
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.520
can always click here.

194
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:26.790
Can I provide you with a number of different types of resources in case so down here there is there

195
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.390
is one on Patten's.

196
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:34.850
There's one on an NDA which will come to really soon and you can look and look at this stuff online.

197
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.190
And I created a video for you so this one here is called the easiest and cheapest way to file copyrights

198
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.500
patents trademarks and make term sheets cetera.

199
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:48.490
So if you want more details on that you click that's And then you click what appears here in this hyperlink

200
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.770
and it'll take you directly to a YouTube video or whatever to wash that that I created for you all optional

201
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.570
of course.

202
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.720
OK so moving on right here.

203
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.220
Who's the owner of the company.

204
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.330
And these are all optional right yourself if it's you if it's the number of people write down their

205
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.180
names.

206
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.900
And then here do you plan on having people that read your business plan sign what's called an NDA or

207
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:16.070
a non-disclosure agreement which means if they sign it then they can't copy or use any of this stuff.

208
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.780
They learn select yes no or it doesn't apply here.

209
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.240
Again consult with a lawyer if you're curious.

210
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:27.750
On my humble thoughts on this process you can always scroll down and select this video here.

211
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.250
Should you ask investors to sign an NDA.

212
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.050
Please seek your own legal counsel and advice.

213
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.160
But this is just my humble opinion for what it's worth.

214
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.550
OK.

215
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.350
Next up is have you registered your company name.

216
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.650
Say yes no or not applicable right here.

217
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:51.210
If you want you can do a search online to see if somebody is already trademarked your name or not.

218
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:57.960
And if you want to watch how to do that you can always just scroll down and select to watch that legal

219
00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.200
one that I created here.

220
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.420
The easiest way to fall copyrights trademarks patents.

221
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.710
Make term sheets etc..

222
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.300
OK.

223
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.250
And of course you can do a search online to see if someone's already created the Web site for your company.

224
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.430
OK.

225
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.940
And the whole point of this entire process this whole document is to save you money and time as well.

226
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.720
So you know based on your search you might want to call your company something else.

227
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.720
OK.

228
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.910
Next up is do you have business insurance like.

229
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.250
Yes.

230
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.860
No we're not a placable.

231
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:33.030
And if you start your company and you have employees and you generating revenue then I humbly recommend

232
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.180
getting business insurance against speak to a local lawyer that can help you this.

233
00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.420
I'm not a lawyer.

234
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.340
Next you can select.

235
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:44.790
Have you looked into getting a government grants and a lot of countries will give you grants for your

236
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.760
business and they'll ask you to pay it back or not.

237
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:57.690
For example when I was I was 18 and I got a student venture capital loan from the government of Canada.

238
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.130
And so I selected Canada here for my my sample country.

239
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.690
And sometimes the flag shows up sometimes it doesn't no probably show up in yours for some reason it

240
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.700
doesn't always show up on mine.

241
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:14.700
But whatever company or country you select if you scroll down not only can you get details on taxes

242
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.900
and all that good stuff and the big banks in your country and I have data here for every country on

243
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.430
the planet but in many of the countries I try to get data from all of them.

244
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:30.900
If you click here you can actually go online and get helpful resources from the country you're in.

245
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.580
I'll turn this back on I usually turn off and I'm broadcasting on get those annoying pop ups but if

246
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.180
I were to click here for example for a candidate because I selected Canada.

247
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:46.830
This will open up a Web site it won't open all these tabs is just web my computer set up and this is

248
00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.950
a wonderful place to get resources.

249
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:55.650
If you have questions about this please let me know and if either the links are incorrect for your country

250
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.590
please let me know and I'll I'll correct them right away.

251
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.210
Thanks.

252
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:06.270
And you can always tell what country and currency your business plan dashboard here is set up as you

253
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.050
can always come here to the settings to change.

254
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.230
If you want.

255
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:09.700
OK.

256
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.400
Moving on.

257
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.190
And I'm just going to cut down here.

258
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.440
I'm clicking on here instead of slacking up there because I want to remember where I was instead of

259
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.690
going on Mackley the top.

260
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.530
OK.

261
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:24.900
Next up here is where you enter your employee names and this is all optional because a lot of people

262
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:30.020
when they start their companies they actually don't have employee names at all.

263
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:35.730
And so what you can do is answer them here we're going to do just for fun is I'm going to copy and paste

264
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:40.410
the names of all my employees into this site here.

265
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.290
OK and let's just pretend to have nine employees and not ten.

266
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:52.520
OK so I'm going to go here and I'm going to pay special because I want the values and not the blue format.

267
00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.300
OK OK scrolling down here.

268
00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:04.740
All right now this part here is completely optional but if you have more than one person in your company

269
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:10.590
you can write down who's in charge of completing step one who's in charge clean step two step three

270
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.450
rinse and repeat you get the idea all the way down to the end of course and skip this if this isn't

271
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.260
of interest to you.

272
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.520
But if you're working with several employees or in a big company creating a business plan you're going

273
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.920
to love this feature.

274
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:28.040
So what you'll do is you will select who's going to do this step here.

275
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:35.300
So what you do is you scroll here select here and then select this dropdown here and you select the

276
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.190
employee.

277
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:36.610
OK.

278
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:42.620
So let's say we want Scarlett Johansson or Ryan Reynolds.

279
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.300
These are not real people.

280
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.760
Reynolds actually is Canadian.

281
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.390
It's from a from a country.

282
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:54.030
OK great so we selected Scarlett Kaye and she is going to do.

283
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.940
And you'll see that all of a sudden up here it appears you know step one is aside.

284
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.790
Is this a sign to Scarlett and Jozen.

285
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.330
And then what you can do is you can enter a date when you want.

286
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.300
Step 1 to be completed and this is all optional because it has optional over here so let's just say

287
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:20.520
February 1st 2019 for example and you'll see that if you enter in a date here this is going to be updated

288
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.610
right here.

289
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:27.180
Ok for that step if you did the same thing for step two and this is the last one I'll show you an example

290
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.460
on them.

291
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.520
They'll move on.

292
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:39.440
But let's say you selected Steve Rogers OK and we enter into a date for Steve to do step two and let's

293
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:44.070
say we want step 2 which is the cover page to be done by Steve.

294
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:50.210
By February 3rd 2019 Okay.

295
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:57.470
And that will appear only on the step to page so if I were to select.

296
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.770
Step 2 watch what happens here you'll see that it changes here to it's assigned to Steve Rogers and

297
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.500
it's due February 3rd.

298
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:09.700
If you don't enter in anything for those two fields I just told you about then you won't see anything

299
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.580
like for example for Step 3.

300
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.190
I didn't answer.

301
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.080
I didn't enter in anything here.

302
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:14.300
OK.

303
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.950
But I can't if I want to be on McQuade's.
