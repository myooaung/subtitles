00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,840
Welcome to step 10 of the course in terms of the what why and how of Sept. 10.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,300
I'll kick off the what.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,600
What are we going to learn.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:15,630
We will discuss our past if applicable and our future milestones including a product or service that

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,310
we create and when we want to be created by.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:26,730
We also talk about revenue milestones our break even milestone are optional unit sales milestones our

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,330
total addressable market percent capture milestones as well as our geographic and industry vertical

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,310
milestones.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,300
We also talk about our exit strategy milestones like an IPO and much much more.

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,570
Let's move on to why.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,070
Why are we talking about milestones and why are we doing this so late in the business planning process.

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,360
Because we not only want to show the reader of the business plan what our product or service vision

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,770
and road map is but we really want to do this close to Step 12 meaning the financial part of our business

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,820
plan has a lot of what we're going to document here in Step 10 being the milestone section can be used

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,170
to create our financial model in Step 12.

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,900
Lastly how how are we going to complete part 10.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,360
Well we will answer the questions in the inputs and analysis tab and you're to notice here that I included

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,220
several of these optional questions here because many of us haven't achieved past milestones in our

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,410
business models especially if we're writing a business plan for a company that hasn't even launched

20
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,920
yet.

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,740
So all we'd care about his future milestones in that case.

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,880
And so if you click on the output button here you'll see that I provided checkboxes for you in case

23
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,690
you want to omit the past milestone and additional future milestone options here.

24
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,090
Thanks.
