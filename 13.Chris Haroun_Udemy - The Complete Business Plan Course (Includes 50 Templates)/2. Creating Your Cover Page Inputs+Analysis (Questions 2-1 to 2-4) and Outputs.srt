1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,400
Please click on this button here.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,940
Inputs and analysis.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,680
Now this is a very short step it's really easy to do.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,250
The first question is have you created a logo for your company.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,710
Just select yes or no or not a playable.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,810
And then when you get your logo you can paste it here.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,960
And actually what I'll do is I'll show you actually how I got my logo done in more detail.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,730
All you got to do is just click on this link here and I'll show you how I I had this done I use five

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:37,500
or dot com and these are the four logos that the person I used over five or dot com that's five 5 we

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,080
are with another our comp and I selected to use this one for my sample company and you can paste your

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,150
logo here if you want to if it's applicable.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,130
And then just entering your cover page date here and then illegal disclosure in every country is different

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,480
but select for legal disclosure we want or select not to put a legal disclosure so I'll just like the

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,980
first one for example and everything that we do on this slab will be reflected in the next slide as

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,150
well so I can select this one here and you see how shark virtual reality is used here is because I mentioned

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,640
in my name if you went to your name as well you're coming company I mean it should appear again.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,100
So after you've answered those those questions a short one.

18
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,440
You can click this to mark this as a 100 percent done.

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:35,080
Or you can actually answer the questions and it will automatically update here to be done or not.

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,630
There's only two questions that you have to answer here.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,040
And that's why it says 50 percent done because there's only four questions right.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,810
So this one we answered.

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,510
And if you were to answer this one too it would appear so let's just say.

24
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:56,540
No September 1st 2019 and so this here will then change to 100 percent.

25
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,070
You can always use manual override but this button to say 100 percent as well.

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,100
And you'll see here that this needle has moved in the whole course.

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,340
We're now down 14 percent of the course.

28
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,180
OK great.

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,100
So listen now click on the output and see what our output looks like.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,500
So if you enter in your information here business name Kate the company in it and if you entered in

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,560
here your product or service subscription then it would appear here just like mine.

32
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,560
And we just entered the date together over that which did that.

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,070
So that appears here.

34
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,240
What sort of accident that appears down here and then your name and then if you entered in a web address

35
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,720
the issue up here and your post addressed as well just you can enter this information here just in this

36
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,320
part.

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,880
Here is Kobuk.

38
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,870
Step 1 do it.

39
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:51,110
And if you're always curious where a field came from you can always just copy it and then paste it in

40
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,650
here.

41
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,410
I'll show you.

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,370
So what you do is go here.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,080
There hit enter and then it'll take you directly back.

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,660
Right here see where we created that field.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,070
Can your Internet address.

46
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,630
Okay great.

47
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,850
So let's go back now to your cover page and so based on what you entered in you have your cover page

48
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,780
done here and this here is my sample and this is yours.

49
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,180
OK.

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,790
I always have sample in the middle of shark virtual reality the pretend company and then yours is on

51
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,760
the right here.

52
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:26,690
And what you do is if you scroll down see every cover page is numbered right page 5 cover page 6 whatever

53
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,300
it is all the way down to her page 50.

54
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,850
This is a big document.

55
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,250
So select whatever cover page that you want to use for your final output here.

56
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,480
And it will feed through later and you'll see why in a second.

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,560
So if we're to select.

58
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,850
Cover Page number one for example.

59
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,620
Then we would take a note of this because later on when we create our business plan the final output

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,670
if we click here it'll say right here blow you blow you'll find your final business plan content.

61
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:04,700
Since you selected page 1 in step 2 which we just did then download the Microsoft Word business plan

62
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,620
template called business plan template.

63
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,530
One you can download this by going to the course or you can just click here to go to my Web site and

64
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,190
download it.

65
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,990
And so when he downloaded it looked like this here business plan template one.

66
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,470
And here's all the fields.

67
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:20,810
OK.

68
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,200
But we'll talk about completing this in much more detail and a lot of this stuff is optional.

69
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,890
But I want to be very thorough.

70
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,790
So again what we'll talk about this later on in the course when we actually create your final output

71
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,580
here in the step here.

72
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,180
So we're now done with with Step 2.

73
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,620
So please make sure that it says 100 percent done.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,310
You can answer the questions here or you can click here to manually override and it will say 100 percent.

75
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,660
So now we are 14 percent of the way done through the course.

76
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,020
Thanks.
