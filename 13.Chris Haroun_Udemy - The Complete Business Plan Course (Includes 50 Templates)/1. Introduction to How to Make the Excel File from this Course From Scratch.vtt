I had so much fun making Excel dashboard document this course that I want to share with you how I made

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.320
this document from scratch even if you have no experience at all with Excel and I didn't use any code

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.930
or any macros and all the buttons you see here are just simple images with hypertext links.

4
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.080
And I want to show you how I made this so that you can create your own dashboard Excel files and impress

5
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.130
people that you work with or for or your employees etc..

6
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.160
And so it's also just a lot of fun to create these documents and it makes I don't know it makes it not

7
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.000
feel like work.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It makes it feel like fun and then never I never saw any part of this course or the Excel creation as

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.990
far as work.

10
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.640
It's so much fun for me to create and I hope you enjoy the process as well which is why I want to explain

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.470
it to you.

12
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.440
And so in the lectures after this one what I'll do is I'll explain exactly how I architected this fun

13
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.510
to use spreadsheet from scratch.

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.900
Thanks.
