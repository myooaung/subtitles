WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.990
So now we're going to go directly over here.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.120
To business plan.

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.880
OK.

4
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.590
So here's what we're going to first.

5
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.430
You're going to download your templates.

6
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.440
And so if you haven't already selected what template you're going to use I selected one then go back

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.580
here to the outputs.

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.650
So we go to the upper tier and you can scroll down and select whatever cover page you want.

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.880
And the rest of the contents will be similar.

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.300
I allowed you to update your foot header and footer yourself.

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.960
I kept it simple just patients but the rest is the same thing so you're just going to select whatever

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.620
cover page you want.

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.570
So I selected her page number one.

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.880
And based on what you select.

15
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.220
Ill tell you what to do next in terms of down the document here.

16
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.830
So I selected cover page number one.

17
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.640
And for those you care about how I create this I use what's called an array.

18
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.420
And you can watch the last part here in the course to find out how I did this Excel stuff from scratch

19
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.210
if you're a nerd like I'm not a nerd.

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.120
I am but you're not.

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.940
OK.

22
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.890
So here it says.

23
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.010
Well first of all it says before looking at the rows below make sure to watch the lecture you're watching

24
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.250
right now whatever you can click here and I put it online as well.

25
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
In case you want quick access there kind of like I did for all these little question marks here if you

26
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.100
click them.

27
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.710
So it says here that I should get a business plan template when you can download from the course or

28
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.130
you can click here to go to my Web site to download any of the 50 or all 50 whatever you want to do.

29
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.250
So once you've done that how much can you use sample number one to keep it easy.

30
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.980
What I want you to do is I want you to go to properties and then if this is optional but I want delete

31
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.620
this and just put your name in there.

32
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.810
And the reason I says sometimes it's tag they they can see who the author is.

33
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.750
I don't want to say my name I should just empty that open.

34
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.920
It's already submitted.

35
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.360
OK John Smith and then you can click here to watch a video which is the video you're watching right

36
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.800
now.

37
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
So that's kind of a moot point but let me delete that highlight and delete it.

38
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.770
OK.

39
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.320
And then this here this entire table of contents is going to update as we complete the document.

40
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.020
And I wrote here a little note which says Right click on here and update the field you know after you

41
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.270
finish it and then select entire table so I delete this now you can delete this yellow box at the end

42
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.100
if you want.

43
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.350
OK.

44
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.010
So just go here.

45
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.280
OK great.

46
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.190
All right good.

47
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.370
And we're going to fill this entire bad boy together.

48
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.170
And there are some other notes there too as well which I'll go over in a second.

49
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.070
All right.

50
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.110
Let's get started let's go back here.

51
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.890
And if you look here actually it says here's all the fields we're going to fit into here.

52
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.290
And the reason it's got that little underline there is you can notice it but but I Pontious space there

53
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.300
and in a period a white period on a white background just so that you don't delete the paragraph mark

54
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.120
which is that if you cross the return Mark.

55
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.340
OK.

56
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.760
All right.

57
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.470
So the first thing we do is when we get our company name and I put it all here for you directly cast

58
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.450
here that your company name is here so just select not this is like this here.

59
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.090
And you're going to copy and paste special k so if you had a company name here you would just hit copy

60
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.010
and then pay special.

61
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.670
But what I'll do is just for fun I'm going to go back to your company name and there's many ways to

62
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.300
go during your show.

63
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.690
The longways for fun.

64
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.170
So let's say you want to change your company name.

65
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.750
I know you already put it in the bag and we go here.

66
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.910
I'm going to change a couple things.

67
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.960
So your company name here is empty.

68
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.080
And so I got a call it's breakfast ups

69
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.440
Breakfast at Tiffany's.

70
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.390
I don't know I have that song in my head right now.

71
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.740
Breakfast at Tiffany's.

72
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.480
Here's your sample product description.

73
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.540
E-mail address all that stuff you get the idea.

74
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.070
OK.

75
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.110
Let me go back here to the business plan and that will be located there.

76
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.280
I can't get the song in my head.

77
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.000
OK.

78
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.940
So this year what we'll do is just copy it and don't select the whole thing is this for sale here copy.

79
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.450
And that will go here.

80
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.770
And then what you can do is highlight this don't hide the whole row because it might like the paragraph

81
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.860
mark just highlight this and then make sure you're back here like that like don't do it like that.

82
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.910
It's tedious but once we get this process down it's really quick.

83
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.180
And then we're going to do.

84
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.850
You're going to pay special because we don't want to mess up the formatting in this whole documents

85
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.840
to text only because this is where we go.

86
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.690
And then your product or company or service description which is here are a sample subscription.

87
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.980
So your products are scription.

88
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.990
You can always go back and get it if you don't have it yet and you cannot use has dropped in here.

89
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.840
Copy again just like the first cell not the whole thing here.

90
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.530
And I'm going to go through here and I'm going to paste the text once again.

91
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.960
And then your cover page date which is here.

92
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.790
And this only needs to be done once.

93
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.510
Just for fun consistency.

94
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.890
I'm going to go like this and just go right to that.

95
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.020
All right pays special as texts.

96
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.550
All right.

97
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.450
And then your first and last name and obviously it's right here it's pretty easy.

98
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.080
OK.

99
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.240
And once we get this out of the way it's a pretty quick kale paste here.

100
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.530
And then same thing email address you can get all that stuff.

101
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.120
And then if you have a legal disclosure you just copy here Otherwise skip this part.

102
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.670
And if you want you can consult a local lawyer wherever you're located.

103
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:29.520
I'm a lawyer.

104
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.450
So pay special text only here.

105
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.390
There it is that's fine.

106
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.130
OK.

107
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.930
So and I'm assuming you did that as well.

108
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.250
And if this stuff is not relevant to you you can still eat those whatever.

109
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.830
OK.

110
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.530
Great.

111
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.850
Great.

112
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.100
And don't worry that you got the underline here it won't appear that way obviously when you print it

113
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.740
and when you go to File Save As PTF if you wanted to go to PTF here it looks a lot different in the

114
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.690
Windows version but it's all the same.

115
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.060
Obviously it's not going to show up either.

116
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.050
You can just ignore that but the great thing about doing this now is we can look at our grammar.

117
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.710
And also we can look at our spelling here because there will be spelling mistakes are there always are

118
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.820
for me at least.

119
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.780
Now before we move on I want to show you quickly how to do the image.

120
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.320
So if you had the image and you create your own logo you can go back to step two and grab it there if

121
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.790
you want and everybody has a different way of creating their own graphic art.

122
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.760
And I want to appeal to everybody but what you can do is if you created your own logo you can bring

123
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.670
it in kind of like I have these here.

124
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.320
And if you're curious on it if you haven't done so already.

125
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.240
Whatever if you want to create a logo for five bucks which is how much it literally cost me for this.

126
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.160
You can click here and watch a video on that.

127
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.830
You can just copy this and bring it over.

128
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.310
So copy and then go here and then just kind of paste it in and get rid of this.

129
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:56.590
And you know for those of you that have those you that have and you have to like that to Senator as

130
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.690
well.

131
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.170
If you have a background you want to get rid of save it's a different color from the White background

132
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.630
here.

133
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:10.210
What you can do is if you don't use advanced software you can always just just use this and go here

134
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.940
in a picture format and remove the background and then you can highlight what you want to keep what

135
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.550
you want to move.

136
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.830
So let's say I want to remove for whatever reason everything except for the Blue those blue there.

137
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.270
This is ridiculous but I'll click there.

138
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.900
It looks like that but I don't get controls to undo that.

139
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.290
And it's up to you how you do it.

140
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.450
And if you want to change the color formatting here as well you can just click on this and it works

141
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.860
pretty cool when it comes to right clicking and all the mike Savel personated develop like Microsoft

142
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.790
technolgies back in the 90s.

143
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.050
I am that old bone you Right-Click.

144
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.830
You can it.

145
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.350
Microsoft always anticipates what you're trying to Shingo format shape.

146
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.840
And then here you can change how it's filled in and you can choose whatever color you want.

147
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.980
But what I recommend doing is matching your logo.

148
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.630
OK so if you click here let's just say you want to match that color there in your logo just to be consistent

149
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.800
on the page select that there then go OK.

150
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:14.230
And that will happen is we'll match it down there you see so whatever color you're using customized

151
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:14.440
for you.

152
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.230
And again don't worry about these little grammatical errors here.

153
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.400
What you should do is if you do see a different color there and put those periods in for that technical

154
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.740
reason but delete all those if you want to keep your cover page looks like this.

155
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.380
If you don't have all the details here you can delete it.

156
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.290
If you don't have disclosure you can delete that and keep it there.

157
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.120
And that looks kind of nice actually.

158
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.240
I like that better.

159
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.990
OK.

160
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.770
All right great.

161
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:45.140
Moving on and we're going to update the executive summary first so I can click this to go there.

162
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.080
It's really cool.

163
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.270
Check this out.

164
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.280
And I include this here for you.

165
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.930
You can ignore this if you want.

166
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.050
I'm just I was assuming some people might open this up without me there with them and I want to I don't

167
00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.850
really get.

168
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.610
Right.

169
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.440
And so it's all based on the field so leave that there if you want to or delete it if you're going to

170
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.730
stay with me through this process and just do what I do.

171
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.840
If you wants.

172
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.380
OK.

173
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.780
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to put in this stuff here.

174
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.490
And I gave you a couple of ways to do it.

175
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.220
OK.

176
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.930
Just because I always love to give you a couple different ways to do soften my course.

177
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.800
So if you're to scroll down you can copy and paste your company a market overview here.

178
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.170
I'm going to show you how I do it here.

179
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.030
A couple of ways.

180
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.060
So right here because it has company Mark or if you go here again just kind of highlight it just up

181
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.300
until the end here and then you can go paste special next day or what you can do.

182
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.010
Oh see that that's a mistake it's a typo.

183
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.330
OK.

184
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.980
And a lot of the information that I have in here is not going to make sense anyway so I just threw in

185
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.670
dummy data here.

186
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:56.790
But if you were to copy and paste this instead it'll work out better because that's the real deal.

187
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.170
Let me just go get control Z and then I will go pay special.

188
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.120
Come on pay special off my computer so slow.

189
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.080
Keep text over that picture.

190
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.760
Don't do that.

191
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.560
We'll do that later.

192
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.130
OK.

193
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.290
There goes it appears there which makes it I still made a mistake.

194
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.690
Comma there you are backspace Backspacer.

195
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.980
OK great.

196
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.670
And I want to show you another way to do it though so you can copy and paste like I just showed you.

197
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.130
OK.

198
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.370
Just you can move down through the entire business plan and then copy and paste special for all these

199
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.670
things.

200
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.380
It's an order.

201
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.860
So what I did was I pulled out all these outputs.

202
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.090
I put them all here including the financials in a beautiful order.

203
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.440
So it's it's it's really nicely format.

204
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.500
If you venture information I'm going to show you how to create everything from scratch.

205
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.820
If you scroll down to the very bottom is there and what you want to do is I'm going to go scroll down

206
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.070
a second story more stuff but I always show you a second way to access your data.

207
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.140
So many controls the couple times get rid of this.

208
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.920
There you get.

209
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:02.720
So I'm going to copy this here copy and let's say you have no idea where this came from.

210
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:10.300
So if you wanted to paste here hit enter and there it is there it takes you directly here.

211
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:10.630
Right.

212
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.180
All those fields are mapped for you it's pretty cool.

213
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.780
And then you can copy it and then pay special k like I should.

214
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.730
Now before we start doing the rest of our document one issue is topical.

215
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.540
So let's first of all hide this let's assume that we want more room in you know the drill with this.

216
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.160
I'll take a second or so to hide it.

217
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.170
My computers are really slow today.

218
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:42.790
But you can also do is there go about what you can also do is you can click this and this will collapse

219
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.210
everything for you.

220
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.800
So you can understand from a higher level perspective it's a lot of fun together.

221
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:55.280
So this is step two step three step four and it's in order with how we're completing this.

222
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.400
And it directly mirrors what's in your contents here.

223
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.160
And these two are the subheadings these ones.

224
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.990
So you've got heading one who's heading one heading two's heading threes.

225
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.430
So usually heading ones and twos having one having two.

226
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.570
OK so product and services adding one.

227
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.830
And these are heading to.

228
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:21.940
So if we look at product and service that's heading one we've got a bunch of having TOS here and this

229
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:28.030
is all heading TOS for product and service so if we were to open this here and it's right below and

230
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.070
it takes a second to open I usually leave them all open and just a lot faster that way.

231
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.990
Because it takes a while to kind of it's compressing a lot of pictures and financial data as well.

232
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.740
But here's what looks like.

233
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:46.260
So this here is the step five product and services page and all the headings here will be mapped.

234
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:51.460
If you wrote stuff to directly here and I'll walk you through this whole process and merge before I

235
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.070
had these and it remembers what you selected before.

236
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.810
So you can click this to make it service only this product or find better.

237
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.030
So I'm confused.

238
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:06.750
So what I want to do is I'm now going to open up all of these in a second.

239
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.330
I just want to show you everything.

240
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.220
High level to see what it looks like together.

241
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.150
There you go.

242
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.600
All right.

243
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.540
And the financial stuff we have here as well.

244
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.350
Lots of financial stuff.

245
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.400
And then the appendix stuff there as well.

246
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.180
Look on this.

247
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.410
A lot of work we did here but it can be worth it.

248
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:22.980
OK.

249
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.880
So now I'm going to open up everything

250
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:34.710
and this is going to open up every one of these rows and make sure that all of your step 12 financials

251
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.210
statements have all the groups open like I mentioned before.

252
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.980
And if you have questions about that please let me know and you can also do is I know that a lot of

253
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.810
you are actually going to probably put this Excel spreadsheet on the left side and the Word doc on the

254
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:49.550
right side.

255
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.090
So I was anticipating that and what you can do if you want as you can.

256
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:59.880
You can hide or you can scroll over to hide this blue stuff of mine I'll show you what that means in

257
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.920
a second.

258
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.580
So let me just truncate that.

259
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.470
Let's get an update here in a second.

260
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:05.220
OK.

261
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.630
So what you can do is see how I froze the panes here.

262
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:15.750
You can unfreeze the panes if you want to go to unfreeze paint and look at them but you can just scroll

263
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.870
over here so that you don't see my my dummy data is just yours.

264
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:28.290
And a lot of people might want to see if I can do this you might want to take this and put this window

265
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:33.110
on the left and then on the right put the the word documents.

266
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.120
And if you don't do that just fast forward to this point here the lower third but I want to show you

267
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.850
for fun.

268
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.360
OK so we're going to go here OK.

269
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.940
So it's different like if you're on Windows you can actually hit escape before I do that.

270
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.340
But if your windows are going to drag the item over if you're in a Mac you're just going to do it I

271
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.200
just showed you there.

272
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.520
OK.

273
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.830
So anyway you've got both on each side.

274
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:59.780
And I want to show you one more thing because I don't know what resolution you're using or Zoom wise.

275
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.280
So I also gave the option to close that there that group.

276
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.420
And it's just going to have your information on the right side if you want to just copy and paste each

277
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.610
item and you look at that.

278
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.140
Yeah.

279
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.140
So you can do it this way as well.

280
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.530
So for your executive summary just you're going to copy and paste your stuff there.

281
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.350
What a way to do it.

282
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.170
I'm going to show you just my stuff I'm going to go on high speed mode and just pay copy and paste this

283
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.190
stuff here which is all my dummy data.

284
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.780
So I'm going high speed now and I'll complete the rest of this

285
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:36.630
OK.

286
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.710
If you don't have a board of advisors you can just highlight this and delete this entirely.

287
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.920
I go back in a high speed mode and finish this off.

288
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.260
End for the product image.

289
00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.930
If you don't have it here you might have had it earlier in the course somewhere else where you included

290
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.090
it.

291
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:07.620
And as always you can always highlight these fields here and show you copy it's pasted up here into

292
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.770
this Field's bar.

293
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:14.490
And by the way if you don't if you don't see what I'm pasting up here this left window to the right

294
00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:14.840
one.

295
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.260
But if you don't see it you can always go to View and then add that's let me actually go up here view

296
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:28.200
and then you add the formula bar and allow that there so if I click this Enter it'll go automatically

297
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.230
to where you had that in the course.

298
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.330
And what I do is I'm going to get out of this mode here for now.

299
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.850
Just a little bit easier this way to show it to.

300
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.940
It will go automatically to here where it should be input.

301
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.060
And if you don't see it here then just go back to wherever you had it in the course mean the executive

302
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.650
summary part and we click here to go home.

303
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.470
And then he can go down here to executive summary inputs or outputs wherever you put it.

304
00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.770
And then you can copy it for it from here.

305
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.810
So if you scroll down and this is all just obviously you don't need to do it if you didn't put an image

306
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.350
there.

307
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:09.210
You don't have to copy it from here and if you didn't put an image in the output here you have to go

308
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.820
back in there and trying to make it really easy way to organize stuff for the cat.

309
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.060
So what I'm going to do is I'm no longer going to have the window side by side.

310
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.790
I have to do the rest of it this way.

311
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.020
OK.

312
00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.040
So let's go back to our business plan here.

313
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.370
OK.

314
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.780
And I'm actually going to open up all of these as well.

315
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.800
Yeah I think it's easier this way but I wanted to basically allow you to do it many different ways.

316
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.720
So I've got the product image and I'm done.

317
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.750
Obviously your date is going to look different on the right than mine will case.

318
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.370
This is just executive summary.

319
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.060
Go back over here and that's fine.

320
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.090
I've got everything but the product image is forever.

321
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:59.140
Sorry Glenn it's optional OK and you'll notice I also had this here.

322
00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.250
That's the footnote which I explained to you as well.

323
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.900
Through what was listed here before I paste on top of it.

324
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.430
OK.

325
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.150
So I can get there in this place on top that's fine and you can pretty this up if you wanted to.

326
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.500
Words got some pretty fun waste a pretty up images.

327
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:21.440
You can go to shadow which I like doing on the right side just be consistent if you chateaus your that

328
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.200
use everywhere.

329
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.830
If you want and you can make this bigger as well.

330
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.940
That sort of thing completely optional obviously.

331
00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:28.960
OK.

332
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.350
A little grammar issue there.

333
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.290
So help me great.

334
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:31.940
Fix it up.

335
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.310
OK.

336
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.560
So looks like we are done now.

337
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.450
Say I made a mistake there and is copying and pasting.

338
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.650
So the executive summary is done.

339
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:47.610
And I made a grammatical error there maybe two spaces there but whatever doesn't matter.

340
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.680
So we're now done with the executive summary and I'm going to show you in the next lecture.

341
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.960
How did did the management team.

342
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.480
Thanks.
