1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,940
Well please make sure you're on the aid tab.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,340
Now we're going to talk about the balance sheet.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,600
We're done with the income statement and you can go back to the first lecture in the section to learn

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,480
more about what a balance sheet is.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,040
If you want.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,560
OK.

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,560
And so it doesn't really make as much sense to forecast a balance sheet when you're first starting a

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,100
company but some investor might ask you for it but I wouldn't spend too much time on it.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,330
And you'd have to it's so hard.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,910
Like one of our short term investments like do we really have a lot of cash in T-Bills sitting on our

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,170
balance sheet or Capital.

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,260
Probably not.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,110
But if you want you could answer them in here.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,210
I'm not going to do it but you can do it if you want.

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,490
And then you've got accounts receivable and you can make this a formula actually if you wanted to so

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:52,570
accounts receivable means let's say that you sell something you sell when you're goggles and you have

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,970
not collected that money yet.

18
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,310
OK.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,430
But it's so it's an account receivable it's an asset you're still owed it but you don't have that money

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:00,890
yet.

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,650
And if accounts receivable are too high it's a bit worrisome from a cash collection perspective and

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,660
so you would see that in here in some people what they do is they make accounts receivable a percent

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,710
of the costs of goods sold.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,640
So let's say that 5 percent of people that buy your goggles or whatever product it was they'd bite on

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,820
credit.

26
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,420
And so you would basically if you wanted to you could go in here zero point nine five times that amount

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,360
above.

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,470
OK but it's a little bit more loose and leave it like that for now.

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,880
So to keep this simplistic.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,410
Same thing with inventory.

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,050
You can calculate how much inventory you have and how much you haven't sold.

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,220
If you want to as well and that would feed into here and that's an asset.

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,510
But it's important to document this if you want to in every company's never leave it blank as is.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:54,760
But basically what happens is if if you have too much in inventory then you could face a cash crunch.

35
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,080
And so I showed you what happened with the returns just for those four months just for you know for

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,730
fun whatever is little example.

37
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,650
But that's how you do it here.

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,940
And as always having is tracked year over year month or month and percentage of revenue every company

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,460
is different.

40
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,940
But I provide it for the tools for you in case you want to do it.

41
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:14,360
Then you have cap packs which is how much you spend on machinery if you want to.

42
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm outsourcing everything with this fictional company and just like a company like Cisco Cisco a big

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,370
telecommunications company here in the Bay Area they don't really seeing themselves they outsource everything

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,250
to CMAC which stands for contract manufacturing services company.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,060
Apple does that too with Flextronics and other companies.

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,450
And then you've got your other I've got the seasonality SPARC line appears as well.

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,760
Accounts Payable.

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,600
You can make this a percent of revenue if you wants or stuff that you owe.

49
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,040
And just think of yourself like you're a bank always you always want to pay your bills as late as you

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,390
can without incurring fees.

51
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,940
And if you do that in the long run you'll save a lot of money.

52
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,840
A lot of my retail companies do this because retail margins are really thin.

53
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,110
A lot of times retail companies only make you know one or two pennies for every dollar and stuff they

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,920
sell.

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,540
And so if they pay everything back as late as possible then they pay less fees and they can remain relevant

56
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,020
longer term.

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,040
So everybody thinks of themselves as a bank in business.

58
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,080
And I challenge you to think that way as well because people are going to try and pay you back in lead

59
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,380
as they can without incurring a penalty fee.

60
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,350
And sometimes what happens is you encourage people to pay back by using 0 30 and in certain terms a

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,000
little outside the scope of this course.

62
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,020
But I want to throw that on your radar screen as well.

63
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,720
And here is I don't use any debt.

64
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,620
But if you did get a loan that's less than a year that would be short term debt you put it in here.

65
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,550
I want you to raise equity just because you can use the networking book on my web site to get these

66
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,790
meeting set up with high net worth investors who will invest in your company.

67
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,830
And don't don't speak with VC firms right away.

68
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,330
I would do high net worth initially because the sales cycle is shorter and there's only one sausage

69
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,280
maker which is the rich dude.

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,540
And again go to Harroun venturous dot com.

71
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,900
And then just download my book there you'll see it's free.

72
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,660
It'll help you lots.

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,350
Couple hundred pages.

74
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,090
Two hundred and ten pages just think and a couple of hours of links to youtube videos and I promise

75
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,440
you will help you raise money from equity investors from people from banks.

76
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,810
But if you want to raise money from banks you can always go to the savings type and in the Settings

77
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,640
tab.

78
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,050
It doesn't matter what country you're in.

79
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,580
Go to settings just for fun I'll throw it to another country random one here and I'm going to show you.

80
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,260
You can access where that is.

81
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,090
Or Serbia is.

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,360
I went there for a wedding actually meant my best friend Corey Paula Netrunner got married there.

83
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,230
Great guy.

84
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,370
But if you're in Serbia for examples around the country I picked your kid to go to your ministry of

85
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,050
finance website.

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,520
Here's some taxes are do in Serbia and then you're here the largest banks in Serbia.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,360
Second I did the top five in every country Sofia.

88
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,090
If you went and click here you can go to our RIF and I saw him on how to pronounce everything.

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,500
But you clicked that Windass computer slow slow sorry.

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,120
But but it should open up a browser.

91
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,990
Here it is here.

92
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,310
So it goes directly to that I guess RSS Serbia so it's right there.

93
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,190
Cute puppy.

94
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,200
And if you want credit ratings information whenever you do that and don't get loans if you can.

95
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,370
And if you do just make sure you pay back your debt quickly so it doesn't mess up your credit rating.

96
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,240
Here's more details on the credit rating industry in in Serbia for example.

97
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,970
And so what I'll do I'll just leave it at Serbia and then it's it's in Gibraltar pensar I guess it must

98
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,780
change as well.

99
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,240
This matter is still pretending it's in dollars doesn't matter.

100
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:46,210
So if you were to click here you'll see that whatever currency you selected is automatically placed

101
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,280
right here.

102
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,620
See here.

103
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,080
OK great.

104
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,070
So let's go back now.

105
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,880
We're going to click here.

106
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,620
I don't want to click on that but it will take me to the top and I'll be put in place.

107
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,020
All right.

108
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,650
So we got short term that were done in short term that is basically debt you owed in less than a year.

109
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,480
So on a balance sheet you've got current assets and current liabilities current assets are stuff you

110
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:15,550
can convert to cash in less than a year by cash itself or bonds and long term assets are things that

111
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,950
you can convert to cash more in the year like say you own a factory.

112
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,010
And factories usually take a lot of time to sell.

113
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,760
Same thing with with about you it comes to short current liabilities and long term goals current liabilities

114
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,360
are things that you have to pay back in less than a year like credit card debt or accounts payable and

115
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,090
then long term liabilities are stuff like long term limits.

116
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,190
And when I click on the Boushey button in Minot which I will I'll show you that more detail in here

117
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,680
you know there's long term debt.

118
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,260
If you have long term debt in here every company is completely different though.

119
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,130
OK.

120
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,500
And then common shares if events you want to go public.

121
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,580
I left this year as well for the share count which is a little bit outside the scope of what we're talking

122
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,010
about here because we're talking with start us by left to their you.

123
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,180
And if you put in and you might want to read this too if you will.

124
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,490
This is completely optional.

125
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,800
But if you put in money to your company or somebody else does.

126
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,070
And you know were to account for it.

127
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,790
I call that a pick additional paid in capital and you just put it here and it will filter through to

128
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,200
complete your policy for you and help you out with the actual Same as well.

129
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,190
So we're done with the balance sheet.

130
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,340
You can go look at the spark lines if you want.

131
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,630
So we already talk about revenue feeds in the income statement where we type things income statement

132
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,700
next thing is Balochi wish we did.

133
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,220
And this is going to feed over here and I put in a lot of cells as well.

134
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,840
Me just get a little more realistic here so about.

135
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,340
They're all green because they link somewhere else.

136
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,810
Okay and then accounts receivable I mean as a percent of revenue here and this just filters off of the

137
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:51,750
cancer SuBo which is this line divided by the revenue back on the competing.

138
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,670
And so this year is cash and cash equivalents and this comes from the cash flow statement which I'll

139
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,890
talk about in person again.

140
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,550
We didn't enter anything for short term investments or accounts receivable and we didn't enter a thing

141
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,800
here for cap ex although we do have depreciation because if you buy equipment you can appreciate like

142
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,860
a dichotomy for that there's a total assets.

143
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,660
Again people are not going to look at this that closely when you first started the company because they're

144
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,040
not going to be much data in here.

145
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,360
They're going to focus a little bit more so on the income statement which is why if you you know in

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,920
the executive summary I spend more time on income statement related stuff and on that one pager which

147
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,000
is completely optional by clicking the home button I show mainly income saving stuff there.

148
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,120
And the same thing if you give a presentation if you're a click on the presentation tab.

149
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,160
Let me actually go there.

150
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,250
We'll come back about the second one show.

151
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,090
So I click here on presentation slides.

152
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,760
It's can here.

153
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,150
This is going to pull for it automatically for you when you complete all the information.

154
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,790
Sort of like zoom out a bit here so I can.

155
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,970
So it limited financial stuff here just a one pager.

156
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,780
I'll show you here.

157
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,270
It's mostly incom same stuff got there in the second so.

158
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,790
Yeah.

159
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,560
So I just made an income statement stuff and you'll recognize this data.

160
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,800
It just pulls over from stuff we completed.

161
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,970
I've got revenue net income and then I put gross margins up her part in it and then here I put her to

162
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,120
rebut.

163
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,470
Spell financials right.

164
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,660
We're happy to provide you with detail financials upon request.

165
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,350
And then you know these are all the numbers that we talk about reading we haven't forecasted here.

166
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,020
That's why I bank this is the first year like near fifth year 10th year.

167
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,270
And usually it's just when you present to investors or you know early on people who might be in your

168
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,320
business model the 10 slide deck as you see here and then you just list a couple of income statement

169
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,750
stuff usually never Balanchine's stuff.

170
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,340
This is a little bit too early for that but I want to include there nevertheless.

171
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,800
OK let's go back to the balance sheet.

172
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,020
You get.

173
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,880
So we're still here.

174
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,040
And again the reason I clicked down here is that going up to the menu is because if I click here it

175
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,150
goes right to the top.

176
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:09,910
All right.

177
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:17,320
So green means from another tab and then you've got other white cells or grey cells I should say that

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,390
are not blue shaded not blue font wear shoes calculations.

179
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,210
OK.

180
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,760
And that pulls everything directly over.

181
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,990
And that is that.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,640
And so we are now done with a balance sheet.

183
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,470
What I'll do is I'll talk about the cash flow statement now as well.

184
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,150
So the cash flow statement pulls everything automatically from the income statement and the balance

185
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,550
sheet.

186
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,190
Okay.

187
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:48,070
And the great thing is just it's a little bigger she read it is if you have a capital statement if you

188
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,570
ever think of the same and a balance sheet then the capital gains automatically always created for you.

189
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,220
Most people realize that but it's just math.

190
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,400
And if I went back to the balance sheet here you'll see that I've got I've got these little comments

191
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,420
here and if you want you can mouse over it just read what those comments are.

192
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,410
But let's go back now to the outputs for the cash flow statement and the Cashell Satan will just tell

193
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,790
you that change in cash every single quarter in this example here in your pocket.

194
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,170
OK.

195
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,520
And so I'm going to be very negative at first because we're losing a lot of money and you'll see here

196
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,790
the way the capital saving works is as follows.

197
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,650
You're reconciling the income saves the income statement a lie.

198
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,600
And so the income.

199
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,490
And you can also or you want to see all this stuff here.

200
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,630
I give you lots of comments on what all of these are and why they're here.

201
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,610
And so with the cash flow statement does is it basically says Hey Mr. or Mrs..

202
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,030
Income Statement I'm going to take the bottom line of your of the income state which is net income and

203
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,410
I'm going to make you tell the truth by saying what the real change is in cash because net income does

204
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,480
not mean that change in cash in your pocket.

205
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,340
OK it's an accounting thing.

206
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,310
And so we're going to add back stuff that's not real.

207
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,530
So for example depreciation is a non tax or non-cash expense.

208
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:07,470
How we say on tax non-cash expense so we can add that back and then this is always the change you can.

209
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,350
You can.

210
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,950
You don't have any information since the first quarter but this year is just the change.

211
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,250
See this period.

212
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,250
Missed the previous period.

213
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,640
So the Cashell say it does looks at the change and so let's say that if accounts receivable went up

214
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,380
a lot and you sold the products but they still on page.

215
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,770
That's unfair you can't account for it that way.

216
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,850
You have to back it out and that's what the cash flow statement does.

217
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,160
It says accounts he will for one period minus the previous one.

218
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,830
So if it goes up it's about the if inventory goes up a lot as well.

219
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,020
That's a bad thing from a cash perspective especially if you don't sell it.

220
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,650
But if and if accounts payable goes up a lot.

221
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,090
That's a that's actually it's a good thing as long as you're not paying it back too late because it's

222
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,020
more cash in your pocket temporarily.

223
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,150
Same thing here with Cap backs.

224
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,390
If you if you're buying more machines and stuff that will hurt your investing perspective.

225
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,700
So this is from we're correcting the income saving here in the operating side.

226
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,580
And here we're looking at stuff we invest in like cap x can make the change here and then financing.

227
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:13,870
If we got a loan or an increase in common shares like somebody invest in our company equity wise you'd

228
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,810
make this an increase in cash because somebody gave you money so necessarily great thing.

229
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,770
It's just a cash changer at the bottom.

230
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:28,900
What happens is it will pull it directly over and reconcile whatever and tell you how much changes in

231
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,920
cash.

232
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,970
So first couple of years we're bleeding cash obviously.

233
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:39,050
And then here cash increases and then we're off to the races here.

234
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,780
That's when the investment bank bankers will be pounding on your door saying please go public.

235
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,700
OK.

236
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,780
So we are now done with that and the next step in the next session to talk about the final outputs for

237
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,520
all financials.

238
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,920
Thanks.
