Please click on the outputs button for Step 11 and this will be a short lecture.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,570
It's just everything that we documented the previous lecturer is automatically pull through here.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,390
But I did give you the option here to turn off this last step here which is what is the most misunderstood

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,170
aspect to your business model.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,450
If you're a brand new company and you haven't talked to many people about your business model then this

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,490
might not be necessary for you to include But but but I recommend including if you've been around for

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,620
more than six to 12 months.

00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,010
Thanks.
