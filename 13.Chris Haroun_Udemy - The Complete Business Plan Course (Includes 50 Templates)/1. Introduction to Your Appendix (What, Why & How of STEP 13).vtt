00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.960
Welcome step 13 of the Course will do.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.010
We're almost done in terms the what why and how of Sept. 13.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.200
I'll kick off the what.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.630
What are we going to learn.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.800
We will learn what to include in our appendix like resumes or product brochures or anything you want

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.590
to include that will really help the reader of your business plan more thoroughly understand your company

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.990
knows move on.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.910
Why.

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.480
Why do we bother creating an appendix part of your business plan.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.370
It's because some readers of your business plan will likely have additional questions about topics that

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.150
you have already covered but not in enough detail like the background of our employees or or the technical

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:49.950
or additional details of your product or services that is included in a brochure or other documents.

13
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.370
Now this part of the business plan also serves the purpose of letting you include other miscellaneous

14
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.960
documents that your reader might ask questions about and by including exhibits.

15
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.340
It allows the reader to understand how well-thought out your business plan is and if they if they think

16
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.030
that your business plan is extraordinarily thorough and complete and well-thought out then they're more

17
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.410
likely to approve of your business plan is more likely to invest as well if applicable.

18
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.580
I know some of you might want to include some of the financial statements in this section 13 here mean

19
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.510
the appendix instead of Step 12.

20
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.480
And that's cool.

21
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.480
That's completely your call and what we'll do is we'll discuss exactly how to do this if applicable.

22
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.260
When we discuss how to assemble your final output for your business plan which is my favorite part.

23
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.070
OK so if you're creating a presentation output as well as part of this course then what you can meaning

24
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.270
in this presentation putting here the slides then you could also include the contents of your presentation

25
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.200
in the appendix.

26
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.910
If you want to and I will explain exactly how to do this in a lot of detail in the final output part

27
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.850
of this course which again is my favorite part of the course.

28
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.610
It's a lot of fun.

29
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.000
OK Leslie how how are we going to complete the appendix step.

30
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.080
Well this step is really easy as all we do is we just click on the green inputs analysis button and

31
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.360
then we answer just a couple of basic questions.

32
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.710
Assan which are optional as always then if you click on the outputs button here in step 13 you'll see

33
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.370
an informational kind of a visual representation or placeholders of what your appendix appendix might

34
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.220
look like.

35
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.070
And please don't spend much time on this though at all.

36
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.780
Can't think the output part of part 13 because what we're going to do is we're going to assemble your

37
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.310
appendix when we complete the final output of your business plan.

38
00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.750
Thanks.
