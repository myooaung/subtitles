00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.600
Okay now that we are done with the cover page and the executive summary we're going to move on down

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.780
in order and work on our management team.

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.790
And again if you look at the Table of Contents here you'll see that it's an order of what we're doing

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.980
now just to make it flow nicely.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.240
So right now we're going to work on mainstream or view and you can always click here to go right there.

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.430
There you go good.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.330
All right.

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.400
Back we go.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.560
So here what you're going to do is you just kind of copy and paste agreed details.

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.900
If you enter an information earlier back in Step Four it'll all appear here for you automatically.

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.030
So let me just use mine as an example.

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.070
So if I were to go here it and I want to get rid of this because I'm here walking you through it's a

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.180
Tauriel but you can leave it there and click that letter if you want whatever.

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.070
So what are going to do is I'm going to get rid at the end.

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.360
Why don't we update this.

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.040
I need to get rid of all the boards it's going look awesome.

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.900
You'll see.

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.820
So what you do is you highlight this if you want OK.

19
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.720
There's a couple of ways to do everything and that will fill up your field to copy and then go here

20
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.290
and paste.

21
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.470
And obviously it's going to be right here.

22
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.240
It's going to pull it up there directly.

23
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.830
And then you would copy and paste what's in there.

24
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.220
So you hit copy and then you'd paste it right there.

25
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.040
And I set it up in such a way that it will flow nicely there.

26
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.520
So let's just do mine.

27
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.410
Guess I got a copy here and then here I'm going to go paste special text only.

28
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.350
There it is.

29
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.300
Tony Clark OK.

30
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.150
Next up we got the final business picture of you and that's actually that field there.

31
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.070
I'll show you when I click HERE COME ON.

32
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.820
There you go.

33
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.720
So actually I put it down here so I can link here so say we were somewhere else in the in our report

34
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.100
and we're lost somewhere or whatever.

35
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.960
If you were to paste it here will automatically jump right to here.

36
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.110
Where are your images.

37
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.800
And if you don't have it here you can go back and get it from Part 4 of the course which is over here.

38
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.210
Management outputs if you created here you just go back here and this will all automatically be opened

39
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.880
for you I just close earlier.

40
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.870
And then you can go here and you can grab the picture of you and that picture of the rest your management

41
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.510
team.

42
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.320
If you have it available to discuss from here and give me a second here your computer sponsored mine.

43
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.310
All right so there it is there you can grab it from here directly.

44
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.750
OK now I'm going to go back here to the business by OK and I'm just going to copy and paste my stuff

45
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.170
now.

46
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.730
So go back down a management team.

47
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.710
OK.

48
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.370
So I paste in my name and then I got a copy this image here.

49
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.240
And earlier in the course we talked about formatting this and I recommended that used as was it points

50
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.000
1.5 or so both of them.

51
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.330
And this is directly from Linked-In and we talked about earlier in the course right here in the lower

52
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.080
third.

53
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.440
Okay back we go.

54
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.500
There are two pieces here.

55
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.360
It fits nicely.

56
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.020
And then your bio so again you can copy this and paste it into the field here and it's just going to

57
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.100
it'll go right here on Mackley you'll see you don't have to do this but if you're lost you'll come back

58
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.590
here.

59
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.970
So whenever you ventured for your bio earlier on Sept. 4 will come through here.

60
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.960
Okay.

61
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.200
And then I'm going to copy just mine just for an example.

62
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.390
Run away sorry.

63
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.740
And then I will pay special as always.

64
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.610
There we go.

65
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.610
There's my pretend bike and then I've got one more thing which is the final BP business plan your logo's.

66
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.870
OK.

67
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.090
So that's going to.

68
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.800
It'll bring you down here a few.

69
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.530
If you added it and you always go back to set for that gap there.

70
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.440
But if I've got these logos here is what you can do is where it's pretty cool.

71
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.590
And this works for Excel and PowerPoint.

72
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.680
They all work together the same way it's the same company obviously but what you can do is you can group

73
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.470
solve them case you select them all by just de-select them.

74
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.660
And so all of these are about point 3 I think by point three point four I guess in this case whether

75
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.520
it's good enough.

76
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.480
All right so you select all of them by pushing the button down on shift as you click all those Then

77
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.310
you right click and then you group them together and just group some as one group of images that make

78
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.610
it easier just to move around.

79
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.800
And then you copy those completely up to you how you want to do it over here and then you just highlights

80
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.330
and then just paste out the paste special and just kind of paste it there.

81
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.900
That's what looks like.

82
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.300
OK.

83
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.630
So you're going to do that for all your employees let me just do two more employees.

84
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.870
I'm going to do Wrigley.

85
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.820
Is his name is Ryan Reynolds here.

86
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.450
So I copy this.

87
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.580
And now what I do is I'm going to paste it into rectally here.

88
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.560
I mean get rid of that because I'm already coaching you through this paste special.

89
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.910
It's a little bit tedious but it's going to it's going to pay off big time see.

90
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.070
It's going to be me.

91
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.870
And then I get a copy.

92
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.470
Ryan Reynolds bio which is all just dummy data here.

93
00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.980
You know see

94
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.550
pay special tax.

95
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.500
And then the image here which is the same as this image in terms of the formatting.

96
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.370
And we'll use the same images too if you want to watch the optional how to put your presentation together

97
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.800
as well based on whatever template you select that I give you.

98
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.420
And you can see in this lecture here lower third.

99
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.690
All right.

100
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.950
So back here in I copy paste.

101
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.270
Sorry.

102
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.360
So I got the image and we have to pay special because it is an image so just paste over top at paste

103
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.770
nodded.

104
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.810
Ok there is there.

105
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.050
And then we can grab the story here and I group them as well just to make it easier to copy.

106
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.980
Go back here pasted on top.

107
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.770
There you go.

108
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.750
All right.

109
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.170
And then one more thing I show you how to get rid of these borders here so we don't put scarlet.

110
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.260
Sorry Scott.

111
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.540
Scarlet Johansson.

112
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.800
Don't get sued and I'm just going to show you three employees and most you won't have 10 employees anyway.

113
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.420
But let me just go here and delete the rest.

114
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.300
Those Kevin and then I want to put this in next page so you can keep hitting enter or hit command enter

115
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.130
command or to run the same thing at a insert a page break if I go here.

116
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.620
It shows the page pre-cancer that can get optional of course.

117
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:28.360
I may go back here and I'm going to go down and get my vice president of sales somebody named Skaro

118
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.040
and Jozen

119
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.000
who used to be married to one.

120
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.610
All right.

121
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.790
Well two years ago.

122
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.240
Sorry but the speed of my Mac I got so many things running.

123
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.260
OK then I'm going to get the pretend bio.

124
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.980
This is just dummy data and I'm going to paste this directly here.

125
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.590
And by the way let's say you screwed up bios and you're not sure which one.

126
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.670
Which one should play on the list first or you forgot to bring one over.

127
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:08.530
You can always click here and then select the name again and it will pull the information over using

128
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.280
this special field.

129
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:14.830
You don't have to do this I don't recommend to it because I'm already pulling the data back already

130
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.540
from somewhere else.

131
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.970
All right now we're going to we're going to get Ms.

132
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.460
Anderson's picture.

133
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.520
And we're going to select this and use that pace not pay specialists image.

134
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.030
There we go.

135
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.100
Almost done.

136
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.410
And there were a select the three D.C. images.

137
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.270
I know it's marble.

138
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.900
You probably find a lot of people there.

139
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.740
OK here.

140
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.140
OK.

141
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.590
And then we're done.

142
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.570
You can get in here.

143
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.630
Looks like there's a typo.

144
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.990
You just fix that there if you want it to whatever.

145
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.230
All right.

146
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.320
Now I'm just going to get rid of the borders and all these just to make it look nice so you can keep

147
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.520
the boards in if you want.

148
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.050
I suggest not doing it just looks better without it.

149
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.310
So I forgot this slight to all the all the cells.

150
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.310
There you go.

151
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:06.000
And I just go through this de-selected Kavran borders I made the same mistake in the older I get the

152
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.900
better was there and then the same thing here I'll see if I do it right this time.

153
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.690
I think I got it.

154
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:13.990
OK.

155
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.050
Got great looks dope looks good looks good.

156
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.760
So you've got the management team or if you hear if you want you can make these image a little bit smaller

157
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.260
to fit everything in one sly looks.

158
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.650
Looks pretty cool.

159
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:31.650
Oh look nice too when we put it into our presentation if you do that part of the Course as well.

160
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.230
OK.

161
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.450
So we've got this we've got three of them.

162
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.510
And then just for fun and we'll do the very I'm going to show you now.

163
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.410
See these are the fields you put here.

164
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.570
Watch this.

165
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:51.350
If I update this and it automatically has added the mesh teams here Tony Tony shark and then Ryan Reynolds

166
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.120
and scarlet and Joseph and it's right here.

167
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.390
So if I were to click anywhere else that's what it looks like.

168
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.670
Yes.

169
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.630
That's why we have heading ones heading 2:6.

170
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.660
OK.

171
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.210
Then if you have bored advisors you do the exact thing I just showed you.

172
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.050
OK.

173
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.760
Otherwise you can skip that.

174
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.160
And so I would put in in if you can't remember where it is.

175
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:16.400
In the course you can just select that old runway and then you can paste up here and it's just going

176
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.090
to highlight your first board person down here.

177
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.280
But you don't have anybody selected and you might even turn that off before if you do to show up here

178
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.600
she can skip that part.

179
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:30.200
If I were to add board advisors wanting you to do is I going to add both of these really quickly when

180
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.960
you go in a high speed boat.

181
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.510
And I'm just going to show it to I'm not going about it with their own high speed boat.

182
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.010
Put this in

183
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.660
OK and we're done here if you have grammatical or spelling mistakes you can update them here if you

184
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.720
want.

185
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.860
And then you get rid of this stuff that explains how to do this how head explain how to do this.

186
00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.170
And then here the outsource partners if you have them you're included here otherwise just delete all

187
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.070
this stuff here.

188
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.770
But if you scroll down maybe you have the maybe you don't maybe you de-selected turned off looks like

189
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.880
I did this example.

190
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.260
But if you didn't they would appear here.

191
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:16.280
And then I just have dummy data here and the same person four times but Ill grab all five outsource

192
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.360
partners if you have them in.

193
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.710
So it's just a simplistic copy here.

194
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.810
And then you just paste it directly here for each one of the names.

195
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.430
OK.

196
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:38.480
So let's we'll type there for four months or K and then you'll have the bio here as well.

197
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.090
You don't have that issue with your pictures.

198
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.100
OK.

199
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.200
And then you'll you'll paste this in here like that's.

200
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.580
And if you have more of them whenever they appear here I don't include that.

201
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:56.740
And if you wanted to just a pretty it up and save this space and say only have one and you can just

202
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.960
bring it back to this page too if you want it to him prettied up a bit and keep that on the next page

203
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.390
you're caught completely completely.

204
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:12.550
And then next up we've got employee recruiting strategy if you had it you just kind of copy and paste

205
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.900
it.

206
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:13.840
Right.

207
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.970
Is it directly from here.

208
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.830
And we are done with the management section.

209
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.170
So if you wanted to I recommend do had the budget for fire and do it now because all that stuff's going

210
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.020
to disappear.

211
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.310
Update the fields.

212
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.810
They'll get rid of all the extra stuff they're going to get.

213
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:36.580
So here we have our executive summary dump done board advisors done outsource partners and then just

214
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.080
this stuff here and then you're done.

215
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:44.530
And if you wanted to make the outsource partners name tagged to show up here you can do that.

216
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:50.030
So right here you can select that and you can make that a heading 3.

217
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.520
For example if it's not hitting 3 and that's heading to show up here.

218
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.600
And then if you go back al-Shehri will happen.

219
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:02.080
It'll pick up that that sample data that will appear right below here outsource burner's update fueled

220
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.630
up to the entire table always.

221
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.720
There it is great.

222
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.310
We are done with the management team.

223
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.770
I'll see in the next lecture where we will talk about product and service making great progress.
