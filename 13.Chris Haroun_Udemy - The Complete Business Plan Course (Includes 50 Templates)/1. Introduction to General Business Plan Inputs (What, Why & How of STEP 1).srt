00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,580
Welcome to step one of the course in terms of the what why and how of step one I'll kick it off of the

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,040
what.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,610
What are we going to learn.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:14,560
We will learn about general business inputs to our business plan and other crucial topics that we need

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,470
to cover before writing a business plan including who is the reader of the business plan what type of

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,530
legal structure the company has or will have as well as intellectual property topics like copyrights

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,690
patents and trademarks and if applicable.

8
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,230
And if you already have several employees we will talk about which employee will write each part of

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,430
this business plan and what the deadline dates are.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,560
We will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your company and other legal topics and much much

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,430
more.

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,690
Moving on to why why are we answering all of the questions in step 1.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,080
Because I want to make sure that we understand from a high level perspective what the legal structure

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,550
is of our company as well as the pros and cons of this business model and who the reader is so we can

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,780
customize our entire business plan based on the aforementioned topics.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,020
Lastly how how are we going to learn about these concepts together.

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,430
In the next lecture and as with all 13 parts of this course we will click on the blue inputs and analysis

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,770
button and answer many questions together.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,120
Thanks.
