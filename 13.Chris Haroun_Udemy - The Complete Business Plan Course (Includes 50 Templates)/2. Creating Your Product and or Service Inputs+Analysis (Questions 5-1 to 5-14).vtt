00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:06.310
Please click on the blue inputs and analysis button here for Step 5 where we're going to talk about

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.740
the product or service or both that you are discussing in your out your business plan.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.340
And it's important to note that I put this after the management team because a lot of the most sophisticated

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.260
investors and people that have Star a lot of companies understand that having a great management team

5
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.920
is more important than anything else.

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.930
And a lot of very successful investors for example would rather invest in a in a management team with

7
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.420
a b business model instead of investing in a B management team with an a business model.

8
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.710
So it's very important that's why we spend a lot of time on it and that will pay off handsomely for

9
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.980
you in dividends.

10
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.390
Once once we create the final output your reader will love it.

11
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.220
Okay great.

12
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.420
So let's get started here.

13
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.520
So the first one here is not optional because there's no optional right in front of it here but it's

14
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.940
called detailed product or service description.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.860
OK.

16
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.700
So if you wrote what your detailed or what your product or service scription was in Step 1 it will appear

17
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.350
here.

18
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.080
Right it's actually a typo of that's supposed to be in 15 words or less.

19
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.260
Keepin it real here.

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.880
OK.

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.770
It'll appear here and if you haven't done it yet then go back to Step 1 if you want and true that in

22
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.570
can.

23
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.900
And if you're if you're technical whatever.

24
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.430
Or a nerd like I am.

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.280
You can always click on here and just see how I wrote that stuff right.

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.710
And so let's say we copy this here if you want your product or service description and you can paste

27
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.620
it directly in here to jump to where you wrote that in this dashboard or what you can do.

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.900
Just do the dropdown here and go all the way down to your product or service description which is here

29
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.770
right.

30
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.750
And that will jump directly back to where you wrote that in this part of the course here it's empty

31
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.370
as you can see.

32
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.950
But if I wrote here test sample description you'll see that that will appear automatically here in step

33
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.440
5.

34
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.310
So because it's tagged.

35
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.710
So let's go back now to here and you'll see that that should appear directly there instead 5 OK.

36
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.600
Here it is.

37
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.330
OK we can see that you wrote this.

38
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.460
Now what I want you to place is I want to add to this.

39
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.870
OK.

40
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.330
And if you want more real estate or space up here you can get rid of that and minimize this as well.

41
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.940
We'll take a second or two for it to close but I gave you the options well if you want.

42
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.350
OK.

43
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.720
And so what you do is you're going to write one to three sentences maybe a paragraph a little bit more

44
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.950
if you want just on a more elaborate description of your product or your service and just include the

45
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.350
value proposition for your customers and every time you answer a question in a document like this in

46
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.990
a business in general ask yourself two words.

47
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.670
So what you ask yourself so what why am I writing this why is it important for the reader of the business

48
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.670
plan to see it so you can use this as an example if you want.

49
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.540
And I put here.

50
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.220
Copyright trademark.

51
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.540
And let's just pretend that I've seen a copywriter or trademark but just go through this look at my

52
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.740
example.

53
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.030
If you want and then enter in your ear your answer here.

54
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.060
And then the next one this is this here is optional but and so a lot of the best business models are

55
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.430
scalable and that basically means can they grow really quickly in a lot of times.

56
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.280
Platforms the best business models out there and a platform basically means if you own the road and

57
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.180
then everybody else are cars or tollbooths and you charge the cars.

58
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.400
So Microsoft Windows is a platform because companies that make software on top of it help to sell Windows.

59
00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.750
You know the iOS operating system or Android those are platforms as well because people buy apps that

60
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.260
are on top of that platform.

61
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.010
Facebook.

62
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.670
Facebook has the quintessential social media platform even though I don't trust them whatever.

63
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.430
Well a side note there.

64
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.290
But but that's a social media platform.

65
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.360
LinkedIn is probably the best jobs based platform out there etc..

66
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.270
So if your platform and if you own a platform or if you're Bismo scalable you can answer that question

67
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.950
here.

68
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.150
If not just skip it because it is optional.

69
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.710
OK moving on quality control what is your quality control process and the people reading your business

70
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.220
plan will love to see how thoughtful you are with your entire business plan detail read up.

71
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.340
If you addressed things like quality control but made it optionals Well okay here.

72
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.200
You can write about packaging if you have a package based product.

73
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.470
You can write it here in and here I kind of wrote about the whole unboxing process of my goggles my

74
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.970
pretend product and I even set it up so that you get those birthday greetings cards and you open it

75
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.420
up and there is you know somebody saying birthday to you whatever.

76
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.350
Well I actually hypothetically hired Morgan Freeman to write or to say when you open up the box for

77
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.880
Sharq virtual reality goggles.

78
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.540
Welcome to the future of entertainment.

79
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.200
I will see you in the movies.

80
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.210
I love Shawshank Redemption best movie ever.

81
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.630
But anyway it is just kind of an example and unbuckling is really important.

82
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.220
I mean people who make a career out of this are on YouTube now and my kids who inspire me I learn a

83
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.320
lot from them.

84
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.710
Packaging is really important.

85
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.780
Its so funny because I'll buy stuff and then when it arrives through Amazon in the mail my kids will

86
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.110
all ask me Can I open it and box in the box.

87
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.750
So it's important that you you look at this because this is the first impression that a potential customer

88
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.030
is going to get of your products.

89
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.490
I guess the key is to try and keep it somewhat cheap though so it doesn't kind of cost too much.

90
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.600
Apple does a great job of this.

91
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.600
That's why they can charge a premium for all their brands.

92
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.370
OK.

93
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.840
So let's move on now.

94
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.830
All right next up production if this is applicable that you just talk about or write down here quickly

95
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.140
what the production process is of of your of your product is and how you create these products and how

96
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.000
long it takes to get to the customer that sort of thing.

97
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.740
And I give an example here that my kids love this company scuffed gaming they make customized video

98
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.710
game controllers and you know just hypothetically speaking.

99
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.200
I'm kind of saying that's how we're going to create our customized product that sort of thing.

100
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.360
And I love my kids.

101
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.710
All right let me talk about the current price strategy.

102
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.020
This one's mandatory.

103
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.480
The future one is optional but here just talk about your pricing policy against all made up data here.

104
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.770
Is it a subscription model which investors love because it shows great revenue visibility over time.

105
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.380
And then if you change a plan to change your pricing model or add to it in the future then you can answer

106
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.520
this simple question here of what your future pricing strategy or price strategy will be.

107
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.440
And if you have a bundle pricing strategy longer term kind of like how when you buy certain products

108
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.440
like like a computer all this kind of awful antivirus bloatware stuff is on when you buy Windows based

109
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.050
PC that's a bundling pricing strategy.

110
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.210
Talk about that if it's applicable.

111
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.420
And then here you can talk about volume discounts like if schools or certain institutions buy a lot

112
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.140
of your product in a certain amount they get a certain discounts.

113
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.340
This might not be economically feasible for a shark virtual reality this is just a dummy data there.

114
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.930
Then you can talk about financing if you sell a higher priced product.

115
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.660
Are you partnering with a third party financing company to finance it in a lot of times when you buy

116
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.760
a car so you buy it from Toyota or you'll deal with a different entity called the bank of Toyota or

117
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.500
another firm in general.

118
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.360
You know it's like when you buy a house you'll deal with a certain bank to get a mortgage and then just

119
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:59.930
as a little side note if you were to click here in settings and you want to learn more about the top

120
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:06.050
five banks in your country I've got them all listed here for you directly down here for every single

121
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.360
country is took forever to do.

122
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.870
But hopefully hopefully you enjoy.

123
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.000
Hopefully it's helpful.

124
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.790
Ok where was I again.

125
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.000
Here sorry.

126
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.030
So products.

127
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.440
All right.

128
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.570
Let me just scroll scroll down a bit to get back to where we were.

129
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.400
And again if we just click directly on the tabs in the bottom it would not have jumped to the top.

130
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:25.970
OK.

131
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:34.890
So next up we've got we've got freemium or a premium strategy do you plan on offering an app for example

132
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.810
it's free.

133
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.550
And then if you want some higher end stuff as a part of it then you pay like Clash of Clans that that

134
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.550
video game which I may or may not still play with my kids every single night before I put to bed maybe

135
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.700
I don't know.

136
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:51.660
But that's a free app but you pay if you want to get jems and my kids are into this whole voicebox thing

137
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.000
now which they want for their allowance because they play a lot for night which is take it over my house

138
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.860
but they can only play on weekends now.

139
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.550
OK.

140
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:05.520
Next up is optional input prices and this is where if you want you can write about how much it costs

141
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.260
to make your product.

142
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:13.290
And if you have a hedging strategy in place if what you're making requires a lot of natural resources.

143
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.540
I'll give you a quick example.

144
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.690
Skip fast forward if you want to this point in the lecture.

145
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:24.790
If you don't care about this but a lot of companies that that make products that use a lot of natural

146
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:31.090
resources what they'll do is they will hedge out the price of natural resources longer term just in

147
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.750
case there's a big price fluctuation.

148
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.610
So for example and this is actually fascinating.

149
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.910
There's a company Southwest which is a great airline in the United States.

150
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.110
The ticker is El-Rufai love which is the name of their they're there in their home airport love joy

151
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.820
or whatever.

152
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:54.690
And then basically what they did was back in 0 1 and 0 2 when the price of oil was spiking to over $100

153
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.990
or eventually spiked to a hundred dollars I should say what they did was they hedged forward the price

154
00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.120
of oil at 30 bucks a barrel so that no matter what happened for about 10 years after 0 1 or whatever

155
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.570
they were able to buy oil at 30 30 bucks a barrel head of over $100 a barrel.

156
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.470
And what they did was this allowed them to hedge the price for themselves and make a lot of money and

157
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:20.860
they actually used predatory pricing to cut prices materially and force a couple of airlines to potentially

158
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.620
go into bankruptcy that's a little side note.

159
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.540
Off topic.

160
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.170
OK let's move on.

161
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.820
But if you write stuff like that in your in your business plan that you've you're looking into hedging

162
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.690
or you do hedge or as part of a larger strategy you might hedge.

163
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.880
It really looks great in the eyes of the reader that you've covered every single angle there is when

164
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.610
writing this bad ass business plan.

165
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.360
Next up we've got distribution strategy.

166
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.940
OK who's going to sell your products to your customers.

167
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.140
OK.

168
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.460
And how are you going.

169
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.190
And don't spend too much time on this because we're going to spend a lot more time on distribution to

170
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.390
customers as part of what's called the go to market strategy in Step 8 over here.

171
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.960
OK.

172
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:05.230
And instead they will talk about your direct and indirect distribution channels selling to wholesale

173
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.780
and retail if applicable.

174
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.710
Using third parties to sell your product or services Well maybe you can just read this here and just

175
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.120
wrap a quick answer here.

176
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.170
If you want OK.

177
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.050
And then this is optional do you offer a refund policy.

178
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.760
So for example if you're taking this course over you to me there's a 30 day 100 percent money back guarantee

179
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.030
on this course whatever that sort of thing.

180
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.830
Let's see.

181
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.870
And I think that is it's I think we're done with this so as you answer the questions as with all previous

182
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:44.070
steps the stuff that is is is required being the non optional stuff will automatically update.

183
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.820
So if I click this here happens up here this will get updated.

184
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.260
Come on.

185
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.450
There you go 33 percent done so obviously means that that means there's only three required questions

186
00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:01.900
here and you can always override that by clicking here which will automatically make this 100 percent.

187
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.190
We have no flags here.

188
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.820
That's fine.

189
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.100
You know you already know how to add flags and comments on the right side there.

190
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.770
It looks like we are we are over 30 percent done.

191
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.070
We are now 36 percent done WOO-HOO making great progress.

192
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.370
And I will see you in the next lecture where we will talk about the outputs for Step 5.
