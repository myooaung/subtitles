1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,180
What we're going to do is we're going to talk about sales and marketing.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:04,650
OK.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,710
And so the first question here is optional which is what is your sales force structure and you can talk

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,700
about how your sales team is is set up you know who's in charge of of selling to to certain geographies

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,920
except cetera.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,480
Do you have a name to count strategy which basically means that you have a handful of employees assigned

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,450
to huge accounts and they will have a couple of accounts each and sort them out to make it better for

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:30,570
you.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,900
But if you want to learn how to get customers you can go to my Web site and download my networking book

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,930
for free.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,590
It's it's you just go to that Web site Harroun Ventris dot com.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,390
So our time at this because we can all see it and then it'll help you get a meeting with literally anybody.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,610
And what I also did actually is if if you're interested.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,380
I created a couple of videos that can help you out a lot when it comes to networking.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,200
And I'll go down here through them.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,120
Basically what you do is if you want to meet any CEO in the world literally any CEO this will help you

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,680
a lot.

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,750
When you're selling or you're trying to sell your product or service it's so frustrating when you deal

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,090
with people in a company they're not the decision makers because very bureaucratic and I always recommend

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,910
going right to the top and I know that might you know might might upset some people whenever but I don't

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,700
like to mess around.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,070
I want to be successful.

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,340
And then if you want you can go through these as well just to kind of understand how to get free publicity.

24
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,830
This one actually is really helpful from a sales perspective.

25
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,330
I recommend watching it.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,710
I RECORDED IN MY KITCHEN.

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,900
But basically what Marc Benioff did who is the founder of the largest company here in San Francisco

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,110
the biggest employer called sales force is he made friends and networked with 50 of the top tech and

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,900
finance journalists in the world.

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,730
And he met with them and that was his marketing and sales strategy.

31
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,430
He was brilliant.

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,520
And now I really understand why sales and marketing are always grouped together.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,660
But but check those out if you want if you want to see how to create a great logo or how some of the

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,790
bigger brands think about their logos.

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,620
You can watch this as well.

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,180
There's other other stuff here as well.

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,250
But it's not for everybody saw a move on now.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,870
So just talk about your cell structure here.

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,080
If you want.

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:31,170
And then here just document what your sales force incentive structure is like how do people get bonuses.

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,180
Do they get commission.

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,760
Some of the bigger software companies have accelerators which means if you pass and hit your goal of

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,640
commissions in a certain month by selling a certain stuff then you get a larger percent of everything

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,180
incremental you sell on top of that.

45
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,780
So anyway just just another idea for you to think about.

46
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,280
This is all optional though because a lot of a lot of startups won't even have these these new sales

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,410
structure set up initially when they get up and running.

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,620
Another one here is sales force registration.

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,620
You need to get a license in some industries you do like to sell healthcare products sometimes and financial

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,970
services to answer those questions there if you want.

51
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,300
Again they are optional.

52
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,990
Next up and this here is quite a I've got a couple of large columns here.

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,740
Rose I should say just to help you out and you can minimize this here if you want a little bit more

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,660
more real estate here in your screen.

55
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:32,100
But these are questions and comments and suggestions to really help you to write your marketing or social

56
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,700
media portion of your business plan.

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,160
So what I recommend is to check out how the more established competitors in your industry are leveraging

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,270
social media Instagram YouTube etc. and YouTube is a big deal because YouTube is now the second biggest

59
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,690
search engine in the in the world obviously after Google.

60
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:58,620
And so if you're curious about how to record online and make online videos and whatnot you can always

61
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,290
go to my blog just to hear whatever.

62
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:07,110
And I made a video on not on how to log in I've made so many mistakes doing what I do but I want to

63
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,240
help you so you can work smarter not harder.

64
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,930
And then there's also something called repurposing content.

65
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:20,340
So if you write on LinkedIn you can take a quote from the article you wrote for your social media strategy

66
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,720
and put it on Twitter Instagram and actually I have to go here.

67
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,540
I'm sorry but.

68
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,990
But I I wrote this one here how to write a book and give it to potential customers and it costing you

69
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,590
next to nothing and it's easy to do and anybody can do it.

70
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,860
And I think that should be part if you want of your marketing strategy as well.

71
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,330
I want it to be thought of as a leader from a sales and marketing perspective in your industry and I

72
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,400
want people to to think about you as understanding more about the industry than anybody else and I want

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,360
you to write a lot if you can online on LinkedIn and and make online videos too because it's free.

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,550
It's Here's another example of how to do it.

75
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,400
It's free to do it.

76
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,780
It'll help you get customers over time.

77
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,380
But you've got to be really long term focused if you're going to do this sort of thing because it's

78
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,530
it's tough to quantify what your return on investment is from sales and marketing.

79
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,440
But but it is their longer term when you market.

80
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,390
This one's really good.

81
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,180
I'm proudest when here this is called How to write great online articles and so this one here I really

82
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,140
recommend that you watch.

83
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:36,870
It's I did it in about two years ago and I used to have my own artist or my own column in Ink magazine

84
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,010
and my editor taught me how to write like a professional journalist.

85
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,710
It's 40 minutes long.

86
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,380
It will really help you understand how to write.

87
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,940
Hope I don't.

88
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,220
Hopefully I don't look too much older than that.

89
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,880
Anyway that's it's there and it's networking goldmine as well.

90
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,860
KOC and I want to create content online daily OK.

91
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,690
Again I want to be a thought leader and you've got to collect email addresses if you're allowed to and

92
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,330
obviously be mindful of GPDA.

93
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:12,710
I think it's called and always have the opportunity for your for your people in your email address to

94
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,040
unsubscribe at the bottom.

95
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:14,420
OK.

96
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,000
But it is there's no better distribution channel.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,840
I know it sounds old school but email is the best way.

98
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:27,020
At this point you can use MailChimp which I mention before or something a little bit more advanced which

99
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,450
I use called active campaign and I mention writing a book and you can watch the video on it if you care

100
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,290
you know give as much as you can to your customers as much as you can you know help them out.

101
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,700
Help them get customers.

102
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,330
And you'll find that when it comes to when it comes to business and this took me years to realize you

103
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,290
know relationships are always more important than product knowledge.

104
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,500
And the more you give the more you get in return longer term it's karma whatever.

105
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,720
I like helping people it's just it is it is it is OK.

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,270
And to make sure in your emails you have links obviously to you know Twitter Facebook whatever it is

107
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,690
at the bottom Instagram's a big one.

108
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,180
It's getting more popular I'm having some issues understanding how to use it properly I've started.

109
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,330
But anyway it's just an idea.

110
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,800
All right and here are some more.

111
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,760
And these are more suggestions not really questions that are going to help you from a marketing social

112
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,570
media part.

113
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,290
A portion of your business plan which is important.

114
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,740
It's important.

115
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:32,010
And if you find that doing social media is tough for you because you have to or you have to do so many

116
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,680
different things when you when you create your content.

117
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,960
Like I'll show you actually mean over here.

118
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,630
So let me close this and I'll show you why I'm closing it.

119
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:51,830
So if I open up my browser what I do is for my daily flogs I repurpose them everywhere so I upload it

120
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:58,350
daily YouTube video here and this automatically goes to a new draft page in Linked-In where I upload

121
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,590
reference of of that video.

122
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,860
And then I just upload the logfile cover here for my weekly email and then Twitter.

123
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,480
This is for me to tweet the blog.

124
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,810
This is for me to send it out I'm on Facebook.

125
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:18,330
And this here is just to put it up on on my website as well and you can always go there and read the

126
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,320
blogs if it's helpful to you OK what topics are OK.

127
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,150
But if it's really overwhelming for you instead of doing what I do we're six tabs open automatically

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,830
within within my browser you can go to HootSuite dot com which is kind of like a portal.

129
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,320
It lets you sell all of your social media stuff or distribute.

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,020
I should say one platform she write once read many cut and now make sure that the Linked In profile

131
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,500
of yourself and all your employees is amazing.

132
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,410
You can copy and paste this if you want this old and it teaches you based on lecture I gave on line

133
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,610
on how to how to create an amazing LinkedIn LinkedIn profile and you also want to use Google Alerts

134
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,930
just to find out about the branding of your customer in any way that that sort of thing.

135
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,100
And then this one's kind of out there.

136
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,270
But if all of the social media stuff is complicated hire somebody that's an intern maybe somebody that

137
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,560
gets it.

138
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,300
I find that my kids get social media a lot better than I do my kids don't watch TV.

139
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,080
They watch YouTube whatever.

140
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,410
I find that millennials too are amazing because I was clueless when I first started in the stuff and

141
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,420
I still kind of am.

142
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,600
OK.

143
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,880
And then if you want to make a professional looking brochure you can go to 5 or dot com.

144
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,760
OK go here and get somebody to make it for you for next to nothing.

145
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,480
And that's right.

146
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,150
My book covers done and my logos and we talked about my logos here.

147
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,590
Here in the cover page here.

148
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,010
And there's the video actually if you click right here which I show you how I created these logos on

149
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,070
fiber which literally cost me five bucks to get all these made.

150
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,010
And the turnaround time was was really fast.

151
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,540
Now only go back here to step nine and put yourselves Mark OK again.

152
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,470
All right.

153
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,020
So Fiver's a great resource.

154
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,770
And there's other ones online too that will help you out a lot as well.

155
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,900
If you want to Subha of log or create YouTube videos this is a 40 40 minute vlog I create a YouTube

156
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,760
video one day on how to set up a blog from scratch.

157
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,950
What equipment to use and all that stuff.

158
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,160
Now when it comes to web sites I personally use Squarespace for mine.

159
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,600
But you can use Wordpress as well which I think has some free options but but in Squarespace Let me

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,890
show you here actually.

161
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,510
And you can skip if you want to here in this lecture.

162
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,370
If you don't care about this.

163
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,480
But but I created my web sites here on Squarespace.

164
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,050
It's really really easy to do.

165
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,580
I don't want to learn about your new home and you but you just create new pages there's no coding at

166
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,180
all.

167
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,960
They help you design it is well and you pay a minimal fee as well.

168
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,050
And anyway I have my entire web presence here.

169
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:07,350
So and I blog and put my blog stuff on here directly in my here to market my stuff.

170
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,630
So let me go back to your story.

171
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,910
OK.

172
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,440
And you can create from scratch a great looking web site using Squarespace and have all these wonderful

173
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,580
templates with images.

174
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,000
It's fun too.

175
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,960
OK.

176
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,000
And then oh for business cards.

177
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,610
I don't want to use a place like Vistaprint where which is where I got some of my brochure stuff something

178
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,960
I actually want you to go to this Web site here.

179
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,720
I'm going to show you.

180
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:39,830
It's called Move as an account to dot com ads your business card is kind of old school in some countries.

181
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,830
People still use a lot not as much in the Bay Area but these are wonderful business cards that are that

182
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,760
are that are thick and they're really creative as well.

183
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,570
And Air B and B whatever a lot of other great companies you use them.

184
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:01,560
It's a little bit little bit pricey so obviously just do a search on the word coupon and then Miew and

185
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,340
then you can get these for a lot cheaper.

186
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:11,040
It's a little pricey sometimes it can cost you 20 cents just to to use one whatever.

187
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,680
So I use them sparingly if at all.

188
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,630
And then here you want to write on your social media strategy so all these these little pieces of advice

189
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,240
humbly for what it's worth here in these two rows.

190
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,840
You can use this for the content of some of these questions you answer here so this one here.

191
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,260
Talk about your social media strategy here.

192
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,870
And I tag it as your social media strategy in case you always want to know where it is in this entire

193
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,870
spreadsheet.

194
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,090
And then what your lead generation strategy So here you're going to talk about your email marketing

195
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,830
campaign or lead generation campaign and how you get customers from online sources.

196
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:57,750
If it's pleasurable which it should be and then hear your off line media strategy and if you is like

197
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,620
old school stuff like radio TV newspaper trade shows etc. you want to mention that here and you can

198
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,270
always look at how your competition does that sort of thing as well.

199
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,390
Obviously it's getting a lot cheaper to advertise on you know radio whatever in other places because

200
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,660
you know Nazmi people are using that and you can even consider looking into creating a podcast longer

201
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:18,900
term.

202
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,190
But the bottom line is you want to repurpose your content you write once read many.

203
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,760
So if you create a blog daily or whatever then maybe a little video snippet can be used on Instagram.

204
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,440
And there's a guy named Gary Vaynerchuk and do a search on him Gary V.

205
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,900
That's what people call him and see his campaign.

206
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,480
He does a really really good job on this and he is a thought leader he's very vocal as well so let me

207
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,440
see Gary V if I search here will take us his Web site of course it does.

208
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,140
And so he does a really good job.

209
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,040
He's edgy but he gets his point across.

210
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,430
OK.

211
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,470
So you can understand what his social media strategy is just by going to his Web site here.

212
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,040
OK.

213
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,390
He's whatever he is.

214
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,040
The thing is if you don't remind people of your success a lot of times people don't know about it.

215
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,820
I know that sounds a little bit out there and uncomfortable for a Canadian to say whatever.

216
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,620
But anyway you get the idea.

217
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:21,750
But but use his as a model if you want to because I think he he gets it and he has gotten and he understands

218
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,820
it better than I think anybody out there.

219
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,690
So Gary and you can listen to his podcast as well.

220
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,380
It's weekly and it's engaging.

221
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,370
And so once you're done with all this your score will score your status we'll update here as well as

222
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,730
here as in all cases or you can just go here to override what I did there and if you want to come back

223
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,790
to this social media stuff later you can always you know click here like I've mentioned before and flag

224
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:56,070
these flag appear down there so that those that fly a couple of them whatever and then come back to

225
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,590
it later.

226
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:04,410
And to your comments on the right there if you want but we are now done with Step Nine where we're almost

227
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,510
two thirds done.

228
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,240
Our price is 64 percent.

229
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,430
Great job.

230
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,760
And I will see you in the next lecture where we will talk about sales and marketing outputs.

231
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,240
Thanks.
