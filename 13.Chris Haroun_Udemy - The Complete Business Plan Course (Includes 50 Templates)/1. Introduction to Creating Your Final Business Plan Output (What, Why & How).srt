00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:07,720
This is my favorite part of the Course as it's a crescendo collection an amalgamation of all 13 steps

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:14,380
in terms of what why and how of creating your final business plan output I'll kick it off for the what.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,910
What are we going to learn.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:22,930
We're going to learn how to use the answers to the many questions that we answered in steps 1 through

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,100
13 and we're going to assemble your incredible business plan.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:36,700
Let's move on to why now if we click on the final outputs business plan button here we see a massive

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,660
amount of information.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:46,700
Why is everything that we have created for our business plan on this one tab and in a modular meaning

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,660
grouped fashion.

10
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:55,870
Well because I want to show you from a high level perspective all of your hard work in one location

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,850
as this will help us to create our final content for our Microsoft Word business plan.

12
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,400
So how are we going to create our final business plan together.

13
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,460
Well I want you to think of the green shaded items you see here as being your heading ones and your

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,960
blue shaded items here as being your heading twos and threes for your table of contents.

15
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,870
And if that doesn't make a lot of sense you don't worry because it will in a second.

16
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,410
Okay.

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,820
So what will happen is these will automatically link to our table of contents on the appropriate pages

18
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,520
in the Microsoft Word template that you selected that you want to use back in step 2.

19
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:45,370
And don't worry as we will break this process down in this part of the course and make it really easy

20
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,260
and fun to complete together.

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,680
Thanks.
