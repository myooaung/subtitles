12
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.510
as you know how to write a book to give to your potential customers.

When you meet them and also how to think about creating a Web site how to get the best quality business

14
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.430
cards and how to get professional brochures and other content made for you at a low low price online.

15
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.020
Also we're going to talk about how to make a great logo.

16
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.860
And I provide links to a lot of videos that I have made on the aforementioned topics in the resources

17
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.530
part of the toolbar right here.

18
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.390
And we can also analyze how our competitors market stuff online and offline.

19
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.060
OK now let's move on to why why are we spending time even discussing how to create online content like

20
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.800
articles or videos because it's free advertising for you.

21
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.730
And if you become a thought leader which I know you can in your industry then it's goal from a marketing

22
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.410
perspective.

23
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.190
I'm going to teach you you know how to how to create online content.

24
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.570
I have a blog.

25
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.840
And if you want here's a link here in the resources part of the menu here to see how to log on line.

26
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.700
And there's another resource here to teach you how to create articles.

27
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.330
I use that my own ink column online and my editor taught me how to write like a journalist and I want

28
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.180
to show you as well.

29
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.880
I have a video for that as well.

30
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.870
OK.

31
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.600
So if you're thought of as a thought leader and you write often and you create contents then it's so

32
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.480
much easier to sell your product or your service.

33
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.060
Now we know why entrepreneurs like to group sales and marketing together in business in general and

34
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.900
in business plans.

35
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.140
OK lastly.

36
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.100
How are we going to complete Step 9 well we're going to click on our inputs analysis button as always

37
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.930
and answer the questions.

38
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.650
And of course some of the questions are optional optional.

39
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.730
Then if we click on the outputs button we see that your sales and marketing portion of your business

40
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.810
plan is automatically created for you.
