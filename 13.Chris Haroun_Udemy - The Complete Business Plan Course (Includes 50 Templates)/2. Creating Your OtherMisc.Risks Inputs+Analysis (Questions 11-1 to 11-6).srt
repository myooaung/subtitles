1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:09,940
Please click on Step 11 other miscellaneous inputs and analysis and this section here is for other stuff

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,130
we haven't talked about yet.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,800
And I went through a really long list of things to add to a business plan and where I didn't know or

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,480
I wasn't sure where it where to include these that would be relevant for everybody and so I put in a

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,650
lot of risks here.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,190
OK.

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,250
And so one of them here is one of the is the risk of future technology developments and it doesn't matter

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,420
if you're running a tech company or not.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,330
Technology developments in the future will have an impact on the industry whether it's I don't know

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,980
maybe you're in the taxi industry a decade ago and you kind of foresaw that there would be some sort

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,250
of online a lift or Uber type platform longer term you want to document this because it allows the reader

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,590
to understand how long term focused you are.

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,670
It's it's really important to know what can destroy your industry so you can get ahead of it and disrupt

14
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,670
yourself.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,710
And I'll give you an example.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,320
So there's Reed Hastings brilliant man who also lives pretty close to here.

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,090
He loves education as well.

18
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,880
He's the founder and CEO of Netflix of course.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,870
And he disrupted his business model.

20
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,920
And investors were upset for a while but he didn't care.

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,550
He's such a brilliant man.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,550
But Netflix used to be DVD only and then he went to streaming longer term because the writing was on

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,810
the wall that that online distribution would disrupt his business model longer term.

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,260
So I want you to think like like Reid did please.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:30,750
HASTINGS.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,000
And just think about what can disrupt your business model longer term from a technology development

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,220
perspective and just comment on it and it could always be preempted every battles while enforcement

28
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,170
fought.

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,280
Another quote there from Sun said the art of war.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,790
OK next up we've got risks of future competition emerging case so let's say there was a large company

31
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,300
in your industry or a similar industry to yours.

32
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,370
That's not in your market yet.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,450
If they were to enter the industry what would that mean.

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,740
What would that mean for your company.

35
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:11,140
This one here is just risk of future macroeconomic developments and so if the economy goes into a significant

36
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,800
recession you know how you react and if you go to the annual reports of all your competition if applicable.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,550
We did that earlier in Step seven when we went to apples to apples and your reports have said for the

38
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,270
past X years when every many years you'll see that all of these new reports mention some sort of economic

39
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,700
risk that could emerge.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,190
And just talk about it here briefly if you can.

41
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:43,630
And I think that the best business models are the ones that are founded during recessions because they're

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,060
lean and mean and they can come out in and really scaler business when the economy picks up and business

43
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,380
is always cyclical no matter what anybody tells you.

44
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,580
If anybody says this time is different it never is.

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:02,590
But just kind of right down here how future macher macroeconomic decline could impact your business.

46
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:03,970
OK.

47
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,210
Next up we've got future other developments.

48
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,880
If I haven't listed a risk yet than just had it here please.

49
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,330
You want to cover every angle so that there are no questions basically from from from whoever is reading

50
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,320
this business plan that can be really impressed with you when it's done.

51
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,730
And I wrote here.

52
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,080
Disaster recovery and I made this one mandatory as well.

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,480
You know what your disaster recovery plan if if there's if there's a fire or if you lose all of your

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,920
data.

55
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,060
That sort of thing it just shows that you're very thoughtful with your long term approach to creating

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,110
your business plan.

57
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,530
And and the reader the business plan will love that.

58
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,830
This one is optional but I love it.

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,370
I love it.

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,750
OK.

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,190
This one here.

62
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,500
When I used to work in the hedge fund industry I would whenever I met with a CEO of a company I was

63
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,530
considering investing in or vice versa I would always ask that person this question which is this was

64
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:02,100
the most mis understood aspect of your business plan by investors or by business partners or by whatever

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,690
is it.

66
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,030
It really shows again that you're very thoughtful in your approach and you've thought of everything

67
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,000
to include But it's a little bit esoteric So it's optional.

68
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:20,640
So when you're done with all the questions here this will update to 100 percent or you can click here

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,490
to override it and this will automatically update to 100 percent.

70
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,730
So we're making a lot of progress.

71
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,880
Now we're done with Step 11 inputs.

72
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,010
Now there's miscellaneous documents you might have that you want to include here in the appendix and

73
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,620
don't worry we'll cover that in a lot of detail later on when we discuss what to include in the appendix

74
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,520
or I clicked on the image there.

75
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,680
But I will see you in the next Lesher where we cover the outputs.

76
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,770
First step 11.

77
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,180
Thanks.
