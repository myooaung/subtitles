00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,290
Please click on inputs and analysis for Step 8 free or go to market strategy which means how you distribute

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,680
your products.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:15,600
And I provided this helpful green shaded row here just to kind of explain.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,270
Go to market strategy and a little bit more detail.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,280
And it basically means how you're going to reach your customers how good your products or just your

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,810
services to customers.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:33,210
And so a direct delivery or distribution and direct model means you're selling directly to your customers.

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,520
I mean there's no middleman like Dell computer would sell computers over their web site only and not

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,200
in stores.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,540
In the past and then there's indirect which basically means if you're selling your products to a retailer

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:54,480
like Best Buy or or or Wal-Mart or even Amazon if they're if you're having somebody sell your products

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,140
for you through another distribution channel and just try to think about as you complete this part of

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,980
a business plan how do you ensure that no customer is more than 10 percent of your total revenue in

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,830
the very long run because that could be a red flag for some investors.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,070
Some don't care when it right.

16
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,370
It all depends and every business Miles little bit difference.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,850
And then we're going to talk about your sales and your sales force team's strategy in the next part

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,250
which is which is part 9 here we're just talking about distribution of your product or service.

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,180
I mean here we just you know you're entering here.

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,350
What is your online distribution strategy if you have one.

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,380
What is your off line strategy.

22
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:43,040
And then here what is your direct distribution strategy and I thought about not having an online distribution

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,140
strategy or at least have that is optional but I'm keeping it in there because longer term everything

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,410
is going to be sold online or sourced online or you'll be able to get leads online.

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,240
So I'm I'm leaving that in because I think that whoever reads the business plans can be thinking longer

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,780
term like that as well.

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,790
But it's not relevant you can always to leave it.

28
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,390
And then here this is direct to your customers meaning if there is no middleman.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,590
And then here you got indirect meaning if you sell to somebody that you know is going to is going to

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,180
sell for you like selling it to wholesale.

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,350
And then here is just the cost of distribution.

32
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,410
Don't spend too much time on this answer though please because we're in talk about the cost of everything.

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,210
In a lot of detail in Step 12 when we talk about financials but I included it here because we're talking

34
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,070
about distribution meaning our go to market strategy and whoever's reading your report might be curious

35
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,150
about the cost of distribution even though we'll go in a much more detail on this later on.

36
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,430
So we are now done with with Step 8 inputs.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,930
So if you answer all the questions here and I think they're all mandatory there's no optional ones here.

38
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,370
Then you'll see 100 percent show up or you can override here by selecting that and now shows 100 percent

39
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,140
done and we're officially 57 percent done look at that needles movement pretty cool.

40
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:00,990
Pretty cool.

41
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,950
Ok I will see you in the outputs part of step 8.

42
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,310
Thanks.
