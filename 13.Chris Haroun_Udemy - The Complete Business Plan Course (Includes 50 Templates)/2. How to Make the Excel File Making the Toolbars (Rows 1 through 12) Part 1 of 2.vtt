00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.620
In the next couple of lectures I'm going to show you how easy it is to create this entire spreadsheet

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.150
from scratch.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.780
There is no code in this.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.570
There are no macros.

5
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.540
It's really really easy to do.

6
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.250
And these aren't even buttons These are just images here and so what I'll do is I'm going to start off

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.250
by just teaching you how to create these image buttons or I guess I just call them images.

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.750
And then what we'll do is we'll build upon what we've learned and learned some of the more complex stuff

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.450
later.

10
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.360
So to kick it off what we're going to do is I'm going to show you how to make these buttons here.

11
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:45.260
And so all I did was actually insert inserted shapes and I insert shapes that look like this ok like

12
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.200
that.

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.850
And then what I did was and it's important to try to keep that we go.

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.620
It's not working.

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.810
It's very and it's important to try to keep the size of the spreadsheet small and so Excel is so brilliant

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.450
because if you insert the same image over and over and over again it only treats as one image and not

17
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.800
multiple images so we'll keep that in mind when we talk about creating little images like these to insert

18
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.860
OK so let's make this first button.

19
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.560
Let's call this one the home button and it's pretty easy to do all you got to do is just Center the

20
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.250
tax properly and then you can size it any way you want as well and change the fun as well.

21
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.930
So what I'll do is I'm going to make it exactly like I made here.

22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.260
It'll take too long as I try to be a perfectionist whatever and I just take too long.

23
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.270
So what we're going to do is this they've got a really cool feature here that allows you to use presets.

24
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.990
So instead of just adding a shadow we can add a bunch of stuff at the same time.

25
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.060
And so if we make a button like that.

26
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.230
There you go we're done.

27
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.420
Pretty cool.

28
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.300
OK.

29
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.570
Now actually I like that one better than one just right for next course I'll do that.

30
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.520
Then if you want to insert a way to tell the button what to do when you press the image I should say

31
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.840
all you got to do is this.

32
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.800
It's easy.

33
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.560
Right click your hyperlink it kind of like a hyperlink to a Web site.

34
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.590
So if we wanted to make this hyperlink to a Web site we could do that HDP

35
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.940
on the screen.

36
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.300
The screen typically got Kate when you mouse over.

37
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.410
And then here is the actual link.

38
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.460
And then all you got to do is click and you're done.

39
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.990
So if we go to CNN I don't want to see what the news.

40
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.620
OK.

41
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.860
I'm having a good day.

42
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.710
All right.

43
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.880
And that's basically it.

44
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.770
Now if you want to put images we'll take it one step further now so I'm going to hack this apart here

45
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.140
so you'll see this here is just text on top.

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.190
See what I did was actually put an image in the background in story.

47
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.970
So I did not have to create multiple hyperlinks here meaning on the image and the button all that it

48
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.080
was added the hyperlink to the text so that text box there.

49
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.870
So this text box has hyperlink on it again.

50
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.950
But I want to show you how to put this on here.

51
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.760
So the only way to put an image on top.

52
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.690
Oh see I got it.

53
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.230
I got to send that to the front now.

54
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.260
So right click bring two front.

55
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.040
OK.

56
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:49.800
Now instead of me going ahead and adding hypertext to this and this what you can do is you can insert

57
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.730
a text box on top.

58
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.440
And so you go here shapes textbooks lips.

59
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.030
I had seen in their ID.

60
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.830
Right so here's a text box we can put on top.

61
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.480
And this way we don't have to actually put the hyperlink on the button or the image itself.

62
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.090
And so of course we have to do is we had to make this image see through little go no fail and then no

63
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.240
line as well.

64
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:32.940
And then what you can do is you can then just insert the hyperlink onto this text box so you right click

65
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.480
hyperlink and they insert here and so we have CNN and our clipboard already and you do it right.

66
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.300
I don't know.

67
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.030
Go to CNN when they mouseover.

68
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.060
OK.

69
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.740
Then when we if we were missed out on it was the bad news today.

70
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.020
You see the top left hand corner for some reason does that sometimes the the most or texts a little

71
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.610
bit off you can see that there.

72
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.500
OK good.

73
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.670
And then what you do is you would group this stuff in.

74
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.570
It's kind of tricky to group in here but what I would do is I would usually insert a brand new sheet

75
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.040
and then let me go back home here and get the stuff here.

76
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.840
So I'm pretty pushed down shift while I slept these three items here copy

77
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:31.230
and then I paste mount here and then what I can do is I can hit control a select all and then group

78
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.390
a circuit that means in second.

79
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.720
So now to go control or command it.

80
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:43.470
I mean if you're a Mac on a PC and then what you do is right click and then you select group gut.

81
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.960
OK great is all this here and I'm going to build on this slowly but this here is just one massive group.

82
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:59.210
And that way I could put all this stuff on every single page out there except for the green button because

83
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.080
the green button is different on every page because that convention I used in this course was if you're

84
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.790
on a certain tab then make it green.

85
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.990
OK.

86
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.870
And then what I did was actually create another menu here and I hit a couple of things.

87
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.620
Now unhide them one at a time.

88
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.790
OK so Master menu here.

89
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:28.530
That's for all the resources in the background like to go to my youtube pages or whatever.

90
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.480
And then also for the total progress and I'll show you that a second but I want to first of all do the

91
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.310
buttons because more fun OK.

92
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.500
There you go.

93
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.070
All right.

94
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:48.210
So this here was my master hidden menu and as I put this here just in case I delete it elsewhere.

95
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:56.520
And this is the only place where I made the menu and then you'll see it won't let me drag it up any

96
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.240
more than that in the corner there if I let go.

97
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.890
That's kind of tricky on your show you really come in handy if you're trying to create the centering

98
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.340
of this entire menu on every page to be identical.

99
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.890
It controls it looks like I squish that to there for a second.

100
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.350
OK.

101
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.870
So.

102
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.950
So if you were to play around with this you'd see that is kind of hard for me to explain it but I want

103
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.800
to get this across to you because I mean it's important.

104
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.950
You see here how it won't call any more than that.

105
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.840
Underneath it.

106
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:35.520
Now what I did was I did that on purpose and you can create a hidden box here so I'm going to ungroup

107
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.870
everything and you're going to see how I did this.

108
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.770
He'll take a second.

109
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.050
There's just a loss of that.

110
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.300
There's a little box up there.

111
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.530
It's hard to see because it's invisible.

112
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.480
See it OK.

113
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:55.890
And I created that little box up there so that when I grouped everything together we couldn't move any

114
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.440
closer than that box there.

115
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:04.590
And the reason I did that was so I can just jam this entire menu up and the top left hand side on every

116
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.800
single sheet.

117
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.360
And if I didn't have it it wouldn't be perfect and it would take eight million years to try to line

118
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.010
everything perfectly socially with them.

119
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:24.680
So if I click control or command and then I go here group and then if I try to jam all of that up in

120
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:31.040
the corner there I'll be able to move it closer or see disaster and then I'll end up using the arrow

121
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.840
keys to try to get it perfect on every single tab.

122
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.370
OK you get the idea.

123
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.070
All right so I guess what I'll do now is I'll just play around on this slide here this will be our sandbox.

124
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.700
All right.

125
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.080
It's nerd talk for playing around tech stuff this non-production.

126
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.530
All right.

127
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.220
So I took off the home and so on and there Neith here.

128
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.690
All that is just an image and I copied that same image.

129
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.410
A bunch of times and all the gray boxes are different renditions of that.

130
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.860
And then here and we you to do is when you get these little images like that magnifying glass or the

131
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.410
law whatever make sure that they're small.

132
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:18.280
OK so if you get them online or from these graphic stalked accom and I got all of my stuff and I'll

133
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.820
actually go to I don't see the news graphics.

134
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.450
Dot com.

135
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.220
There should be a web page is all this should be a news site and all they're allowed to do is just give.

136
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.460
All right.

137
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:36.840
So I have this here is called story blocks and it's an amalgamation of three different companies.

138
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.030
There is a video which is called the your box.

139
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:46.890
I use that for some of my courses and the images which you see graphic stock and then there's audio.

140
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.250
And I got my music here as well images music and that is kind of fun.

141
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.030
OK.

142
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.320
All right.

143
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.880
So make sure these are all tiny whenever you put them in.

144
00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.320
Because sometimes it's a disaster.

145
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.990
These little things sometimes can be seven or eight megs.

146
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.600
And then you're screwed and performance sucks.

147
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:11.290
And so I got this entire file that we use in this course too and it was five next or so which I'm pretty

148
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:11.760
proud of.

149
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.950
It took me a while for that.

150
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:13.840
OK.

151
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.630
So they're all the same thing there.

152
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:23.350
And under here and if you're using if you're using a PC or any other Mac aside from my own you probably

153
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:29.150
saw the flags update here automatically didn't know mine which is unfortunate but it is what it is.

154
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:33.630
And this here I'm going to show you how to do later so just so I remember this.

155
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.170
Throw societ can ok.

156
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.670
GARRETT Welcome back to the end.

157
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.980
What I did there actually is that's a treat.

158
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.840
Change the transparency built in.

159
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.560
Because I didn't want to show it like when the green when this turns green this button when you click

160
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.290
it.

161
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.980
I didn't want that to be too white in the background so I went here transparency suit there and there

162
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.430
is there is candida.

163
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.050
My people are present.

164
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.870
There you go.

165
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.270
OK.

166
00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.640
All right.

167
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.820
Now this here I just got off of off a fiver.

168
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.170
I paid that guy five bucks to make that.

169
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.810
And you saw that I think back in Section step two the course.

170
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.110
Explain how to that just an image.

171
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.350
All right.

172
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:26.260
So we are almost done with the images this here all this is here is just the text is hyper tech sensitive

173
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.810
on top of that piece here.

174
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:35.650
This is just a little image that way and this way in the way that I got to know for some reason Siri

175
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:36.840
thought I was talking.

176
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.890
All right.

177
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.890
The way I did these images here was I use them here with an Excel and you want to use these Excel images

178
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:52.710
she can because there Microsoft created and to the extent that they're actually not that memory intensive.

179
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.540
So what I did was and you can always just use mirror that paint press feature we use before you can

180
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.150
kind of paint brush that this should work we see your paint brushes that boy here and should pick up

181
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.260
a lot of it to pick up all that.

182
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.900
Not all of it.

183
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.560
OK anyway I played around with it but by going up to this little cool menu I loved to use and I used

184
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.310
I used a bunch of the presets and played around with them and I use a bevel if I pronounce that right

185
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.060
Bebel.

186
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.260
And then I kind of played around with with a bunch theory.

187
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.270
Yeah that's it.

188
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.710
And then you name that that's how he did that.

189
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.920
And again these are the only hyper hypertext is on the text itself.

190
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.220
And then these little guys here.

191
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.210
Oh my God these were pain in the neck.

192
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.240
So I put it in these gray little boxes here.

193
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.930
And then what happened was I had to put green behind.

194
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.510
They're hard to see.

195
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.320
So I'm going to dismantle this bat boy here.

196
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.650
And anyway that there's there's a grey box behind that and then you've got to you've got to use the

197
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.410
send back thing see it there.

198
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.100
It's actually a couple different layers.

199
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.820
Pain in the neck but it's fun.

200
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:08.690
And then there's a really cool feature which works best on PowerPoint but if you click this how trippy

201
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:09.360
is that.

202
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:15.130
So it just thinks that there's a couple of images ungroup everything.

203
00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.620
But when you have tons of them.

204
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.660
This is dope.

205
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.600
It's awesome.

206
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.860
It's trippy to write.

207
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.950
Oh that was cool.

208
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:23.690
I went back on that.

209
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.730
That's new.

210
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.490
All right.

211
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.230
And Microsoft developers always anticipate where you're trying to do when you right click.

212
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:36.550
Always nice to coatl I have dated myself many times of course but Right-Click always OK.

213
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.480
All right.

214
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.150
So I think we're done with all the buttons now.

215
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:46.210
These these guys here were a bit challenging to make in all.

216
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.750
All you if you want to change around color do something fancy.

217
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.120
What do you think.

218
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.430
What do you.

219
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:58.210
I to tell you now I'm going to write like I can right click for picture always right click.

220
00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.390
And then there is there's kind of cool little fill features here.

221
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:09.290
You can have a solid fill a gradient fill and I use gradient a little bit here as well.

222
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.480
You see this here and I play around a lot.

223
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.730
Look up here's what I can change up here.

224
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:18.120
And then you can change around to a different color.

225
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.090
Again it appears that preset gradients as well.

226
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.850
You got to drag these little Barnum's over here.

227
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.160
That's French.

228
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.120
OK.

229
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:33.140
And then just changes around here and eventually you'll see changes a little bit.

230
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.490
You know it's kind of painful takes well and you can put your own images in the back if you wanted to.

231
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.270
I don't I don't suggest that folks will take up less space.

232
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.920
OK.

233
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.610
Now I want to show you this quickly.

234
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:51.050
And it's not going to work perfectly for whatever reason but you've got to make sure that you have move

235
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.350
and size on all of these otherwise you won't be able to minimize that screen here.

236
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.920
And these guys will stick out like a sore thumb.

237
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.830
So if you don't do that they won't minimize but those all minimize there enough on what should be a

238
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.350
little more.

239
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.010
OK.

240
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.410
And when you group them together they group minimize even smaller which which is which is pretty cool.

241
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:13.880
Pretty cool.

242
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.200
OK great.

243
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.180
And let me see I think we're almost done here.

244
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.740
These here are just I got that from Apple.

245
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.540
I had a really the resolution sucks.

246
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.590
If you if you zoom way and but I had to do that to keep this size small.

247
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.530
Okay great.

248
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:38.140
And I think we're we're we're done with all of this here and this here is just an image.

249
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.680
Oh I kept this the same on every single page.

250
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.970
So basically in order to work smarter not harder these links here.

251
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.270
This Q&amp;A just goes to my Web site for the YouTube stuff whatever.

252
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.800
And this here just it goes to my Web site Al-Safir PTF.

253
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.900
But they all go to the exact same like every one of these PDA once.

254
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:04.510
And that way you kind of have one pointer and that's instead of creating multiple instances which which

255
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:10.930
is kind of like hard coding when you when you code bucket and here these here these are just text boxes.

256
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.760
And then what I did was if you right click you can insert a hyperlink.

257
00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.550
I went to Wikipedia and then that's it there.

258
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.330
And these huge boxes.

259
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.840
And then what I'll do is I've shown you everything here when I actually have the checkboxes.

260
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.030
Yeah we'll get there soon.

261
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.180
The reason I threw this little house hoax that's I was saying Ken.

262
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:38.380
And by the way at 6:00 the homescreen here the reason I put that house on a bunch of screens is because

263
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:46.210
I was worried that the that the student would get lost if they minimized the screen and they wouldn't

264
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.120
know where the home button is.

265
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:54.130
That's why I had a little house there house and then it gets so I've been told my whole life I have

266
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.030
an accent but I don't.

267
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.310
Americans have the accent OK not not Canadians.

268
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.970
We invented English OK.

269
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.820
All right.

270
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.520
So if if you click on that it'll go back to my home.

271
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.890
So anyway go out there and get the idea.

272
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.840
And I think that these here are just buttons.

273
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.230
And then this here is just an image.

274
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.960
And there you just right click and then you can insert a comma.

275
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.150
You know the drill.

276
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.980
And then up up up up.

277
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.070
OK that's it.

278
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.490
Good.

279
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.800
All right so we're done with the images now.

280
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.970
Now when I teach.

281
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.350
Oh one more thing I want to show you.

282
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.450
So it's important.

283
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:32.500
This it's called.

284
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.570
So there's a great feature that lets you line up lots of items.

285
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:43.920
So what you do is I am going to bring a couple of guys down here can we get some images.

286
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.620
So easier explaining with images.

287
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.780
All right.

288
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:50.760
All right.

289
00:17:50.820 --> 00:18:01.860
So let's have a say have three or four boxes I'll just kind of copy a bunch of this compromise here

290
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.220
though that gets one right.

291
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:10.190
Let's just use three boxes and let's say that we want to line them up perfectly.

292
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:17.060
That's why we want to line a couple of boxes up so that they're perfectly flush lined on the bottom.

293
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.410
OK.

294
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:22.900
So what you do in this case is a group that lasy

295
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:29.580
hand-grip OK got

296
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.170
lots going on here.

297
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.760
Slow here.

298
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.390
OK good.

299
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.790
So we're ungrouped.

300
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:45.460
So what we would do is you would select multiple boxes at the same time and then line it up on the bottom

301
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.040
or the top with the left to the right.

302
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:47.400
I'll show it.

303
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.970
That means it and this will be.

304
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.730
This will save a lot.

305
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.720
It's fun to get count artistic so you get a picture format here.

306
00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.550
It has a menu doesn't appear until you click on them and then you go to a line and a line bottom to

307
00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.290
wash those three rectangles.

308
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.510
Watch this.

309
00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.880
See that pretty cool.

310
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.930
So they're perfectly aligned on the bottom.

311
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:13.210
And what I usually do is I usually make the master one way higher up than the others and vice versa

312
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.540
where I can align the top line left whatever it is.

313
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:21.190
And you can also sort of I have a dream go back to where it was.

314
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:29.520
You can also have them spaced out horizontally as well sort of selected the text there.

315
00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:35.780
But if you select multiples and I try to do this over here they are almost perfectly spaced.

316
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.200
One tenth of a millimeter somewhere which drove me crazy but whatever.

317
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.920
If you want to give me a one star of you I completely.

318
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.110
If you want to you want to 100 percent money back guarantee right now.

319
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.190
31 days later I totally get.

320
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.310
I'm with you.

321
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.560
Right so go here.

322
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.670
Pick your format and then we can go to a line industry horizontally.

323
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.700
Watch this thinking OK.

324
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.500
So they're perfectly distributed horizontally.

325
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.600
And then we can do this you can line them top middle bottom and ever but they're now flush.

326
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.110
OK it'll work.

327
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.600
There you go.

328
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.120
OK.
