00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.400
Hello and welcome back to the course on computer vision.

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.040
And today we're going to talk about cascading.

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.790
So previously we discussed about the show on classifiers and how they're constructed from Week classifiers

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.860
and put them together.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.780
And now we're going to talk about another hack that the burial of Jones algorithm applies in order to

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.950
speed up the process.

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.420
And the hack is called Cascadian schematically it looks like this.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.170
We take a window that we're evaluating on our.

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.150
So that's a window that is sliding across our lives and we look for the first feature in all or list

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.540
of features.

11
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.210
So for the most important feature and then we see if it's present on the image or in that same window

12
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.040
if it's present in some window or not if it's not present in the same window then we reject that window

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.500
completely and we don't even evaluate the remainder of the picture.

14
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.410
So if for instance this is the most water feature and we find out that it's not present in some window

15
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.400
then we're not even going to look at these.

16
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.510
Then if you say the way to think about it is if if there is no nos an image then it's just not going

17
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.210
to be a face like a frontal face has to have a nose therefore what's the point of looking for eyes and

18
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.540
cheeks and eyebrows and so on if we're you know that there's no nodes.

19
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.070
Then if this feature is in the presence of if there is a nose then it is time to walk for the second

20
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.540
feature.

21
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.880
Now we're going to evaluate if the second features in that sampling them if it's not then we reject

22
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.620
the subway for instance if there's a nose but then whatever this is there's this looks thing an eyebrow

23
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.320
but it's upside down so maybe there's no Water-Lily.

24
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.500
Whatever this feature represents whatever the algorithm was looking for there.

25
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.650
It's not present then we're going to now reject the reject image because it has a nose and doesn't have

26
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.310
a lip so on your face.

27
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.130
So then if certain value the third feature if it is present if that should also happen then and without

28
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.090
talked.

29
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.340
And so on.

30
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.250
So if servies is not present then we reject and move on.

31
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.640
So that's the simplistic diagrammatic kind of explanation.

32
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.450
In reality it's a bit more complex.

33
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.660
In reality of course it's very risky to rely on just one feature because maybe it might not be.

34
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.240
Maybe the shade is in such a way or the lighting is different or maybe just so for some reason wasn't

35
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.660
detected as can be lots of different circumstance so what it actually does is in this first step it

36
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.110
doesn't look at the one feature it looks like the top five features with the top 12 inches.

37
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.650
Well let's say let's say Tokai for argument's sake it looks at top five features and then decides based

38
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.220
on them so if if they're not present if for instance none of them are present then or some portion of

39
00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:00.820
them are present like the details the details are not important right now what is important is the whole

40
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.930
concept that regardless if you find identifies based on the first five features it takes one of two

41
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.530
or three or four or five and it's based on them that this window this some Windu is pointless had to

42
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.590
keep looking at it's not a face it won't continue then here it will look at the next 12 here or look

43
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.310
at the next 25 or something.

44
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.250
So every time because the features are becoming less and less important less and less prominent is taking

45
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.660
more and more of these features.

46
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.280
But nevertheless is basing its decision on whether or not to continue going forward with this on the

47
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.940
at the at that point in time all the features it's looking at.

48
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.720
And if it is not happy with one and seeing things that it might now like if it decides that over here

49
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.690
that right now this should be the these features and all this many of these features that are not there.

50
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.340
This is not a face.

51
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.020
I'm not even going to evaluate the rest.

52
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.550
And that is called cascading.

53
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.170
It helps really speed up the process.

54
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.450
So in visual terms let's say that these are all features that we identify.

55
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.510
Again we'll go back to the simple example of just getting them one by one rather than in batches.

56
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.490
And so what we're going to look at is we're going to look at the subgroup over here.

57
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.090
And so let's say we look at this feature and we can see that it is present.

58
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.900
That's the eyebrow over here.

59
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.740
Dark and bright.

60
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.230
So this will pass so that that passes.

61
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.580
OK so it goes from here to here.

62
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.140
Good.

63
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.010
Second Future looks for this.

64
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.310
You can see that in the eye.

65
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.260
OK it passes then goes to this and maybe in this case it actually can see that.

66
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:45.040
So this is technically this feature is reserved or was originally planned for the lips so light black

67
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.760
lights a light dark light and it would that would have identify liberties we've got an intuition that

68
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.210
actually eyeball you can see the same thing you can see light dark and light so it can mistakenly actually

69
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.560
accept the this feature is here and would say oh this features here so we do have the lips and really

70
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.190
we don't.

71
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.110
But OK so even if that passes it gets to this future and it cannot identify this feature because this

72
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.860
feature for instance like nowhere on this image you can see like light and dark until dark and you can

73
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.350
see the light and dark of light but not the other way around the white and black like that.

74
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.990
So it was actually for this part of the nose as far as I remember.

75
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.730
So at this point it would at this point it would reject I would say this feature features are present

76
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.530
so featuring them for the present.

77
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.790
They reject the sub window completely and it wouldn't even evaluate this feature.

78
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.440
And as you can imagine you can get kind of 100 features or how many features after that it would just

79
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.080
not evaluate them any of them.

80
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.010
And even though evaluation takes like split seconds for each one but when you add them up because there's

81
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.590
so many of them it takes time and plus you have to go through this image lots of time with some windows.

82
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.480
And so it saves not just time devaluing the Swan But lots of features all the features that come afterwards.

83
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.000
And it just rejects this whole sub window and moves on.

84
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.780
And that really speeds up the process and that's called cascading.

85
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.030
So on that note we're going to wrap up today's tutorial.

86
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.960
I hope you enjoyed it and I look forward to seeing you next time.

87
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.670
And until then enjoy computer vision.
