1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,840
Welcome back everyone to the part of the social clone project.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,080
We're going to finish up the accounts application.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,610
That means our log in log out and sign up capabilities by setting up the log in and log out your calls

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,090
and or setting up py file creating two more templates for that and then we'll also set up the migration.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,960
So we're going to continue with the accounts application right where we left off from the previous lecture.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,200
OK.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,940
Here I am Adam text editor.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,860
Remember in the previous lecture we finished off creating are based studies team M-file.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,540
What we need to do is set up the log in to redirect your URL and log out redirect you RL that the log

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,310
in and log out views are going to call and we're going to need to do that within our settings that PI

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,880
file.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,690
So go to simple social settings not pi.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,450
And then these usually go all the way at the bottom so scroll all the way down and we're going to set

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,680
up two variables.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,730
So you're going to say log in underscore redirects underscore you are l.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,190
So this is the log in redirect and we'll have this redirect to a test page and then we will have our

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,830
log out underscore read redirect underscore you Earl and I'm going to have that be equal to A thinks

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,470
page.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,730
So we'll save that.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,750
And now that we've said test and thinks let's actually create those templates so we didn't create those

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,500
templates inside of our top level templates in the same directory we're based on index trees.

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:30,180
Tim L-R so we'll a new file and I'm going to call this file test.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,500
H.A. and I'll create one more file under templates.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,450
New file and I will say thanks to HTL and let's set those up so the test.

25
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,120
I was going to test this.

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:49,500
Basically we're going to say extends from base but each T.M. we're going to say block the content block

27
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,890
and put this inside of a can actually going into a container.

28
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:01,350
We just need to say H-1 you are now logged in exclamation point and then we'll just actually just have

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,250
that be it.

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,590
So I'll save that that's essentially going to be a test page to see if logging in worked.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,690
Once you log in it should take us this page you are now logged in.

32
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,930
And then in our thinks each team pile this is going to be the log out.

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:24,000
So we'll say extends based HCM HTL I will call the content block here and then we'll say H-1.

34
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,840
Thanks for visiting comeback soon.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,480
That's kind of the typical log out thing you usually see in a web site.

36
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,750
So if you log out of Facebook usually see oh thank you for visiting.

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,400
Come back soon.

38
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,020
Cetera.

39
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,530
So that's our log in and log out so log in view from jingo point eleven essentially going to look for

40
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,870
those variables which are then going to connect to these HCM files.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,410
So now that we created those HMO files what we need to do is actually set them up with the views that

42
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,110
pi and euros that PI over a simple social app.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:02,390
So in the simple social project come over to views that pie right now we just have our home page view.

44
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm going to add in the test page and the things page I will say class test page and I'm going to again

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:19,440
use template view here and then just set my template name equal to test page T.M. and I'll add one more

46
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,360
for the actual thinks page.

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,150
So will say thanks page.

48
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,530
And this is going to be a template view and this will say template name is equal to think study.

49
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,180
Female perfect.

50
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,170
Now I'm going to say that since we have these interviews we're going to connect these two or you're

51
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,100
all stopped by.

52
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,410
So let's do that come over to your All-Starr pie.

53
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,190
This is our project your PI file and we will say you are el and WIPs you are ill.

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,440
And then we're going to use regular expressions here.

55
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,930
We will say something like carrots.

56
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,630
Let's actually make sure we have that in our accounts as well.

57
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,040
That should always be there.

58
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,700
So our curate counts carried accounts and then curate this will be for the test page support slash.

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,630
And then I can put a dollar sign in there just to continue in case we want to build off test.

60
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:21,380
I will say views that test page dot as View so call as a view and then let's give it the name test.

61
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:31,930
And then we'll say you are all using regular expressions again carrots and then I'm going to say thanks

62
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,940
and let's connect that to use the the thinks page as a view and we'll get the name.

63
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,960
Thanks ok save that.

64
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,740
So now are your patterns are done.

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,930
Let's move on to the next step which is to migrate all the changes we did to accounts.

66
00:04:52,180 --> 00:05:01,760
So I will say Python managed PI make migrations accounts and turn let that run great.

67
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:08,830
We created the model user Nangle and say Python managed up-I migrate enter and we should see it should

68
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,290
have apply those migrations.

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,070
Let's check and see if this actually works.

70
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,870
We may have to do some debugging.

71
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,180
We will say Python is up high and then run our server.

72
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,210
Enter.

73
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,940
OK so we got no bugs there.

74
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,950
So we may have to do a little debugging but right now looking good.

75
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,420
I'm going to hop over to the browser in here and the browser let's refresh and see what we get.

76
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,150
OK.

77
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,240
So it says template syntax error.

78
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,940
Invalid block line 17 static that you forget to register or load the tag.

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,850
I probably did.

80
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,010
So let's make sure it's actually registered and we can see or hear that's happening at base that T.M.

81
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,390
error at line 17.

82
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,220
So let's fix that.

83
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,070
So I will go back to my base that each team l file.

84
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,640
So let me come back here and here in my base study C.M. file.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,640
I can see him using static but in order to actually use that static call you need to load static files

86
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,590
scroll all the way back up here and right underneath this dock type.

87
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:12,440
I'm going to call load as a template tag and then say static files save that and balustrades again.

88
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,710
Welcome back to the browser.

89
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,600
Let's refresh and it says Welcome to our social.

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,720
OK looking pretty good right now we can see we have the basic navigation bar.

91
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,010
We have our social groups log in and sign up.

92
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,570
So right now groups shouldn't really do anything but log in and sign up should Let's practice signing

93
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,240
up will click sign up and you can see here it actually looks really nicely formatted.

94
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,030
Here you can see there's extra stuff about the password and then required 150 characters or fewer.

95
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,510
That's what bootstrap 3 library is doing for us.

96
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,140
It's making this really nice display.

97
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,270
So let's sign up.

98
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,320
I'm going to say my display name is test user.

99
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:59,520
My email address is going to be test at gmail dot com password is going to be password and then we will

100
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
confirm our password with test password.

101
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,340
Let's click sign up.

102
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,640
OK so it's signed up and redirected us the log in page as we expected.

103
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,120
And it kind of auto filled for me because I'm using Chrome right now which is kind of memorizing the

104
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,100
username password.

105
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,990
So let's make sure this is working and the log in and it says please correct username so it's wrong

106
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,610
username it should be.

107
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,940
Test User and then make sure that password is also correct.

108
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,760
Test password.

109
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,740
Ok now I'm going to log in and then boom it says now you're a log then perfect.

110
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,520
And I can see here the actual navigation bars change.

111
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,550
Now I have post in create group.

112
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,740
I also have log out.

113
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,550
So let's test with log out make sure that's working.

114
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,730
And it says thinks or isn't it come back soon.

115
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,300
Fantastic.

116
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,460
Looks like everything is working for us so we're going to do it in the next lecture we'll continue on

117
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,210
by moving to posts and groups and we kind of have to work with those simultaneously.

118
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,460
So we're not going to work on a single application like we just did here.

119
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,870
But since they're so connected it should be relatively straightforward as far as working with them in

120
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,560
sync.

121
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,150
OK I'm going to end it here and I'll see you at the next lecture.

122
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,380
Thanks everyone.
