Hello everyone and welcome to part 7 for loops.

2
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.550
So we're going to be learning about the most basic for loop in javascript and this lecture.

3
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.560
And if you've only dealt with for loops in Python before you may actually want to watch this lecture

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.870
instead of just reading notes because the syntax for a for loop or basic for loop in javascript is going

5
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.150
to appear quite different to you versus Python's for loop.

6
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.800
OK so what is a for loop.

7
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.140
Well a for loop allows you to continually execute code usually a specific number of times or linked

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.200
to the elements in a sequence.

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.870
Now Javascript has three types of four loops it has its most basic for loop which just iterates through

10
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.260
some block of code a certain number of times that it has to for in construct which loops through a javascript

11
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.130
object and a javascript object is a data structure in javascript that we haven't covered yet.

12
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.400
And then there's also the form of loop which is used with Javascript the race which again is another

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.300
data structure.

14
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.760
We haven't actually covered yet.

15
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.410
So until we cover those we'll leave for loops in four of loops.

16
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.120
Aside for now and as a quick note previously we use the notation Nahm is equal to plus one when during

17
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.780
a loop we want it to increment the variable number by just one.

18
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.020
There's also two other ways of writing that.

19
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.210
And that is numb plus equal to 1 or nonplus plus.

20
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.170
And if you want to subtract 1 you would just say no minus equals 1 or minus minus.

21
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.850
So these are all the same.

22
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.540
All three of these statements are doing the exact same thing.

23
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.670
That's just a heads up because of javascript.

24
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.560
The most common one you'll see is the very last one numb plus plus.

25
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.960
All right.

26
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.540
This is what the most basic version of a for loop in javascript looks like.

27
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.270
You have your four keyword statement and then you have three other statements separated by semi-colons

28
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.840
inside of parentheses and inside the brackets you execute some code for the for loop.

29
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.540
So let's actually describe Well each of these statements represents and we'll show you an example as

30
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.010
we go along.

31
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.470
So statement 1 is executed before the loop.

32
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.690
Or that could block even begins and that could be something like the find the variable i is equal to

33
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.290
zero.

34
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.850
Well I can think of that similar to the While loop where we just said something like Nahm is equal to

35
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.400
zero or x is equal to zero.

36
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.740
So Statement 1 is executed before the loop even really starts.

37
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Then we have statement 2 which is there in the middle and statement to the finds the condition for running

38
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.530
the loop.

39
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.660
And in this case we can almost think of this for loop.

40
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.420
There's just another syntax way of writing a while loop.

41
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.840
So what's an example of that while statement 2 could be something like this.

42
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.950
Well I'm less than five.

43
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
So here we can see we're almost just rewriting a while loop inside of this force statement.

44
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.090
We're starting off with the variable I's equal to zero and we're saying keep running this loop while

45
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.130
I's less than five.

46
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.780
And then finally statement 3 is what is executed each time after the loop cycles through once.

47
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.070
So just like a while loop we saw earlier we may want to incrementally add.

48
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.410
So here with this for missing is start off with the variable.

49
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.240
Isaac bizzarro and while I have less than 5 you some code.

50
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.600
And then every cycle you're going to add one to I or I plus plus.

51
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.020
All right.

52
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.060
So let's see some examples of for loops in the editor.

53
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.160
All right so here's my editor and I have my browser of my console open and it's linked just as we've

54
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.750
done in previous lectures.

55
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.620
Let's start off with the most basic correlate that we initially discussed.

56
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.560
So again I'm going to say something like for an EQ and actually hit enter here.

57
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.180
Note that Adam gives you the three options the four four in and then four of will start with just the

58
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.260
most basic four.

59
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.710
We hit enter what's really nice is Adam takes care of a lot of the stuff right now.

60
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.160
It takes care of statement 1 that initialization of a variable takes care statement 2 which is what

61
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.130
we actually want to run through and the while condition and then plus plus or statement 3 we want to

62
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.510
happen after every time this is run.

63
00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:03.370
Now let's actually change the array that length to just be less than five and we're going to say

64
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:14.020
the log number is and then we'll concatenate it with I.

65
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.770
So let's save this and actually run this here.

66
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.480
And here you can see numbers 0 1 2 3 and 4.

67
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.360
You can see this is basically just another way of rewriting a 4 or excuse me a while loop.

68
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.180
We have some initial condition the while condition and then what we want to do after every time this

69
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.150
loop run in like I mentioned earlier.

70
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:43.460
This plus plus is just another way of writing eyes equal to I plus one I can save that and if I refresh

71
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.070
or get the exact same result.

72
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.390
And another note is that this doesn't actually have to be.

73
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.630
I could call this whatever you want.

74
00:04:50.630 --> 00:05:01.800
So you could say variable num While numbers is less than five we could say nonplus plus right as them

75
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.370
save this we refresh or we get the exact same result.

76
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.540
It's most commonly used for I.

77
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.760
So keep that in mind you'll see a lot but sometimes it might be helpful to you to rename it if it helps

78
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.290
the readability of your code.

79
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.980
But more often than not you're going to see it as I and it so often I that that's why Adam text editor

80
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.190
auto fills it to be I OK.

81
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.900
So let's continue on with another example.

82
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.900
We're going to create a variable called Word and let's just have it be the first few letters of the

83
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:41.420
alphabet A B C D E F G H I J K OK.

84
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.100
And then I'll start typing for enter and I usually say four I's equal to zero.

85
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.210
I array that length and added text editor actually auto highlights array for me to change it to something.

86
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.720
So I will change it to Word and you can see that it's actually auto filling that in for me.

87
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.750
Inside the for loop which is quite nice and I'm going to log this so I will say LMG lips.

88
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.420
Let me click somewhere in the activate that and then we'll say log in I'm going to input word indexed

89
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.900
at that location case let's say this.

90
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.270
Now what do you think is going to happen here.

91
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.640
Take some time.

92
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.430
So it will refresh and we see here.

93
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.860
Now we get ABC the AFGE all the way to Cape.

94
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.980
So again this is just a way of kind of rewriting the while loop.

95
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.310
So we are equal to zero and will I's less than the length of the actual word he incrementing I and then

96
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.390
print out the index location.

97
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.690
ABC etc..

98
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.320
Right now let's show you another example where let's say you wanted to skip every other letter or something

99
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.170
to make that obvious.

100
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:55.090
I'll do something like this A B B B B A B A B.

101
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.180
And then I'll write a for loop here.

102
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.790
And I'm going to keep most things the same except over here where it says I.

103
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:10.930
Plus plus I can do something like icicle 2 I plus two armlets this again.

104
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.050
Put that site.

105
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.220
And now what do you think is going to happen when I refresh this page.

106
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.460
Well I can see a printed out five times and if something is repeatedly put into the console a Google

107
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.870
Chrome will actually just put a little number here next to it.

108
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.000
Instead of flooding your screen with repeated code or repeat the output.

109
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.040
So this little number here represents that a whisper put out five times which makes sense because if

110
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.560
you look at this we have 1 2 3 4 5 A's in that word.

111
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.640
So you can see here it doesn't have to just increment by one increment by any number you want or you

112
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.500
can even go down it can decrease.

113
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.800
OK so that's all we need to know about for loops and Javascript for now.

114
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.730
Coming up next we're going to do a quick exercise just to practice your understanding.

115
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.110
Well see at the next lecture.
