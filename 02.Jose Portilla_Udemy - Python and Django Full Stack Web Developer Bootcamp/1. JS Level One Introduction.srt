Hello everyone and welcome to javascript level on welcome to the first javascript section of the Course.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,810
This section will begin to build our understanding of adding interactive functionality to our Web sites

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,190
in javascript support is actually built directly into most modern web browsers.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,900
That means we can run javascript directly into the browser console or as a fool dot javascript that

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,230
connects to an HTML file which means there's nothing to download right now javascript is mostly full

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,670
programming language meaning I like to mail or C Ss.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,560
It supports things such as raise loops and general logic.

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,760
We will briefly cover major programming concepts as we encounter them with javascript eventually we're

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,160
going to be showing you how to use javascript to directly change to stem cell or CSSA shown on a page.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,690
Now we're really going to touch on that topic in the document object model or deal M or dom section

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,060
of the course to begin with however we're going to be focusing on just the javascript basics all by

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,810
itself.

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,300
OK so we're going to start off with javascript just straight in the browser console and later on we'll

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,390
show you to connect fooled javascript's to an aged him.

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:20,850
File all the code used in this section can be found that JS scripts under the javascript level one folder.

16
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,900
Let's get started.

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,010
I'll see you at the next lecture.
