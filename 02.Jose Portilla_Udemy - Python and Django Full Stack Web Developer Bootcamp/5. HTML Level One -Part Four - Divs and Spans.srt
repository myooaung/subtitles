Hello everyone and welcome to part 4 divs and spans.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,110
So in this lecture we're going to be showing you some examples of how to use a div and Hispan tag.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,630
However keep in mind that we actually won't really be able to utilize them until we learn about CSSA.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,180
Basically we're going to be using DIVX and spand tax to actually group together blocks of H Tim L.

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,410
And the reason we want to group them together usually is to apply CSSA to them.

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,470
So keep that in mind as we learn about them in this lecture.

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,380
They probably won't seem to take any effect into account but later on we will see how they are useful

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,930
when adding in style of success.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,450
Let's jump to the Adam text editor just to show you how they work.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,030
OK so here I am at the Adam text editor and I also have my browser open and a little zoomed in here

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,220
so you can see the text clearly.

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,870
Right now I just have a heading one here.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,860
Let me go in and show you what it would look like if you were to use a DIV tag and this basically stands

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:09,300
for division and then allows you to tag together groups of elements into basically generic containers.

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,620
So for instance let's say I have another heading 1 and this is something that says we'll call it group

16
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:28,490
1 and then I have a paragraph here that says I want to be together in group 1.

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,130
So let me say that refreshed this.

18
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,140
And we see we have different span's group 1 and then the paragraph says I want to be together in group

19
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,900
1.

20
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:44,220
Later on when we learn about CSSA what we want to do is add styles to particular elements in our T.M.

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,370
and what we can do that is actually saying okay apply style number one.

22
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,180
So for instance the color red to all heading 1 tags.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,030
So that would just go along and say Hayes is heading 110.

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,100
OK this font colors now red.

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,130
It's is heading 110.

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,570
OK this font color is now red.

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,440
But sometimes you actually don't want to do it by the actual element type.

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,520
You want to do it by specific division or a group of elements that you define.

29
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,120
And the way you can do that as we'll see later on the CSSA section is actually calling a DIV tag.

30
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,660
And so the way with the work is you can see here I have div..

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,140
Now if I hit enter.

32
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,920
Notice that we automatically get this class to pop out here and that's going to allow us to essentially

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,150
name this division after a class and then we can apply styles to that class and we can put whatever

34
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,720
you want in that class.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,030
So for instance I cannot put this all here give this class a name such as something like group 1.

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,890
Save this.

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,390
And if I refresh us we won't notice anything different.

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,440
Here in D.H. Tim L..

39
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:56,600
Later on when we learn about C Ss we'll learn how to actually add style to a division with a class name

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,450
instead of just actual element tags.

41
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,720
And that's basically what we're going to be using a division for.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,450
So right now there's still time by itself and each T.M. doesn't mean a whole lot it's going to mean

43
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,920
a lot more we learn about C Ss So if this was a little unclear to you especially if that class keyword

44
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,630
don't worry about it too much it's going to make a lot more sense in the future.

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,130
I just want to introduce it now because it really is just a Tamil.

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,200
It's not C Ss it's used in combination of C Ss OK and then the last thing I want to mention here is

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,880
the span tag and basically the spand tag is almost the exact same thing as a division except it's inline

48
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,790
instead of grabbing an entire container.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,650
So let's say we have this class or this div division of group 1.

50
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:47,870
If I wanted to make essentially a little inline container to only apply effects to an inline section

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,230
so only apply effects for instance to these three letters or three words here be together in what I

52
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:01,430
could do is wrap them in a span tag and then put whatever I want there to be in that span.

53
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,780
And again I want to say this and refresh this here we don't notice any difference because we haven't

54
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,720
actually applied any style to it.

55
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:13,660
But just keep these two words in mind for tagging when we later learned about C Ss.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,610
OK so again not a whole lot to actually show here.

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,790
Basics of this lecture's just to be aware that there is a DIV tag and a span tag.

58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,010
If their usefulness doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you right now don't worry about it.

59
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,870
It will make a lot more sense when we actually read or reach the CSA section of the course.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,340
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
