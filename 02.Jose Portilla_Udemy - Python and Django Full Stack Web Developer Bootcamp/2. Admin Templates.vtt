00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.360
Welcome back everyone to this lecture on adamant templates.

2
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.820
Now for projects where other users will have access to the admin page.

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.450
Not just yourself the person who created the Web site you may want to add some customization to the

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.410
admin templates.

5
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.500
That way when they log in it looks a little nicer it's more related to the actual web site etc..

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.860
So to do this you can overwrite template punched him elf files that are associated with the Admin Pages

7
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.180
in order for that to work.

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.350
You must have the correct template name and directory structure.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.140
Finding the file names that are correct involves looking around jingoes open source code on get hub.

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
So what we're going to do is we're going to create that directory structure and then find a template

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.780
name from get hub will kind of walk you through the whole process.

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.910
Then afterwards once we have that template we're going to copy and paste the ASTM file into our code

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.050
and change the template however we want.

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.440
Let's get started by jumping over to our editor and setting up the directory structure.

15
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.450
OK so in your project directory where you have your project directory your project folder and then your

16
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.170
application folder what you're going to have right underneath the project directory.

17
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.960
At the very top level you're going to add a new folder and you're going to call it templates.

18
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.710
And then under that new templates folder you're going to create a subfolder called admin and this is

19
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.680
where you can copy and paste template HTL files that are associate of the admin and essentially overwrite

20
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.660
the original admin template files.

21
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.110
Now to show you what these template file should be named.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.520
We're going to hop over to our browser and walk you through the Django documentation or open source

23
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.840
code.

24
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.800
Just a little bit.

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.760
Let's open my browser and head over to jingoes page.

26
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.170
OK so here I am at get help dot com slash jingoes slash Django.

27
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.720
And this is all the open source code for Django.

28
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.620
And we actually need to play around this a little bit and find where the admin template files are.

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.100
So let me go ahead and show you how you can find them.

30
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.380
Your first going to come to this Django folder.

31
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.870
Let me zoom in just a little bit here so it's kind of clear what we're looking at.

32
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.780
You'll come over to Jane go with that load up and then underneath jingo you'll scroll down to see contrib.

33
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.840
Click on that and then you'll find Adam in here and then under admin you'll find the templates folder.

34
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.950
So this templates folder is where you have registration admin to the Pentagon which you kind of want

35
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.910
to play around with.

36
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.140
You can edit those too as well but we are just adding the admin page right now so we'll click on that.

37
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.590
And this is why we had to have that specific directory structure templates underscore admen because

38
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.350
essentially we're going to be overwriting one of the team files and for now we can overwrite the base

39
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.540
site h l.

40
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.250
That's the very first page you see so if you hit that and click on open a new tab you'll see here that

41
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.820
it says extends from Adam in base that age female and essentially just has the index page and the dingo

42
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.710
site admin Hetter page.

43
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.900
Now if you come back here you can see that there's base h t m l and this is the base h tim Alko that

44
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.740
kind of has the styling the links etc. and builds out with a lot of these pages are going to look like.

45
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.740
So if you want to end up doing things like setting the page have certain styles or colors anything with

46
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.070
CSSA or just kind of something that extends to the majority of the pages.

47
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.290
This is the file you kind of want to play around with based that each team.

48
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.520
But we just really want to play around with that very first thing.

49
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.540
So we'll say based site HTL base underscore site that each team will I'm going to copy all of this.

50
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.280
So right click copy and then I'm going to hop over back to my editor see to minimize that and have an

51
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.180
editor right here.

52
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.770
So underneath Addleman I'll create a new file and remember he said the exact same name as what we just

53
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.890
discussed so it's going to be base underscore site that each team will enter.

54
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.420
And now we have this template file.

55
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.400
So then I'm going to just paste it here if I just run this right now nothing is going to change.

56
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.570
So I'm actually going to do is change over the first heading 1.

57
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.240
So you can see heading 1 right now.

58
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.340
It links to the index page of the Ottoman site.

59
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.920
But then it also has this kind of template insert.

60
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.850
So it says here like oh I'm inserting some say a header at default Gengel administrator etc. instead

61
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.960
of doing all that I'm just going to kind of put in my own line here.

62
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.240
So let's delete that.

63
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.820
And let's just have it say something like new Ligers for doing a video store let's do video store admen

64
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.420
then I'm going to save this.

65
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.600
Now that we've gone ahead and edited this based site that reached him we want to make sure that our

66
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.360
settings file is ready to accept any template changes.

67
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.550
So we'll open up our project folder open up settings that pie and as we them before you can actually

68
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.250
just is directly usually had another variable name but instead we're going to do is if you come over

69
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.870
to where it's as templates it is going to search for templates.

70
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.570
There we go and Lotus has directories right now.

71
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.630
MT Salt's go ahead and do the following.

72
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:03.940
We'll say oh estopped path the join and we're going to join that base directory with templates

73
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.760
so save that and once you have that we should be able to see the new changes in our base site at him.

74
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.960
So we notice that basically Genger already restarted it for me.

75
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.820
So I'll bring in in my browser now with the admin page and if I bring it over you can see now it says

76
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.560
video store admin.

77
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.830
So those are the kind of changes you can make basically anything stylistically that you want to change

78
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.460
or CSSA you're probably better off doing the baseline each small file.

79
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.070
But if you want to change kind of minor things around this kind of index page of base site HTL you can

80
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.170
do that as well.

81
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.580
Now carefully be careful you don't want to change things too much to actually break the functionality.

82
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.600
I would recommend this war for style choices as far as functionality editing word and learn the more

83
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.700
correct ways to do that later on throughout this series of lectures.

84
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.930
All right that's it for this lecture.

85
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.660
I'll see at the next one.
