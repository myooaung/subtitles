Hello everyone and welcome to part two function exercises.

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,540
Let's get some practice of functions.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,000
But I want you to do is open up the file part to underscore functions underscore exercises that jazz

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,790
which is located under the javascript level 2 folder the problems will gradually get harder as you go

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,570
along.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,690
Let's take a quick look at this file and look at the problems.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,430
OK so this is what the exercise thought Jap's file looks like.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,860
And a lot of these problem statements are sourced from coding that dot com which is a great Web site

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,960
for practice problems.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,480
You want to get more than what's here in this file but basically you're going to have a problem.

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:48,010
The name of the problem and it's going to ask you to write a function to take in particular parameters

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,590
and then give an output.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,500
And after the problem statement you'll see an example of what it should look like.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,230
So here we can see the sleep and function when it takes an false and false.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,970
It should output true.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,120
And if we keep going down we see something like monkey trouble if monkey trouble function takes and

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,960
true and true it should output true center.

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,710
We go down to string times and it says given a string and some integer do something with it.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:19,360
So string times we see it takes in a string a number and then outputs that string multiplied as many

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,100
times as the number shows here.

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,420
Then we see lucky some Which is another problem takes in three numbers a certain number of the penny

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,840
and what's going on.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,680
And then finally we have problem five which is a speed ticket problem.

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,790
You get a number and a boolean value and you either get 0 or 1 or 2.

25
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,300
So if we go all the way down we get this bonus problem which is make bricks.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,250
This is a pretty tricky problem.

27
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,330
So if you can't figure this one out don't worry that's why it's a bonus.

28
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,570
Go ahead and read the problem see if you can figure it out.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,310
But this has to do not so much with javascript but more of just computer science and trying to think

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,630
like a programmer.

31
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:57,960
OK.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,920
So leave that one is a bonus for you.

33
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,000
Go ahead and tackle the other five and I will see you in the next lecture.

34
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,180
We're going to be programming through the solutions.

35
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,350
Thanks everyone.
