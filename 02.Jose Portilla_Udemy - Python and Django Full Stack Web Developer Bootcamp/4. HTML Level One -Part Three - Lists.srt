Hello everyone and welcome to part three of a small level one where we discuss how to create a list

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,800
an HMO.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,810
A lot of times you want to get your information on your e-mail page organized.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,450
And one way to do this is with a list an e-mail has two main types of lists.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,140
That's an ordered list and an unordered list and we can actually then add list elements to each of these

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,880
types.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,940
Let's get started by jumping to the Adam text editor and our browser.

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,490
All right here I am with my Adam text editor open and I have right now just the simple basics that DML

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,620
documents we've been working with and I've deleted everything beleft one heading one that says lists

10
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,640
on it.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,360
Let me first show you how to create an ordered list.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:52,050
Now an ordered list is numbered so you can see number one the first item number to the second item etc..

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,870
So to start off with an ordered list you just type o l and then you can click enter here.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,670
And Adam text editor will automatically create the opening tag and closing tag for you and then inside

15
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,630
of this ordered list you're going to have list elements.

16
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,150
If I save this and then refresh my page you notice nothing's actually changed.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,540
So I do have an ordered list there but with no elements in it to create a list item or list element

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,010
it's just as I said be your tag and then whatever you want in there.

19
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,940
So in this case we'll just say first item going to save that and refreshed this.

20
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,340
And I see now I have my one first item and let me zoom in here a little bit.

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,010
We're going to do control plus to zoom in on the safest Tim else we can see it a little better here.

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,330
So here's my first item.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,600
And as I continue to add list elements into this order list such as my second item save this and refresh

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,500
the page you can see here that they are numbered and this will continue on as long as I just keep Eida

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,350
adding items into this actual list so third item there refresh and here we can see the numbering.

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,040
Now later on of CSSA you can actually change the numbers if you want to use something like roman numerals.

27
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,700
But this is a very basic default of an HMO ordered list.

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,860
Now a lot of times you actually don't want to number things you just want some sort of bullet point.

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,080
And if you want that then what you're looking for isn't an ordered list and to create an unordered list.

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,010
You use the tag UL for an ordered list.

31
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,230
So you all enter there.

32
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,540
It creates the opening and closing tags for me.

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,590
And now as the add list items all say bulat one here.

34
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,690
Add another item here will say second item.

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,790
You can really add whatever text you want here.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,440
Well do ally enter here and then we'll say third item going to save this and refresh and I you see I

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,910
have an unordered list where there is no number but everything is just a bullet point.

38
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,190
And that's the main difference between an ordered list o l and an unordered list.

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,470
UL and the last thing I want to cover quickly here is a nested list.

40
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,800
So you can actually nest lists inside of each other and you can test an ordered list inside of an unordered

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,810
list or vice versa.

42
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,590
Let me show you an example of this and I'll show you kind of an extreme example of nesting lists.

43
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,980
So you usually won't see that many list and into each other but I just want to show you this.

44
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,250
You can get an idea of what's possible.

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,590
So here's an ordered list and I'm going to have two items in it.

46
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:32,450
First item one and then item 2 and I'm just using the autocomplete there enter to make that a little

47
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:32,840
quicker.

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,790
So here's item one here's item too.

49
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,070
And they're numbered because they're inside an ordered list.

50
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:46,010
And now I'm going to put in an ordered list inside of these ordered list tags I put in that an ordered

51
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:52,700
list which means if I add some new list elements will be inside so I'm going to say something like I'm

52
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,160
nested inside for that list item.

53
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:03,350
And you know make another list item that says also nested exclamation mark will save that refresh this

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,810
and we can see here that was that nesting.

55
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,970
We also get an extra in the notation.

56
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:14,750
So a symbol can show that this is nested inside of this list so if we wanted to get say Item one item

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,560
two and then we could say these are like sub items of item 2.

58
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,170
That is an unordered list.

59
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,210
Now we can actually keep going if this if you wanted something further nested then we could put an ordered

60
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:36,590
list in there and then say something like whoa I'm really nice that exclamation mark and let's emphasize

61
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,180
this by putting some of this in bold.

62
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,790
So remember we have these strong tags to put something in bold.

63
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,470
And I'm going to go in there.

64
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,400
We go.

65
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,080
Now let's save that.

66
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,580
Refresh this and we can see here.

67
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,240
Item one.

68
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,800
Item 2 we have this nested unordered list and then whoa I'm really nested there.

69
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,970
So it's just a very quick example of nesting lists.

70
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,660
We're not going to do it too often in the course but I just want you to be aware of the ability to do

71
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,310
that.

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,970
All right.

73
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,920
So that's really all there is for lists themselves.

74
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,890
It's a pretty basic topic remember you essentially have this oh well for ordered list and you fell for

75
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,560
an ordered list and then inside of either these every item in that list is going to have an L.A. tag

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,360
Corri list elements.

77
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,150
OK thanks everyone and I will see you at the next lecture.
