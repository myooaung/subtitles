Hello everyone and welcome to CSSA level to in this section of the course we're going to continue to

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,510
expand our knowledge of CSSA by learning about fonts and the box model.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,770
This will be a shorter section but at the end we're going to have a project for you that actually covers

4
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,020
and reviews the ideas from CSSA level 1 and CSSA level 2.

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's get started.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,950
I'll see at the next lecture.
