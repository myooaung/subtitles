00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,210
Hello everyone and welcome to the course overview lecture.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,860
As a quick note I have a favor to ask of you please watch this entire video lecture.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,140
Regardless if you've already taken multiple courses on you to me or even multiple courses by me or if

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,910
you're brand new to you to mean or brand new to online learning in general please watch this entire

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,880
lecture video will really help your course experience be a lot smoother.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,130
Thank you OK.

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,270
Continue on.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,020
We're going to talk about three main things in this lecture.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,610
We'll talk about general of course information how to get the course notes and files and how to get

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:33,970
help.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,980
During the course first off a huge thank you for enrolling.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,470
It really means the world to me.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,090
To get messages from students every day telling them I help them in the careers.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,370
Help them solve a problem at work or that they just really enjoyed the course.

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,080
So thank you again for enrolling.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,490
I'm really going to try my best to make sure you have a good experience.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,960
First off let's discuss some general tips for getting the best experience with this course.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,710
You probably noticed that I speak at a pretty steady and deliberate pace so feel free to speed up the

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,330
videos.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,090
You can check for a speed icon on the bottom tab.

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,870
In fact you can see that this video right now I would personally probably be watching these videos at

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,240
about 1.5 or 2 x speed.

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,650
But that's my style.

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,290
If English is not your first language you can probably also slow down the videos.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,730
So do whatever speed feels right to you.

26
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,170
If a video ever appears blurry.

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,700
Make sure to check that you're viewing the video in high definition if you want to download the videos

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,910
for offline viewing.

29
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,700
You can do that with the utility app any technical platform issues you may encounter.

30
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,370
Please contact support you to me dot com.

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,590
Technical platform issues can be things like having trouble posting to the Q&amp;A forums having trouble

32
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,750
logging into your account or having trouble viewing the actual videos.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,230
Those are technical platform issues.

34
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,760
I can't help you too much there.

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,910
So please contact support me dot com.

36
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:57,770
If you experience those type problems again the course is self-paced and you get lifetime access to

37
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,590
the materials and that includes any updates.

38
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,450
Also upon completion of the course you can unlock a certificate for your linked in profile and you can

39
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,230
check out the fake Q lecture which is the very next lecture.

40
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,150
For more information on how to unlock that certificate.

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,390
Now let's talk about how to get the course materials.

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,090
You can download all the files as a zip from this lecture.

43
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,900
The fake Q lecture or the installation lecture.

44
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,040
That's this lecture the next lecture in a lecture.

45
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,900
After that it's the same zip file so any one of those lectures is fine.

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,320
It's saved as a resource so you should see a little blue resource tab open up while you're watching

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,180
the actual video.

48
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,770
Just click on that and then download that zip file future missions to this course will get their own

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,370
ZIP file in the relevant section and I will also upload an updated that zip to these 3 lectures.

50
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,080
So what I mean by that is if later on in the future I add a new clone to this course.

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,940
Maybe we make a clone of Facebook dot com then I will create 2 zip files.

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,420
I will re upload an updated version of the whole zip file but I will also make a separate zip file just

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,280
for that section.

54
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,200
That way to have the read download all the notes.

55
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,150
Every time new material is added to this course.

56
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,630
Also as a quick note sometimes the built in unzipping program on your computer may not work for unzipping

57
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,500
a file.

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,770
Please try another program before posting to the Kewney forums.

59
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,190
If you're having trouble unzipping files.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,590
Thanks All right.

61
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,500
Now let's talk about how to approach the course this course is divided into sections that lead into

62
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,460
each other.

63
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,980
Each section can be visited independent of the others but they also assume knowledge of all the concepts

64
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,860
covered in previous lectures has a very high level overview general curriculum or what this course has.

65
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:51,110
We first talk about HCM l CSSA and Javascript and then we continue talking about the document object

66
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,710
model and J.A.G. that's really the front end half of the course.

67
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,210
Then the second half the course discusses the Python programming language how to work with Django and

68
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,880
sequel.

69
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,680
And then after that we have Web site clone projects.

70
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,380
Also keep in mind that we do not assume any previous knowledge.

71
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,780
So you can take this course even if you have zero program experience.

72
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,650
We won't ever assume that you've encountered any other technology before.

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,290
However that means if you already have experience you may want to read through the code notes first.

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,250
Otherwise you may be viewing video lectures that just go over things you already know.

75
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,590
Again this is trying to be a careful balance for people who have never programmed before and experienced

76
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:36,180
programmers so beginners should follow through the course in order more experienced developers should

77
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,000
probably visit the curriculum page and decide what the best starting point is for them and be honest

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,750
of yourself.

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,590
If you start to have trouble if a certain section you may want to go back a section and review that

80
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,290
material OK.

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,920
Now let's talk about how to get help during the course.

82
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,440
OK so let's discuss the steps you should take whenever you need help.

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,720
During the course the first thing you should do especially if you run into a programming error is use

84
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,820
Google and stack overflow as tools to help you solve that issue.

85
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,900
A big part of being a developer is learning how to answer your own questions by using Google and using

86
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,730
stack overflow stack overflow or just a Web site where you can post questions and other programmers

87
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,510
will help you out.

88
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,280
But a lot of times almost 90 percent of the time your question has been asked by someone else and you'll

89
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,760
already find an answer through Google and stack overflow.

90
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,860
If you still can't find that there you may want to check out the fake Q lecture where I will be posting

91
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,460
commonly ask questions that pertain to the course.

92
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,300
If you still can't find that there and your question is more specific to something in the course search

93
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,580
the Kewaunee forums for previous posts.

94
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,440
It's likely that someone's already asked a similar question to yours while you're viewing a lecture.

95
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,570
You can also look at the bottom tab and you should see a Q and A button you can click that and that

96
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,420
will take it to queue in a post that actually pertains to the specific lecture that you are watching.

97
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,820
If you still can't find the help.

98
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,880
Not to worry.

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,770
Post a new question on the Kewaunee forms please include what you've tried your code and as much information

100
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,710
as possible.

101
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,100
That way the students and I can quickly help you out.

102
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,940
Here are some useful ways you can share your code online with us.

103
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:17,460
You can use code append the IO codependents SEO a just and get hub or even just a plain screenshot or

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,990
you can actually copy and paste with formatting your code onto that the to meet Q and 8 forums.

105
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,410
Choose whatever you prefer.

106
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,310
As far as some general information for the question and answer forums for this course you can usually

107
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,490
respect the reply within 24 hours.

108
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,580
In other students reply often so often a reply comes a lot faster in 24 hours that I checked the Kunin

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,690
forums at least once a day usually more than that.

110
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,850
You may also just get a quick link reply.

111
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:50,130
So if I see a questions very similar to yours answered on stack overflow I may just reply with the link.

112
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,780
If you're still confused by that or haven't given you enough information feel free to just continue

113
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,750
the thread asking follow up questions.

114
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,670
I'm always happy to help you out.

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,910
Also remember to say thank you especially if another student has helped you out in reply to your question.

116
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,380
It really helps build a great community of students answering these questions.

117
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,320
Also it's a great idea for you to go to the Q&amp;A forums and see if you can help out other students in

118
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,040
the course.

119
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,180
It's a really great skill to have and it really helps your own understanding to answer other people's

120
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,280
questions.

121
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,010
As a final know there are many ways to program and that includes the choice of your development environment.

122
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,510
The styling of the code your programming choices etc..

123
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't want you to ever feel locked into the choices we make in this course.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,960
Feel free to explore other options and also feel free to share them as well if you prefer another.

125
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,230
Ideally you prefer another library.

126
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,060
You have different programming styling from your experience.

127
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,540
That's totally ok.

128
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,110
Don't ever feel that you have to do exactly what we do in this course and again just a huge thank you

129
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,640
for enrolling in this course.

130
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,990
I'm so happy you have enrolled and I get to help you on your journey of becoming a web developer.

131
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,420
I'll see you inside the course.

132
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,050
Thanks everyone.
