00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.480
Hello everyone and welcome back to this continued solution's lecture of the cap project one we're going

2
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.080
to get to York.

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.870
We left off last time and finished the project by just editing the CSSA file to make the styling look

4
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.960
the same as what we wanted to cap some project going to look like.

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.540
Let's go to the editor and browser and get started.

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.160
OK.

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.150
So here I am at my editor what I'm first going to do is edit the main things in the body that I want

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.800
to change.

9
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.530
We've already taken care of the font family.

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.760
The next thing I want to do is take care of the background color remember the background color was actually

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.380
a dark background.

12
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.880
So all I did choose just any color you want that's dark or any light color it doesn't really matter

13
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.150
that's not really the point of this exercise.

14
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.300
The background color that I ended up choosing was hex code.

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.090
0 1 1 6 2 7.

16
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.770
And because we have a dark background color it means the actual color of our text which we can call

17
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.840
by just color needs to be a lighter color or can just be whites or cream.

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.020
So I choose hex code.

19
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.430
F D F F F C colon.

20
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.140
So let's make sure that worked out well refresh this page.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.510
Great.

22
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.700
So Eric back to the dark blue.

23
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.950
And now the white text.

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.840
Next thing I want to do is actually align everything to be centered.

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.430
So I will say text align center refresh make sure that works.

26
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.160
Everything is looking great there.

27
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.970
Now let's work with that border.

28
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.580
So the border is actually going to be quite thick.

29
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.690
So the official solution is have it at 60 pixels but I'm a little zoomed in here.

30
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.760
So let's just do something like 40 pixels and let's make it a solid border.

31
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.330
And here we can actually use a hex code again.

32
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.830
And the hex could either it was a teal color.

33
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.350
So he said to e c 4 8 6.

34
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.810
Again don't worry if your colors don't match exactly.

35
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.910
You really have all the flexibility you want.

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.040
As far as the colors go but here we have the border looking good.

37
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.670
But remember that we also wanted to get rid of this top border which means I can just say quarter top

38
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.130
and assign it to be of pixels.

39
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.920
That's a very quick way for us to essentially get rid of that top border and leave it to be that background

40
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.530
color.

41
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.400
And then finally if I want to make the call even closer I can call something like margin to be zero

42
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.520
pixels to try to slim down the distance between the border and the actual edge.

43
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.740
So again if I comment that out and refresh this I can see there's a little bit of gap between the border

44
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.370
and the edge of the browser there.

45
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.570
I undo that to give it at zero pixel margin.

46
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.520
Then I squeeze all the way to the end.

47
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.270
OK.

48
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.920
So now let's take care of some of the individual elements so the paragraph we already have that color

49
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.710
working correctly because it's in the body.

50
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.940
Well we might want to do is add a little more padding so it's just practice doing that.

51
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.750
Lawyers say patting on the top is something like 5 percent

52
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.670
padding on the left.

53
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:34.380
We can say 20 percent of it can say padding on the right is 20 percent so we can save that and refresh

54
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.440
over here and now that's been able to kind of elongate the landing page for us.

55
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.110
So looks a little more like the solutions.

56
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.340
And then finally we also want to start editing some of the sizes here.

57
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.430
So if you look here the first thing last name email and the form in general things are looking a little

58
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.910
smaller than or actually the same size as the paragraph but we want to be a little larger.

59
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.550
So they're looking a little smaller and referencing the solution.

60
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:12.010
So let's expand that something it can do is try calling form and say everything in the forum tag has

61
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.790
a font size and call it with it.

62
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.740
So it's in relationship to everything else to the body text.

63
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.030
So refresh this.

64
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.260
Now we're looking at a much larger font size here.

65
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.850
And if I don't like the spacing here I can also add a margin so I can say something like margin or I

66
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.350
could even just give it to the bottom and give it a small margin like something like 10 pixels.

67
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.370
And again this is really up to you this is just so that border doesn't touch that bottom button.

68
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.560
Now let's talk about that bottom button.

69
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:55.810
Remember we gave that bottom button in idea called some so I can say hash tag sub and let's give it

70
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.000
a color background so I'll say background color in this Lucias lecture was gold.

71
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.770
So that's all.

72
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.170
Just give it.

73
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.350
In my case the next card I found was f f 9 F 1 c.

74
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.340
Let's refresh this.

75
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.540
Make sure it works.

76
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.120
Looks like it's gold now.

77
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.230
Now let's make it much larger.

78
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.370
So it's Add in a heights.

79
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:27.540
Say About 80 pixels and also give it a with of let's make it a little larger something like 150 pixels

80
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.070
save this refresh.

81
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.780
OK it's looking pretty large.

82
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.860
Now let's continue.

83
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.700
Let's give it a bit of a margin.

84
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.430
So it's not directly touching that e-mail and it will give it something like a four pixel margin there.

85
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.510
Looks a little nicer since it's not directly touching.

86
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.410
And if we want to we can make the top marginal a little better.

87
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.480
So we'll say something like wups for pixels.

88
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:06.990
Something like margin top let's specifically give that to be let's say triple that 10 pixels so we refresh

89
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.290
and it looks a little nicer and the spacing here great.

90
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.900
Now finally a couple of things we wanted to do is the font size is a little small so I'll call font

91
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.550
size again say 1.5 CM and they also want to show you the trick for curving the button.

92
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.630
So right now by default the button is square if I want to give it some curve.

93
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:35.050
The term for that is border radius and then we can define a certain amount of pixels that we want the

94
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.110
radius borders have which are basically just round the corner.

95
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.010
So if I refresh this I can see it says sign me and right now the font is a little too big.

96
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.420
So what we can do is actually just call it back to let's say one E-M.

97
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.850
See if that fixes it.

98
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.650
Sign me up OK that's looking good.

99
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.420
So our actual font sizes is OK and it looks like everything is working.

100
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.800
So let's try this now.

101
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.550
We'll say hello first thaim fill in the last name.

102
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.910
Email.

103
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.570
Click on sign me up.

104
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.090
And it takes me to thank you for signing up.

105
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.250
So we're able to just quickly walk through an example landing page.

106
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.440
Obviously it doesn't do much more just free to practice looking at something and recreating it.

107
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.930
And so far looks pretty good.

108
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.510
Feel free to play around a lot more.

109
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.600
Feel free to explore the official solutions that I've left free in the downloaded folder.

110
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.830
They're a little different than what we went through here but basically the same idea okay if you have

111
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.520
any questions feel free to post the Kewaunee forums and I'll be happy to help you up.

112
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.960
I'll see you at the next lecture.
