00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,050
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be coding out the solutions for the game

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,610
project that tic tac toe project when the previous lecture Hopefully you had a chance to attempt it

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,190
on your own.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,450
But if not feel free to code along with me.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,720
Right now I'm going to hop over to my editor and browser to get started.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,270
OK here I am at my editor and here's the browser and I have three files open and empty HVM file in MTC

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,550
SS file and an empty javascript files are ready to really tackle the front end and see its capabilities.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,620
With this little project of ours.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,910
Let's start off by creating the HTML file and filling out the actual content that will style it and

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,730
then will actually add the interactivity with javascript going to type HTL there just to set it up.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,840
We have tic tac toe and let's actually link our CSSA file.

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,840
So I'm going to link right now to my CSSA file which I've just called.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,730
Game C Ss.

14
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,050
And then I'm also going to link to bootstrap.

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,100
That way I can use the jumbo translator.

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,100
All you have to do to do that comes to get bootstrap But come in then I can just scroll down here and

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,800
grab the latest comp. The minute vide see SS.

18
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,200
Copy and paste that line into my file.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,680
Now let's check the we're ready to go by just putting a heading in here saying connected.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,890
Make sure that font looks good refresh or page.

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,550
And here we have connected in Bootstrap So we know we're good to go.

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,370
OK so far my links are OK and I also want to link to my script.

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,900
Let's just do that over here at the bottom so all the way at the bottom going to call script.

24
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:53,290
And we're going to make the source equal to my script which is called My script G-S will save that and

25
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:59,160
to verify that's connected I'm going to do a console log that says connected save.

26
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,610
That will refresh this page and then let's inspect B at the console.

27
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,880
Expand this just so we can see it and it's connected.

28
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,160
So we're good to go there.

29
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,640
Fantastic.

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,360
Now we need to create some HTL content to actually create the board.

31
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,660
Let's comment this out and then coming back to main.

32
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,570
Let's expand this.

33
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,100
First thing you wanted to do is since we're dealing with bootstrap create a DIV tag that contains the

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:35,660
class container so this will have the container class and then inside of this I'm going to create the

35
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,300
jumbo from

36
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:48,310
now we'll have a heading and say this jumbo tron says welcome to tic tac toe tic tac toe and we can

37
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,350
put a paragraph in here if we want says get ready to play.

38
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,610
Let's save this and refresh make sure it actually looks good.

39
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,150
OK.

40
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,970
Welcome to Gary to play.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,030
And then finally let's add a button.

42
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,420
Remember we had that restart button so I will call a button tagged and then it will have the type button

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,120
the name button is fine but let's give it a class and the class for you are going to just reference

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,730
bootstrap for this.

45
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,320
So I would expect you to have this memorized I would expect you to reference the documentation but the

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,570
class I chose was between.

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,170
And then I also added the beats in primary to it and then I wanted to make the button large so I added

48
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,150
between LG.

49
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,290
So basically what's happening here is this class tells it it's a bootstrap button.

50
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,820
This tells it's a primary bootstrap button so that takes care of the coloring and this takes care of

51
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,680
the sizing be at large.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,700
Let me save this.

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,370
And let's also add what we want the button say.

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,430
So let's have it say something like restart.

55
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,610
Now we could put this on multiple lines if we wanted to keep it all on line.

56
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,490
I'm pretty zoomed in right now but let's refresh and here we have restart.

57
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,430
I can click on it.

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,420
Nothing is happening but it's all working the way we want it to.

59
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,110
So for now let's continue on.

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,540
Something to think about at this stage is I will probably want to reference this button later on in

61
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,520
my javascript since the only button on the page.

62
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,850
Let's just give it an ID.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,820
We could also call it by its tag but I like calling things by their ID.

64
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,200
So let's give it the ID B so I can call it later and we're going to do is add in the table that's going

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,680
to represent our board.

66
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,560
We're going to add in the table and then we'll have to style it to actually make it look like a board.

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,850
So let's continue on that we're going to put this inside of the container.

68
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,920
But outside of the Jumbotron.

69
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,000
So let's expand that.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,170
So here we are now inside the container but outside the Jumbotron.

71
00:04:49,260 --> 00:05:03,350
I'm going to call a table and I'm going to say my table has a line equal to center and an inside of

72
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,790
this.

73
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,420
I have three table rows so say TR an inside it be true.

74
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,820
There's going to be three cells so tiddy and we'll leave them blank for now.

75
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,490
See the leave that one blank and then he leave that one blank.

76
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,940
And now let's do this two more times.

77
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,200
You can just copy and paste

78
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,020
and if we save this we should have our table right here.

79
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,280
You'll notice there's actually nothing showing up and that's because we have no styling attached to

80
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,170
this table so let's come over to the CSSA script and actually get some styling.

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,290
So we make sure that we're actually seeing this table I'm going to give styling to the actual table

82
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:55,260
cells the T.D. And let's give it a height of 150 pixels and these values are pretty arbitrary.

83
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:02,950
So you could have put whatever you want it also give it a width of 150 pixels so they're squares are

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,660
going to text align center.

85
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,260
And the reason for that is when I put an X or an O inside of the actual cell I wanted to be center aligned

86
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,250
and then let's give it a border.

87
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:25,070
This will allow us to see it will say five pixel solid black border and then let's give it a font size

88
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,260
of 100 pixels.

89
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,900
And again this font size refers to what I'm actually going to be putting X's and O's.

90
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,220
So let's save this will refresh over here and now I see my tic tac toe board.

91
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,300
Great and let's practice manually putting in an X over here.

92
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,260
So let's put an X into the very first table cell.

93
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:49,300
Save this refresh and there's my X and it's text the line centered which is exactly what we wanted.

94
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,760
Great hopefully you're able to get this far with very few difficulties.

95
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,860
I know it may look kind of daunting when you see just what the browser but on the page Tim LNC is a

96
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,260
site.

97
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,070
It's definitely everything that we've done before and it's pretty straightforward.

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,830
Now it might not be so straightforward especially since we're just learning it is the actual javascript

99
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,780
code to manipulate the document object model to play the game.

100
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,960
So let's get started on that.

101
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,730
I'm going to have a few sections.

102
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,910
I'll have the restart game button.

103
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:33,380
Then I'll have some sort of a section that grabs all the squares that I also want some sort of function

104
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,820
that can clear all the squares

105
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,550
and then I want to create a function that will check the square marker.

106
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,350
So something like check the square markers or check if it's an X or no.

107
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:58,760
And then finally I want some sort of for loop to add event listeners to all the squares.

108
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,520
OK so those are the main task we have to do and our javascript code and I'm going to approach this in

109
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,320
the next lecture.

110
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,310
That way you can spend some time to review the TMLC assess in the next lecture will actually cut out

111
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,490
all the stuff script.

112
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,470
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
