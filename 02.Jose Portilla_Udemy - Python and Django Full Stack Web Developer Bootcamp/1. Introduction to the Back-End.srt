00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,890
Hello everyone and welcome to an introduction to the backhand So welcome to the back half of the course

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,880
and before we begin we're going to get a brief overview of what to expect for this entire second half

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,890
of the course.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,790
But I also want you to congratulate yourself because you've already learned so much about the entire

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:22,900
front and stack.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,040
And we're going to continue on learning about the back and stack and get that full stack web developer

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,100
knowledge again congratulate yourself.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,490
You've learned a ton already.

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,010
OK.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,900
So to use Django and Python effectively a basic level of understanding the command line is necessary

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,260
and these commands are sometimes slightly different.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,450
For Windows users versus Mac OS and Linux users so refer to the notes for full examples and reference

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,780
commands since we're only going to need to know a few of them to get started.

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,240
So the next lecture is going to have a quick overview and a basic introduction to command lines and

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,350
using that command prompt or terminal.

16
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,660
If you're on a Mac OS or Linux and there's also a full note different explanations in case you want

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,660
to reference those that's just going to be a quick overview lecture.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,550
And that's actually all that's in this particular section of the course.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,080
Then in the next section in order to use Django we need to have a pretty good understanding of Python.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,600
So we have Python level 1 and Python level 2 and we need to learn Python up to the point of object oriented

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,570
programming.

22
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,360
If you already have previous experience of Python feel free to skip certain lectures look around in

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,930
the curriculum and see if it's a good starting point for you.

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,440
And I'll remind you do that again when we actually reached us Python lectures.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,740
Once we've learned Python we can begin to use a jangle web framework to create Web sites.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,320
And let's go over a very high level overview of how Django actually works and don't worry if you don't

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,480
fully understand this.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,990
This is just kind of to plant a seed in your mind that way once you actually reach Django you can remind

29
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,700
yourself oh that's what we were talking about in the introduction lecture.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,380
OK.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:57,620
So it's a very high level overview of Django basically a user will request a URL on your Web site something

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,850
like there'll be that hello dot com then that's going to go to a PI file which is then going to call

33
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,540
the views that py file in Django and the elves are just connected to views through a simple call and

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,720
then that will call your model Pi which contains all the information of your database.

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,960
And then that will query your database for the information feed it back to views that pi which creates

36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,410
the view of your Web site what it actually looks like.

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,660
And then we use templates to fill out that view with a TMLC SS and Javascript and then we send that

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,340
back to the user so far.

39
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,990
We now know the front end technologies and that mainly falls right there under the template sets h TMLC

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,650
SS and Javascript.

41
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,660
We're going to be doing next.

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,820
Is learning enough python to then we can use Django to actually understand this essential workflow.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,790
OK so now it's time to learn Python enough to successfully use the jingle framework that we just described.

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,320
That's a very high level overview.

45
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,460
And as we go through the back end make sure to visit the documentation for Django.

46
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,340
It's actually really well written and we'll get into why it's so well-written.

47
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,010
Later on when we talk about Django.

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,710
OK.

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,010
Now quick caveat and quick no many Jingles tutorials dive straight into a clone project where you're

50
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,420
guided through a clone of a popular Web site.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,400
Maybe they guide you through a clone of Twitter of Reddit etc..

52
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,470
This course is going to take a slightly different split approach where we create a very simple web site

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,710
first and then we move on to clone's So we first develop a very simple web site and the Web site is

54
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,520
just going to be a simple registry of user provided links with some basic user interactivity.

55
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,060
The reason we don't do a clone at first is because this doesn't really provide the best learning experience

56
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,030
for fundamental concepts with a simpler web site approach.

57
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,380
We can give really clear explanations on the actual fundamental concepts and how Gengel works.

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,420
Usually if you just start off straight into a clone you have a good idea of how to create that specific

59
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,950
clone Web site but you don't really have a good understanding of the fundamentals in order to create

60
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,870
your own specific Web sites.

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,550
And this approach also allows us to add an exercises that you can try out independently so that we can

62
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,870
test your knowledge on the core concepts instead of just guiding you through a code along where you

63
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,420
don't really get a chance to test your knowledge once you've gotten the main concepts down the simple

64
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,060
website.

65
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,990
Then we can tackle clone projects the later sections of the course will then utilize those clone projects

66
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,630
introduce more of anti-cop concepts things like social logons authorisations security the placement

67
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,470
IX cetera.

68
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,070
So we do have clone's and there are a great way to introduce those topics in a fun and interesting way.

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,250
All right.

70
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,230
Get ready to learn a lot this half of the course is where you really get to build all the cool stuff

71
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,400
and eventually you'll find yourself just staring at your computer thinking whoa that I just build a

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,330
freakin Web site and it's really exciting stuff.

73
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,200
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
