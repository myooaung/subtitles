Hello everyone and welcome to this quick advance side lecture where we talk about the Gengel de-bug

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,440
toolbar.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,150
We've already seen how to manually debug Django at the end of our clone projects but maybe there's a

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,100
better way that we can try to get a little more help and luckily there is it's called the Django de-bug

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,490
toolbar and it's a favorite tool for jangles developers to help them try to catch where errors are happening

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,070
inside of their project.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,310
The jingle toolbar gives useful panel tools about your project that can help you clarify why certain

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,610
behavior is occurring or happening.

9
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,960
It won't be able to pinpoint the exact source of a bug or help you figure out how to actually change

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,840
the syntax.

11
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,600
It really just contains useful information that you may find helpful to actually find and help fix the

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,230
bugs.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,280
So this with the toolbar actually looks like we'll actually play around for a lot more in the next lecture.

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,430
But essentially you see on the right hand side this toolbar and there's various panels they can click

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,770
on and then it gives you information about your website.

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,570
Now keep in mind this may or may not fit with your workflow style but it is helpful enough that many

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:16,060
developers that work of Django keep it up to date of their open source contributions so it may not work

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,580
for you but it's a very popular tool for developers in general which is why it's worth talking about

19
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,680
in order to get the debug toolbar in your virtual environment.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,090
Go to your command line and type Pipp install Shingo dasht debug cache toolbar and depending on how

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,190
you actually install Django and your version you may even already have installed but again go to a virtual

22
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,220
environment and do that Pipp install command OK in the next lecture.

23
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,120
What we're going to do is briefly go over the panels and what information they show you.

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,110
Then you can decide if it's a good fit for your workflow.

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,030
A lot of the projects in this course are small enough where the toolbar may not be a deciding factor

26
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,010
in whether or not use it though once you become a developer either as part of a larger company or you

27
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,510
start develop your own really large projects.

28
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,550
The toolbar may be a good choice for your workflow.

29
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,390
OK I'll see you at the next lecture.
