00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.850
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.050
Welcome back to Part 6 of the blog clone project.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.620
So he finished up all our views and now let's wrap up all the or else including the Urals in the project.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.790
You're also up by file by setting up a quick authentication system that runs on top of that super user

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.520
group.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.940
That way anyone that actually wants to create a post needs to be a super user should be pretty brief.

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.380
So let's get started.

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.230
All right.

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.750
Here I am at the Adam text editor and I will open up the URLs that py file that corresponds to the my

10
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.280
site project folder.

11
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:45.210
And here when I'm going to do is save from jingo dot contrib.

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.910
Th authorization import use.

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.720
And what I'm doing is I'm just importing some views just like I would from another application from

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.280
the authorization application.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.040
And we've seen this actually done before.

16
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.730
So let's set this up.

17
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.440
Going to call your L and I'm going to create a domain slash accounts slash logons can be or a logon

18
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:19.410
page and we're just going to call use the log in and give it the name logon and the next thing we're

19
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:30.930
going to do is create our log out souls say our accounts slash log outs slash dollar sign in here we'll

20
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.660
say views log out give it the name walk out and then give it some keyword arguments or so.

21
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.870
KW a RG Yes we can collapse that directory tree give ourselves a little more room here and then we'll

22
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.010
say equal to an old do we'll give it the next page.

23
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.430
So that's the next page going to go to and we'll have it go with a value of just a forward slash.

24
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.860
So when you log out the next page you go to is just the home page which is our post list page.

25
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.610
OK.

26
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.390
So those are all patterns and if we check out under registration we have our log in that each team l

27
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.270
page which is ready to go.

28
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.350
So let's fill that out right now.

29
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.750
And we'll say that this extends from blog base.

30
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.450
H tim L. and depending on what plugins you have for Adam this could be syntax highlighted and will eventually

31
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.440
have some base but each team will block.

32
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.240
So I'm going to say block and we'll have some sort of content block which will behave as our body block.

33
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.280
So we've usually seen you can call it whatever you want and then we'll need to call and block here.

34
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.680
So this is essentially going to be our log in page.

35
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.090
So I'm going to have it be a Jumbotron eventually in the baseline h team l file or we're gonna end up

36
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.750
doing is sending a link to bootstrap and we'll just say something like Please log in.

37
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.900
And then after that we'll have H-3 and imprints will remind the person must be a super user.

38
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.060
Please check with the site's admin.

39
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.700
Just some sort of message there to indicate Hey you must be a supervisor if you're not checking to say

40
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.730
admin.

41
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.050
And then here we can add in some logic.

42
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.810
So we're going to say is

43
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.520
the forum.

44
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.640
Errors and then whenever we have an if you should have an end if so if that's the case.

45
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.910
So if our form has any errors in it meaning essentially there was a match between the user or the password

46
00:03:50.350 --> 00:04:00.120
to have something pop up here saying your username and password didn't match please try.

47
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.590
Whoops.

48
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.000
Quis try again.

49
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.040
Otherwise we'll just continue on with this form.

50
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.430
So create a forum tag and it doesn't need a class and for the action we're going to have it do is go

51
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.430
to the log in page.

52
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.450
So this action sort of index that each symbol is going to have it using your template tags.

53
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:33.580
Will say your el log in and we're basically since we're into your old PI file pointing everything as

54
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.370
far as templates to go straight to the blog I don't have like we've typically seen something like blog

55
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.200
coaling log in because there are no templates at the site level.

56
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.640
Everything goes to the blog.

57
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.180
So in that case you can kind of simplify things by just saying log in and we'll discover that more as

58
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.450
we mess around with more templates.

59
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.920
But we also don't need a.

60
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.780
Actually.

61
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.600
Let's make this Kapolei just so it's clear.

62
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.910
But what we do need excuse me is the SRF token.

63
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:12.000
So let's add that in so we'll say see SRF underscore tokin.

64
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.160
And after that we're going to have form dot as underscore.

65
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.690
So that creates the paragraph form and after that we need some inputs.

66
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.990
So I'll have a submit button.

67
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.870
And let's give the class that's going to align with the bootstrap classes.

68
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.900
So between beats in the primary.

69
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.510
Eventually you'll start kind of memorizing more and more of these classes and it doesn't need a name

70
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.010
because we're not linking it to anything Tim Wise.

71
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.050
But we give it a value and let's just have the button say something like log in and then beyond that

72
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.480
what we want is to have is some hidden input.

73
00:05:49.710 --> 00:06:00.370
So give this a hidden input the name will be next and the value is just going to be next here.

74
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.810
And this basically has to do with the view that we're operating with.

75
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.980
So if we come back to your pie this log in page essentially this view is not log in it's going to supply

76
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.160
this next value for us which is going to allow us to kind of deal with what to do next after this person's

77
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.660
been logged in and let's make sure this div is closed and that's it.

78
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.250
Great.

79
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.040
So that's our entire log in.

80
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.200
But each team L and that's all we have to do for the Urals page in the actual If come back here.

81
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.740
This is all we need to do is just have these four patterns.

82
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.260
Two of them dealing with log in and log out setting up the abdomen and then including blocks that you

83
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.000
are all right.

84
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.430
Pretty brief lecture but basically all are log in and off authentication stuff.

85
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.200
As far as actually going into registering on the site should be done for us.

86
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.040
Up next all we have to do is take care of these rest these templates and then we're going to do in the

87
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.170
next lecture.

88
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.680
Thanks and I'll see you there.
