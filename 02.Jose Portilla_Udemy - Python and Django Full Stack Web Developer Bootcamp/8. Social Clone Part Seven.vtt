00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.980
Welcome everyone to part seven of the social club project what we're not going to do is focus on the

2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.630
group's application by creating the views for the group templates and then connecting the template files

3
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.680
to those views using the or stop high file for group applications.

4
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.010
All right.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.190
Let's hop over to the Adam text editor and get started.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.600
All right so by now I should already have your model's not pi file filled out for the group's application.

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.030
Now we're going to open up views up PI under groups and start filling out some very basic views for

8
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.850
our actual group's application.

9
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290
And we're going to do is couple of things first.

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.290
A couple of imports I will say from Django contrib.

11
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.670
Th for authorization mix ins and then ongoing to import.

12
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.500
And I will import two mixes here the loggin required to mix in and then the permission required mixin.

13
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.500
And if you want you can put these on multiple lines just by having parentheses.

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.570
So something that's common to see is if you have really long import lines you can just use multiple

15
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.640
lines with a print CS there and then.

16
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.060
Well we're also going to do is a bunch of other imports we will say from Django core that you're all

17
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:25.800
resolvers import reverse and then I will also say from Django views import and then I'm going to import

18
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.970
those generic views and that's just the class based views that we've worked with before.

19
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.150
OK let's get started.

20
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.830
I'm going to say class and I will have a create group view.

21
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.600
So if someone is logged into the site and they want to create their own group kind of like creating

22
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.970
your own subset this will be the view for that.

23
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.350
And it's going to take and the logging required mixin and it will also take in the create view and then

24
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.860
here I just need to specify the fields I want them to be able to create.

25
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.630
So we say field is equal to and I want them to be able to edit the name of the field or the name of

26
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.290
the group.

27
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.640
I should say and then the description and those are just directly linked to the model slot pi.

28
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.220
So the name and the description I don't want them to be able to edit things like Slogger members because

29
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.920
that really wouldn't make sense.

30
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.820
So when they create a group it takes a generic view and then finally I just need to connect it to the

31
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.200
actual model.

32
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.730
So if I'm going to connect it to the group model that means I need to import it.

33
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.870
So we'll say from groups or models and you can also say from that models import group and then group

34
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.300
member that way you can call them throughout these class based views.

35
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.910
So right now we have a very basic create view.

36
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.110
So to actually connect this to a template we're going to need to later on our template underneath groups

37
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.970
as well as are you're also not profile but let's continue on to create a detail view and a list view

38
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.870
and then we'll actually mess around with those template files.

39
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.160
So I will say class and let's just say single group and this is just going to be a generic detail view.

40
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.820
So it's just the details of that specific group things like the post inside that group etc..

41
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.770
And that's just going to be connected to a model called group.

42
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.710
So pretty simple.

43
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.390
And then we'll have a list groups.

44
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.310
So when someone goes to like the list groups page to see a list of all the available groups kind of

45
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.710
like selecting a list all subsets or something like that and then we'll say generic and that will be

46
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.700
a list view and you can see already that class based views making our lives a lot simpler.

47
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.010
And then we'll say models equal to group.

48
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.260
So I'm going to say that looks like we have three main class based views.

49
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.930
Now let's head over to the templates and actually create those template files that connect them.

50
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.450
We already have group base group detail group form and group list.

51
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.350
So we should be pretty good to go.

52
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.210
Let's start off by saying group base and in the group base that each team T.M. I'm going to say extends

53
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.680
from base thought HVM L and then I'm going to call block content.

54
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.250
So that's going to extend from the actual baseline each team M-file that have already created underneath

55
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.910
the project templates.

56
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:09.710
And then I have my content here and I'm going to create a div container class and then I will say div

57
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.180
class row K.S. need that for bootstrap purposes.

58
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.830
And then I'm going to make three blocks here.

59
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.670
I have a pretty group block a group content block and then a post group block that we'll see how we

60
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.800
can use later on.

61
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.070
So this block I will say is group we can actually just put it like this.

62
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.700
It's a little more readable than in a copy and paste this.

63
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.530
And then we will have a block that is the group contents group underscore content and then the post

64
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.120
group.

65
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.840
So we won't use all of these blocks in every template but in case we ever want to have something that

66
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.000
goes before the group content we have group during the group content we have group content and then

67
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.720
after that group content we have post group.

68
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.570
OK.

69
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.830
So that's always I will say that.

70
00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.660
And then we're going to continue on with the other templates so lets start off with the group detail

71
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:10.330
page that will come over as a group detail that very next template and I will say extends from groups

72
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:18.010
forward slash group underscore based to h tim L that H team all we were just working with and then let's

73
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.810
put everything we want to occur before the group name.

74
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:29.060
So I will call block and this will be my Prete group block and then a heading one I'm going to have

75
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.950
the group name and I can call that using template syntax by saying group that name.

76
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.240
So remember with those class based views there is actually a context dictionary that gets passed that

77
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.070
holds everything that the model has.

78
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:50.450
So since groups have names I can just call group name and this word group is the lowercase singular

79
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.480
version of the actual models become models of Pi.

80
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.540
This is the lower case model.

81
00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.000
G r o u p which is where that actual context dictionary comes from.

82
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.900
And that just as we've told you before comes from class based views then heading to.

83
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:14.170
I'm going to say member count and hearing and input another basically call to the context dictionary

84
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.550
and enjoy group members so again come back to the model.

85
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.820
Remember we have members here an offer that I'm actually going to call a method and I can call the count

86
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.490
method or attribute off of that.

87
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.690
And if you want a list of these you can check the documentation for various things you can call off

88
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.810
of model objects.

89
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.190
All right now the next step for the sexual group detail page is on that group detail page where it's

90
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.680
actually listing the posts.

91
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.240
If you're a member and you're logged in I want you to have a leave or join button there.

92
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.950
So let's try to add that in.

93
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.560
Inside this same Prigg group block I'm going to create div and I will call this content in case I ever

94
00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:03.300
want to edit this FC the SS and inside of this I'm going to say if and I will say if user in group members

95
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:14.400
all so that means if this user happens to be inside this essentially an array or list of all the members

96
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.930
inside that actual group model then I'm going to do the following.

97
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:28.200
I'll have an anchor tag that has an H ref to your L and then groups leave.

98
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:34.640
So we haven't actually created this view or Uriel's yet but later on in our Urals file for the actual

99
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.540
groups we're going to be able to have the option to leave the group.

100
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.320
So we only want that if the user is already in the group so we'll say OK the users are already in a

101
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.870
group and visit to this page.

102
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.890
They have the option to leave and they're going to be able to leave.

103
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.730
We also have to define what slug.

104
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.810
And that's just going to be equal to group thought slug.

105
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.160
Now we'll kind of edit this later on.

106
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.950
But let's actually make sure to see your template with those percent signs and then inside of this we're

107
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.270
going to go ahead and give this a class to all say class when collapses.

108
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.890
We get a little more room here.

109
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.050
Class is equal to.

110
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.770
We'll just have this be a normal button say between Actually let's make it a really large button.

111
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.570
So it's kind of obvious I can start this on a new line.

112
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:22.150
So it will say class Button but say button.

113
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.190
LG for a large button.

114
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.160
Fill out this button and then let's make it a warning button so it's like really obvious to the user

115
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.670
that if they click that button they're going to leave.

116
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:31.590
OK.

117
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:37.940
And then we're also going to do is add in a span so we're going to use Cliffie icons or glyph icons

118
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:45.020
and this will allow me to actually have an icon there instead of just like a word that says Leave group.

119
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.840
So it's going to look like an exit sign or something.

120
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.920
So we'll have it be a remove circle and that will be right next to the word leave.

121
00:08:52.280 --> 00:09:01.500
So we do this by creating a span and then inside that span we create a class and that class is going

122
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:12.480
to be a glyph icon and then it's glyph icon dash remove dash circle and you can technically not really

123
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.820
have the span.

124
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.890
Just kind of an icon I want to put in there.

125
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.100
You can check out the bootstrap documentation for all these codes and all the different icons they have

126
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.080
available.

127
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.890
And then I'm going to say leave OK.

128
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.160
So we have this button that shows up if a group if a member is already in that group and then they can

129
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.780
click on that button and they'll leave the group so that if that user is already in the group else we

130
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.320
should probably give them the option to join the group.

131
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:37.780
So we'll say.

132
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.890
Else.

133
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.200
And it's going to be a really similar thing we'll have h.

134
00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.450
And then let's just copy this because it's so similar.

135
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.730
So I'm going to copy this entire anchor tag and then post it here.

136
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.240
And then inside this anchor tag let's change what we want so else you're not going to leave it.

137
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.850
And we know they're going to join it.

138
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.150
So we'll make another view later on for Euro groups join.

139
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.110
Same thing is going to be the slug and we can have the same thing as a button a warning you can change

140
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.460
if you want but a warning or default et cetera for coloring.

141
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:15.980
We will have instead of a remove circle I'm going to say OK circle and then we will say and sort of

142
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.260
leave.

143
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.610
All right.

144
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.900
Again basic idea.

145
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:27.170
We check that user who's currently visiting this page is in a group that members are all and then whether

146
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.420
or not they're going to leave or join.

147
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.710
All right now we're actually almost done with group detail that reached him L and then scroll down past

148
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:40.420
this block and then I will start a new block and this is just going to be my group content here.

149
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.860
And then what we will do is I don't want the group content that is the list of actual posts to take

150
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.990
up the entire page.

151
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.590
I kind of want them lined up a little bit.

152
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:55.750
So what I'm going to do is say give class and I'll get this a class of call medium Dash 8.

153
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:03.050
Those are those bootstrap formations and then we'll say if I'm going to say if group that postop count

154
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.630
is equal to zero.

155
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.970
And that basically means if the group doesn't actually have any posts in it yet what I will say is instead

156
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:17.840
of listing something I'm just going to have a hit or two that says no post in this group yet let's make

157
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.010
sure we spell it right.

158
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.700
So no post in this group yet.

159
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:27.520
And then if we don't have else actually let's say else else what else are going to do.

160
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:37.770
We're going to say for four post in group posts all and then I'm going to just cycle through this.

161
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:46.180
But when I'm going to do is say include and then we'll say posts forward slash underscore post-time

162
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.280
h tim L and let me describe since we haven't really seen include yet what's going on there and other

163
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.060
than that we're actually done with this page so it will take a little bit of time to kind of do a little

164
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.950
description of 13:1.

165
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:05.070
So all I'm doing here is I'm saying if the group currently has no post just have a heading to that says

166
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.310
no post in this group yet.

167
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.650
But the more likely situation where we actually already have posts in that groups.

168
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.180
What I want to do is save for posts in groups of posts that all.

169
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:20.370
And then I'm going to include now include is kind of a way of saying extends except you're going to

170
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.000
essentially insert it right in the middle of an each team I'll file.

171
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:30.820
So instead of actually extending and using blocks we can do is use the Include statement to inject in

172
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:31.960
each team Al file.

173
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.220
Sister is going to be so much stuff going off the posts themselves.

174
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.970
A lot of HVM calls a lot of template calls I template tags.

175
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.240
I don't want to include all of that in this group detail that is T.M..

176
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.680
Instead what I will do is have that all taken care of in this post.

177
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:47.800
A steam elf file.

178
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.160
And since this is going to be injected to kind of signify that as a developer I had this underscore

179
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.200
there.

180
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.430
Now I technically don't need that underscore there.

181
00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.050
It's really more for me to understand that this particular piece of each team file is designed to be

182
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.190
injected into other each team of files using include.

183
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.320
So that's the kind of syntax that I'm going to be using to actually understand that.

184
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.500
So that's it for the group detail page and we're going to do is finish off those other class based views

185
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.180
that we just created.

186
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.940
So we'll come back up here the next one we're going to do is the group list page so that should be pretty

187
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.550
straightforward.

188
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.730
Let's go to group list.

189
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:33.010
Click on that and this is going to extend from groups slash group underscore based h Timo.

190
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:40.120
Let's collapse that directory tree again and then I'm going to call a block for my pre content's or

191
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:49.390
group content than hear what I will say is give this a class of call medium for a lot of these class

192
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.980
calls and you can adjust them yourself.

193
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.350
This is more for styling.

194
00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.240
And then we will say contents and what I want to do is check if a user is logged in and they're authenticated.

195
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.770
I want to say a welcome back username and if not it's going to just say hey welcome to the group's page.

196
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.980
Select the group.

197
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.690
So let's try that out.

198
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:17.190
We'll see if the user is underscore authenticated and I can use all these user template calls because

199
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.890
of the Django authorization package basically takes care of all the heavy lifting to connect this on

200
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:29.780
the backend so you can just say user that is authenticated and what I will do if they're authenticated.

201
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:35.660
I'll have a heading to you on the web page it says Welcome back.

202
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:43.920
And inside of this heading to I'm also going to have an anchor Ted and it's going to link to their actual

203
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:44.930
profile.

204
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:53.490
So I'll say you are el and pose for underscore user so that it actually links to their profile where

205
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.300
it has a list of all their posts in case they ever want to see that.

206
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.260
And then I also need to provide their username.

207
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:09.180
So say a user name as equal to user dot whoops user thought user name and then inside of here and the

208
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:15.570
actual anchor tag wasn't going to do is say at end with template tags.

209
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:22.430
I need to inject this double say at user the user name so that basically has that kind of Twitter quality

210
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.900
or basically any social network quality where it is user and authenticated.

211
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.050
I'll say welcome back.

212
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.480
There'll be a link here that says at user that username and if you click on that link it will take you

213
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.040
to a list of all your posts.

214
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.410
Now we're going to take care of that view later on when we're dealing with posts now.

215
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:45.290
And if so for everyone though it will show the falling ill say groups heading to.

216
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:50.750
And then I'll have a paragraph here it says Welcome to the group's page.

217
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.160
Exclamation point.

218
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.860
Save that and then the other thing I want to do is check that if a user is authenticated I should be

219
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.290
able to kind of have a button that says Create newgroup.

220
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.510
So we'll do that as well.

221
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:15.390
We'll say if outside of this first attack if the user is underscore authenticated it will have an anchor

222
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:21.910
tag here are again the anchor tag is linked to your el groups underscore creates.

223
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.230
And there's a couple of ways you could have done this.

224
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.370
You don't have to do exactly the same way I'm doing it but I'm going to do it for a simple button call

225
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:35.160
between PTEN dash and the between dash will be 10 dash warning.

226
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:40.090
Now remember from the navigation bar technically the user can already create a group from any page.

227
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.980
There's a little link in the navigation but since you're on the group's page it might be nice to actually

228
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.670
have it as a separate button as well on the actual group page.

229
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.390
So that's why I'm adding this in.

230
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:57.100
And then we will go ahead and add a span and use those glyph icons so in the span I will give it the

231
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.410
class glyph.

232
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:06.970
Let me make sure I spell that right Cliff icon glyph icon.

233
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.470
I'm in trouble with this glyph icon dash plus dash sign.

234
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.250
It looks like a little plus sign and we'll just have the text right next it.

235
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.920
Create new group and then we need to end that if.

236
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.320
All right.

237
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.790
So that's it for that at the very top of the page.

238
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.020
And so that will end the group block.

239
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:28.940
So it just checks.

240
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:29.960
Welcome back.

241
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.040
And then says welcome to girls page has a little button there if you're authenticated to create a new

242
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.290
group.

243
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:45.170
Next we're going to do the actual group or content so we'll say have a new block group content and then

244
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:52.420
couldn't give this one more division we'll say should be call dash media Dash 8.

245
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:59.400
So this can take up everything and then we'll say div class I'll say list group in case we ever want

246
00:17:59.400 --> 00:17:59.680
to.

247
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.270
This will see SS and now I'm going to have a for loop.

248
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:07.130
So I'm going to say for group an object underscore list.

249
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.310
And we'll talk about this object in your score list later on.

250
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:20.440
So for group an object list and have an anchor tag and we'll give this you or I'll call.

251
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:32.430
We'll say you're all groups single where the slug is equal to the group thoughts slug itself and I'm

252
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:40.530
going to have this actually have a class will say this class will be list group item in case I ever

253
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.940
want to add it or call it.

254
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.320
And then let's kind of start this rest this anchor tag on a new line.

255
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:54.850
And that is going to have let's say inside this anchor tag will have a heading three with a class of

256
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:55.910
its own.

257
00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:05.930
And this class will say tidal list group item heading.

258
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:11.700
So in case you ever want to edit that three you can do it in the SS and then I will say the group actual

259
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.090
name.

260
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:21.360
So that's the heading three and what is actually going on here is kind of briefly describe it.

261
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:28.110
So so far I have for every group in my object list which is essentially going to be a list of the actual

262
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.530
groups remember this is the group list.

263
00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.370
Each team L.

264
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.050
And we're going to have an anchor tag that so far has a link to the group names.

265
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:40.020
If you click on the group name Ill take it to the groups single page through this slug connection but

266
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.930
there's still more I want to add here.

267
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:52.770
I'm going to inside of the same anchor to create a div class and will say list group item I'm going

268
00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.650
to call it text and then say container fluids.

269
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:03.930
That's a bootstrap a container called and then here is where I'm finally going to use that description.

270
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:09.420
So I'll say it description underscore HVM L and then a pipe OPERATOR I'll say safe.

271
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:15.090
So that allows me if you remember from the previous clone project that allows me to actually use the

272
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:21.610
HTL code in a safe way so that if something is bold you actually see bold text instead of seeing bold

273
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.360
template tags or bold HTL tags.

274
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:31.280
Now what we want to do is right after this we're going to call another div and this is just going to

275
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.940
be a row and I know there's a lot to type here.

276
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.030
So if you want to just copy and paste this from the actual solution so you don't make any type of thing

277
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.240
where it's really easy to make a typo here and I'm sure I'm making one right now which we're going to

278
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:50.930
fix later and we'll create one more that says call medium for and we'll create a span and we will say

279
00:20:50.990 --> 00:21:00.340
this is a class and we'll get this a batch class and then we're going to do here is inside the span.

280
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:08.160
I'll have group members counts and then inside of that I'm going to say

281
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:11.720
member

282
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:26.610
member and I will say group members count pluralize and later on we'll actually see what this does pluralize

283
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:34.700
SRU I don't actually spell it wrong OK that's the end of this particular div and then we're going to

284
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.600
start one more inside of the object suite div.

285
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:43.690
And this is also going to be call M.D for in here again.

286
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:50.560
Basically have the same thing span with the classes equal to badge.

287
00:21:50.680 --> 00:22:00.650
And then we'll call it group post counts and then outside of this we will have post template tagging.

288
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:07.240
I'm going to inject group post counts and then we will call pluralize on that as well.

289
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:08.940
OK.

290
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.380
So a ton of div tags here and I promise we'll go over all this at the very end.

291
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:20.450
But now we're going to do is basically scroll down and this make sure everything's lined up and we should

292
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:26.630
have two div tags after the end four and then an anchor and three more tags before that and everything

293
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:31.460
else should be lining up so if you don't have that you probably made a typo somewhere suggest a copy

294
00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.660
and paste from the solution.

295
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.790
That's a lot easier than typing along with me.

296
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.160
But let's actually go through this grouplets patients.

297
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.840
There's a lot going on here.

298
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:44.060
First off group all we're doing is checking these authenticated if they are we have a little thing that

299
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.960
says welcome back at whoever the user is and it links to that user's post.

300
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.520
So you log in you go to the groups page says welcome back Jose.

301
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:53.240
Click on that.

302
00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.060
Then it takes a list of all jose's posts.

303
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.930
Then it says END-IF.

304
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.310
Now everybody would say welcome to the group page.

305
00:22:59.360 --> 00:22:59.790
We check.

306
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.950
OK if is authenticated let's add a little button there so they can create a new group.

307
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.320
There's also one of the navigation bar.

308
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.250
But we should have one here as well.

309
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.410
That's the end of the group block.

310
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.250
Now it's the much more complicated group content block but it's actually not so bad.

311
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.360
Basically what we're doing is we're saying OK for every group in this object list which is going to

312
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.290
be a list of all the group objects we're going to have.

313
00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.850
And essentially you can kind of ignore these class calls or just CSSA and focus on what's really going

314
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:26.660
on here.

315
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.590
So here we're going say group name.

316
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.200
And you can click on that group name and will take you to the single group page for that group detail

317
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.380
page so we just created earlier and then the actual description we call a description underscore each

318
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:46.010
hymnal and we call it safe that way and caster's any bold tags or it's hallux tags whatever they happen

319
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.570
to be displayed correctly.

320
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.740
And then we have these group members accounts and group post count.

321
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.210
So on the actual page where it details the groups that are available it will say how many posts that

322
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.710
group has and how many members that group has as well.

323
00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.260
That's basically all that's going on here.

324
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.230
It's just the large amount of div class calls that kind of make it hard to read.

325
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.630
But essentially it's just a pretty simple for loop.

326
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.380
That's the splaying the group name.

327
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.450
The number of members in that group and the number of posts that group.

328
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.210
Then when you click the group name it will take you to that actual group detail page.

329
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.480
That's all that's going on in groups list.

330
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.960
Now finally what I want to fill out is let's say someone does click on Create a new group they're going

331
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.500
to go to groups create and that's going to be created by that create view.

332
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:33.470
So let's come over here and set that up with group underscore forum.

333
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:43.150
So in this page I'm going to say extends groups slash group underscore based T.M. and then I'm also

334
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:48.950
going to remember this is a form so I will load up bootstrap 3 to make the form look nice.

335
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:57.730
Then we'll have block and then it will say group underscore content and here doesn't really matter what

336
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.660
heading size you use.

337
00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:07.570
I'm just going to say create a new group and then we'll create a form here will say form loops for form

338
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:13.780
and this form will have a class but it will have an action and the action will link back to

339
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.510
your L groups underscore create.

340
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:27.080
So basically linking to art create view and then we'll give this post method and will actually also

341
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.970
give it an ID in case we ever want to edit it.

342
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:37.580
S. SS Now I will say group form spicket group form of camel casing just so I know and inside of here

343
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.620
since it's a forum we always need our CSR token.

344
00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.930
And then below that we're going to have the forum call.

345
00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:49.820
So if template whip's with template tagging will call bootstrap form as we saw before bootstrap underscore

346
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.560
form in the past in the form.

347
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.530
So this makes it look a lot nicer when using bootstrap 3.

348
00:25:54.590 --> 00:26:01.320
Which again you have Pipp install finally will have an input block and that will just be type submit.

349
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.220
It'll save value says create.

350
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:09.810
So it says create and then let's give this a class we don't need to give it a name globally between

351
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.190
PTEN primary and then BATNA large.

352
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.790
OK so definitely a lot of stuff here so let's quickly review.

353
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:24.080
We finished off all the templates for groups as well as most of the views so let's quickly review.

354
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:29.560
So what we did in this lecture was it came over to views that pie in the group's application.

355
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:34.900
And we created three main views for creating a new group for looking at a single group and then the

356
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:40.210
list groups and then we actually went to the templates and fill that out ourselves so the basic template

357
00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.720
just has these three blocks.

358
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.040
What goes before the group.

359
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.470
What the actual group conta is.

360
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.280
And in the post group.

361
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.720
That way we can easily separate them than we actually have the detail page of a group which just shows

362
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.610
the group name.

363
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.380
The number of members in that group and then it actually says if the users in that group there's a leave

364
00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.880
button if the user is not in that group there's a join button that we can't connect users to groups

365
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.630
themselves.

366
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.030
And here we just say OK if there's no post in the group just say no posts.

367
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.510
If there are post though we're just going to kind of inject this underscore postdates TMail content

368
00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:16.330
that will work with later on in the future lecture then we actually went to the group list page which

369
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:21.190
was a little complicated but essentially just shows Welcome back through the user says Welcome to the

370
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.190
group page.

371
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.470
If the user is authenticated we have a little button that says you can create a new group and then here

372
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:32.920
we just actually list out every group with the link to the group and then the number of members and

373
00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.360
the number of posts that group.

374
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.640
Finally for that create the we have group underscore forum or just create group and we have that forum

375
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.600
that we just created.

376
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.260
OK.

377
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.810
We're actually still not done with all the views for groups.

378
00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.260
There's two more a little more complicated views.

379
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.750
We're gonna do the next lecture.

380
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:53.800
That's basically the views for joining a group and leaving a group so that's going to kind of require

381
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.940
a little bit more of a code to actually make those work.

382
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.560
Or if you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums.

383
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.370
Definitely that a lot here and we only type the lot so if you're stuck on something or something that

384
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.890
didn't seem quite right you can always just copy and paste from the provided notes.

385
00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.090
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
