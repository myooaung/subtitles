00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.900
Hello everyone and welcome to part two object oriented programming object oriented programming as a

2
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.660
way to use Python to create our own objects.

3
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.500
And sometimes it can be a point of great confusion for beginners and mainly because it's often just

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.420
talk poorly.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.380
You're kind of just thrown into object oriented programming taught a few keywords and expect to understand

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.100
everything all at once.

7
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.010
We're going to try our best to save you from any confusion by systematically building up and showing

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.340
you slowly the thought process behind object oriented programming.

9
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.070
Otherwise known as O.P..

10
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.030
And why would even need to use it.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.580
We will use it quite a bit for Django.

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.120
So let's get started by showing you the basics.

13
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.420
This is going to be a single dot PI file.

14
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.300
For the notes part two object oriented programming that PI that is going to be multiple video lectures.

15
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.070
So keep that in mind.

16
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.280
We're going to break it into understandable steps.

17
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.930
Let's go to the editor now.

18
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.960
All right let's start off by trying to understand the fundamental idea behind object oriented programming.

19
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.580
Why would we even want to use it.

20
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.330
Well hopefully remember when we were first learning about basic data types and basic structures I could

21
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.700
do something like this say my list is equal to one to three.

22
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.860
And then when I said my list dot notice that I get a bunch of methods here a appends count extend pop

23
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.920
or move etc..

24
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.880
So there's a lot of methods available to me on this object.

25
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:30.020
And then I could say append the four here save this and then do something like Prince my list.

26
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.170
I save this run Python notes that pi or whatever file you have and I get one two three four.

27
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.050
Now the idea behind object oriented programming is this.

28
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.980
So far we have the capability to create a very simple function or even a very complex function.

29
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.950
What we don't yet know how to do is build something like a list object.

30
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.440
We don't know yet how can you build an object and then have methods inside of it or attributes inside

31
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.700
of it that you can use to affect the object itself.

32
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.100
And that's the whole idea of object oriented programming.

33
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.530
How are we able to actually create our own objects in Python.

34
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.670
We know how to use the built in objects in Python but we don't know how to actually build our own.

35
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.620
The first step on your journey of learning about object oriented programming is to realize that in Python

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.430
everything is an object and you can check an object type by saying type and then passing in an object

37
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.950
itself.

38
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.610
So for example if I pass in a list here I don't have to save it as a variable I can just say type and

39
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.130
let's print out that type.

40
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.580
So say print type here it tells me it's of the class list and class is going to be one of the key words

41
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.040
we use.

42
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.530
We're actually learning about object oriented programming.

43
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.540
So here I know that this is type list and I don't even actually have to have anything inside of it.

44
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.100
It can just be an empty list.

45
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.270
I can run this in a class list and if I replace this just to be Quincy's remember that's how we define

46
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.160
a tuple.

47
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.850
So if I save this and run this it says class tuple and we can see this for a variety of things.

48
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.280
Let's say pasan a number type McDermitt princes or bals there and I run this.

49
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.950
They'll say class I.A. or class Integer.

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.910
Make this twenty point zero.

51
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.290
Save this.

52
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.620
Run this and it says class floating point.

53
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.220
So what we want to know is how can we create our own classes in order to create our own object.

54
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.900
So we keep seeing this keyword class and we want to know how can we use it.

55
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.880
So let's actually show you so now that we understand everything in Python is an object we can use the

56
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.280
class keyword and the user defined objects are created using this keyword.

57
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.480
The class is essentially a blueprint that defines the nature of a future object and from classes we

58
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.780
can then construct instances of that class an instance is just a specific object created for a particular

59
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.800
class.

60
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.010
So for example previously we created the object my list that was an instance of a list object.

61
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.080
Let's see how we can actually use class.

62
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.000
First off we start with the class keyword.

63
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.980
And if you hit enter here you'll get class auto completed for you.

64
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.890
Let's create a sample class and note the syntax highlighting here.

65
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.990
And by convention class names are always capitalized.

66
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.980
That way you know whether you're calling a class or a function.

67
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.870
Functions are lowercase.

68
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.480
Classes are a start of an uppercase.

69
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.030
Now we have close parentheses.

70
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.350
Colon.

71
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.570
And then what goes here in your class.

72
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.010
Right now I'm going to use the pass keyword to not do anything.

73
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.610
We'll just say pass.

74
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.840
So I'm going to save the.

75
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.310
And then over here I will say x is equal to.

76
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.970
And I will say sample close princes and then I'm going to print the type of x.

77
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.410
Save this.

78
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.370
Let's run it.

79
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.850
And here it says class maned that sample and we'll discuss what main is in a future lecture.

80
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.710
Right now we can see that I'm getting a very similar result to what I saw previously with the builtin

81
00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.490
classes.

82
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.850
I've now created in my own class my own object called sample all using the class keyword.

83
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.210
All right.

84
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.400
That's it for this lecture.

85
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.540
So far all I want you to understand is that everything in Python is an object and we can create our

86
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:19.350
own objects using the class keyword and we can check with the type built in function what the actual

87
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.230
class is coming up next.

88
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.280
We're going to learn how to add attributes and methods to a class and we're going to start right where

89
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.850
we left off.

90
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.860
In this video I'll see you at the next lecture.
