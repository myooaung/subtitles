Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,800
To change a level 5 in this section of the course we're going to be focusing on user authentication.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,770
So far we've only created applications that assume everyone's going to see the same pages.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,870
And this is one of those aspects of Django where there are lots of built in available tools as well

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:25,880
as plenty of external packages that enhance the functionality of user Athens cation.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,980
We're going to be focusing mainly on the built in tools for this particular section of the course and

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,950
we'll be talking about users in the user model talking about permissions groups passwords and authentication

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,650
and then how to have users log in and log out of your Web site OK.

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,630
Let's get started.

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,560
I'll see you at the next lecture.
