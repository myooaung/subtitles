00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,870
Hello everyone and welcome to part three of the bootstrap section of the course where we talk about

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,930
Neph bars Neph bars are those navigational bars that you often see on the top of the Web site.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,130
We've actually already seen them on booze trips his own Web site and in this section of the course we're

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,880
going to show you how to manage to create the basics of NF bar.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,620
So when we start out coding we'll actually code line by line a very basic nav bar and then later on

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,030
we're just going to be copying and pasting from the course notes and the reason for that is a lot of

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,880
the class calls that bootstrap uses for the nav bar components are really repetitive and kind of hard

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,960
to memorize.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,450
There are things such as navs space nav bar dash nav and it gets a little confusing and the naming convention

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,750
is a little bit of a poor choice specially we're trying to memorize things.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,190
So we're really just going to be copying and pasting to focus on just accessing the information or learning

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,950
what it does seeing what's available if bootstrap instead of memorizing how you could code out a bar

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,940
from scratch.

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,700
So we'll focus on just the basics for cutting it out by scratch.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,090
Everything else was going to be copy and paste from the course notes so keep that in mind as we continue.

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,290
We're also going to see briefly how to connect and HDMI LPs to javascript and Jake Query and we haven't

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,310
really discussed those two technologies yet and we're definitely not going to dive into them really

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,080
that deeply at all this lecture but we actually need them for some functionality of the nav bar such

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,210
as a dropdown menu being on the nav bar only really works when you connect the HTML page to Jake Query

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,710
and Javascript.

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,000
So again this lecture really not going to talk much about javascript.

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,360
Jake Query we're going to do that in future sections of the course but we will show you now how to connect

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,790
the nation email page to some online hosted javascript.

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,660
Jay queery codes.

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,190
All right.

26
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,050
Let's go ahead and get started by jumping straight to the editor in our browser.

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,560
OK so here you have my editor open a have an H T M L file open and I've already linked that to the latest

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,510
compile the modified C Ss of bootstrap.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,090
And here I have my body ready to go as well.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,510
So if I come over here to the project page it's link up.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,900
First let's check out how we can find more information about nav bars in the documentation of bootstrap.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,340
So if we come up here to bootstrap you can actually see there's a navigation bar already on that strip.

33
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,230
You can see it says getting started the SS component so this is what a typical nav bar looks like.

34
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,380
As you begin to explore the page and if you just come here to components will take the components page

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,370
and down here there's a nav bar section so click on that.

36
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,200
Now we can see some information about the fault nav bar and we can see that it requires javascript plugins

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,350
for certain things such as collapsing and dropdown menu which are going to be talking about later on.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,670
So here is an example of an app bar.

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,900
There is a brand.

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,800
Some links a dropdown menu some search tools link an inlet dropdown menu on the right hand side and

41
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,050
you can copy and paste this entire code if you want to take a look at all this.

42
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,990
Instead all we're going to do is start off a building up the very basics and then we're going to add

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,290
in components from the course notes.

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,370
So let's show you how to just build a very basic nav bar in your age team file and then we'll start

45
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,890
copying and pasting from the course notes and just a little bit.

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,610
All right so the very first thing we do is called the Navteq that's the NIV tag that's going to be an

47
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,090
team L that we can use to actually begin to build our NAV bar.

48
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:29,410
And what we will do here is give it the class nav bar space nav bar dash default and we'll be adding

49
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,890
a few things to that class later on to explore a couple of more things about it.

50
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:42,890
And within this Navteq ongoing to create a divide so that it take a DIV tag here and give it the class

51
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:51,980
nav bar dash header and this will actually be the header of the nav bar which is usually known as Brande's

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,260
So this is where your company's brand or the main name of the Web site is going to go all the way on

53
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,300
the left and inside of this we add in an anchor tag.

54
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,730
There's an H ref there.

55
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,620
And the reason for that is usually when you click on that link it takes you back to the home page which

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,580
is leave that as a hash tag for now.

57
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,930
Now we'll call it company.

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,710
Let's save that refresh our page and see what it looks like.

59
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,850
OK so here we see that we have company.

60
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,440
However right now it doesn't look like the actual bootstrap company.

61
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,350
So if we come back up here we can see with the nav bars if we scroll down to nav bar that brand usually

62
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,730
looks stylized.

63
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,700
It's come back here this looks just like normal the same links.

64
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:41,640
So we end up doing is inside of the anchor tag add in a class called Nev bar dash brand.

65
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,560
And hopefully you can begin to see that a lot of the classes start with the word nav bar.

66
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,080
Second get a little confusing as far as trying to memorize these things which is why reference documentation

67
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,760
is so important for the section.

68
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,960
But now if I refresh I can see it looks like a typical company call.

69
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:02,060
And as I mentioned here this Tref would usually take you to the home page you can really put in any

70
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,830
link here.

71
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,750
Just like for any other anchor tag so i can say HTP Yes.

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,620
Coal and coal say W.W. Google dot com.

73
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,480
Save that fire refresh this and click on this company.

74
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,360
Now it takes me to Google dot com right now.

75
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,850
We'll just leave this as hashtag and we'll discover later on how we can use the hash tag to link to

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
different parts of the page.

77
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,010
OK so we have a company brand over on the left now is discuss how to add in more components to the actual

78
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:39,540
navigation bar so outside of that div I'm going to create an unordered list and an ordered list is how

79
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,010
you add more things.

80
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:51,110
This nav bar and to make it look good we give it the class nav space nav bar dash nav pretty repetitive.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,190
I know probably not the best name in scheme but that's how it goes.

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,350
That's why you reference documentation for a lot of this in inciters unordered list.

83
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,140
We put in list items and then we give an anchor calls where it just like the company or brand page we

84
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,400
could give a link to another page.

85
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,100
But right now we'll just keep it simple.

86
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,160
We'll call this item 1.

87
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,550
Put another one in here or tag and we'll call this one item to and let's see what they look like.

88
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,160
Now as I refresh this page and there is item one item to their leaks so I could click on them to go

89
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,610
somewhere but right now they don't really lead anywhere because a ref is just a hash tag.

90
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,690
Now everything we've created so far is lined up to the left.

91
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,890
If I want to add components to this nav bar that are lined up to the right I just add in the class Navarrete

92
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,580
That's right.

93
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,850
And let me show you by adding in a new unordered list and putting in the class same as last time nav

94
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,490
nav bar.

95
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,160
And then I add in here now.

96
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,260
Barbash right.

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:02,680
And then we can add in some more list items saying on the right save that refresh and we can see here

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,090
we have on the right as they expand this I can see that it's kind of all the way to the right.

99
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:15,170
What I can do is put everything inside a container tag to try to balance that out a little bit so create

100
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,970
div container and this is something you'll find yourself doing often when you're working and bootstrap

101
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,060
is kind of put in these container tags.

102
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,920
To contain things save it.

103
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,050
Refresh this.

104
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,790
Now I can see this is nicely centered.

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,450
So even as I expand the page from the left and the right it's a little more centered around the middle

106
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,810
which is nice.

107
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,790
OK.

108
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,300
Make sure you don't actually wrap the entire nav bar on the container.

109
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,460
Let me show you what happens if we do that.

110
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,210
So if I wrap this entire nav you're in the container.

111
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,590
What's going to happen is the entire nav bar is going to be centered and it will stretch across the

112
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,720
entire page.

113
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,380
So that's usually not what you want you want just the components themselves to be inside the container.

114
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,110
So lets undo that.

115
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,300
Let's do this.

116
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,320
Great.

117
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,850
So saving that refreshing here.

118
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,580
Now we have the nav bar as ready to go.

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,470
So as we continue I want to briefly discuss keeping a nav bar fixed to the top of the page.

120
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,140
Even as you scroll down and in order to really show that we need to add some more material to this page.

121
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,950
So I'm going to just copy and paste this from the notes but basically it's just a container class so

122
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,600
let's copy and show it says.

123
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:34,090
It's a container class with a Jumbotron inside of it says hello Lorem some lordship some other container

124
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,910
more stuff Florham up some some.

125
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,230
So if I save this refresh my page over here I can see that I can scroll up and down but you can see

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,380
as I scroll down I eventually lose the nav bar.

127
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,490
Now a lot of times that's how you want it you want it so that you scroll down the nav bar is no longer

128
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,290
visible.

129
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,000
Other times you may want the actual nav bar to scroll along with you as you go through the page.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,290
So let me add in a little more content here.

131
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,430
We'll do one more alarm ipsum or at least two more so we can really get the effect.

132
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,640
Refresh this page so you can see I have a little more to scroll down up and down with but the nav bar

133
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,010
stays on the top and it disappears.

134
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,810
If I want the nav bar to actually be fixed the top of the page even as I scroll down I just come back

135
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:25,840
up here to where it says Nav. class nav bar space nav bar that default and I can add in this class call

136
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:34,570
right here which is nav bar dash sixt dash top and this will fix it to the top of the page no matter

137
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,260
if you scroll.

138
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,060
So right now have an activity.

139
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,350
Let's refresh this.

140
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,610
And you can see already the change is kind of obvious the margin on the bottom went away.

141
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,980
And as I scroll down the nav bar comes with me and the way to do that is just adding the bar at that

142
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,400
fixed top and other quick note on the nav bar.

143
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:57,730
Usually you will personally define the color using CSSA But if you want to stick to the basics but you

144
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:08,100
don't like the light color there's a nav bar dash dash Inv. class you can add and here and this will

145
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,560
essentially just make it dark and invert the colors.

146
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,130
OK.

147
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,890
So that's all I wanted to show right now.

148
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,280
Let's take these out.

149
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,770
Wups come back here.

150
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,400
Like I said let's delete these.

151
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,190
The fixed top and also the inverse.

152
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,510
Call save it refresh.

153
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,580
And let's also get rid of all this junk right here.

154
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,240
Those last paragraphs are coming back down.

155
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,430
Going to get rid of what we added here.

156
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,710
Just so we can focus on the nav bar right now.

157
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,810
So refreshing this.

158
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,710
I only have my nav bar.

159
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,270
OK.

160
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,900
A big thing about now is bars especially a strap and also do a bit with the grid system is when you

161
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,190
collapse it it actually forms what's known as the hamburger.

162
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,750
And if I come back up here to the components page of the Get Bitstrips site you can see as I begin to

163
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,580
collapse this down I get this little hamburger icon.

164
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,860
The reason it's called Hamburger is basically you have two buns and a burger in the one and a click

165
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,430
that.

166
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,130
Then I get the rest of the left bar right now.

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:14,750
You'll notice that even as I squeeze this browser all the way I don't get the actual collapse of the

168
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,630
burger icon I just see the actual items beginning to reformat themselves.

169
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,260
But I don't get the collapse.

170
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,140
So let's show you how you can actually get that collapse in and to do that.

171
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm going to delete a lot of a lot of what we already have here.

172
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:38,470
So let's get rid of these divs and I'm going to copy and paste from the notes and then walk through

173
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,840
that.

174
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:48,530
So it's copy and paste what's underneath the collapsible container here.

175
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,190
So I just copy and paste it a lot of stuff so let's walk through it and explain says I refreshed this

176
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,970
we can see we have this brand linked link and dropdown but the dropdown doesn't actually work yet.

177
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,720
And we'll explain why in just a second.

178
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,460
But expanding this let's actually show what I copied and paste it here.

179
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,130
And this is all from the notes.

180
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,070
So here I have my div class nav bar Hetter and we actually had that before.

181
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,780
Then I added in a button right here.

182
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:20,060
And basically we have this brand and toggle get grouped for what is essentially a bit immobile display.

183
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,480
And this is going to be the code that actually creates the hamburger Rikon.

184
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,080
So right now I have this button call and it says class nav bar toggle collapsed.

185
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:36,190
So even with this already as a part of my nav bar as I begin to drop down I can see that it becomes

186
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,610
the hamburger icon if I click on it nothing happens right now but I can see that it does collapse.

187
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,440
Now that I've added those lines of code.

188
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,150
So hamburger icon as I expand I get back the nav bar bullets explore what's actually going on here.

189
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,420
So here's the code for the hamburger icon.

190
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,130
And basically what it is it's a Spanish class.

191
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,200
It says Esser only toggle navigation.

192
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,450
And then we have these three calls for the cumbers and we can see as I collapse this I get those three

193
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,220
icon bars I can add in more here.

194
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,940
So let's make that for now.

195
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:18,690
And if I refresh this I can see actually get four icon bars in if I keep going if this add in the bunch

196
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,260
more refresh I can see him adding in more icon bars here.

197
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,880
However it's typical just to use three.

198
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,050
So let's save it with three.

199
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,690
Refresh the page and we can see you have the three that little hamburger icon.

200
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,410
OK so this is the actual code for the hamburger icon.

201
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,720
Again just using the class icon bar and then toggling of navigation.

202
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:49,330
So that's all inside this button for the button class is nav bar dash toggle space collapse and there's

203
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,200
some more information here that usually just be copying and pasting.

204
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,480
All right.

205
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,040
So that's all under the F var header.

206
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,130
And then anything inside of click collapse nav bar that collapse goes into the hamburger.

207
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,090
And basically what that means is this.

208
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:12,560
So anything any unordered list that you add in that's inside of a div with this class to collapse nav

209
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,760
bar bash collapse is going to be collapsed into hamburger.

210
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,590
And she what I mean by that is let's add in an ordered list.

211
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,690
Outside of that.

212
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,290
So I'm going to add an unordered list.

213
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,860
And just like we did last time at the very beginning we'll give it the class

214
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,910
nav bar or nav space nav bar dash nav

215
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,550
and we'll say something like Hello.

216
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,070
So let's save this.

217
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,770
And you notice Hello here no longer goes into the hamburger.

218
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,020
So as I expand this I see brands.

219
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,730
Hello.

220
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,460
Link link and then a dropdown menu.

221
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:04,200
Then as I begin to collapse this everything that was inside of this div class had collapsed nav bar

222
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,730
that collapse went into the hamburger whatever was not inside of that which in this case was this halo

223
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,090
happens to not go into the hamburger and basically details the same behavior we saw last Tyne-Wear just

224
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,390
get squeezed down but doesn't actually go into the hamburger.

225
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,040
All right.

226
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,180
So that's what that class is doing.

227
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,660
And usually you're going to put almost everything inside the collapse.

228
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,330
Now if Mark collapse unless it's really so important they don't want it to go in this hamburger class.

229
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,360
But it's really common.

230
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,180
Just put everything inside the collapse.

231
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,190
Especially for mobile viewers the last thing we need to do however to actually complete this is if we

232
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:48,350
expand back or menu here and we can't refresh this well let's save this and then refresh as we see we

233
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,110
have the two links and then the dropdown menu but the drop down menu is not working.

234
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,040
And we also noticed that when we collapse this the dropdown menu here wasn't working.

235
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,690
And that's because we actually need calls to query in javascript to make those functionalities work.

236
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,710
And the way we're going to do that is in our case we're just going to copy and paste from the notes

237
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,490
and later on we'll show you how to actually grab stuff from Jake Query.

238
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,580
So either go to code that J.Crew dot com to grab this or just copy and paste it from the notes but we're

239
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,750
going to do in our case is copy and paste this and put it at the very bottom.

240
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,120
Of our body call right here.

241
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:33,380
And what this is doing is copying and pasting a script call to Jake Query and this one is copying and

242
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,510
pasting the bootstrap Javascript.

243
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,510
And if you went back to the very first page of javascript you probably noticed that there were some

244
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:47,900
calls there that you could have also copied and pasted so if bootstrap went to download bootstrap as

245
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:54,950
we scroll down here we saw there was a modified CSSA but there was also this bootstrap Javascript.

246
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,100
So that's what the second line is right here.

247
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,020
This bootstrap javascript that's what I'm copying and pasting from this other line is code that J.

248
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,030
Queried dot com.

249
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,200
That's actually a link to Jay queried.

250
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,600
Yes which we're going to talk about much more later when we talk about Jay query and how it connects

251
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,200
to Django.

252
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,960
But right now you can just copy and paste these two lines from the notes save this and then refresh

253
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,960
our page.

254
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,860
And we should see now that the dropdown menu is actually work.

255
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,200
So here we have dropdown items.

256
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,900
And as we collapse this we see the hamburger icon I can click on it and now everything is working.

257
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,440
All right.

258
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,970
And if you want more details on how to actually add in your components the dropdown you can there check

259
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,820
the documentation which is really good.

260
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,240
Or just check out the notes and you can see here that's basically just another unordered list with the

261
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,410
class dropdown menu.

262
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,850
And then you can add in links list items there.

263
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,470
OK.

264
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Thanks a lot everybody.

265
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,230
If you have any questions feel free to post in the Q&amp;A forums.

266
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,140
I know this was a lot of stuff especially if these kind of goofy class names.

267
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,470
But I want you to really get out of this is being able to reference the documentation for nav bars and

268
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,330
know what's possible if bootstrap.

269
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,170
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
