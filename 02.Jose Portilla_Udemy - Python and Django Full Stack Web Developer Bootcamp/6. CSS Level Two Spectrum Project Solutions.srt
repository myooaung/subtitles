00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,970
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be going over an example solution to

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,480
the Spectrum project.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,410
Remember your solution may not look exactly like mine as far as sizing and color choice but the overall

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,690
ideas hopefully similar enough that you can follow along these solutions and reflect back on your own

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,500
work.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,090
Let's jump to our editor in browser to get started.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,700
OK.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,810
So here I am with my editor open.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,770
I have two files project thought CSSA and product thought HMO.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,320
They're empty right now.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,770
Here is what we're trying to recreate something that looks similar to this with our own color palette

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,980
choice and our own custom font choice.

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,940
And right now I have this project thought to.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,320
Just refreshed it so that it's clean and there's nothing there.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,890
Let's get started by working on the Tim elf.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,850
The first thing I'm going to do is just type H T.M. and we'll call the title of this project and we

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,540
also want to make sure that it's linked to our actual sheet.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,910
In our case such is called Project that the SS and that's all we have to pass since it's in the same

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,920
directory.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:17,980
And then for the body itself I'm going to give a Heading 1 and we'll call it my spectrum project and

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,740
then let's make a table.

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,890
So we'll make a table.

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,980
It's going to have one table row.

24
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,750
And if we look back at what the solution looks like remember we have one table row with essentially

25
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,820
five cells.

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:37,330
So I would call t d and i will copy and paste that for more times so that my total is five and if I

27
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:44,050
want to actually reference stuff here it might be useful to give the table a class that I can reference

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,440
later.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:52,750
So let's give it the class something like art and for the table cells let's give them each an individual

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,670
ID.

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:00,010
That way I can assign them each individual color and we may not use that class but it's just there in

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,760
case we need it later.

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,450
The idea is we will definitely use though.

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,600
So we'll give each of these our own ID

35
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,200
and we'll label this five.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,020
So let's save that come back to project that each team will refresh and I see my spectrum project.

37
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,480
But the thing is all my table cells are empty.

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,690
So let's come to CSX and assign them overall something to make sure that stuff is working.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,980
So let's give them all a background color of black.

40
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,110
And if I refresh this I won't see much.

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,380
I see essentially five little tiny cells there you may not even see them on your screen.

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,390
So what I have to do is expand the size of these.

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,540
So let's continue doing that with something like giving these table cells a height.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,000
Now let's give them a height of 200 pixels with such a colon

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,210
save that refresh.

46
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,700
And now you can see there a good height.

47
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,900
All right the next thing I want to do is actually give these table cells a with as well so let's do

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,490
that.

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,590
Let's give it something like 100 pixels that should be fine.

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,620
And then refresh over here in I can see my spectrum project is starting to look similar to what I have

51
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:12,900
here.

52
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,840
We can measure off the size of the height and the with if we want to make it larger.

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,460
So if we want to just expand this a little bit so it's a little nicer.

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,820
There we go.

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:31,180
And what I want to do also is start to grab the heading one and text the line to be Center.

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,660
Let's refresh this.

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,440
And now we're getting to really think of something that looks like closer to a spectrum project.

58
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,530
Something else we noticed here is that the table itself isn't centered.

59
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,270
So let's try to use the margin on auto to do that.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,590
So I can use that class I used earlier or I could also just call table itself since it happens to be

61
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,700
the only table there.

62
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:04,690
And we'll just call auto save that and now I have a centered margin here or the margin is the outside

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,720
the very outside of the box model.

64
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,970
So let's review what we've done.

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,520
We've been able to create our table cells.

66
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,090
We have the art class here which allows us to just grab if we go back to the page C.M. that entire table.

67
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,130
So I could have also just called Table but I wanted to be a little more specific in case we have multiple

68
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,460
tables here and use margin auto to center it and have also text the line center that heading 1.

69
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,210
So everything looks good here.

70
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,930
Now what I'm going to do is come to this coolers CO and actually grab some of these hex codes.

71
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,470
I went ahead and just grabbed a basically a random color palette and I'm going to copy and paste these

72
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,010
text codes so let's copy each of these.

73
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,170
So there's my first one there's my second one

74
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,500
third

75
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,740
fourth and let's grab the fifth one and we have to make sure each of these starts with that hash tag.

76
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,930
There we go.

77
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,660
So those are my hex colors and the way I can assign these is by calling the ID's.

78
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,150
Remember we gave each individual table cell in ID and eventually will be able to get rid of this background

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,350
color black.

80
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,430
So let's do that.

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,500
Let's go.

82
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:28,200
Hash tag 1 and we'll call the background color for it to be the very first

83
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,880
let's refresh this now we can see we beginning to override some of these the colors because if remember

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,070
about CSSA specificity.

85
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:48,170
The ID is going to be in the hierarchy or above the hierarchy of just a normal element call.

86
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,140
So it's called background color again let's keep doing this for the rest of them.

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,310
And if you want you can basically fast forward through this because I'm just repeating myself here.

88
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,820
So let's copy that excuse me

89
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,280
semi colon and we're gonna do that two more times for the for class.

90
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,480
Give it a background color

91
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:26,570
and let's do that again for five class or five Id excuse me I should have been saying Id not class.

92
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,460
And then let's paste in these colors here

93
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,730
copy and paste that color there.

94
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,100
All right.

95
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,210
So let me save that.

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,190
Refresh this.

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,390
And now I can see my spectrum project is looking pretty good.

98
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,860
I have the colors lined up and they're overwriting this tiddy call.

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,380
In fact I can just delete that save this and I'll still look the same.

100
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,440
Now I want to affect the spacing in between these if we look at Spectrum 5.

101
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,850
There's a little more spacing here in between these actual table cells.

102
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,400
So to do that what I can do is mess around with the box model and remember the important part that box

103
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,750
model is the actual border.

104
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,580
So quick way to do this would just be to get each table cell a white border.

105
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:19,260
So I'll say something like border and give them each let's say six pixel solid white border.

106
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,990
Save that and refresh.

107
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,780
In here we get the nice spacing out that I was looking for.

108
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,670
And finally I want to add my own custom font to the Heading 1.

109
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,940
So I already have Google fonts opened here and I wanted to just scroll down to a random one.

110
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,230
Let's say something that's.

111
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,100
This one looks nice is Anton.

112
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,330
So we'll add that the family selected will open it up here.

113
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:53,150
I will copy this as a link into my m l file save it come to project C Ss and copy the font family call

114
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,170
and put it under H-1.

115
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,460
So now when I refresh project I can see my spectrum project now has that new font and that's really

116
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,260
all you have to do for this project.

117
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,680
Again hopefully you have enough practice with the box model so you can play around with this.

118
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,440
You didn't have to do it with the border you could have messed around with the margin and padding as

119
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,970
well but it's really up to you.

120
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,230
There were multiple multiple solutions to getting something to look like this.

121
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,280
So do not worry if your solution did not follow mine exactly.

122
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,650
There are multiple ways to get something that looks like this.

123
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,010
If you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewney forums.

124
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,900
Hopefully at a fun time recreating something you just saw the front end and you could recreate it using

125
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,760
H TMLC SS on the back.

126
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,500
And thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
