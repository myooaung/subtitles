Hello everyone and welcome to part five control flow control flow is a fundamental aspect of any full

2
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.680
programming language and it allows us to execute code only if a certain situation or condition arises

3
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.880
and we can use it in combination of logical and comparison operators in case this is your first time

4
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.170
programming we're going to briefly go over the main concepts of control flow such as if statements l

5
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.490
statements and if statements in this lecture.

6
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.720
If you've already programmed in another language before you may actually find that more useful just

7
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.820
to reference the notes for this lecture to get the javascript syntax since a lot of these concepts are

8
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.920
the same across programming languages.

9
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.410
The only thing that's different is the actual syntax.

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.070
So let's continue on and actually discuss control flow.

11
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.000
So usually we have control flow.

12
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.770
You're going to initiate some sort of condition check that returns a boolean which is either true or

13
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.470
false.

14
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.040
And then based off those results you use control flow to execute a specific block of code.

15
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.440
Let's see the first basic example which is an if statement.

16
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.920
So in this statement the general syntax looks like this.

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.910
You say if and then some condition and that condition right there is usually some sort of comparison

18
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.070
operator or you're checking for some sort of equality.

19
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.730
So we say if this condition is true we execute some code that's inside those curly brackets.

20
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.460
So the syntax is if imprint sees the condition check and then curly brackets you're going to execute

21
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.610
some sort of code.

22
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.370
Then there's the if else statement.

23
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.240
And the main logic behind this is if some condition is true you execute some code that very first line

24
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.730
there else meaning if that condition was not true you execute some other code.

25
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.800
So here we're just checking if a condition is true.

26
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.940
We execute some code.

27
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.060
If it doesn't happen to be true than the else statement occurs and we execute some other code and then

28
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.280
we have the if else if else statements.

29
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.190
So if you want to check for multiple conditions not just one you can add an ELSE IF statement.

30
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.680
So the syntax looks like this.

31
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.550
We say if you check for some condition number one you execute some code then you can have an else if

32
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.500
to check for another possible condition.

33
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.720
And then you see some other code if condition want condition to.

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.880
Don't bring up true.

35
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.230
So neither of those conditions happened to be true.

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.950
Then finally the else block executes some backup code OK.

37
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.640
Let's actually code through some examples.

38
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.910
I was just general syntax in a very high level overview but I think if we could through some examples

39
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.400
I'll make it a lot clear.

40
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.640
I'm going to open up my editor in my browser now.

41
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.810
All right so here you have an html file open and javascript file open there both blank in my browser

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.330
is connected right now to the h l file.

43
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.420
So let's actually fill in the sage T.M. file and then also connected to the script.

44
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.380
So I'm going to write scripts.

45
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.770
I can get rid of that and just say the source is my script doc.

46
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.070
Yes.

47
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.930
OK.

48
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.760
And let's make sure this is working by adding some sort of alert here that says hello.

49
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.890
Save this I'll refresh my page and I get the alert.

50
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.420
Hello.

51
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.850
Great.

52
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.980
So we're connected to the job script.

53
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.870
That way if I want to run more than one line of javascript code all I have to do is type it to the database

54
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.690
file and then refresh my browser over here.

55
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.090
And let's actually open up the console here as well so I won't say inspect it the console and now I

56
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.370
can see output so to begin seeing an if statement in action.

57
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.010
We're going to start by creating two variables.

58
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.110
First we'll create hot and we'll say it's false and then create another variable called Temp.

59
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.920
And I will say it's equal to 60 and we're going to do it just apply some very simple logic code so we

60
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.630
say if some condition is true then we execute code inside of those curly brackets.

61
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.480
So for example we have these two variables hot contemp and imagine that hot starts off as false and

62
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.100
temperature or temp is some number in degrees.

63
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.380
And if the temp is greater than 80 we want to assign hot physical to true.

64
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.550
So if it's more than 80 degrees I'm going to say that it hot is not true.

65
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.310
So what does this look like.

66
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.710
Well I can say if I could actually enter here and Adam will automatically fill in that sort of syntax

67
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.710
scaffolding.

68
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.850
And the most basic if statement is just if true.

69
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:38.620
So let's run this one first and don't say if true I will log Iran refresh the page here and it says

70
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.150
Iran.

71
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.350
So that's the very most basic if statement if true.

72
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.210
And then this always runs because it will always be true.

73
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.890
Let's show you something a little more realistic using those two variables.

74
00:04:48.990 --> 00:05:00.970
I'll say if the temperature is greater than 80 logged temp is greater than 80.

75
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.110
We'll save that refresher page and we actually don't get any output which makes sense because remember

76
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.700
temperature is 60 but now let's do this.

77
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.690
If temperature is greater than 80 I will say hot is equal to true.

78
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.510
And the secondly the first time we show this.

79
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.210
But this is how you can reassign a variable in Javascript.

80
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.600
So right now I initiated it with the V.A. our call.

81
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.550
So this is for initialising that variable.

82
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.910
But if I just want to reassign it I have to make sure it's reassigned to the same data type here.

83
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.020
So it's also a boolean.

84
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:44.560
But in this case I'm reassigning it to true and then I'm going to log out.

85
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.800
So let's see what happens if I refresh this page I get false.

86
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.050
So what actually happened here will have my variable is equal to false temperature 60.

87
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.930
I said if the temperature is greater than 80 re-assign hot to be true.

88
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.110
And then finally output hot since temperature was not greater than 80.

89
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.060
This re-assignment never occurred.

90
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.850
Meaning hot is always going to stay false.

91
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.950
Now let's try this again but set the temperature to be higher than 80 100.

92
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.540
So take a moment and think what we'll see when actually refreshes page will it be false or true.

93
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.850
To refresh and it's true.

94
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.680
Which makes sense because the temperature is now 100.

95
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.120
Meaning if the temperature is greater than 80 100 greater than 80 re-assign hot to be equal to true

96
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.590
and then log whatever hot currently is and hot was reassigned to true.

97
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.490
And that's the very basics of an IF statement.

98
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.470
Now let's imagine that we want to execute another block that occurs if the if statement is false.

99
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.130
Well in that case we can use an L statement to do this let's add that in.

100
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.740
So I'm going to say just console log up here.

101
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.160
Console log on outside.

102
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.830
So if the temperature is greater than 80 I'm going to say it's hot outside else and you can see that

103
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:08.160
Adams helped me out here so I'll just take to help else I will log.

104
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:18.480
It's not very hot today and you might be wondering hey why doesn't else actually have this parentheses

105
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.440
check here.

106
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.850
And the reason is because else doesn't need to check for any specific condition.

107
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.700
You remember else is going to occur only if all the conditions above it never were activated they were

108
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.730
never true.

109
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.830
OK.

110
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.310
So let's try this again.

111
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:39.650
I'm going to delete this line right here and I'm going to set temperature equal to 100.

112
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.690
So let's think what's going to log if I set temperature equal to 100 or refreshed this page and it says

113
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.430
it's hot outside.

114
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.640
So that makes sense if the temperature is greater than 80 log it's hot outside.

115
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.720
Now let's set the temperature to be 50 degrees.

116
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.360
What do we think is going to happen when I refreshed.

117
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.760
Page.

118
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.050
It's not very hot today.

119
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:05.880
That makes sense because this if statement was never triggered as true meaning this statement is going

120
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.360
to occur.

121
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.480
It's not very hot today.

122
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.670
That's the basics of it.

123
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.170
If else statement.

124
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.490
OK so we saw how if statements work how if else statements work.

125
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.460
Now let's see how else if statements work.

126
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.980
So again if we want to check more conditions in just one single condition and its opposite we can add

127
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.730
ELSE IF statements to check for multiple specific conditions.

128
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.490
And the way it looks is like this and you can see that Adam text editor will actually help us out and

129
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.710
we see else if all hit enter and it makes sense that there's Prince he's here now because I want to

130
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.680
check if another certain condition is true.

131
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.310
So let's actually check for multiple temperature changes.

132
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.010
So right now if the temperature is greater than 80 degrees I say it's hot outside.

133
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.170
Now let's imagine that it's just pretty average or nice outside.

134
00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:06.440
So the temperature is less than or equal to 80 and the temperature is greater than or equal to 50 degrees.

135
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:15.630
So somewhere in between 50 and 80 I'll say average temp outside.

136
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.400
Now let's check for another condition.

137
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.870
Again we'll call it else if.

138
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:32.630
And inside the Sprint CS I'll put in another condition something like temperature less than 50 and temperature

139
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:44.670
greater than or equal to 32 degrees alog that it's pretty cold out.

140
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:53.010
And then finally I'm going to one else statement and for the sell statement I'm going to say it is very

141
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:53.960
cold out.

142
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:59.460
And the reason for that is because I know the else statement is only going to occur if the temperature

143
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.050
is not greater than 80.

144
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:07.350
It's not in between 1850 and it's not in between 32 and 50 meaning statements only going to occur when

145
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.950
the temperature is less than 32 degrees.

146
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.510
So let's try this out and make sure we got everything right.

147
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.280
Going to refresh my page here.

148
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.800
Member are starting temperatures 50 degrees.

149
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:23.120
So if I refresh this I would expect it to say average temp outside because we fall right here.

150
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.720
Temperatures equal to 50 let's make average temp outside go again with something like 70 degrees.

151
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.530
Save this refresh and there it is again.

152
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.990
Average temperature outside.

153
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:40.620
Let's make it say it's pretty cold out so I'll say it's 40 degrees outside refresh and it says it's

154
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.620
pretty cold out.

155
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:51.360
And let's make it something like 10 degrees by refresh this page then it says it is very cold out meaning

156
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.330
none of these conditions were actually activated.

157
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.540
So the statement was activated.

158
00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:01.480
OK let's do one final example of comparison operators.

159
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.700
So I will delete all this.

160
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:07.290
And let's start with kind of a store example.

161
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:16.310
So make a variable called and set it equal to 10 flips variable called him set it to 10 and then I'll

162
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.430
create another variable called cheese and said it's equal to 10

163
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.500
and we'll discuss semi-colons later on.

164
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.560
You don't actually need those there so don't worry about having semi-colons everywhere right now.

165
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.740
But let's say we want to report back to headquarters what are ham and cheese sales where we run a little

166
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.540
store that sells ham and cheese.

167
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:48.660
So I'm going to make my variable report equal to a string that's just blank right now.

168
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:57.460
And then I'll start off with my first statement and I will say if the sales of him is greater than 10

169
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:08.160
greater than or equal to 10 and cheese is greater than or equal to 10 I'm going to say my report is

170
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.700
equal to strong sales of both ham and cheese.

171
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.660
Then let's have an ELSE IF statement and the statement is going to say.

172
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:38.600
Else if ham is equal to zero and cheese is equal to zero My report is going to be equal to nothing sold.

173
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:46.230
And let's keep things simple with an L statement and I will say report is equal to.

174
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:55.970
We had some sales of items and you can keep adding elses statements for things like if you only sold

175
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:59.640
ham or you only sold cheese that day what would it look like.

176
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:06.770
But at the end of this outside of these statements I'm going to say log or cancel that log and I will

177
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.040
log my report.

178
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.540
So it's refreshing and see what we get.

179
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.350
So it says Strong sales of both ham and cheese that makes sense.

180
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:21.200
Ham and cheese are both 10 right now let's say Ham is one will refresh this page.

181
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.230
We had some sales of items that make sense.

182
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.430
Let's change it so that nothing was sold is equal to zero and cheeses equal to zero.

183
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.570
Refresh our page and it says nothing sold.

184
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.790
OK great.

185
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:40.360
Hopefully now you have a general understanding of if statements if else statements and if statements

186
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.650
in javascript.

187
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.510
Coming up next we're going to begin discussing loops with the while loop.

188
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.260
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
