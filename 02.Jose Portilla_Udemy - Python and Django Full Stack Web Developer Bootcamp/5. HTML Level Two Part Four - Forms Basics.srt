00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,870
Hello everyone and welcome to part four forms.

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:14,310
Basics creating forms and each Malle really revolves around the idea of the in that tag.

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,940
And throughout this lecture and the subsequent lectures we're going to be looking at various types of

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,590
inputs for forms and how we can use them to accept user input.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:29,100
So if you've ever visited a Web site where you had to input your email password into the form online

6
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:35,990
and then click submit that's an HMO form forms are actually going to be a key component of Django later

7
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,420
on.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,190
But in order to really understand how to use them with Django you need to fully understand them with

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,820
just pure HCM.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,630
Let's get started by looking at some basic examples.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,780
Go jump to the text editor now.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,140
All right so I'm a text editor open and I have my browser open.

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,280
And before we get started I just wanted to show you the two reference links you can actually find inside

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,350
the part for forms basics HTML file that correspond with this lecture.

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,300
One of them goes to the W3 schools where it just talks about input types.

16
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:10,300
So here you can see html input types and the basic form of an input tag is the input tag.

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,090
And then we specify the type and noticed you can have text types.

18
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,100
You can have password types submit types so has a little submit button.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,970
And later on we're going to really be exploring a bunch of other types such as radio buttons dropdown

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,510
checkboxes etc..

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,880
So that's the idea behind this.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,120
And if you want a more technical reference you can always check out the muzzle Developer Network web

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,970
site which is also linked in that aist him l file.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,730
So let's get started by just kind of walking through this.

25
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,730
So basically what we do is somewhere in the body you start your form.

26
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,990
So before we actually get started I'm going to make two headings I'll say something like.

27
00:01:48,020 --> 00:02:00,360
Log in and then we'll say heading to please input your we'll say e-mail and password.

28
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,210
Save that refresh over here and then we see log in please and put your email and password.

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,900
Let me just zoom in a little bit on that.

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,110
So it's a little clear.

31
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,630
And here we have our two headings later on we're actually going to learn how to do civically label inputs

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,920
but right now just keeping it basic let's simulate a loggin site.

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,980
First we have to do then is call a form and if you want we can actually call form like this.

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,550
And then we have our form or opening tag and our closing tag and we see we have a class which will make

35
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,240
a lot more sense when we talk about C Ss so you can just ignore that for now.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,820
We have an action which is going to be later on use to actually call an action the Peniel kind of for

37
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,540
me using.

38
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,150
And then we have a method which is post right now we actually don't need to worry about any of these

39
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,670
things.

40
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,600
We're going to talk a lot more about them.

41
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,070
But basically the action is later on we're going to be sending the data and then the method of has to

42
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,740
do a get post a DTP method.

43
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,690
Right now we don't know enough to really use any of these so we're just going to delete all that and

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,710
just have form save that.

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,450
Now let's stick our two headings inside of this form tag.

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,230
And as I mentioned the main part of creating a form really revolves around those input tags.

47
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:24,240
So we're going to do is call an input tag and then we notice that as we call input and then enter Adam

48
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,630
text editor will automatically say type equals name equals and value equals and so let's break this

49
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:37,560
down type is where you actually clarify what type of input you want and by default it's type text.

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,610
And that's something we're going to be exploring a lot through this lecture in the next couple of lectures.

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,330
Different types of inputs.

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,660
Then you have the name of the input and the name of the input is just the name of scientists input so

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,370
you can call it on later in some other files.

54
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,600
And then we have the value and the value is the actual default value that's placed inside there.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,160
So let's explore this right now.

56
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,720
Let's start off with one of the most common types of inputs which is an e-mail type and an email type

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,730
basically just checks to make sure you have an email in there will give this a name and we'll call it

58
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,560
user e-mail.

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,760
So let's save this and refresh.

60
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,880
And now we noticed that we have an actual text box here.

61
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,280
And what's different between a normal type equals text and a type equals e-mail.

62
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,560
Is that the e-mail type is going to make sure later on when we actually click submit that we have an

63
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,340
at gmail dot com or at yahoo dot com.

64
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,320
Or an actual e-mail in there.

65
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,990
So for a normal text type input you could just put in user and it would work.

66
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,460
But for a type e-mail it's going to make sure that you actually have X and then a dot com or a dot in

67
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:48,790
there.

68
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,670
So maybe you've been using a web site you actually mistype your e-mail and a little pop up will say

69
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,160
Please enter a valid email address.

70
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,820
This is the type of input they're using to automatically do that.

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,340
And basically all this work is being handled behind the scenes by your browser just specifying the type

72
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,040
will basically take care of that for you.

73
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,690
And that's really the big part of the beauty of H-2A mail.

74
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,810
It works across browsers that way at least for the most common types and it does create an other input

75
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,780
or our password.

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,000
So we'll say this type is password we'll save it refresh.

77
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,570
And I noticed that we had two boxes.

78
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,790
This was the email and this was the password.

79
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,790
Well look what happens when I start typing in my password here.

80
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,330
It's actually hidden from me and that sort of default behavior is happening because I specified this

81
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,160
type to be password instead of just the default text or an email type.

82
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,390
And these are the kind of types right now that you don't need to worry about memorizing them too much.

83
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,280
You always have those reference links for the different input types that are in the four forms basic's

84
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,980
that each team metafile those two links I explained earlier.

85
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,460
But eventually you're going to be using these inputs so often that you're going to just remember off

86
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,410
the top of your head.

87
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,990
Oh I need an e-mail type in a password type etc..

88
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,930
Right now don't worry too much about memorizing all of these.

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
And let's go ahead and get this input and Main.

90
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,730
So we will call this just a very simple name something like password and that name can later be used

91
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,230
to actually reference this.

92
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,150
So again you don't see anything changed here on the form.

93
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,510
And finally let's discuss this value.

94
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,080
So the value is if you want a value to be pre-filled there.

95
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:40,660
So let's say email here and we'll say password please save that refresh and notice her the value.

96
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,830
It basically has a corresponding default here.

97
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,530
So e-mail here password please.

98
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,630
But notice that right now this password please just shows up as a blank password.

99
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,260
So it does make a whole lot of sense to put a value here into that.

100
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,960
And later on we'll show you some better ways of actually showing some default text there.

101
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,570
But that's what you can use if you want it to be pre-filled.

102
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,690
And then finally one of the most important input types is the submitters and we don't need to give that

103
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,850
a name or value but we just refresh and here we have a little submit button.

104
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,330
And this is a little submit.

105
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
But look what happens here.

106
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,910
It says Please include an ad in the e-mail address e-mail here is missing.

107
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:35,280
So let's actually give this type submit a value I will type and submit their refresh and notice.

108
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,860
Now the submit button actually has a submit their in-call this whatever you want like please click me

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,800
save that refresh Quick me.

110
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,160
All right.

111
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,800
So let's explain what's going on here.

112
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,390
There's only three lines but there's actually a lot of moving parts.

113
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,580
So if we look at this code.

114
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,070
Everything here is wrapped in form tags.

115
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,180
And that's actually really important.

116
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,360
That allows them to know that we were talking about a complete form here and we have three input types.

117
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,180
The first one is e-mail.

118
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,020
The second one is password and the third one is submit and the key idea I want you to just take in right

119
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,510
now is not how everything is linked and working together but really the fact that you can call an input

120
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,250
tag specify type give it a name to reference it later on.

121
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,310
Right now that doesn't make a whole lot of sense because they haven't really used the name yet.

122
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,600
And then de-value which has some default value for its Ehab.

123
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,280
Sometimes that default value doesn't make two cents such as wifi password type.

124
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,970
Otherwise you just see a bunch of dots there or Asterix and then you sometimes really do need a value

125
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,760
such as with the submit button where it just looks like an ugly button if you don't have the value there.

126
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,360
All right.

127
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:52,140
So this right now the submit button is linked to these two inputs because if I click click me it will

128
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,830
actually work so I'll say something like please include it at the e-mail address.

129
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,160
E-mail here is missing at.

130
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,310
And that's why we want to specify something like type e-mail.

131
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:09,900
So now if I say hello at yahoo dot com and then put in a password click me.

132
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,930
Looks like it's ok.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,850
Nothing's actually happening here it's just clearing it.

134
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,420
Every time we click Submit We'll get into that sort of functionality later.

135
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,870
I do actually grab information from those input cells.

136
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,850
But right now the very basics is you coliform tag.

137
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,000
You call these input tags you specify type.

138
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,280
You can give it a name which we'll use later on and you can give it a default value.

139
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,580
Sometimes you're not going to really want a default value such as the password.

140
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,510
Sometimes you really will submit button.

141
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,190
All right let's just walk through just a couple more examples some maybe a little sillier examples of

142
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:50,790
different types of inputs and a really fun one is the choose color input and it's just a color input

143
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,470
so let me show you what that looks like.

144
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,370
I'll say something like.

145
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:04,110
Choose color as heading 1 and heading 2 is going to be click on button and then I'm going specifying

146
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,020
input or enter there and the type is going to be a color.

147
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,320
So let's say that refreshed this page and notice it says choose a color.

148
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,350
Click on button and this is a default color picker.

149
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,880
So if I click on this button right here I get this little pop up that allows me to actually pick a color.

150
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,790
So for instance I can pick this purple color.

151
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,350
OK.

152
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,480
Now we can see a change to purple or we pick up bright red.

153
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,300
It OK.

154
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,920
And I can see it changed to bright red.

155
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:38,790
So all of that functionality is built straight into T.M. just by specifying the type is equal to color

156
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,580
and that's sort of a fun example.

157
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,040
Now let's show one more which is essentially the default.

158
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,600
So I'm going to say heading to will say enter some text.

159
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,900
And then we'll have some input.

160
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,760
And we're just going to leave it as the type the text which is the default and I say something like

161
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,480
X goes here we'll save it.

162
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,350
Refresh Elsy text goes here which means I can type just random text here.

163
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,240
And it works just fine.

164
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,390
Let's zoom in a little bit and you can see that there's really no limit on how much text that can right.

165
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,260
Later on we learn about things like a text area type which allows us to have a larger section or like

166
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,770
paragraphs of text but those are just a few of the input types that you can use as you begin to create

167
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,070
form.

168
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,810
So just the very basics here that we've covered really all I want you to be aware of is that there is

169
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,080
a foreign tag there are input tags and you can specify the type of input and certain types of input

170
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,150
will have restrictions such as the email type will have the restriction that you need an at symbol when

171
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,440
you actually click that submit.

172
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,600
But that's really all I want you to get out of this lecture for right now in the next lecture we're

173
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,910
going to be talking about two more things we'll talk about labels and how they work when you can actually

174
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,400
label one of these inputs.

175
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,570
And then secondly we're going to go back and talk about that form with the action and method arguments.

176
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,360
Remember that when I first typed in form and it had autocomplete it had these calls right here an action

177
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,130
and a method and the next you're going to be discussing those and seeing what happens when we combine

178
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,150
that with some sort of Submit button.

179
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,750
OK.

180
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,760
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
