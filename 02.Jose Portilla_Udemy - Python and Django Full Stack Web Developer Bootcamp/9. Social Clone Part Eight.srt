00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,860
Welcome to partake of the social cloning project now we're going to do is connect the views that we've

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,120
already created in groups to some murals.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,910
We still have two more views to create in the group's application but we'll worry about those later

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,510
on.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,770
Right now we're just going to connect the user created to some Urals and we're also going to register

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,650
the group models that we previously created to the admin that PI file.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,830
Let's hop over to Adam and get started.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,070
All right.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,700
Here I am at the text editor I have the model's views and the various templates are created.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,750
What I want to do now is go to your not pie.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:43,500
This is the groups your URLs up py file and here's where I'm going to basically connect all the views

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,730
I just made.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:53,250
So we will say from Django figuration your Elle's import your L and then I'm also going to save from

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,130
Daut import views to actually access the views we just created specifically those class based views

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,580
and then we'll get this app name group so we can reference it later on with your template tagging.

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,880
Now I'm going to make a list of your all patterns and we're going to say the first pattern is just going

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,180
to be the very basic groups page and that will be the list groups page.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,090
So we'll actually just call it carot dollar sign.

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,030
So when someone actually goes to your Web site dot com slash groups it shows you the list of all the

20
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:34,150
groups so say views list groups start as a view and then we'll give the name we can just keep it all

21
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:43,290
and then we're also going to say your L and for this one this is going to be the Create page so you

22
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:50,380
can either call it slash create or call it slash new and then we're going to say views and that will

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,150
be the create group as a view.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,730
And then we'll see name is create

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,900
it will create in other Euro function this is going to be for the actual detail view and it is going

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,980
to be a little more complicated.

27
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,280
We're going to do is say PPOs slash and slash and then this will actually be the group and we're going

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,760
to use regular expressions to plug in the slug there.

29
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,270
So it goes.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:22,880
Question mark capital P and then open tag close tag with slug.

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,940
And then in brackets here we'll say minus backslash.

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,780
There'll be you know we'll say plus And after all of that forward slash dollar sign and Bisco it's just

33
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:41,160
going to say post in and then it's going to slug ify the actual group name and then that will lead to

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,280
the actual single group there.

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:53,250
So there will be views dots and we called that single group will say as a view and we'll give the name

36
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,370
and collapses this we get a little more room which is called This single and save we still have two

37
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,300
more Uriel's and two more views to make about Leni leaving and joining groups.

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,900
But right now we don't really worry about them we'll take care of that when we actually create those

39
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,030
views blessing.

40
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,430
I want to do in this particular lecture is assigned the admin file for the models created so remember

41
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,500
previously we created the group model as well as the group member model.

42
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,860
So let's set that up in our admin that pie going to open that up and then go to Evan that pie from jingo.

43
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,290
And then I also want to say from datt import models.

44
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:37,750
So I want to register these models with the abdomen and I will say Adam in site thought register and

45
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:45,130
then I just passen models group and then the other thing I want to do is a little special with a tabular

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:52,090
inline and the inline class that we're going to be using basically allows us to utilize the admin interface

47
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,790
and or Gengel Web site with the ability to edit models on the same page as the parent model.

48
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,620
So our group member basically has a bit of a parent model with group and what we can do is we can use

49
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,710
a tabular inline class so that when we visit the admin page I can click on group and then see the group

50
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,440
members and edit those as well.

51
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,840
So let's see how we can do that.

52
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:20,420
All I need to do is say class group member and then I'm going to say in line then I call in tabular

53
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:29,180
in line and then I just do the assignment of model is equal to models group member and then I don't

54
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:35,720
actually have to register it because now the group member model is in line here and we'll see what that

55
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,280
looks like with more detail when we actually it is the Adamant site and that's all we're going to do

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,090
for this lecture.

57
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,350
Just connecting the views we've previously created in our Urals the py file which you can reference

58
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,590
in the notes as well as set up our registration for the models so the group model is just typical registration.

59
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,730
And then here we did a type inline which you're going to see later on when we actually visit the admin

60
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,380
page.

61
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,160
OK.

62
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,880
So much shorter than the last one.

63
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,340
So take your time with this.

64
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,760
Definitely a lot of stuff to type out and you can always copy and paste from the notes.

65
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,590
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
