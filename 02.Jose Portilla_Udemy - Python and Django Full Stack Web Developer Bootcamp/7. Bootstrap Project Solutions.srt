00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,450
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture will be cutting through the solutions for the coffee

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,070
lover bootstrap project that I explained in the previous lecture.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,890
Let's show her editor and browser and get started.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,300
OK so here you have my browser open just a quick reminder we're going to do is create this Jumbotron

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,640
add some content to the Jumbotron.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,960
Have these two paragraphs here.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,180
These large sums add the pictures the coffees the thumbnail class and then make sure that we have the

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,960
nav bar.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,700
And then if I click on the sign and it takes me to the form we also want to make sure that we get the

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,880
grid system right.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,540
Or actually adding these thumbnails of the coffee pictures and we have the links to these coffee pictures

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,710
right here on these links right here.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,180
So one two three takes it to images of coffee.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,010
OK let's get started.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,990
All right so I have my editor here open with my browser behind it.

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,990
I've opened up a new project thirty's Tamil file so I'm going to just link to it now.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,260
So I've copied its full path and I'm going to paste it here into my browser.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,820
So right now it's blank.

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,260
Let's add in CMH T.M. code.

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,380
It's called the title of it Project.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,100
And let's also add the link.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,430
We're going to need for bootstrap itself.

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,400
So I'm just going to copy and paste that from the Web site already have it open on another window on

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,420
another screen so I save that and then let's add an just the heading here to make sure things working

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,510
well stay connected.

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,430
Refresh over here and I can see I'm connected.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,350
Great.

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,290
So the first thing I want to take care of is probably the nav bar.

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,610
So we know that's going to be just here on top of the page all we have to do for that is add an NAV.

30
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:52,710
And remember we have a class here and it's going to be nav bar and I'm going to also add an nav bar

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,170
dot or dash Inv. which is going to allow us to have that darker color here refreshed that I can say

32
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,230
I have my nav bar Inv. doesn't have anything inside of it yet so let's add in those things.

33
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,600
In our case it's just one other item.

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:20,060
So we'll end up doing is putting an unordered list in there and we can give it the class nav bar dash

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,780
Nev..

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,310
And before that actually Nev. space for that.

37
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:33,560
And then the list item I want to here is an anchor tag with an H reference of my Sign-Up page and I've

38
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,090
called my Sign-Up page and I'm working right now.

39
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:44,410
New underscore Sign-Up thought HTL and this is going to say seinen.

40
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,500
Let's save that refresh.

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,660
Now I can see here I have seinen but notice here I also have this welcome.

42
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,450
So let's add that in as well.

43
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,280
And that's going to be a brand.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,300
So let's put that in.

45
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:07,620
Which means it's going to be underneath the nav tag or create a div and this one takes nav bar dash

46
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,490
header.

47
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,450
And again I don't expect you to memorize these.

48
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,220
Just be able to reference the documentation for what you need and then we'll put an anchor tag here.

49
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,360
The class that's going to have

50
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:31,510
is the nav bar brand and the ATRA if we wanted to have just the hash tag and we'll say something like

51
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,810
welcome let's refresh make sure it got in there and there's our welcome sign in if I click sign in it

52
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,630
takes me to the new Sign-Up.

53
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,780
All right.

54
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,260
Looks like a nav bar is working as we want it to work.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
We come back here at the bootstrap project.

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,710
It's a little bigger here than what we have here.

57
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,960
That that's actually because I'm zoomed in on this page.

58
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,640
Suffice zoom in on this page will get the same size.

59
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,190
So you can see here I have the little plus thing if I just actually reset the default.

60
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,260
I'll get the same size that I have on the screen.

61
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,810
OK so now bars taken care of if I click sign then it takes me to that and you sign up page.

62
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,180
Let's actually just copy and paste this code that we have so far and put it on the news sign up page.

63
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,630
In fact I'm going to copy this entire page.

64
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:25,130
Put it on my news sign up HTL page and then instead of taking it to sign in I'm going to change this

65
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:34,710
to landing page and then have it take me to the original HMO which is new underscore project.

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,130
We'll save that refresh over here.

67
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,730
And now I have this link to the landing page on my sign up page and the note kicks in takes it to the

68
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,820
landing page to see how it's changing it back and forth.

69
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,260
OK.

70
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,150
Great.

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,670
So let's come back to our main new project buddy Tim Page.

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,950
Check out the bootstrap project.

73
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,930
We still need to add and this Jumbotron.

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,660
So let's go ahead and do that.

75
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:05,460
First thing I want to do is put it all in a container so I have that deal with the container class and

76
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,010
then I'll end up doing is putting in the Jumbotron here.

77
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,790
So say Divx put in the jumbotron

78
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,060
and then we'll say H-1 coffee lover projects

79
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,910
and then let's just add in some paragraphs of lordship some here just so we have a little bit of content

80
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,480
on the page.

81
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,150
We'll save that refresh our project and we can see here we have coffee lover project Lorem some larm

82
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,370
some.

83
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,470
So we come back to a bootstrap project we've created a general landing page for Jumbotron.

84
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:50,520
We created an avatar on the page at least the other ASML we added two paragraphs and Lord of the Jumbotron.

85
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,440
And next we used a grid system to add in the thumbnail pictures of coffee and we have all those links

86
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,790
right here one two three four five six.

87
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,210
So coming back down I'm going to need to add in those pictures.

88
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,570
So how do actually do that.

89
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,000
Well since I want to take advantage of the grid system for the resizing of that I want to make sure

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,680
that it's in a container and then in a row.

91
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,010
So create a new div have it be container.

92
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
I could have also just put it in here in this container but sometimes it's nice to separate out your

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,040
code this way.

94
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:31,760
Put heading 2 and have it say pictures of coffee and then all manually code out the first actual row

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,210
and then we'll just copy and paste for the rest of them.

96
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,750
So the next thing I want is the row class and then here I'll make another div

97
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,540
and let's put this all in one line I remember.

98
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,920
I want it to be at least three columns of pictures across on the largest setting.

99
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,370
So if I expand this I see three pictures across the largest setting and on the smallest setting it should

100
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,510
just be two pictures.

101
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:07,000
So you can see the pictures actually get smaller to adjust for that as I go on so expanding this again.

102
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,010
Three and at the smallest it's going to be too.

103
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,130
No matter how small it gets.

104
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,660
It's always two pictures across.

105
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,110
No matter how big it gets it's always three pictures across which means I want something like this.

106
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,730
I won't call on large.

107
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:29,250
I want each picture to take up four units out of those 12 units because four times three is 12.

108
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,890
And then at the very smallest call extra small.

109
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,940
I wanted to take six units so six times two is 12.

110
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,990
And then the next thing I want to do is add in the thumbnail class and the thumbnail class allows us

111
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,880
to actually make these pictures of the thumbnails and let's explore what that looks like in the documentation

112
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
coming to get bootstrapped.

113
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,060
Com I can click on the components and over here on the right hand side I'll see and look down that there

114
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,890
is thumbnails.

115
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,750
So clicking on that I see I can extend this Tripps grid system with the thumbnail component to easily

116
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,530
display grids of images videos text and more.

117
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,710
And this is kind of going to look like almost like Pinterest style photos and they show you an example

118
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,930
here of what these actually look like.

119
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,910
But the main thing to notice is that all we have to do is say class thumbnail and what thumbnail allows

120
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,780
you to do is actually expand the call to the class on the outside.

121
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,940
So by default these tropes thumbnails are designed to showcase linked images with some minimal required

122
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,800
markup and then you can also put in custom content which we won't be doing here but you can see that

123
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,950
I could even add in this little heading some paragraphs statements and some buttons as well.

124
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,930
So those are two examples of what thumbnails look like.

125
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,170
Basically all you had to do was add in the thumbnail class.

126
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,970
So coming back to our project we're going to add in here a thumbnail and then we're going to add an

127
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:00,720
image tag right here and we want to make sure that our source matches up to the coffee picture and all

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,640
those coffee picture sources are available to here on the Bitstrips she can click on one of them and

129
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll take you to this link right here so I can just copy and paste this link.

130
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,510
And then put it as the source of my image.

131
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,700
Save this and then if I refresh my project I can begin to see the first picture of my coffee.

132
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,840
So now instead of just repeating those steps over and over again I'm going to copy and paste all these

133
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,560
from the solutions.

134
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,040
It's basically just duplicate.

135
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,990
Over and over again.

136
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:39,020
So I copy and paste these Let's shift tab over and I can see here I have everything the same.

137
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:46,330
Just linking two different images that I have on the solutions so let's save that refresh over here

138
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,100
and I can say I have my pictures of coffee three across three at cross.

139
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,860
Everything's looking good.

140
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,420
OK.

141
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,370
Now that's actually all I really needed for the project itself as far as the main sign up page.

142
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,750
Delivering a check now is if I begin to decrease this it turns into two columns which we see it eventually

143
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,440
that's great even as it gets smaller states too.

144
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,410
Now I just need to fix the sign up page which is currently blank right now.

145
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,570
So let's do that.

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,850
Let me click open my new sign up page which is right here.

147
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,780
New underscore sign up each T.M..

148
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,450
It only has NEVER right now so we need to add in the forms.

149
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,430
If we take a look at what the solutions looked like.

150
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,790
So coming back here clicking on seinen I can see there was actually a large Jumbotron saying to log

151
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,580
in and email password.

152
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,570
So let's add that in to our sign up page.

153
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,980
It's going to come outside of this.

154
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:47,100
Now I've been going to say whoops div put in a container.

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Another day with the Jumbotron itself and then I'm going to just put it heading on log in and then the

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,290
paragraph is going to say Enter your email and password.

157
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,310
So let's save that.

158
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,850
Make sure it actually registered a far site refresh.

159
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,180
Great.

160
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,640
So there's a log in and three email and password.

161
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,780
Now it's time to just add in the form Selsey form and there's an action here in this study.

162
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,070
Tim L. We really don't need to worry about any action because we're not actually going to lead anywhere

163
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,820
and we don't need to worry about the method.

164
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,860
If we wanted this to lead somewhere else to another page and the back end we could have filled that

165
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,180
in.

166
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,880
But we don't need to worry about that.

167
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,780
The class however we do need to worry about.

168
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:44,520
So we'll say form that group member that's the class we've been working with for bootstrap forms.

169
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:56,010
And then I want to add in a label and an input first one is going to be my email and put.

170
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:05,030
And we're going to give this class formed dash control member the two main classes we were working with

171
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,000
and we were working with inputs and forms.

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,900
It was Forum group and forum control and then the label I want for this is email and I want to make

173
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:21,540
sure this has a name so we'll give it a name user E-M for user email and make sure we assign it the

174
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,900
label user.

175
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,420
E-M now we don't need actually give it a value.

176
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:36,460
Instead let's give it a placeholder and we'll say email just looks a little nicer.

177
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Let's save that.

178
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,400
Make sure it worked well refresh.

179
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:39,960
Great.

180
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,720
Here's our email but notice it's going all the way across.

181
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:49,200
It's actually not in a container class which means I need to come back here and either put it back into

182
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,850
this original container or create a new container.

183
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,340
It's up to you depending how you want to organize your code.

184
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,290
But I'll just put it in a new container.

185
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:06,000
Well scrap this form put in that new container refresh and here we have it in a nice container.

186
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,300
OK so we have our e-mail looking nice the container.

187
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:16,150
Let's come back up here and actually add in to our form the password the checkbox and the submit button.

188
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:23,370
So this will look really similar for the password so I can actually just copy this pasted in here and

189
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,590
change the things I need to change.

190
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:32,730
So for instance I want to change the actual label to say password and also change for instead of user

191
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:41,760
E-M I'll say user pass which means I need to change this name over here to user pass and to change the

192
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,200
type to password.

193
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,260
I'll keep class form control the same and then placeholder.

194
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,260
We're going to say password here.

195
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's save this refresh make sure it all worked.

196
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,940
And there's our e-mail there's a password.

197
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,790
Looking good.

198
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,650
Now it's add that checkbox.

199
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,110
Remember that checkbox just said something like keep me logged in.

200
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:18,240
So I create a div and will give it the class checkbox we'll call a label will say it's for user check

201
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,300
say keep me log.

202
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:33,080
Then it doesn't matter if we capitalize everything and then I want the input to be a checkbox input

203
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,090
with the name user check.

204
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,860
Let's save that and see what we get when I refresh this.

205
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,300
So it says keep me logged in but know that it's actually on top of my checkbox.

206
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,760
So let's fix that.

207
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,100
The way to fix that is by actually putting in my label wrapped around the input.

208
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,780
So I'm going to grab this input over here.

209
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,560
And make sure I call in the correct form.

210
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,350
So I'm going to pass it in before the keep me logged in.

211
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,600
So now let's save this refresh and I can see here.

212
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,190
Now I have my check box before the actual label keep me logged in.

213
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:24,140
So again the way I did that if I expand this window scroll to the left here is I called the label said

214
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:32,110
input type and then had the techs keep me logged in and closed off that label then I just want to add

215
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,120
in the submit button.

216
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,100
So I will call button type is going to be submit.

217
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,660
It could have also set input.

218
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,460
It's up to you.

219
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:50,060
And let's give it the class between between defaults and that's just something you can reference off

220
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:55,670
documentation depending on what you want to look like you could have styled it as a success button or

221
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,930
a primary really up to you if we refresh this.

222
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,910
You can see now we have this button here Our it doesn't actually have anything in it.

223
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:10,020
So let's add in something like submit save it refresh.

224
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,000
And here we see submit and now are Web sites looking pretty good.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,740
So we'll come back to the landing page we see coffee lover project the pictures of the coffee company

226
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,660
to sign in.

227
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,950
We see a log in.

228
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,640
I can put in an email and I can put in a password select to keep me locked in and submit.

229
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,170
All right that's really all you have to do for this project.

230
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,290
I know it can seem really intimidating at first when you see this version of the project the actual

231
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,340
official one.

232
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:42,430
So everything of the instructions but hopefully you saw from what we learned here in the solutions video

233
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,770
that it's actually pretty straightforward.

234
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,210
We didn't even reference the documentation that much for what we had to do a lot of it was just covered

235
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:49,930
in the videos.

236
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,660
Now I know some things such as remembering what these classes are such as forum group or forum control

237
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,130
may seem tedious at this point in time but these are things we're going to be using often enough when

238
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,720
you're working a bootstrap they'll actually remember them.

239
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,730
And I know I keep saying that you'll reference the documentation a lot but even for simple things like

240
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,340
this which is actually a pretty good looking landing page.

241
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,990
You don't have the reference documentation that much with the mount of practice you're going to be getting

242
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,530
of bootstrap in this course.

243
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,480
OK.

244
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,210
So I hope you enjoyed the project.

245
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,440
I will see you at the next lecture.
