00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.330
Hello everyone and welcome to the Python installation and setup lecture for this course.

2
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.850
We're going to be installing Python using the Anaconda's distribution and all that means is that distribution

3
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.670
is just a version of Python also comes prepackaged with additional useful libraries.

4
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.280
Now the Anaconda distribution is actually quite large.

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.100
So we're going to be leaving the full download of it as optional.

6
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.590
I'll show you the full download site.

7
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.230
You can go ahead and just click on the graphical installer if you want but we're going to be showing

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.240
you also how to install what's known as mini Khanda which is just a smaller version of Anaconda without

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.020
so many of the additional packages that way if you don't have a lot of space on your computer you can

10
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.950
just download that again if you already have anaconda or python in your computer.

11
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.000
Feel free to just skip this installation lecture.

12
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.840
But make sure to watch towards the end where we show how to set up and configure atom to have a terminal.

13
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.540
OK let's get started by going to Google in our browser.

14
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.810
All right.

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.150
Here I am in my browser so go to Google dot com and then type in Python Anaconda.

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.840
Hit enter and the very first link should be continue on iOS slashed downloads page.

17
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.140
Click on that and this will take you to continue on the IO slash downloads.

18
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.980
And here you'll see download Anaconda now and it has the download links for Windows Mac and Linux.

19
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.060
If you scroll down here or just click on these links it will automatically take you here.

20
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.240
But let me zoom in a little bit so we can see this clearly.

21
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.870
Here are the download links for Anaconda which is the python distribution for Windows OSX for Mac and

22
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.700
Linux.

23
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.070
Now for this course we will be using Python 3.6 and we're basically going to require you to use Python

24
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.310
3.6 because Django and future versions is going to be dropping support for Python too.

25
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.580
It's one of the first main libraries to just be completely dropping support for Python too.

26
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.560
They're really pushing towards a future here.

27
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.990
So because of that we will be using Python 3 for this version of the course.

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.030
Now Python 3 in Python 2 are extremely similar.

29
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.870
And I will mention some things that recoat along through the course some key differences between them.

30
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.860
But again they're very similar.

31
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.750
But for our future proofing of course we're going to be using Python 3.

32
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.890
Now if you're on Windows all you have to do is download this installer member to choose the correct

33
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.470
64 bit or 32 bit installer and then just double click on the executable file and follow the instructions

34
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.340
on the screen.

35
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.700
If you're on a Mac OS you can come here.

36
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.390
Click on the graphical installer for Python 3.6 and then download it double click on the dot PKC file.

37
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.030
Follow the instructions there.

38
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.730
If you're on a Linux computer it's also very simple.

39
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.390
You just download the installer and then in your terminal you type in this command right here.

40
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.840
BASH And then the actual SH file that you downloaded.

41
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.070
OK so those are the full versions of Anaconda and the python distribution.

42
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.570
These are essentially the easiest to install.

43
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.940
So you just download and follow the instructions but you'll notice that they're quite large.

44
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.740
They're about 422 megabytes each.

45
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.130
If you scroll up a little bit you should see a link here that says try many Khanda and that basically

46
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.910
saves disk space or just download time.

47
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.080
Click on that link.

48
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.470
Many Khanda and it will take you to this page.

49
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.930
Where has the installations for or the downloads for Mini-Con for Windows Mac OS and Linux.

50
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.450
Now if you're on Windows it has an executable installer.

51
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.650
So again all you have to do is click on that and then follow the instructions for Mac OS and Linux.

52
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.030
They're both bash installers.

53
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.270
Which means those are command line installers.

54
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.710
If you don't know how to do those or use those.

55
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.140
All you have to do is click here on the quick install page for installation instructions and this has

56
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.450
the full installation instructions.

57
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.580
If you are on Windows all you have to do is essentially double click that executable file that you download

58
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.690
and follow the instructions on the screen.

59
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.410
If you're on Mac OS and haven't actually done a command line install It's actually also really simple.

60
00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.920
All you have to do is go to your browser download the mini installer and then you will end up downloading

61
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.540
this sh file.

62
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.050
Let me zoom in a little bit here so we can see clearly.

63
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.880
So you will download this sh file and then what you will do is in your terminal window and you can just

64
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.520
do a spotlight search for the word terminal and it will bring it up directly into your terminal wherever

65
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.010
you saved this sh file.

66
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.860
Put it there and then we going to do is say bash and then type in right here.

67
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.790
Whatever file you downloaded and it may not look exactly like this.

68
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.940
Here it says latest.

69
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.810
But whatever your file is called Just type it there then you just close reopen your terminal window

70
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.120
for the changes to take effect.

71
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.620
Sometimes you may need to restart your computer for the changes take effect but usually just restarting

72
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.310
your terminal window will make that happen and the tester installation you just enter the command list.

73
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.030
And if you're on Linux I assume you've probably done this before but all you do is the exact same thing

74
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.150
for Mac bash and then the SH file.

75
00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.850
All right if you have any questions on the installation or are having trouble with it.

76
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.780
Feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

77
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.030
A lot of times some students on older operating systems will have issues with an installation.

78
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.160
Maybe you're on Windows 7.

79
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.820
You haven't quite caught up there yet.

80
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.970
Or maybe you're confused whether you have a 32 bit or 64 bit computer.

81
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.210
Any confusion any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums.

82
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.390
I'm always happy to help you out and get Python an anaconda working on your computer.

83
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.880
OK now let's hop over to the Adam text editor to show you how you can install a plugin which allows

84
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.590
you to have a terminal or command line prompt.

85
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.500
Right in Adam I'm going to hop over to Adam now.

86
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.480
OK here I am at the Adam text editor.

87
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.850
You may have noticed that as I've been using the Adam text editor I have a little plus sign here and

88
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.530
if I click on that plus sign it gives me a terminal where I can type python and then actually start

89
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.600
using Python command prompt directly at my terminal here.

90
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.760
So let's quit out of that.

91
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.080
Well we're going to be doing is showing you how you can install a terminal install some plug ins that

92
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.280
will make work in Python with Adam a lot easier.

93
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.360
So the welcome Guy.

94
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.630
What you can do is click here on install a package and then open installer.

95
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.040
If you can't find this Wolken guide page then all you have to do is click here file.

96
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.340
Go to settings which is control comma or command comma and then click here where it says install and

97
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.830
what you can do.

98
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.250
Adam is search for packages that other people have created or that it has created that allow you to

99
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.290
add your really useful tools for Adam.

100
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.900
The first thing you want to do is actually get that terminal.

101
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:38.270
So type terminal enter in it will search for packages for terminal and the terminal package we're going

102
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.370
to be using for this course.

103
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.560
It's called platforming.

104
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.070
Dash idealy dash terminal so what you will do is you will click the install button for that and then

105
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.170
you may need to refresh or restart Adam for the effects to take place.

106
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.280
So you will have a little blue button there.

107
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.370
Go ahead and install it.

108
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.010
They'll download it from the internet and directly install it.

109
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.760
So that's the terminal package you're using.

110
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.040
But for me dash ID dash terminal.

111
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.150
Once you've installed that you should be able to click on a plus sign here and then open up a new terminal.

112
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:14.100
The next thing we're going to be doing is searching for a python in packages and we want a Python package

113
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.040
or Python plugin excuse me that actually helps you autocomplete.

114
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.820
So there is already built in Python language support in Adam.

115
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.860
You should already have something that looks like this downloaded but I also like the autocomplete dash

116
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.380
Python package which helps you autocomplete variables methods and functions.

117
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.480
Feel free to install that as well.

118
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.250
And if you really want to explore the power of Adam package's search for Django.

119
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.130
And a lot of people have made other useful plugins and packages for Django.

120
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:49.890
I've downloaded Adam dasht Jingo and it helps you just build jingle apps faster of Python.

121
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.260
That's not required but you can go ahead and explore.

122
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.490
There's also templates language Adam support a lot.

123
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.620
A lot of packages here and plug ins that you can explore.

124
00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.080
All right.

125
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.450
So if you are not on a Windows computer you can feel free to skip to the next lecture.

126
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.340
But if you are a Windows computer I want to quickly show you how you can change what command prompt

127
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.130
or terminal or what power shell your actual platform will dash ID is using.

128
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.940
So initially by default this new terminal will use something called Power Shell in Windows.

129
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.300
But we want it to use is the command prompt.

130
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:28.140
So we need to change the settings for that under here in search packages begin to search for terminal

131
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.620
enter and you should eventually see the platform the dash ID terminal that you installed.

132
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.940
Click on settings here.

133
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.480
Once you've installed it and it will take you to the settings page.

134
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.400
Scroll down on the settings page and then what we're looking for is this shell override.

135
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.860
So we want to override the default shell instance to launch.

136
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:56.310
Now what you should do is on your computer you need to find the M.D executable file and almost always

137
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.450
it's under the system 32 folder.

138
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:05.230
And in fact you should be able to just type this directly into these shell overon and then have it set

139
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.790
up.

140
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:12.620
So take your time pause the screen if you need it but set the shell override to be c..

141
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.800
Windows system 32 CMD d e x e.

142
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.120
And that will change the terminal for being power shell to being the command prompt.

143
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.550
The reason we do that is because sometimes the Conda virtual environment won't work.

144
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.420
A power shell and we'll be showing you how to use that in a subsequent lecture during the jingoes section

145
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.340
of the course.

146
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.090
So this really won't affect you right now for the python level on a python level 2 but when we start

147
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.230
talking about Django it will affect it.

148
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:38.880
OK.

149
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.160
So I just wanted to quickly note that for Windows users.

150
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.370
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

151
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.680
Again any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums and I'm always happy to help you out.

152
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.590
I'll see you at the next lecture.
