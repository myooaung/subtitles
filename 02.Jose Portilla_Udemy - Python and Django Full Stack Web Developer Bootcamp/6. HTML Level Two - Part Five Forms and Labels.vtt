00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.520
Hello everyone and welcome back to five forms and labels we've already explored the basic input tags

2
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.540
things such as email types of password types and we even saw some more fun ones such as the color type

3
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.700
of inputs.

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.990
But now what we want to do is really understand how to connect these various input tags to two features

5
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.720
and one is an action upon clicking that submit button and then the other one is actually labeling that

6
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.390
input.

7
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.450
The use of that label tag will allow you to add labels in front of the input in your aged him form.

8
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.060
And we're going to be learning how to use the label as a as well as the four parameter inside of that

9
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.810
label tag.

10
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.730
And then we're also going to exploring how to activate actions upon clicking the submit button.

11
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.710
We're going to do is walk through a couple of examples that further explain things that we didn't cover

12
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.660
last time but see last time.

13
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.840
So if you remember from the previous lecture when I clicked that submit button it seemed to just refreshed

14
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.590
the page and not really do anything.

15
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.470
And we also saw that when we created a forum tag we had that action and method key parameters that we

16
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.540
didn't really the finer talk about.

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.760
Now is the time to revisit those topics and see how they really work which jump to the text editor to

18
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.980
get started.

19
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.030
All right so here I am at the editor and I also have the forms the H to him l file open.

20
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.360
Let's start off by recreating.

21
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.500
Just a very simple form and I'll will use the form tag.

22
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.840
And notice we have that class action and method parameters.

23
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.970
Right now we're just going to ignore those and close them up.

24
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:47.800
Passen input enter and then we'll say this input is just an email and then we'll also give another input

25
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.960
for submit.

26
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.780
So that's the Submit type of input something I will do however is add a name to this email.

27
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.870
So last time we did this but didn't actually really explore what happens when we add a name.

28
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.700
So let's add a name refresh this page and let's add a couple more things here.

29
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.940
I will say paragraph to enter email and then give a value to this submit button.

30
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.100
So we see something there.

31
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.050
So we'll say submit save that refreshed this and now we see something that says Enter email and submit

32
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.540
Let's see what happens when I actually enter an email click submit.

33
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.370
So I will say something like user at gmail dot com hit submit and notice it seems to essentially just

34
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.570
refresh the page but pay attention to what actually happened here.

35
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.530
In my u r l in Mayerl now I see at the very end user e-mail is equal to user per cent scient 40 gmail

36
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.940
dot com and basically percent sign 40 is a code for the at symbol and we now can see that when I click

37
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.580
Submit I'm basically assigning whatever input I had there to that name.

38
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.030
Let's try this again.

39
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.680
I will call this HVM L and instead of entering email I'm going to try just with a very basic text input.

40
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.870
So I will say type look say enter here.

41
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:16.360
TEXT I will say type is equal to text and then give this name something like user

42
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.620
will save this refresh.

43
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.830
And now I see enter text let's say enter text and I will type in my stuff here.

44
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.390
Click submit and we see now in the your L we see forms that is HTML with user input is equal to my stuff

45
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.820
so we can begin to get this idea that when I click Submit I'm actually signing whatever is inputted

46
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.600
to the name that the input tag had.

47
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.220
Now what I want to do is explore the idea of an action occurring when I hit the submit button.

48
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.300
So far right now when I hit submit it basically just refreshes the page.

49
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.180
Let's see if we can perform an action to go to another web page or another Web site Aplon clicking that

50
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.190
submit button.

51
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.650
So we come back here to form and put in action in.

52
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.400
And then we can pasan a web page.

53
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.360
Now a lot of times you won't be passing in a nother website passen another web page within your own

54
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.460
web application.

55
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.380
Right now since we don't have a full back in we'll just say the action is equal to HTP and we can say

56
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.400
P.S. WW let's say Facebook that.

57
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.070
And then we need also supply the method and we'll say it's a get value method.

58
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.760
We're going to be talking a lot more about method and get versus post in future lectures right now just

59
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.850
keep it simple by saying Upon clicking the submit button the action I want you to do is go ahead and

60
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:54.550
go to Facebook dot com and we'll see that we still retain that user input.

61
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.700
So let me call him again.

62
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.920
Are forms that age Tim L..

63
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.700
Here we see entry text.

64
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:11.040
And let's just make sure that's working by saying enter text and take me to FP for Facebook and will

65
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.350
refresh this.

66
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.740
And now we see Ettrick text and take me to SB So I will enter some text here.

67
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.350
So say hello world.

68
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.270
Hit submit.

69
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.650
Now let's see what happens.

70
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.940
Now it takes me to HTP Facebook dot com with the user input equal to Hello World so we can begin to

71
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.330
get this idea that upon clicking that submit button I can call actions to take me to others web pages

72
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.220
within my entire web application.

73
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.980
Along with the actual input so it might be nice is upon clicking submit it actually takes me to that

74
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.440
user profiles page based off what the input did in these input tax.

75
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.610
All right now we don't know enough about the back end to actually handle a lot of this stuff.

76
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.810
Right now we're basically just working all of this on the front end but hopefully it's pretty impressive

77
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.100
what just pure HVM l can do by itself.

78
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.480
Let's go back here to forms and then finally talk about labels.

79
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:15.940
Labels going to be just a very quick topic on this so I will delete this and go back to a normal form

80
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:27.170
click save and then show something very simple something like enter some text and then in this input

81
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:34.100
I'm going to be having it say text will save this refresh and it says enter some text so I can just

82
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.700
say hello world etc..

83
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.670
Now something I want to notice here is that when I called this paragraph this input type text becomes

84
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.360
a new block so it's not on the same line as this paragraph.

85
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:53.140
Something I may want to do is actually label all the text inputs on a form.

86
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.830
So a form may have various inputs it may have multiple text inputs.

87
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.510
Maybe you filling out a job application on line and you have various text boxes to fill out something

88
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:09.680
you may want to do is try to label them and there's two ways of doing it will show you the technically

89
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.540
bad way of doing it which is individual and also the way you should be doing it.

90
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.620
So if I just type in a label or begin to type it in.

91
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.740
I get this label text filled out with this for parameter and we're going to discuss what that parameter

92
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.040
means in just a second.

93
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.060
Right now we'll show you kind of the quote unquote bad way of doing it.

94
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.220
It's basically just the more repeatable way.

95
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.760
But the reason we don't want that is because we want to practice dry coding principles dry standing

96
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.120
for D or y or.

97
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.190
Don't repeat yourself.

98
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:48.320
So if I call this over here and paste it into that labels Here's my input type and then I say enter

99
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.230
text.

100
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.950
Colon.

101
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.760
Save this an hour refresh that form page.

102
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.520
I can see now that the label is on the same code block as the actual input and that's what I wanted.

103
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.300
But now let's say have multiple inputs.

104
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.060
Something I may have to do now is just keep calling labels I'll say something like.

105
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.730
Again enter text.

106
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.570
Call the input type and text and let's get these values.

107
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.600
Will say this is like one just so it's clear.

108
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.100
We'll call this block to save that.

109
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.300
Refresh the page.

110
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.470
Now we can see here a say entered text block 1 enter text block to something however that I don't want

111
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.720
to do is constantly be repeating myself so I don't want to have to actually call label enter text label

112
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.970
entered Tex etc..

113
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.720
That's where that for parameter comes into play.

114
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.600
So we just showed how to use a label individually.

115
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.500
Banality show how to use a label with that for parameter.

116
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:55.050
So I will again call label and here you have the four parameter and what I will do is match this up

117
00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:02.370
to a new parameter that we're going to learn about called ID so I'll say this is for user input and

118
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:08.940
then say something like enter input and notice the inside of these label tags.

119
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.990
It's just a text.

120
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.900
I haven't actually passed than the input tag yet than outside of this.

121
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:21.520
I'm going to say input will say this is type text and we'll give it a value something like.

122
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:30.430
Hello and will also give it an ID and ID is something we're going to be exploring a lot more when we

123
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.520
talk about C Ss in the next section.

124
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.270
But for now I just want to make sure that Id links up and matches the four.

125
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:45.340
And basically what this is saying is it's saying OK this label is for the ID user input and there is

126
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.690
the actual label.

127
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:52.780
And then we can see that the input has the site the user input which means it's going to link this label

128
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.970
to this input.

129
00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:00.820
So let's refresh this with Will it save it and then refresh this and we can see here enter input has

130
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:09.290
been linked to this text box and I didn't actually have to now put that input into this label and this

131
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:13.420
is just a bit of a nicer and more common way to see label being used.

132
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:18.470
Right now it may not make a whole lot of sense because we haven't really covered ID yet and we haven't

133
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.920
really covered how to connect an ID to another file.

134
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.940
But right now just consider the idea that ID is a possible parameter for uniquely identifying in HVM

135
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.390
Eltang and that whole concept is going to make a lot more sense.

136
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.370
We want to uniquely style HTL tags based off some sort of ID.

137
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.890
And that's how we're going to be finding them based off of the site.

138
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.260
All right.

139
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:48.860
So so far recovered forms how to perform an action will perform how to label an input and then how to

140
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.350
use label with D for parameter.

141
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:57.620
The last thing I want to mention are two extra parameters you could put into an input and that is instead

142
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.400
of a value you can use a placeholder.

143
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:06.200
So I notice when I use value I actually have to manually delete what's already in there.

144
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.300
A lot of times on the internet instead of a value you will see something called a placeholder.

145
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.520
So let's save that and refresh the page and we can see here we have a placeholder and it's a little

146
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:22.000
more faint in the font color and that's because when I click on this it will basically immediately disappear

147
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.570
as soon as I start typing something.

148
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.790
So that's much more common to see when you're building a web site that has a placeholder instead of

149
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.280
a value.

150
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:37.270
So you'll often see things such as Enter email or like enter email here.

151
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.090
This was an email input.

152
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.050
So refresh this entry mail here.

153
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:46.460
And as soon as I click this and start typing stuff that placeholder goes away that's a much better way

154
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.210
of using stuff to actually be a placeholder instead of a value.

155
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.740
And the last thing I want to show you is this required argument.

156
00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:01.400
So basically what happens is when you passen required here it doesn't require anything to say required

157
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.080
equals it's just required.

158
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:08.960
And basically what that means is when you submit something you need to make sure that it has this.

159
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.610
So let me show an example of that.

160
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:17.620
We will say enter text here and let's add in some more input.

161
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:26.880
So let's just make it simple get rid of this label and we will get rid of this ID and we will have this

162
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.490
text input as well as in other text input.

163
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.930
And this will have a placeholder

164
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.540
and this will say not required.

165
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.420
And then finally we will have an input with a submit button.

166
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.080
SUB.

167
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.910
And we will give that the value.

168
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.690
Wups let's expand that again will give that the value.

169
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.820
Just submit.

170
00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.930
And then this will have a placeholder saying required as you may have guessed.

171
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:06.630
Basically when we click submit we are required to have input in this second text box.

172
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.940
I will refresh this.

173
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.730
We see not required and required.

174
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:18.240
So if I just put stuff in required so I say hello and don't put anything in not required click submit.

175
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.080
I don't have any problems the page just refreshes.

176
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:28.080
But now let's try it again I'll zoom back in and we will skip to this little pop up.

177
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.690
We'll put something in.

178
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.850
Not required.

179
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.850
So hello.

180
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.480
But not put anything in the required.

181
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.460
Hit submit and notice it says Please fill out this field and all of that is happening with your browser.

182
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:46.460
This recognizing that hey this e-mail says that this input is required so you must put something in

183
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.910
there before clicking the submit button.

184
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.880
Or I'll give you a warning.

185
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.330
And that's the difference between something being required and not required.

186
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.300
All right.

187
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.750
I know we covered a lot in this lecture.

188
00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.870
Let's briefly talk about it one more time.

189
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:05.420
We talked about forms how we can state an action to link to another web page and then we can say method

190
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.050
equals to get to actually complete that action.

191
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:13.500
Then we talk about labels how you can use an individual able to actually label one of your inputs.

192
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:20.920
And then finally we talked about the use of the four parameter with label as well as placeholders and

193
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.590
set of values and the required parameter.

194
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.810
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
