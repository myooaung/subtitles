00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.580
Hello everyone and welcome to three tables quiz solution.

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.030
In this lecture we're just going to be coding through the solutions for the table quiz.

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.590
Let's get started.

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.140
All right so I have my text editor opened and I have my browser open to this tables that HVM l file

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.040
which is currently blank let me collapse that directory screen.

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.150
And here I have the actual text file with the quizz instruction so I can reference this data later on

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.490
or remember you want to just create a table with those three columns and three rows.

8
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.440
Let's start off by just creating the ditched him file itself.

9
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.230
Well luckily we just have to type H.T..

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.080
Hit enter and everything's automatically created there for us.

11
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.090
And then here in the body I'm going to just say something like table and let's insert a header just

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.990
to make sure we're properly lnk are heading I should say and we'll say table quiz save that.

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.130
Let's refresh this.

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.350
And here we see table quiz.

15
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.120
So we know these are linked together so we're good to go.

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.030
I can just delete that heading now since I know it's linked.

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.920
And now I have the table.

18
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.020
The first thing of this table that I want to create is the T head element.

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.610
I remember the T head or the table head is what actually has the column names.

20
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.730
So it has the column names in bold there.

21
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.410
And that takes in th cells instead of the regular T-cells.

22
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.270
In my first column will be the country name.

23
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:38.090
My second column will be the country flag and then my third column remember is the GDP in millions of

24
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.490
U.S. dollars.

25
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.210
So let's save that and make sure it actually worked for us by refreshing over here and there we have

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.190
a country named country flag GDP.

27
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.500
Millions of U.S. dollars.

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.930
But remember that the actual solutions that looked like it had a border to it.

29
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.890
And we covered how to create a border back in the tables lecture you just come up here to tables select

30
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.460
border equal to English just put in let's say to then we refresh and now we have that nice border.

31
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.990
Now it's just a matter of filling in the information.

32
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.760
So the information we have has to go under table rows or Tiaras tags.

33
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.070
So here's a table row.

34
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.880
Now let's start by filling in the first table cells.

35
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.570
So the first one we have is USA.

36
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.350
That's the first table cell.

37
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.080
Then the second one we have Tedi is going to be the actual image of the flag.

38
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.720
In order to put that in we need to call an image tag.

39
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.620
So we didn't actually show this in the table lecture but all you have to do is just type an image and

40
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.690
then put in the source.

41
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.950
So we have this image tag that we worked with earlier and it just nested inside this CD or table cell

42
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.360
tag.

43
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.160
And that's really all you had to do for that let's grab that USA flag link so I will copy and paste

44
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.050
it from here.

45
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:58.950
Let me copy that and then paste it inside the source save this and let me refresh to make sure everything

46
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.950
worked correctly here and there we have country flag and us so we're linked correctly.

47
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.010
And then finally the last cell I want for this row is with my tv tags here.

48
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.280
They will cell call it and let me zoom in a little bit so we can see a little better.

49
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.900
It's the GDP in millions of U.S. dollars.

50
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.780
And from the notes just right here 18 million 561 etc..

51
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.850
So let's pay that in.

52
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.660
Save it refresh.

53
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.740
And it looks like we're good to go.

54
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.520
Here we have the country named country flag and GDP.

55
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.500
Now just a matter of duplicating this process for the next two rows.

56
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.560
So again we just say table row and let's just put in the three cells right now.

57
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:51.350
DD see the the and the next one we had was India and then I'm going to put in the image tag again.

58
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.690
I M.G. enter and automatically has the S R C or the source for you and we will grab this Indian flag

59
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.900
from Wikipedia and a quick note.

60
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.300
Sometimes Wikipedia will change the actual links or the size of the picture.

61
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.140
So we're getting some distortion the size.

62
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.300
Don't worry we're going to cover how to actually set image sizes later on especially during the CSSA

63
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.030
lectures.

64
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.440
So if you get kind of funky flag sizes don't worry about it too much.

65
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.800
Just make sure you understand the idea of creating the table itself.

66
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.900
Don't worry too much about these actual links.

67
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.790
In fact you can replace it with your own links if you want it to.

68
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.740
So I will just copy and paste that flag in dealing crate there and then let me put in their GDP and

69
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.160
I have that information right over here.

70
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.510
Copy and paste that save this and let's make sure the second row worked right.

71
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.680
Perfect we have India Indian flag and then their GDP.

72
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.670
And then finally it's time for the United Kingdom.

73
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.240
Will put in their three selves.

74
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.150
Tedy t.

75
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.490
T the.

76
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.410
And we're going to say United Kingdom

77
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.300
image source and then there GDP Solecki GDP first copy and paste that in here.

78
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.280
Save this and refresh to make sure you still have the connection.

79
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.980
Perfect.

80
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.520
And now it's time for their flag so let's grab that flag link.

81
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.190
I'm going to just copy this from the notes and then paste it in here at their source.

82
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.010
Good let's save that.

83
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.230
And now with the refresh here I see the United Kingdom flag.

84
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.690
All right.

85
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.540
And that's really all we had to do.

86
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.060
So we have the country flaks USA India United Kingdom their flags and then GDP.

87
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.860
All right.

88
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.890
So hopefully found that exercise pretty straightforward.

89
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.770
Again you can always just reference to solutions notebook or excuse me solutions.

90
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.810
H tim Metafile.

91
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.660
In case you want to actually reference the code itself.

92
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.140
All right thanks everyone.

93
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.970
I hope that was straightforward and I'll see you at the next lecture.
