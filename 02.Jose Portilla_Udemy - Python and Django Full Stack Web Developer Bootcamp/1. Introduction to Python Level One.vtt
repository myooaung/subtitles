00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.780
Hello everyone and welcome to Python level 1.

2
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.870
We've already learned so much that it may seem crazy that we're only now reaching how to learn and how

3
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.200
to code in Python because Django is completely based in Python for a majority of the course from now

4
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.750
on we're just going to be working of Python.

5
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.100
But your previous programming experience with learning javascript.

6
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.310
Tim elsea Yes.

7
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.050
And those fundamental coding ideas is going to help make learn Python a total breeze.

8
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.400
So over level 1 and level 2 we're going to be covering a lot of the same general programming topics

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.320
from javascript.

10
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.890
Things like for loops and while loops etc..

11
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.490
So we won't spend as much time in Python talking about the very basic idea of what a for loop is or

12
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.830
what an array is or what those basic ideas are.

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.270
Instead we'll just show you more the syntax of how to work with those ideas in Python.

14
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.310
And then we're going to expand on these ideas to learn about object oriented programming something we

15
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.430
haven't talked about yet.

16
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.320
So if you've already taken a python course you may already know a lot but we're going to be covering.

17
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.800
Especially if already taken one of my Python courses.

18
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.390
You may find it easier to skip ahead to a section instead of starting from the very beginning.

19
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.700
Let's outline some of the topics of both level 1 and level 2.

20
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.440
To give you an idea of where to start.

21
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.880
If you already have some experience in Python level one will start by talking about basic data types

22
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.800
of Python that includes numbers strings lists and dictionaries.

23
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.690
Then we'll talk about tuples sets and booleans control flow of python and how it uses indentation things

24
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.720
such as the if else if statements.

25
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.920
Then we'll talk about functions of Python then starting at Python level too.

26
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.830
We'll talk about scope with Python.

27
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.270
Will discuss object oriented programming of Python errors and exceptions decorator's and then regular

28
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.370
expressions utilize the curriculum outline to jump to the lecture you feel is the most appropriate starting

29
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.100
point for you.

30
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.160
If you already have some program experience of Python or if you are a complete beginner feel free to

31
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.250
just start from here and continue on.

32
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.590
It has been a really long learning journey so far.

33
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.770
Just to reach this point.

34
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.740
So I really want you to take the time and congratulate yourself.

35
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.230
Everything you've learned so far is challenging material.

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.520
So remind yourself that you are awesome for making it this far into the course and give yourself a huge

37
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.750
pat on the back.

38
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.110
OK I level 1 and 2 are the only thing standing between you and the main course topic which is Django.

39
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.550
So let's dive straight into it and get started by setting up Python and the Adam text editor in the

40
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.540
next lecture.

41
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.500
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
