1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,760
Hill every want to walk up to part seven of the blog and project it's finally time to actually start

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,260
filling up all those email templates that we've created in the previous lectures and we're going to

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,700
start off with the base HTL templates.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,190
So that's the one we're going to be using by extending it to all the other templates and we'll also

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,950
be setting up some of the C Ss and Javascript calls.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,620
We're going to be making through up to future lectures.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:33,900
Let's get started by helping the editor and also be showing you the resources in the browser so we're

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,930
kind of back and forth between those.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,980
Let's get started.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,680
All right.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,670
Here I am at the editor and I opened up the base that each team l file.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,860
So far we don't really have anything in it.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,610
We just have this doc type H Tim L and I've gone ahead and added load static files that way I can reference

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,720
things such as the blog CSSA file we did using template tagging.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,960
So I can say that static template tag.

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,530
So coming back to the base that each team l we're going to add some stuff to this.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,840
So the things to add after adding a title is bootstrap saw type that in as comments so I want to add

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,220
in Bootstrap.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:16,880
I also want to add in this medium style editor and that's going to be the thing that allows us to kind

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,900
of mimic medium calm editing and we'll show you what that means in just a second.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,930
We also want to have some custom CSX and then probably some Google fonts as well.

22
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,190
So we'll grab those as well.

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,880
And then the other thing that I want is over here in the body will probably want a nav bar eventually

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,550
so I'll be adding that in this lecture.

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:47,140
And then since this is going to be the base likes him will probably also have some content so I'll have

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,090
some sort of body block here.

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,980
I believe you called it the concept block so we'll call it concept block.

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,990
OK so let's say that and let's come back up here and show you the resources and how to grab the rethinks

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,950
for bootstrap.

30
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,920
We've done this a bunch of times before but just come over here to get bootstrapped back.

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
And then I'm going to grab these CD ends.

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,520
I will copy this and then I'm going to paste it here.

33
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,230
And here we can see the latest bit if I see a SS and also an optional theme is what I've copied and

34
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,180
pasted those are the only two lines we need.

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,610
And then the collapse directory tree to get myself a little more room.

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,170
Now the next thing we're going to add in is the medium style editor.

37
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,940
So in case you're not familiar medium dot com Let me show you what that looks like and then we'll explore

38
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,760
some hub libraries that are open source for us to use to mimic this song.

39
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,090
Hop over to my browser here and close this get bootstrap.

40
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,830
And here we can see a page if you go all the way atop.

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,760
Check out these links.

42
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:53,150
But it's just that the user Y A B W e slash and then the medium Ed. And you can see is actually a library

43
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,380
that has a ton of commits.

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,570
It's actually updated pretty recently as far as this feeling.

45
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,820
At least a month ago it was updated.

46
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,220
And if you keep scrolling down you'll see it it supports most major browsers but to actually get an

47
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,170
understanding of what this is I'm going to go to medium dot com to kind of show you.

48
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,120
So if you're go to medium com right now I'm logged then.

49
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,270
So I can see particular articles that median dot com is basically where anyone can just write an article

50
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,870
or a blog and everything has the same style and formatting.

51
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,720
So if we click on one of these articles such as this one how machines make sense of big data.

52
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,270
Obviously you can tell that I follow a lot of data science and technology articles you'll click on it

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,450
then it looks something like this in every article or blog on a medium that basically has the same look

54
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,620
and feel you have images and you have this text editor and you have kind of these wide margins.

55
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,630
So it looks kind of like a blog post.

56
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,880
And if you want to write your own story you click here and write story after you've logged in and then

57
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,550
you have the sort of editor to say some stuff here and then you can highlight this and it gives you

58
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:02,870
the option to either make it bolds make it a taluk head or one heading to where you can put a link here

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,170
and then say I don't know Google dot com etc. and they can see it's underlined and now it's a link.

60
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,520
So that's the kind of thing we want to mimic in our own blog posts.

61
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,210
So if we come over here after some searching I was able to discover that a lot of people wanted the

62
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,730
sort of functionality and it's already here for a client for us to use.

63
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,490
And if you scroll all the way down you want to make sure that whenever you're working with open source

64
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,890
files that you found online that there is some sort of license agreement so we check on the license

65
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,650
make sure that we have permission to actually use this.

66
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,990
Now I'm just using this for educational purposes so you can see that this is copyright but there's also

67
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,390
a particular license so there's permission free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of the software

68
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,600
to deal in the software or any sort of restrictions.

69
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,790
And then is subject to the following conditions.

70
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,970
Usually the conditions are for you just to source an attribute who you actually got this from.

71
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,970
So here's the actual information here on this license we're just doing this for educational purposes.

72
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,000
But whenever you're doing something in a production you should always make sure that you have the rights

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,710
to this software.

74
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,390
Obviously things are hosted on get hub in their open source things and get a little fuzzy if you ever

75
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,600
have any doubt you'll get the message to the person directly.

76
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,970
Coming back to the actual whoops let's go back here.

77
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,730
Are you coming back to the actual medium Ed. home page here on the hub we can see that if you scroll

78
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,490
down.

79
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,170
It's essentially a javascript library that mimics exactly what the medium Viacom was doing.

80
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,850
It has modern browser support which is good and it shows you some basic demos on basic usage.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,620
So we're going to be doing is using this for text area and eventually you click on the demos you'll

82
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,200
find this demo.

83
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,580
So this under medium Ed. demo text area h team L and you can see that after you've imported and linked

84
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,850
everything the javascript in the CSSA you just have to create this script here to create a new editor

85
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,600
object.

86
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,120
And you also have to make sure that has this class this editable medium Ed. text area which we actually

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,030
did back when we were creating that we just dictionary attribute in the forms classes and then coming

88
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:14,200
down here we can see that there's various ways to actually add this in as a file in our project.

89
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,460
And there's a service called JSE deliver which kind of acts like an external CDN.

90
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,710
So if you don't actually want to download everything and link it up manually you can just copy and paste

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,180
these two right here.

92
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,030
So one is a javascript file and then one is the CSSA link file so I'm going to do that.

93
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,690
The other option is if you're having trouble getting the CD ends to work then just do the manual installation

94
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,650
which you just scroll down here.

95
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,810
And then you click down where it says latest releases will take it to the latest release page and then

96
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,580
I'll say OK is 5.2 3.0.

97
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,490
And then we can do is find there all the information about that.

98
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,400
And then just download the source code itself and then just use the linking which we already learned

99
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,390
about HTL to link the javascript and CSSA files.

100
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:02,700
So I'll come back here to my editor and I'm going to copy and paste that medium style editor.

101
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,960
So there's only two things there is that javascript.

102
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,270
And then there's this C Ss So coming back around here.

103
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,270
Those are the two links I'm going to need to actually implement the medium style editing and later I

104
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,350
will see the template tags I had to set up that widget class and then also call that script that we

105
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,610
kind of just talked about.

106
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,930
Then finally for some custom CSSA make sure that any custom C Ss goes after all these other CSSA calls

107
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,110
and I'm going to link it here to this blog that si SS So luckily I've already inputted static files

108
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,040
meaning I can just say add a link here.

109
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,860
It's a style sheet and then from a trip on you use static template tagging which you've seen before

110
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:50,340
and just say static and then call something like see SS blog about CSSA.

111
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,340
Because if I look at her Churi that's where it is.

112
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,060
We have static C S S log that t ss and right now.

113
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,760
Our blog about C Ss is empty and if you remember back to what the blog actually looks like we have those

114
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,290
sort of color changes that the text does and I'll show you how I discover that.

115
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,080
So what's a really fun Web site to check out which we probably mentioned the very beginning in the course

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,060
as a way to share your code for Front-End stuff is code Pendar.

117
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,030
I know that c o d PTEN.

118
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:26,090
I know and you can come here and there's lots of pens and essentially this is just really nice fun front

119
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,570
end stuff.

120
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:33,170
So using three Front-End technologies that's him LCAC us and Javascript and CSSA is actually really

121
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,680
powerful.

122
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,040
You can do a lot of C Ss that you would think would be limited to Javascript.

123
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,690
So what I was doing I was just messing around code then I kind of wanted to add some nice CSSA this

124
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,530
maybe something that was a little fun for the blog project.

125
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,760
Eventually after searching these if you find something that interests you for instance maybe you want

126
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,230
it.

127
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,400
Well not the box solution that's all too crazy.

128
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:01,010
Let's say you wanted to have this little guy this rainbow preload or so you click on this.

129
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,260
You'll notice that it has noted it's only supported in Chrome.

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,670
But if you wanted to add something like this to your site we could do just copy this VSS and then copy

131
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,500
the same Elche.

132
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,720
This is an example of how to use a CSSA and that would be an easy way to have that on your site.

133
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,460
So I ended up doing is I discovered this little loading.

134
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:28,160
So it's a simple loader and we can click on it and what it does is the background changes Hughes and

135
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,400
I want it to instead of have the entire background change hues.

136
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,070
I would have the letters themselves change hues and I didn't really care too much about these three

137
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,660
dots that are loading.

138
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,420
So basically what I want to grab is just the color changing and this was actually all done with SS So

139
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm going to copy and paste this.

140
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,020
And since we're using this for educational purposes we don't have to worry too much.

141
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,500
But the license but in case you want to use a file like this in production it's always a good idea to

142
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,500
contact the creator and make sure that's OK with them.

143
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,520
Obviously their hosting this all open source and there's no real license agreement here.

144
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,470
We should always check and make sure.

145
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,720
So all you do is copy this and note the class.

146
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,050
It's the class loader and we're going to be kind of calling that on everything later on.

147
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,700
So I'm going to come back here after copy and paste that and I'm just going to put that into our own

148
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:24,100
blog about SS So will paste it here and then scroll back up.

149
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,520
And I don't actually need the BE1 be to B-3 cetera.

150
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,880
So all those were is if you kind of check out this.

151
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,290
We had class B one B and B-3 that's for these three little loading bars.

152
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,940
What I really want and am concerned with is just this loader and then these keyframes.

153
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:52,350
So I'm going to get rid of these BE1 classes scroll all the way down and then kind of get rid of them

154
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,400
just to simplify my CSSA script a little bit.

155
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,360
And then what I want to do is last thing I don't want to change the background I just want to change

156
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,300
the color and we'll be exploring this later on as we actually implement this OK.

157
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,340
So there is my loader and we actually don't need this left right top either erroneous position or fix

158
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,020
kind of simplifying this.

159
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,300
These are the three things they only really care about.

160
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,770
The hue rotates or it's actually coming from the linear gradient of the color and then the animation.

161
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:31,400
So I will save this and then we'll see if we have this H-1 call which we can leave.

162
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,200
We want it to but I'm actually going to get rid of it since we don't really need a heading one.

163
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,510
So that was Felix over here this loading or somehow it's also changing.

164
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,050
I don't really want that so going to say save it.

165
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,930
So the main things I care about are loader and then keyframes if you keep the other stuff in you may

166
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,950
get some different behavior than what we've seen in the blog so far.

167
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,630
And after we've set up our blog about CSSA file with that extra code the last thing we have to do is

168
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,940
set up Google fonts.

169
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:05,050
So coming back to the browser I have Google fonts or Fahnestock Google dot com and I can search for

170
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,230
the two fonts I used.

171
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,170
Obviously have a lot of flexibility over which ones you want to use.

172
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,170
I use one called The Russo one look kind of interesting to me.

173
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,770
And then I also use one of my favorite fonts This maps Mazzara.

174
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,050
And then we're going to add that as well.

175
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,390
Two families are selected to open that up and then copy and paste the link here.

176
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,140
So I'm going to copy that and insert that into fonts.

177
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,330
And now I have the stylesheets OK.

178
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,130
Perfect.

179
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,880
And now we're going to do is set up our nav bar.

180
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,810
So we'll come down here.

181
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,000
And we're going to set up our nav bar.

182
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,410
So there's our next.

183
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,060
And let's set up the class calls and I would expect you to memorize these.

184
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,290
I basically was just looking at the bootstrap documentation.

185
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,640
In fact a lot of this was kind of just like copy and paste from Bootstrap documentation.

186
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,710
So we use nav bar space nav bar dash default.

187
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,400
And then I'm going to create another class called Tech fonts which is going to allow me if I go to blog

188
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:18,030
about C Ss and that and now that's going to allow me to actually edit the fonts of the actual nav bar

189
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,040
so that that.

190
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,280
Going to say the font family of that is.

191
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,990
Russo one that was the font from Google that we just got.

192
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,470
And then it's also going to be sans serif.

193
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:38,660
And then I'm also the font size to be I should say 1.5 E-M And then of course you have a lot of leeway.

194
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:45,380
If however you want to do this and to give a little bit more margin here so I will save that.

195
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,180
So coming back to base that is simple.

196
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,980
So that's my tech funds.

197
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:57,600
And then the other thing I want is custom nav bar so custom therefore is a class that I'm going to be

198
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,310
using in case I ever want to customize anything else on my enough bar.

199
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,620
I'll leave it blank for now on the blog about C Ss.

200
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,120
I don't believe we actually ever really need it or use it.

201
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,130
But sometimes a good idea to just add in another class while you're building at the base HTL template

202
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,360
in case you ever want to mess around with it.

203
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,650
So we'll save that and then we're gonna do have a div here and we're just going to give this a container

204
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,310
div that way anything we put in the nav bar will actually be contained.

205
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,350
So we're gonna have quite a few links here.

206
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,910
First one is going to be effect let's give it a class Personal going to be our brand.

207
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:40,540
So we'll call this nav bar dash brands and there's something else you can add in here we'll add another

208
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:47,800
class big brand and that way we can link that to our CSSA file if necessary.

209
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,210
And Big Brown is just something to make it a little bigger.

210
00:14:50,530 --> 00:15:00,970
So don't come over here and add an big brands class Elisha's have this be font size of 1.5 E-M.

211
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,380
That way it looks a little larger than the rest of the text so if you notice back when we were running

212
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:12,360
the blog project the brand font size of a little bit larger than the rest of it so that's what the big

213
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,880
brand is for and then continuing on with this.

214
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,260
What I want to do is set up the link.

215
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,520
So if you go to the if you click on the brand I should take you back to the home page or remember the

216
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,970
home page for us is the actual post lists also your all post list.

217
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,760
And let's call this something like my blog OK.

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,680
So I'm going to expand this.

219
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,960
We don't really need to reference the browser anymore.

220
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,480
And Addinall a little list item.

221
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,080
And you can kind of fast forward for this if you don't want to watch me do all this just as a heads

222
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,450
up.

223
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,110
And then we went in about page either about yourself or the company.

224
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,930
Now we'll just have to say about it can copy and paste all these links to make sure you get the spelling

225
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:05,140
correct and then have two references so we'll have a reference outside reference that is to have dot

226
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,320
com Maybe we're using this for your own portfolio site or your company's web page.

227
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,640
We'll have something like that.

228
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,220
And then let's have another one to link then

229
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,150
and we'll have the say only then.

230
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,590
And let's put this all in an unordered list.

231
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:43,790
So on are list here and so be in their class loop's nav nav bar Sneath and all grab all these list items

232
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,520
and put them into this an ordered list

233
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,710
and I will save that.

234
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,410
OK so now we have to make sure that if the user is logged into the Web site they see those other options

235
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,870
and there's other options we're creating a new post drafts and then logging out and something that says

236
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,560
something like welcome user welcome Jose cetera.

237
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:14,570
So in order to do that I'm going to add in in other unordered list and I'm going to also give this class

238
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:25,650
and will say nav bar actually nav nav bar dash nav nav bar dash right so everything's right aligned

239
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,940
as far as the log in information.

240
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,090
And here's we're going to add in some template tagging for some logic so we'll add an if statement and

241
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:44,380
we'll say if the user is underscore authenticated which comes from our imports of the Auth. library

242
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,520
in Jingo and whenever you have and if you always got to make sure you have an and if so have that as

243
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,020
well.

244
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,360
Now what kind of leave this towards the bottom.

245
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,070
So if the user is authenticated what are we going to do.

246
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,970
Well we should have a list item right.

247
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:10,860
And that list item which is give it a anchor Ted and the anchor tag is going to be your template and

248
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:19,060
the template is going to say oh blink to post-New and we'll have it say you post.

249
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,610
So I'm going to copy and paste this because I want three more really similar things.

250
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,040
I was sort of post-New to go to your draft page.

251
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,590
So that is post draft list and associate new posts.

252
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,990
We'll just have it say drafts to there's the unpublished blog post and then we also want some sort of

253
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,100
log out button so I have log out.

254
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,770
And then this will just say log out.

255
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:58,300
And then finally after all that I want one more of these which is a little simpler that just says sexually.

256
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,800
Sorry we're going to have a link.

257
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:07,460
Just going to say Welcome saying welcome and we'll inject our name.

258
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:13,390
So that's going to be user the user name save that.

259
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,760
Now if you have an if statement you're probably going to have an else statement in order for this to

260
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,110
all work correctly.

261
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,330
So if we don't have any of that what is the right Bargen to look like.

262
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,370
So we'll say

263
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:35,800
else we'll have a list item or 10 give it's a link that says in which makes sense.

264
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,910
So if you're not logged in you're going to want to log in and we'll say this template tag of your el

265
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,130
log in and let's give this a class Alliance rights

266
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,560
nav nav bar dash right.

267
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,600
And if you can see here I believe it should fall under the unordered list class anyways but just because

268
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,930
I'm a little paranoid add it to that particular item as well.

269
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:11,240
And let's scroll over here and what we could do is just have something that says log in but instead

270
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,400
we'll have a cliff icon which is essentially that little icon.

271
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,750
And these are free icons that come with bootstrap.

272
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:25,050
And in order to use them you just use the span and then give this band a class and the class name just

273
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,550
matches up the actual icon you want to use.

274
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,410
So in our case it's g l y glyph and then

275
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:43,280
Sakal can dash user and that's a little kind of Facebook looking face that little profile.

276
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,030
All right.

277
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,470
So that should be it for our number so you can see here if we can review it.

278
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,630
We have everything on the left hand side of my blog with the brand page about Herb Linked-In and then

279
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,620
everything to the right.

280
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,000
If the user is authenticated.

281
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,330
We have these three links you post drafts log out.

282
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:07,780
If they're not authenticated else or we're just going to have pay go to the logon page and it's a picture

283
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,500
of someone it's not even some text now outside of the nav bar we're going to do is set up our actual

284
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,590
content.

285
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,720
So let's do that.

286
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:23,730
Let's put all the content inside some sort of div and we can say have a class called content and then

287
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,380
have another class called container in case we ever want to use it.

288
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,230
And if we're interested in collapsing things like if it's on a mobile display this is where you could

289
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
start adding and things like gross.

290
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,300
So we don't really worry about this too much since we don't intend for people to really read or blog

291
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,670
posts on immobile.

292
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,250
But you would just have the Rosen here and then you can start saying well this class is going to be

293
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:56,210
something like call medium A and then maybe have another class for the blog post that we can link it

294
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,540
up to any CSSA that you want to affect.

295
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,420
But eventually after you've done all your divs what you're going to want is the actual block itself.

296
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,680
So it's going to be block and then contents

297
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,340
or body block whatever you want to call it.

298
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,080
And then we'll have an block here.

299
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:16,910
OK.

300
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,010
So basically you can add in a bunch of divs here that refer to the bootstrap ability to actually collapse

301
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,940
things correctly according to whatever the grid system you worked out with.

302
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:28,880
OK.

303
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,700
So that is it for the base that each team M-file.

304
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,520
It was a lot of typing but stuff like save us some time when we actually work with other templates.

305
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,630
And that was hopefully a good enough explanation of where we got this medium style editor from as well

306
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:49,200
as the Google fonts and as well as this custom CSSA if we go down here for the color changing and the

307
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,730
key thing here to know is that we're going to be using this lower class at the very end to get everything

308
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,510
done.

309
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,830
OK.

310
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:02,100
Make sure you copy and paste this from the notes if you're iffy on actually following along my coding

311
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,010
here.

312
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,500
Thanks and I will see at the next lecture where we begin to extend this to all the other templates.
