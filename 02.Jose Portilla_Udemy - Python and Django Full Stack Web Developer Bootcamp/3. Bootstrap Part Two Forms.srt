00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,210
Hello everyone and welcome to part two of the Bitstrips section we're going to be discussing forms.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,020
A quick note before we actually begin to dive straight into forms of bootstrap.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,910
I want to talk about bootstrap in general for just a little bit.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,050
Many students get intimidated by bootstrap when they first approach it.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,210
They think they need to memorize all the classics that we cover in the section of the course.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,230
Now that's actually certainly not the case.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,950
You want to think of this section more as a guide to the documentation and what's really possible bootstrap

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,930
not as an overview of things that you need it memorize.

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,960
Even the people who work bootstrap often or everyday are going to you're referencing the documentation

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,540
a lot.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,570
Well we really want a master here is the skill of gathering and applying information not just memorizing

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,660
information.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,680
Now it's continue on talking about forms.

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,510
So bootstrap comes with many default classes for forms.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,920
There's two really important ones that are going to be covering here.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,480
And one of the first ones are going to cover is a class called form group.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,040
So let's explore the various form components that we can use of bootstrap and we're going to be referencing

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,630
the course notes quite a bit.

19
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,850
So what I would suggest you do is to open up the part to underscore forms that each T.M. file that's

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,430
under the bootstrap folder.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,550
OK let's jump straight to our browser and to her editor to get started.

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,760
All right so here you have my editor open as well as my browser and if I refresh major T.M. here right

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,190
now I have it linked to my browser this extra Mells linked in it also already has the link to the CD

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,930
version of bootstrap.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,590
There is an empty body to get started.

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,470
I just want to point out where we can find a lot of this information.

27
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,990
If you go to get bootstrapped dot com click on the CSX tab and then click down here where it says forms.

28
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:46,370
They'll take you down to a basic example of forms and we can see here that we need to wrap labels or

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,520
controls in a dot form group for optimum spacing.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,550
And what it says there it's just trying to tell you that it's a class.

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,360
Remember we're dealing of CSSA we reference classes with that period or Dopp.

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,710
So when you actually type in the class it will just be formed up that group you want to actually have

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,730
that dot there.

34
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,770
So let's see this example explore a little bit and see what happens when you wrap everything with a

35
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,230
form group class so I will copy this.

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,380
And it's actually a really nice copy to clipboard button there.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,880
You can just use and I'm going to paste this into my system file save it and then check it out here

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,840
in my browser.

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,100
And we can see right now it stretches from end to end on everything.

40
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,860
So what I can do to organize this.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,270
So it looks a little nicer.

42
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,840
Put it all in a container class and that's something we to be doing.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,470
Often when we use bootstrap as put everything in different container divs.

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,950
So let's paste that there.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,920
The closing tab.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,500
And then grab this entire form and just put it a little more or indented a little more.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,710
All right.

48
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,140
Now that everything is in a container class.

49
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,160
When I refresh you can see it's a little nicely centered.

50
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,500
So so far it's looking pretty good.

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,910
We have our e-mail input our password input and we could see some more advanced inputs things such as

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,290
a Choose file inputs.

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,000
If I click on Choose file we can see that it pops up something for me to choose File.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now right now we actually can't do anything of this because we haven't learned the backend technologies

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,530
such as jingo to actually accept that file and do something with it.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,530
Here we can see just a checkbox and then the submit button.

57
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,950
Now the class I want to talk about with forms is this class form croupe and what the class form group

58
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,430
does is it puts spacing in between components of forms so that they look nicer and they just read a

59
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,380
little better.

60
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:39,390
So to show you what I mean by this I'm going to just delete these divs for the first two refresh and

61
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,100
pay attention to the spacing here.

62
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,780
For email address and password you can see here that they begin to get a little closer.

63
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,540
And when we were dealing with our own input forms for some of the previous projects we saw that we were

64
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,230
using tricks such as adding in a break or adding in an empty paragraph to get that margin spacing nice.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,830
But all that's taken care of for you and bootstrap student controls here.

66
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,800
When you use the class form group and then let me refresh here.

67
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,460
Now we can see the spacing is a little readable more readable now and especially between the actual

68
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,050
blocks of the email address versus the password is just minor things that bootstrap is helping you out

69
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,110
with a lot by having those classes ready for you.

70
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:27,690
In the next class I want to point out is this form control class that's in the input tags.

71
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,520
So we have these imput tags and we give them this class form control.

72
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,870
Let's explore what they do by actually just taking them out.

73
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,790
So there's my foreign control I've taken them out and I refresh over here and we can see that by taking

74
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,760
out the form control on the Impe attacks basically we have what looks like almost normal ASTM L or normal

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,420
CSSA styling I should say.

76
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,160
Let's show one of them on this password and put just to see that difference.

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,060
So with the form control tag I can see that it's rounding the corners it's making it stretch the container

78
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,330
size it's actually highlighting a little differently.

79
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,340
You can see that the highlighting has a bit of a almost like an alpha or a blur around the password

80
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:06,920
box.

81
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,960
Email is highlighting there but it's not as subtle.

82
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,390
And those are really the two classes that are making the forms look nice for bootstrap.

83
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,170
It's the form group and form control tags are classes excuse me they are going to be using all the tags

84
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:27,970
the DIV tag for each form that's the label an input it should have the form group and then each input

85
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,070
should have the form control.

86
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,260
Now let's explore just a few examples of various different inputs to you're going to be using on a form.

87
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:45,670
So I'm going to delete this entire form and then add in things from the notes so I'm copying and pasting

88
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,590
from part to underscore forms.

89
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,030
So let me copy and paste the email submission example.

90
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,350
So here we have a label and put and we've actually already kind of explore this.

91
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,260
But let's refresh.

92
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,140
And this is a typical email address so we have the email address the email input's is where you would

93
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,860
enter your e-mail and then you also notice that it says will never share e-mail to anyone else.

94
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,960
This is really common to have a little explanatory text underneath any input.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,390
A lot of times in an email address to give some sort of a note like this what we use for that is this

96
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:28,850
small tag and we give it the class form text text muted and it says whatever text you want to say behind

97
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,100
that so that small tag basically just says OK a small piece of text.

98
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,080
So it's not same size as a paragraph.

99
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,730
That's another useful tip when you're dealing with forms.

100
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,560
If you ever want to give a little note there for a particular aspect of the input form so that's the

101
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,350
email submission going to delete that.

102
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:52,340
And then I want to put in the password submission not too much to see here let's save it and refresh

103
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,800
and here we can see a password submission again.

104
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:00,830
We've already seen this with bootstrap going to copy and paste the next component that I have in the

105
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,790
notes which is a dropdown select.

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,450
So here we can see we have Supe's the select form and let's copy all this in then a little more just

107
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,840
so it's more readable.

108
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,040
Save it and refresh and here we can see what a dropdown form looks like with bootstrap.

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,380
So if this trip you get this nice interface now we can see that it actually expands the entire width

110
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,550
of the container.

111
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:30,010
Again there are ways to control that with SS or just by adding the container itself but what a drop

112
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,490
down menu looks like with bootstrap.

113
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,080
If we want multiple select Options Let me show you what that looks like.

114
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,470
There has also the class form control here.

115
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,410
So I can copy and paste this save it refresh.

116
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,630
Now we can see here we can have multiple selections.

117
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,620
So if I want to select multiple copies I can do a shift and click and that's basically another example

118
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,850
of something very similar to a dropdown except now I can select multiple options.

119
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:06,010
And the way you do that is you say select just like we did last time but now you say multiple.

120
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,310
So just to reiterate from the last drop down option which I'm going to copy and paste here for you to

121
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:20,570
see the first one I save this and refresh it just a single selection if I want a dropdown that where

122
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:27,610
I can select multiple things using shift or using control or command or you end up doing is in the select

123
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,870
tag you add multiple And that's just a keyword.

124
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:40,170
OK so moving along the couple more is that I want to show you are the text area with bootstrap.

125
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:46,830
You can delete these and put it in text area it's also taking the form control.

126
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,070
I refresh this and we can see a nice text area houses rounded corners.

127
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,000
It has the ability for me to grab this and expand it.

128
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,960
There's the file upload input.

129
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,990
We actually saw that a little bit already.

130
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,710
Well let's paste that in from the notes.

131
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,820
We can see that it's also taking the class if we look here form control dash file.

132
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,680
So that's another important thing to know when you're dealing with type file input.

133
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,390
You want to make sure has the class form dash control dash file and the example here also comes at that

134
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,710
small type that we've seen earlier which is some placeholder block level for help.

135
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,120
So this would say something like oh please input your resume or something like that.

136
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,270
Then you click on Choose file and automatically pops this thing up.

137
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,950
Great.

138
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,160
And like I mentioned before we don't know yet how to actually deal with something when we upload it.

139
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,960
We still need to learn the actual backend technologies for that now there's two more I want to show

140
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,470
you two more examples and that is radio and examples with bootstrap.

141
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,410
So I'm going to copy this and we're going to see a couple new tags that we haven't seen yet.

142
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,930
And those are the field set tags.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,580
So if we come up here we can see we have a field set tag and takes a class form group and the loss of

144
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,240
a legend.

145
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,080
So let's actually refreshes and see what that looks like.

146
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,730
So here we can see radio buttons and that's the legend tag that's making it look like this.

147
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,890
And you can see hopefully it's visible on your screen but I have an underline here because it's a Legin

148
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,870
and so easy option is this and that.

149
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,020
Be sure to include it's great option too.

150
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,250
Option 3 is disabled so if you want something to be the table again that's Option three over here.

151
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,760
You just put in a disabled call right here.

152
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,010
Disabled.

153
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:26,660
All right.

154
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,340
So nothing too fancy going on here.

155
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,730
You can just check that there's classes for each of these.

156
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,310
So if you want it to be disabled you can say form check disabled as the class here instead of just form

157
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,750
check.

158
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,080
So here we have the class form check which is really commonly used for radio buttons.

159
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,600
And as you may have guessed check buttons.

160
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,160
So we're going to put in a check button example here.

161
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
Copy and paste that from the notes

162
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,690
paste it helps get rid of that field set and that division

163
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,650
paste it in here.

164
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,740
So here we have classes form check label is form check label.

165
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,050
Let's refresh see what this looks like.

166
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,100
And here it says check me out.

167
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,610
You can click and click.

168
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,000
Not much going on here.

169
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,830
But if you want it you can put in class form check.

170
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,270
And that's really all there is to forms of bootstrap.

171
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:31,590
So let's copy this entire form from the notes and paste it in so we can see what's something or a bunch

172
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,030
of options would look like I'm going to copy and paste this

173
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,440
and copied everything including the form tags so I will save that refresh and here I can see a really

174
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,650
large form example so I have my email.

175
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,320
I can see the spacing is nice between the various inputs and the password.

176
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,800
There's my example select Here's an example of multiple selects.

177
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,710
Here's my example text area.

178
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,600
Here's the Choose file and put radio buttons.

179
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,360
Check me out.

180
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,700
And then the submit button.

181
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,250
Now we can always callers submit button.

182
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,540
We have different classes.

183
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,330
So before we end this lecture something I really want to stress here is that you do not have to memorize

184
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,730
everything that I just went over and if it seemed like I was just quickly going over many examples but

185
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,570
not diving deep into them that's exactly what we're doing for the section of the course.

186
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,490
Bootstrap is just being able to see what's possible and being able to reference the documentation.

187
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,000
So you have these notes available to you in your class notes if you ever want to make a form with any

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,060
of these you can basically just copy and paste to your own needs.

189
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,770
Or you can always just check out the documentation that has many examples.

190
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,920
So here we see a basic example of a form that we can do things like a focus stay disabled stay etc..

191
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,910
Validation States in line forms is a lot of examples in the documentation.

192
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,340
It can be intimidating at first but really it's all here to help you.

193
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,830
Just normal people referencing this and writing it.

194
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,710
So don't ever be intimidated and if you have any questions posted to the Q&amp;A forums I'm always happy

195
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,580
to help you out.

196
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,360
OK.

197
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,370
Hopefully you now have an idea of what's possible with the forms and bootstrap and that you're going

198
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,490
to be using class formed that group a lot whenever you're actually dictating that you have a forum there.

199
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,010
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
