00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.700
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.850
In this lecture will show you how to add search on your and view pages.

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.270
So we currently only have a few entries in our models just a few movie titles a few customers but with

4
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.760
a more realistic project ends up having hundreds or even thousands of entries.

5
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.400
It's going to be hard to just quickly scroll through and find what you're looking for.

6
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.610
We can add a search in the Admin Page to quickly and easily find what entry we're looking for and Gengel

7
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.380
actually makes this incredibly easy.

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.880
It's essentially just one Ashmit you add into a class.

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.820
So let's hop over to the editor and show you how to do that.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.780
OK I'm back here at the editor and on your abdomen up Paey file remember these classes recreated created

11
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.020
or we could add in fields or the ordering of fields.

12
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.010
We can also do is add in an attribute called Search underscore fields and you can set that equal to

13
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.380
a list of fields you want to actually search in the search box that jingoes going to automatically create

14
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.520
for us.

15
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.140
So for instance for movies you probably just want to search the title.

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.860
You can imagine that if there was a description of this movie you may want to search that as well.

17
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.750
Now the more terms or field you add in here in the search field that means the longer it's going to

18
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.800
take to search something.

19
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.380
However it's relatively quick so it shouldn't be a big deal to add in more fields here.

20
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.050
However we probably don't want to add fields like length unless you intend to search for length in the

21
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.990
search box.

22
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.510
So I'm going to save this so you can see what this actually looks like.

23
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.030
Let me bring in my abdomen page.

24
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.120
So here's my ADD admin page.

25
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.590
And we added a search field to movies so we click on movies Lotusphere.

26
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.660
Now we get this nice little search box and what I can do is I can begin typing something like Indiana

27
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.600
and then hit search and it's going to return anything where Indiana happened to be in that title.

28
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.410
OK.

29
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.010
Now if I'd search something like 1 to 3 or let's say 120 and hit search right now 0 movies pop up because

30
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.770
it's not searching at the length of movies it's only searching the title of movies.

31
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.480
So let's edit that so we can see the effect and I hope that over here and then let's go ahead and say

32
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.830
length is something we can search as well.

33
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.460
Save this.

34
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.960
I'm going to refresh this come back.

35
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.780
The videos come back to movies.

36
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.370
And now I'm going to search for let's say 120 hit search and I see Jurassic Park shows up because remember

37
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.340
now I can search for the link for movies if I click on dress park.

38
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.530
That was the link for that movie.

39
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.060
OK.

40
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.490
That's really it for adding search as he saw it's incredibly easy and incredibly powerful.

41
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.130
All you need to do is inside one of these classes add in the search mute search underscore fields and

42
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.790
then add in a list of fields you want to search or remember to register.

43
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.540
Along with the model.

44
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.140
OK thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
