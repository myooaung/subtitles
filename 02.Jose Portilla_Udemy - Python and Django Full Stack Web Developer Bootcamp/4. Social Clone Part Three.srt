1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,580
Welcome back everyone to part three of the social cloning project.

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,990
Now we're going to continue with the accounts application and we're going to do now is focus on setting

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,030
up our temple HVM elf files for the log page.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,350
The sign up page as well as connecting that to our actual index page with the navigation bar.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,540
Let's get started and hop over to the Adam sex ed..

6
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,570
All right here I am at the Adam text editor.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,010
Now before we get started what we're going to be doing is installing a library called Bootstrap 3 for

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,340
Django or Django Dasch bootstrap 3.

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,970
And what this library does is it formats forms in a really nice way using bootstrap.

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,730
So go ahead and in your virtual environment or even in your default if you're not using your virtual

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:56,170
environment say Pipp install jingo Dasch bootstrap 3 lips and then hit enter and let that install.

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,270
Now I actually already have it.

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,140
So it just set all packages meet the requirements already satisfied.

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,110
But for you inside your virtual environment again say Pipp install Shingo dasht bootstrap 3.

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,420
So that's something we're going to be using throughout the project to actually just make the forms look

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,930
a little nicer.

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,710
Now once you've done that going to go ahead and just clear that come over to your settings that py file

18
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,020
and in your settings up-I file scroll all the way down to where it says installed apps.

19
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,280
And here we're going to say is bootstrap theory and then a comma.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,350
So again Pipp install bootstrap 3 and then add it to your installed application.

21
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,470
It will show you in a little bit how to use it.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,330
It's essentially just the two lines of code.

23
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,260
You load it in and then when you call form say bootstrap form right before it and it will actually make

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,200
it look a lot nicer in your application.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,360
OK let's come back to our accounts templates in logon to HTL and sign up that each team T.M. we're going

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,190
to start off with the Sign-Up parish team L and it's actually going to look really similar to the loggin

27
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,200
that each team L.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,660
So in the sign up page what I'm going to do is say extends and I'm going to extend from base start h

29
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,240
t m l which we're going to work with at the very end of this.

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:14,500
And then the other thing going to do is load bootstrap 3 which is the library just installed so extend

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,110
from base storage Timo that we created earlier and then load bootstrap 3 and then we're going to do

32
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:28,360
is call block content so that content block and then I'm going to create a div of the container class

33
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:38,820
inside of this I'll have a heading 1 saying Sign up and then I will call a form so inside of this form

34
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,590
I'm just going to have a have a class or even an action because the action is going to be taken care

35
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,420
of by jingo.

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,870
And the method should be post and I always like capitalizing it.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,090
It works the same if it's not capitalized but that's just for readability for me.

38
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,900
And inside of this we always need our token.

39
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,150
So you can start typing in C SRF underscore tokin inside a token call like that.

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,090
And then the last thing we're going to do is create a form and once you have bootstrap 3 installed you're

41
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,080
going to say is bootstrap underscore form space form and that's going to allow us to actually make this

42
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,710
form look a lot nicer using bootstrap on our Web page.

43
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,390
And that's a bootstrap theory.

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,300
You can check out the documentation links for it.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,640
But essentially that's the way we're going to be using it for our project.

46
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,680
And then after that inside this form we're going to have an input button.

47
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,680
It's going to be type submit.

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,540
I'll give it a value of Sign-Up.

49
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,970
So that's what it says in the actual button.

50
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,980
It won't have a name but we will give it a class.

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,120
Let's give it a class between PTEN the default and save that.

52
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:50,640
OK then I'm going to select all this of control a and then copy it and bring over my log in that is

53
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,500
HTML file and I'm going to copy and paste this because essentially we're going to be doing something

54
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,850
really similar here.

55
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,490
So I am again going to extend from the base to a small bootstrap 3 block content container but instead

56
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:11,190
of Sign-Up this is not going to say log in and then save that and then the value over here is going

57
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,470
to be log in and then I'm going to save that.

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,070
Okay perfect.

59
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,530
Now let's go ahead and set up our views that PI file and or you are also PI file and the connection

60
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,980
between them.

61
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,710
So coming over to views that pi.

62
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,170
Again this is all under accounts you should already have this from the previous lecture.

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,580
Just sign up create view then go over to your PI.

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,320
Or if we haven't created yet what we need to do is create it.

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,310
So underneath accounts say new file your L's not pi.

66
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,630
So it says new file you are Elle's that PI enter.

67
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,000
And now here we're going to import a couple of things.

68
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:00,370
I'm going to say from Django configuration that you are L's import are el.

69
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:12,440
And then I will say from jingo doc contrib dot th authorization in poor views as off underscore the

70
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,260
views.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,610
Now the reason we're doing this is make sure you have jingle one point eleven at least to do this but

72
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,440
jingle one point eleven introduced a log in view and a log out view.

73
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,900
So we actually don't have to take care of those interviews that py file anymore.

74
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,210
Previously we had to do.

75
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,480
Inside of that pi create a log in view and a log out.

76
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,670
Now Gengel one point eleven has taken care of that for us and that's located under the control of a

77
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,030
T-H views.

78
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,850
So I'm going to say import views as authorization views or ATHM underscore views.

79
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,190
So I don't mix it up with my original views which is here.

80
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,710
So I'm saying now from import views.

81
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,600
So this is going to line number three is going to import my own views that py file.

82
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,440
And so I don't mix the authorization views I'm going to import as authorization views and let's set

83
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,800
up our Apennine so we'll call this app name accounts that way in case I ever want to use your old templates

84
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,630
in my base or each time I'll file for example at the navigation bar I can refer to it as the accounts

85
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,510
application and then we'll set up our world patterns list.

86
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,720
So inside IList I will say Yoro.

87
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,330
And then using regular expression I'm going to say log in and out this is we're going to use that new

88
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:33,310
Gengel one point eleven feature elysÃ©e say off underscore views dots and then the loggin view is the

89
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,420
actual view.

90
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,630
And I'll say as view and that's when you log in every feature of Django one point eleven and then inside

91
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,860
of that I'm actually going to connect it to the template name.

92
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:53,200
So inside a log in view as view I can say template name is equal to and whoops you can do that.

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,580
That's going to be a string and I'll zoom out just a little bit and collapses so we can see the whole

94
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,220
thing.

95
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:08,220
It's going to be accounts slash log in HTL and I'm going to give it the name equal to log in that's

96
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,300
going to be for you are all templates in the future.

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,960
And if you want you can separate us separate this out into more than one line.

98
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,920
Here I'm just writing in one giant line.

99
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,480
But you could just break this up into multiple lines.

100
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,610
So.

101
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,360
All right.

102
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,810
So again this is our logging your you are all connected to log in we call log in view from this authorization

103
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,320
views as View and then pass in the template you want to connect the.

104
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,840
In this case log in each table and give it the name log in for future your templates then a comma here

105
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,400
for our next URL.

106
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,830
And that's going to be pretty similar except it's going to be logged out.

107
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:53,850
So I will say regular expression log outs dollar sign and then I want authorization views and now I'm

108
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:03,570
going to ask for the log out you as a view and set the name equal to log out.

109
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,520
Then finally I will have the sign up view.

110
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,620
So the whole way your el

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:20,410
Sign-Up view right there and then from my view is file say views the sign up view it created as a view

112
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,460
and then I will say name is equal to.

113
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,910
I'll just call this site up.

114
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,840
OK.

115
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,330
And now are your PI file inside of our accounts application is ready and just to quickly review what

116
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,320
we just did here.

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,260
We're already familiar in putting your L's again in importing contrib off views as authorization to

118
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,370
use so I don't mix it up with my own view is that PI file and that's going to allow me to use these

119
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,010
new features a jingle one point eleven log in view and log out view.

120
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,870
A quick note for log in view you have to connect it to your template name for log out view that has

121
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,490
a default view that we can use.

122
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,990
So that's what we're going to do.

123
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,590
Say lock up you as View and then log out.

124
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,800
That will essentially go back to the home page once you log out and that are sign up we already have

125
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,550
that connected.

126
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,840
So I will say sign up as you name sign up and that's all we have to do for our Urals not py file.

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,520
OK.

128
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,420
Now the next step is to actually connect our accounts application to our full project using views in

129
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,110
your L's.

130
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:25,270
So let's open up our tree and come back to simple social pie and then we're going to connect it via

131
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,350
your else.

132
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,560
So right now I'm in the main project.

133
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,600
You are also not py file and let's fill this in so it actually connects to the log in pages for the

134
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,110
accounts we're going to do is over here I will say your l.

135
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,160
So Creedon and Yunior L and using regular expressions we're going to do is say the counts forward slash

136
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:56,570
and then we will say include and I'm going to occlude include accounts you are oles so that you are

137
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,740
also file were just made and then give it the name space.

138
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,380
And this actually should go inside include I will give it the name space.

139
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:15,190
And let's just say accounts here comma and then save that and then the other thing I'm going to do is

140
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:31,440
say are accounts slash and I'm going to include jingo contrib dash or dot th dot or else OK.

141
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,430
And then comma and we're going to leave that as is.

142
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,720
And that should be it for the actual Your file for connecting to the accounts.

143
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,040
So essentially what this is doing is it's connecting the accounts main space to accounts or else.

144
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,510
That way someone has log in or sign up that connects directly to your Olsdorf PI file that we just created

145
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,210
in the accounts application.

146
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,860
Now this jingoes that contrib the author or else that's going to allow us to connect the thing that

147
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,350
Django has under the hood for authorization.

148
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,460
You'll notice that if we hit over on admen PI undercounts we actually really need to register any models

149
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,610
here because we're using jangles built in use user's model so we don't really need to register anything

150
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,510
with the admin remember with users was already included.

151
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,720
Whenever you log into your adamant page so we're just using what has already nicely provided for us.

152
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,080
Now jump over to our base let each team mail file.

153
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,670
So based on each C.M. all the way under our main templates and essentially what I'm going to be doing

154
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,560
is copying pasting from the notes themselves and explaining each copy paste.

155
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:45,280
So the first thing I want to do is let's just give this the title of star social save that and then

156
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,770
underneath or inside this head it should say.

157
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,820
And underneath that title I'm going to be copy and pasting some links.

158
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
So the first thing I'm going to copy and paste is just bootstrap itself.

159
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,940
So let's put that in.

160
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,240
So there's that giant link for the stylesheet to bootstrap the next one I'm going to do is the optional

161
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,560
theme that goes a bootstrap.

162
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,600
So I'm going to copy and paste that as well.

163
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,860
You can copy and paste this either from the bootstrap site or from the notes themselves.

164
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,040
I'd recommend the notes just so we make sure we're all using the same version or on the same page.

165
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:20,700
And then finally and going to copy and paste the javascript line that's again also from the bootstrap.

166
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,150
OK.

167
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,270
So those are my three bootstrap blanks.

168
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:30,400
The other thing that I do is copy and paste a link to a style so the style sheet is going to be linking

169
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,660
to is our own style sheet but also google fonts API.

170
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,490
So we're going to be using this fonts from the Google API.

171
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,550
So as we've seen before I'm just going to link that up in the head and I'm going to link the master

172
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,940
CSSA file.

173
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,930
So let's do that as well.

174
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,200
Underneath this I'm going to link to the M.C. SS.

175
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,980
Now what's important to know is how I'm actually linking this.

176
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,710
You remember that we created a C Ss folder underneath our templates folder and then underneath that

177
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,270
I created the master C Ss file and I'm going to link it using this static call.

178
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,830
So wherever we say that load static I'm going to be able to connect this.

179
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,240
So we just say stylesheet ref.

180
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,800
And this is probably the most important line here as far as getting everything connected will say static

181
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,860
which means go look in the static directory.

182
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,690
So we set up in the settings that py file and then go to simple social C Ss and then master C Ss to

183
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,120
actually link everything.

184
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,880
OK.

185
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,970
Now underneath the body outside of the block I want my actual navigation bar.

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,250
So let's actually build this together.

187
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:42,570
And I will say nav and there's my nav and in my nav I will say class and it will give this a nav bar.

188
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,590
My nav.

189
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:51,080
And then we can actually just give it the default rules so I'll say this is rule navigation.

190
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,830
You can basically just copy and pasted it from the documentation.

191
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,880
But I want to walk through it just in case you end up copying pacing and are wondering what's going

192
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,530
on here.

193
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,150
So I gave it this class nav bar my nav my nav is something I'm going to be using later on.

194
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,860
So that's my own special navigation.

195
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,310
In case you ever want to add your own CSO styling.

196
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:18,030
You can do is just kind of tack on classes and then the next thing to do is set up a div here and I'll

197
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,930
call this container from Bootstrap that we've seen before that goes inside nav bar.

198
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,400
And now it's time to add an anchor and the actual link is going to be to our home page.

199
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:35,020
So we're going to do this with a your all template tagging and we will say you are el and give it the

200
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:42,190
name home that will link to the Home link and then we're also going to say here let's just say this

201
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:49,030
will be store social and let's make this into an actual brand which means I'm going to say the class

202
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:58,750
of this anchor tag is nav bar dash brand and I will tack on my nav class in case everyone at the CSSA

203
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,710
for that.

204
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,220
So again right now my name navigation.

205
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,470
It's all in a container.

206
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,030
I set my brand.

207
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,810
Remember that's that large home button that goes all the way to the left.

208
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,340
And now I'm going to start an unordered list.

209
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:23,430
And inside this unordered list I will say class is equal to now have nav bar dash nav nav bar dash right.

210
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,460
So kind of right align everything.

211
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,310
And these are going to be just a couple of buttons things that go to a post a group a create group and

212
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,180
a log out page and then a log in page and assign a page.

213
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,320
Now some of these we won't be able to fill it out right away because we haven't actually created them.

214
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,990
So we're going to kind of leave certain links blank and then we'll fill them in later.

215
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,430
OK.

216
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,400
First thing I want to do is I want to check if a user is authenticated so a user object is going to

217
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:57,830
be returned to this web page so I can actually check using some template tags if the user dot net can

218
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:03,950
call the is authenticated attribute off of this which means so the user is authenticated they logged

219
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,150
in.

220
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,300
It's been successful.

221
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,830
And we're going to basically see what the actual navigation bar will look like.

222
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,560
So I put in list objects and there's an ordered list an anchor tag here and right now I will leave that

223
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,580
blank as an address but it's actually going to say inside this anchor.

224
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,050
It's just going to be post.

225
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,220
So that means that the users are locked in.

226
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,970
They can then have a little button in their navigation bar that allows them to post something.

227
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,690
The next thing to do is again list anchor tag.

228
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,020
And this will be groups.

229
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,540
So if the user is logged in they'll be able to see the groups again and leave that blank.

230
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,460
We haven't actually created any groups yet.

231
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,870
And then again after a log then I'm going to allow them to create a group.

232
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,350
So we'll have a create group option over there.

233
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,540
And then finally I'm going to have a log out.

234
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,810
So if the user has authenticated that means they are logged in.

235
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,640
So we should probably have a log out button here.

236
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,960
It will say log out and this one I can fill in because I do have a Treffry to go.

237
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:12,850
So we're going to say for the your template is going to be called to in a string accounts colon log

238
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,130
out and that connects to that your Else up-I which connects to that log up view.

239
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,810
And now I'm ready to do the other options in case my user is not authenticated meaning they haven't

240
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,740
logged in yet.

241
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,060
So else they have a log then I will do the following.

242
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,200
I'll create a group's tag.

243
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,790
So you should still be able to see the groups.

244
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,680
Whoops let me do it.

245
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,360
Tref call in here.

246
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,650
And just type in groups and they're the anchor.

247
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,510
So we still be able to see the groups even if you're not logged in.

248
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,780
That we can just kind of visit as an and not logged in user.

249
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:56,190
And then the other option we're just going to be either log in or to sign up.

250
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,840
And these actually do have the links right.

251
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,990
So we just create them.

252
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:07,760
So let's create those here I will say your el accounts log in for this guy.

253
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:18,640
And then in the H.F. here for the sign up it will say your el accounts sign up save.

254
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,790
And then as always if I have an if statement with templates I need to say.

255
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,080
And if so and if.

256
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,680
OK.

257
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,280
So we're going to be filling this a lot more into your posts in groups created.

258
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,100
But right now we're just using the basics.

259
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,900
I have accounts log out log in and sign up and that ends my unabridged list.

260
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,940
So that should end my navigation bar and then I'll have my content.

261
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,470
And actually I'm going to wrap this content in a class container so I will see a container and then

262
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:55,550
I'm also going to put in my content which can be a class I later edit in my CSSA file that master C

263
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,120
Ss and let's put the content inside of this.

264
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:04,580
OK so going all the way down to the bottom we're going to eventually link to our javascript.

265
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,390
Right now we don't have a javascript file that we've been messing around with but we'll take care of

266
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,790
that later.

267
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,880
So let's just save that.

268
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,660
So by now we should have a simple navigation bar.

269
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,710
A lot of the links are just empty.

270
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,940
But we should at least be able to see the empty buttons themselves so we'll see some of that says Post

271
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,220
groups create groups and this will allow us to kind of check if user authentication is working.

272
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,830
So that's our based H.T. mail file and we should already have the index file ready to go.

273
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,530
Since we've done that earlier.

274
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,110
OK.

275
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,030
Our template files should be ready to go.

276
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,260
We still have to do a couple of things such as make them migrations and make sure the accounts are fully

277
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,980
set up.

278
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,760
We're going to do that in the very next lecture.

279
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,110
So I will see you right then and we'll continue on right where we left off here.
