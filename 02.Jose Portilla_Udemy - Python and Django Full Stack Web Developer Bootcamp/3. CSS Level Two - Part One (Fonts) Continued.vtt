00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.610
Hello everyone and welcome back we're going to continue our discussion from last time of part 1.

2
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.530
Talking about funds in the last lecture we showed some basic CSSA properties for font's.

3
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.690
Now we're going to explore how to understand OS choice and Fonte relationship will also show how to

4
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.370
use custom wet funds.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.630
Let's get started by jumping into our browser checking out a few links.

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.670
All of these links are provided as comments in the Part 1 font's h tim L and CSSA files that come with

7
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.110
the download for this course.

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.870
Let me top the browser now.

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.670
OK so the first two links so I want you to check out the official wikipedia links for the list of typefaces

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.470
included with Microsoft Windows and on the second link here with Mac OS.

11
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.430
And you can just scroll down and see the latest fonts added for Mac OS.

12
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.220
And if you scroll further down you can see the family name subtype faces available.

13
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.320
So as I mentioned the previous lecture not every font is going to have every face or style available

14
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.440
every font can be shown as a taluk or bold.

15
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.660
And here you can check out the Wikipedia links for more information on the faces available.

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.760
That's that bold taluk etc. and the typeface is available now if you're choosing a font and you want

17
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.590
to know availability on both platforms.

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.150
You can check out this Web site called CSSA font stack dot com and it has a really nice display of a

19
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.880
font and then the percent of availability on Windows computers and Mac Peters So if we zoom in here

20
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.730
for a second we can see something like Arial is a font that is available on 99 percent of Windows and

21
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.470
98 percent of Mac computers.

22
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.560
So it's a pretty safe choice for pretty much most operating systems that are using Windows or Mac.

23
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.640
And that goes for Ubuntu as well.

24
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.120
So there are other choices that may not be as safe for instance something like optima is really only

25
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.010
available on Mac computers at 94 percent and available only about 3 percent of Windows computers.

26
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.310
So if you're trying to choose a default font try to choose something that has high availability on both

27
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.870
Mac and Windows.

28
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.030
Well let's say you're wanting to choose your own font.

29
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.420
Well you can actually download fonts from the Internet and you can either download the font file itself

30
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.220
and link it to your project locally which is what you'll do when you host everything.

31
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.920
But you can also just link to an actual Cdn or a link itself.

32
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.650
Let me go ahead and explore how we can do that.

33
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.480
There's two Web sites we're going to be exploring.

34
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.070
One is Fahnestock Google dot com which is a really great Web site to download fonts from.

35
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.130
And the other one is font library the org which kind of has a little bit of a goofier fonts but it does

36
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.010
have some pretty nice fonts as well.

37
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.910
Let's explore how we can actually grab one of these fonts and put it into our Web site.

38
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.260
So if you come to Fahnestock google.com you're basically looking at the rectory of a lot of font families

39
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.210
and you can clarify what kind of font you're looking for maybe something like handwriting monospace

40
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.110
trending and maybe you're looking for a specific language et cetera number styles Thicknesse.

41
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.480
So let's look at one that's really obviously not a font that comes on your computer.

42
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.910
So this one right here.

43
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.240
Baria let's click on that.

44
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.800
Click on the plus sign to add it.

45
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.930
And here we see the family selected.

46
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.650
Now if I click on that I see this right here and you'll notice that it says embed font so to embed your

47
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.160
selected fonts on a web page.

48
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.120
Copy this code into the head of your team document and then it tells you what to specify and assess.

49
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.190
So you use the following CSSA rules to specify these families barrio.

50
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.480
And then you can also say cursive.

51
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.500
So let me show you how we can do that.

52
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.510
And you also notice that it has a low time of fast.

53
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.810
So loading this using these links is going to take a little bit of time because your Web site is going

54
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
to connect to Google but you can also download the font itself.

55
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.120
But let's try just with the embedding.

56
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.990
So I will copy this link.

57
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:06.250
And jumped to my text editor and here you have the text editor open and in the head of the HTML file.

58
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.610
This is part one of fonts from last time.

59
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.990
I'm going to save this right here and it's just a reference to zoom out a little bit to the actual link.

60
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.800
So you Fahnestock Google API.

61
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.870
So right here I've added the link and now I can come over here.

62
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.230
And let's say we want the paragraphs to actually have the fonts that we just downloaded.

63
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.480
So let me delete some of the stuff from last time.

64
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.010
That will delete most of it except for the paragraph and we'll take care of font family and we're going

65
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.810
to copy and paste what is here.

66
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.450
This font family line.

67
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:51.090
So I will copy that and then come back to the Adam text editor and paste that right there.

68
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.660
So let me save that.

69
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.980
You have part 1 fonts we can't copy that full path.

70
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.280
They just come here it's the directory copy full path.

71
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:10.160
And now let's paste it into our browser and here we can see that I have this sort of funky font from

72
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.140
that Google API.

73
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.700
So it's really easy to add in new fonts using Google fonts API.

74
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.570
And if you wanted to you could also download the font and link to the file locally.

75
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.380
We'll be talking a lot more about linking stuff locally versus linking stuff online when we talk about

76
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.040
bootstrap.

77
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.730
But the main idea I want you to get out of this lecture is that you can come to Google fonts.

78
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.970
Pick any font that looks good to you.

79
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.270
Add it to what is essentially almost like a shopping cart.

80
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.070
And then check this out and it will actually begin to add.

81
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.100
So here if I wanted to use two different types of families fonts you can see here that Google has automatically

82
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.490
already added them to the link so that I can get rid of barrio the first one and then only have this

83
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.640
play fair display font and tells you what to specify in the CSSA to actually specify those families.

84
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:07.630
The other web site I want to show you about fonts is not Google fonts but this font library that which

85
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.020
is also in other web site that hosts open source funds and a key thing to remember is that some fonts

86
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.300
can actually be really expensive and are not free.

87
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.560
So not all fonts are free.

88
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.920
You're going to have to make sure that you check the copyright and whether or not you have permission

89
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.030
to use a font on Google fonts all these fonts are free and open source.

90
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.260
You can check them out.

91
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.480
Same with font library.

92
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.200
ORG but on other Web sites sometimes you have to pay to get access to a fund.

93
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.780
So make sure you keep that in mind.

94
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.160
Malicious show you how to grab something from library or going to go check out a handwriting fonts.

95
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.360
Click on it over here.

96
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.840
Let's choose a song that says Alex brush.

97
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.050
So I click on that one here I see the the font what it looks like.

98
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.590
Great.

99
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.190
And then it says to use this font it's very much the same thing we're doing.

100
00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:04.480
So I just copy this link put it in the head of my H Tim L file so let's get rid of the last one.

101
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.830
Paste that in there.

102
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.170
Save it and then over on the C Ss I can see what I have to use so we'll just copy and paste that I'm

103
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.210
showing right now for an example paragraph.

104
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.820
So we'll come back up here and paste the whole thing in there.

105
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.460
So now I'm just calling Alice.

106
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.950
Alex brush regular save that.

107
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.440
And let's come back up here and refresh this page and we can see now I'm using that Alex brush font.

108
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:28.770
All right.

109
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:34.060
Hopefully you realize this is actually a pretty simple process just linking to the head of each team

110
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.450
document and then using the information in your CSSA.

111
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.390
So basically use now any font you want.

112
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.850
Does it have to actually be included on Windows or Macs.

113
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:49.420
You'll be loading it directly from this Web site Google font or library org.

114
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.990
All right.

115
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.130
That's all I wanted to talk about for this lecture.

116
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.300
Do you have any questions feel free to post them to the Kewaunee forums.

117
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.130
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
