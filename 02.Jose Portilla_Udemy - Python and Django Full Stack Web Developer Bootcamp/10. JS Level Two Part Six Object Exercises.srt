Hello everyone and welcome back to part six objects exercise.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,010
So for this exercise check out the file Part 6 underscore objects underscore exercise that Jap's which

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,850
is under the javascript level 2 folder it contains three objects.

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,890
Along with tasks that involve you adding methods to each of these objects.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,310
Let's take a quick look at this file and what you have to do.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,020
OK so this is what the file looks like.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,810
It has three problems which have three basic objects.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,600
You get an object that looks like this for the first one and then we want you to add a method called

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,200
name length that prints out the length of an employee's name to the consul.

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,570
And then for problem to you're given the same object this employee object with the name job and age.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,390
And we want you to write a program that will create an alert in the browser of each of the objects values

12
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,520
for the key value pairs.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,180
So for example it should ILIR name is John Smith job as programmer age is 31.

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,750
So remember the use of this keyword in order to solve this and then back to Problem 3 the very last

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,310
one.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,370
We just want you to add a method called last name that prints out the employee's last name to the council.

17
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,690
And for this you got to do a little bit of research because notice the name comes as just a single string

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,660
with a space in between and you're going to need to figure out how to split a string to an array.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,010
And there's a hint here linked to W3 schools where they show you how to do that.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,670
Right.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,850
Those are the three problems.

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,900
Pretty simple.

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,420
I'll see at the next lecture where we actually cut through the solutions.
