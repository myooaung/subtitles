1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,600
Well everyone welcome back to part for a re exercise.

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,530
It's now time to practice using arrays in a more realistic situation.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,500
And we're going creating a very simple student roster at using the javascript code that we know so far.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:27,640
Go ahead and check out for Array exercise se him I'll file open it up in your browser and read the instructions

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,140
there.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,490
I'm going to hop over to my browser with that file open to explain the actual exercise.

7
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,340
OK so I have here the h him l file for open in my browser and like I mentioned for this exercise we're

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,890
making a very simple web app that contains an array of student names in a javascript file using an array

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,450
and the Web site is going to prompt you for four possible commands Add Remove display and quit.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,440
So those are things that you're actually going to type in and this web page will prompt the user for

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,700
one of those commands.

12
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,370
And then here's what these commands should do so.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,400
And it will then create a prompt for a student name request.

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,600
Then we add this name to the student to the array of the student names in the script file.

15
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,050
Remove will create a prompt for a student named requests.

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,520
Then remove this name from the roster array display will print out the roster using console log in quit

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,660
will end the while loop of prompts.

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,120
So let me actually show you what this would look like.

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,770
I'm going to refresh this page and run through what this may actually look like.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,920
First off it asked me Would you like to start the roster webapp Y or N..

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,430
Yes or no.

22
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,530
I'll enter y.

23
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,320
OK.

24
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:47,020
And then it says Please select the action Add Remove display or quit point to add and what name would

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,130
we like to add.

26
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:53,210
And we're going to be worried about single word name so first names only.

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,130
I would like that Jose.

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,780
And then it says Please select an action add remove this player quit so I will say this play and if

29
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,490
I hit OK I can see here in the Consul that I successfully added Jose incident roster.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,050
Now annoyed to add another name.

31
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,710
Let's add Sam and Naledge display the roster again.

32
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,650
I see now I have Jose and Sam in the array the consul.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:35,230
Now let's add one more name and I will add Franki books that he selects and action ad now it like that

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,450
Frankie analogise display.

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,600
I have Jose samen Frankie.

36
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,500
Let's see what remove does.

37
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,010
So it says Please select the action I type remove and then it says what name would you like to remove

38
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,230
or remove my name Jose let's display aere.

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,340
And here we see Sam and Frankie so I successfully removed Jose and then to end all this.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,410
I'll just quit and it says thank you for using the web app.

41
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,840
Please refresh page start over.

42
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,090
OK that's it.

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,510
All right.

44
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,440
So there is a javascript file that actually has a bunch of hints and comments.

45
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,220
It's basically a walkthrough guide to help you out with this project going to take a look at it now.

46
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,750
So the file you want to use and link to your east him file is called part for underscore array.

47
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,090
Underscore exorcized javascript.

48
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,400
This is a javascript file that just has a bunch of comments in it.

49
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,620
Comments and hints.

50
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,900
It's optional to use if you want you can go straight into the exercise without referencing this javascript

51
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,950
file at all.

52
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,830
But I would recommend that you check out the javascript file for the hints and the structure it provides.

53
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,170
So again this is available to you.

54
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,030
It basically tells you what to do.

55
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,760
So for instance we've already created the roster for you.

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,940
The variable roster and we want you to create functions for the tasks so add in use today.

57
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,600
Create a function called add new that takes in a name uses that push to add a new students to the array.

58
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,250
Then the remove student and we actually have hints here on stack overflow.

59
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,880
We haven't shown you how to write a function called remove that takes in a name and then finds its index

60
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,100
location that removes them from the roster.

61
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:21,200
So there is a link here a stack overflow that will tell you how to remove a particular element from

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,450
an array.

63
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,030
Now we have the splay roster.

64
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,770
Just create a function called display that prints up the roster con..

65
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,570
That's pretty easy it's cons. that log basically and then start by asking if they want to use the web

66
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,770
app yes or no.

67
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,740
And now at the very bottom this is where all your logic is going to go.

68
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,720
Create a while loop.

69
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,120
It keeps asking for an action.

70
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,090
Add Remove this player quit and then use if and else if statements to execute correct functions that

71
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,360
we created above for each of those commands are right.

72
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,020
You have any questions on this.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,670
Feel free to post the Kewney forums.

74
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,760
You can always check out the javascript solutions if you get stuck on something or just hop straight

75
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,990
to the next lecture.

76
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,080
Run be coding through the solutions to this exercise.

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,220
Thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next lecture.
