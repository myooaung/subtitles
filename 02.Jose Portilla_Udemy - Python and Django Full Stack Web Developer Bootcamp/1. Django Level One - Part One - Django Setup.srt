00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,510
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,280
We're going to be getting started with Django.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,030
We finally reached the moment we've been waiting for throughout the whole course using our Python skills

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,240
and all our front end skills along with the jayega web framework before we actually dive into the technical

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,460
details of Django.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:28,270
Let's learn a little more about it than it's really interesting background Django is a free and open

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,030
source web framework.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,450
And being a web framework it really allows us to solve two major problems.

9
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:41,230
It allows us to map a requested your from a user to the code that's actually meant to handle it and

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,690
then it also allows us to create that requested HVM dynamically.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,610
So using templates which we'll learn about later on we can actually inject calculated values or information

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,930
from the database into an aged female page to show to the user.

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,190
So we're going to be really connecting all the front end stuff to the backend stuff through this web

14
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,000
framework.

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:07,380
And Django is extremely popular it's used by many sites including things such as Pinterest PBS Instagram

16
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,600
bit bucket Washington Times Mozilla and much more.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,790
You can check out the official Gengel Web site for a whole list of example web sites that operate using

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:22,760
jingoes web framework Django was created in 2003 when the Web developers at the Lawrence Journal World

19
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,160
newspaper started using Python for their development and the fact that it originated at a newspaper

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,290
is actually really important to the culture that surrounds Django because the original developers were

21
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,030
surrounded by those newspaper writers good written documentation is a key part of Django.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,880
And we're going to be exploring documentation as we go along through this part of the course and that

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,980
also means that you have excellent references to check out on the official Django documentation pages

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,020
jingo has its own excellent basic tutorial where you're basically walk through creating a basic pulling

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,400
web application.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,810
And I would definitely suggest that you check out that polling tutorial later on throughout this course

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,480
and also the reason it's a pull is because that also extends back to newspaper routes.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,440
If you're on a newspaper Web site you may want to pull your readers to see whether or not they agree

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,850
with the topic of a story.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,580
So when encountering Django tutorials you're going to often read that you should use what's called a

31
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,750
virtual environment or you'll sometimes also see it as V and V.

32
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,360
Let's talk about what a virtual environment is.

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,650
How do you use it and why it's so important to use one whenever you're working with Django for a large

34
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,620
project.

35
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,430
The virtual environment allows you to have a virtual installation of python and packages on your computer.

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,820
So why would you ever actually want or need this.

37
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,260
You've already installed Python.

38
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,420
Why bother with a virtual environment.

39
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,320
Python packages change and get updated often and there are changes that sometimes break backwards compatibility

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,490
that your web application or web project made depend on.

41
00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,020
So what do you do if you want to test out the new features of a package update but you also don't want

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,850
to break your current web application.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,600
After all you can't just take down your web site every time a package gets updated.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,260
Well that's where the virtual environment comes in.

45
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,780
You can create a virtual environment that contains the newer version of the package or the virtual environment

46
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,620
for your older version of the package.

47
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,610
And luckily Anaconda makes this really easy for us.

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,690
A virtual environment handler is already included.

49
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,060
So to use this virtual environment with Conder you're going to use the following commands.

50
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,550
Now we'll walk through this and just a little bit but the Kada create command initiated the virtual

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,240
environment.

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,320
So we say Konda create space dash dash name and then another space and you type in the name of your

53
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,950
environment.

54
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,950
So in this case I've called my environment my E and V there and then the last word there.

55
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,790
Django is going to say well what package do I want to initiate this environment with an Konda requires

56
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,360
that.

57
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,340
So you'll say create dash dash.

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,650
Name the name of your virtual environment and then the package that you want to start that environment

59
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,060
with and later on you can specify a specific version for that package.

60
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,900
So you can say Django something like equals equals 1.9 or 1.8 1.10 etc and then you could activate that

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,760
environment with activate space.

62
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,190
The name of the environment and this all happens at the command line.

63
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,820
Now anything installed with Pitt or Khanda when this environment is activated will only really be installed

64
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,980
for that environment.

65
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,780
So that allows you to create separate versions of packages and pythons all on one computer with the

66
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,720
use of these virtual environments.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,230
And then you can deactivate the environment with deactivate my envie or the name of the environment

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,440
and it's highly encouraged to use virtual environments for your projects to keep them self-contained

69
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,610
and not run into issues and packages are updated.

70
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:48,990
All right.

71
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,290
So let's jump to our command line and show you an example of actually creating a virtual environment.

72
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:00,380
OK here I am at the Adam text editor and before we get started by walking through a virtual environment

73
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,410
using Konda what I wanted to point out is that Konda itself has really good documentation on creating

74
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,000
virtual environments or managing environments and it's linked to in the resource notes.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,560
But let me jump to that Web site real quick over here and show you what it looks like.

76
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,850
Just go to the IO slash thok slash using slash and VS for Environment study CML or just google search

77
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,400
Konda environments should take you to this page or just use the resource link.

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,130
But this has a lot more details on what we're going to be showing here.

79
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,950
Shows you how to create an environment change an environment clone an environment remove etc..

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,170
So if you ever have any questions further than what we discuss here you have this documentation that

81
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,140
will walk you through all of these steps.

82
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,450
So we're going to be doing is creating an environment and there's an example here Conda create dash

83
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,460
dash name.

84
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,620
They're calling their environment snowflake's and it uses bio Python.

85
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,890
So let's create a virtual environment that will create a virtual environment for Django for us.

86
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,930
So I will come back to Adam klick plus here to open up my terminal.

87
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:14,540
And then what I will do is say this Konda create a dash dash name and let's call this my Django E and

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,700
the.

89
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:22,940
And then I will type Django because that's the package I want to initiate my Django envy or environment

90
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,630
with.

91
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:30,010
I will hit enter and what it's going to do is download that Gengel package if I don't have it already

92
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:36,890
and then apply it to that virtual environment and Conda is actually pretty smart and it will know that

93
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,860
if you have already a similar version of Django somewhere install on your computer it may not need to

94
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,620
copy it you just referenced it that way you don't need to download anything it'll just reference previous

95
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,670
installations.

96
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,870
I don't have Jeng on this computer yet so it will do is fetch that meta data and let me expand this

97
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,700
shew what happens.

98
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,360
And it will ask you hey these new packages are going to be installed.

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,550
Is that OK with you.

100
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,180
And I will say no right now because I actually don't want Python 2.7.

101
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,730
I want Python 3.

102
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:19,500
So what I'm going to do is say no on proceed and instead I will say this Conda creates name and let's

103
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:29,690
say my Jingo and B and instead of starting with J go I'm going to start it with Python 3.

104
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,780
And the reason I'm doing this is to show you an example of specifying a specific version of Python or

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,070
a package.

106
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,150
So it's a very similar process you say Konda create dash dash.

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,770
Name the name of your actual environment.

108
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,830
And in this case instead of a package I will say Python and then you say equals and then you type in

109
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,120
the version number you want.

110
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,810
So for instance I want Python 3.5.

111
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm going to enter it will fetch that packet's meta data again.

112
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,760
It will show me the new packages that will be installed here I can see that I have the correct version

113
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,800
of Python I want 3.5.

114
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,780
You can also do a 3.6 depending on when you're actually viewing this course if that's been added to

115
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,450
Khanda.

116
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,470
But let's stick with something 3.4 or above.

117
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,800
So 3.4 3.5 3.6.

118
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,030
Those should all work fine for what we're going to be doing.

119
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm going to proceed on that select Y.

120
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,160
And then I will jump forward in time for this to all being downloaded and installed.

121
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,570
I'll see you there.

122
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,610
All right so that has finished installing and now we actually get the instructions so to activate this

123
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,290
environment we can use activate and then the name of the environment and then deactivate it once we're

124
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,340
done using it we can say deactivate and that will deactivate the environment.

125
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,620
And if we ever want to use it again we can easily just activate it with the activate command.

126
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,090
And if you're on a Mac or Linux computer and you're using bash you probably have to use source.

127
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,810
So keep that in mind.

128
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,310
All right.

129
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,600
Now that we've set up our actual environment it's time to activate it.

130
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,390
A quick note.

131
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,000
In case you forget what environments you have on your computer you can easily list them through this

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,580
command Konda info dash dash E and V S and this will list all the environments you have here I just

133
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,700
have my default Anaconda the root environment and then this environment I created my Django Ian V and

134
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,610
depending on what Anaconda version you initially installed this may say Anaconda 3 instead of Anaconda's

135
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,850
2 but lets actually activate this environment.

136
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:39,080
If you're on Linux or Mac OS and you're using bash you will probably have to say Source activate and

137
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,660
then the name of the environment.

138
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,240
Django E and VI.

139
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,630
Since I'm on a Windows computer right now I don't need to specify source.

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,880
So let's bring that back down to just activate my Django E.A..

141
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,950
I hit enter and it will activate the environment.

142
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,860
And the way I can tell that the environment is activated is she should see here parentheses might Django

143
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,450
envy and that means that everything I do right now in regards to Python is going to only take effect

144
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,480
on this environment which means if I decide to install a Django in this environment it's only going

145
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,340
to be installed.

146
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,660
That specific version of Django for this virtual environment.

147
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,490
In fact let's do that now.

148
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:24,980
I will say Konda install Django enter and this will install the latest version of Django.

149
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,280
And for this course basically any version of Django that's higher than 1.8 should work just fine.

150
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,970
So 1.8 1.9 or at the time of this course 1.10 should be fine let's say proceed y.

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,620
But I do encourage you to at least use 1.10 that way everything we do in this course matches up exactly

152
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,440
with what's on your computer.

153
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,240
OK.

154
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,010
We're going to hop forward in time for this to finish installing and downloading.

155
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,380
All right.

156
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,930
So that finished installing Django to this virtual environment.

157
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,910
And if I want to confirm this virtual environment is actually working correctly I can just type in Python

158
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,190
into this command line.

159
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,780
And I notice that the version of Python here matches the version of the environment.

160
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:16,080
If I were to say quit and then deactivate this environment suffice just say de-activate notice I'm no

161
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,530
longer in the virtual environment.

162
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:23,960
So if I say Python now I'm back to my original installation of Python which happens to be this 2.70

163
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,620
version.

164
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,010
So that's a nice little confirmation that you're in the virtual environment and you're actually doing

165
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,780
effects on that environment.

166
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,340
Let's say quit and we're ready to go.

167
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,200
OK.

168
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,200
So we did a lot of housekeeping stuff in this lecture haven't actually dived into Django but a lot of

169
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,450
this stuff is really important and it's going to clear you of headaches later on if you don't learn

170
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,280
how to actually use virtual environments correctly.

171
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,360
So by this lecture you should have a full understanding of virtual environment at least how to create

172
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,140
them activate them and deactivate them.

173
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:02,540
You can always reference that link in the resources if you want more information about the environments

174
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,240
and you should have installed Django to your virtual environment.

175
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,370
Coming up next we're actually going to get started with using Django.

176
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,570
Thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next lecture.
