00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,940
Hello everyone and welcome back to the solution lecture part one for the front and PROJECT.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,280
We're going to be cutting through the solution for the connect for game.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,730
Let's get started by hopping over to our editor.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,300
OK.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:22,630
So to get this project started I have three files in HTL file a CSSA file and a javascript's File.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,990
We're going to start off with the HTL then we'll Stylo some CSSA.

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,950
And then finally the majority of our time is going to be spent coding through the logic we have.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,020
Jake Query and Javascript.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,460
Let's get started with the HMO.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,120
So the smell is actually quite straightforward.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,660
First we just do the basic aist him all call.

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,300
We can give it the title K'NEX for save that.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:48,920
And then I want to link to bootstrap as well as my own CSSA file.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:56,480
So let's start with my C Ss which is I have it just being called game that C Ss let me save that and

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,390
I'm going to copy and paste the Cdn link for bootstrap and you can just copy and paste this yourself

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,030
either from the notes or from Boots get bootstrap dot com.

17
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,610
So there's a C and for bootstrap lets make sure everything's working just by saying hello in the heading

18
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,620
and refreshing our age Tim Page.

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,260
OK it looks like it's connected networking.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,190
Let's start by putting everything into a div container so that we keep it organized and centered on

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,070
the page.

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:34,880
And I will make sure that it's completely aligned centered by saying a line center as a parameter in

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:50,080
that div and all have one say welcome to Connect for all have heading to say something like connect

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,100
4 chips to win and then H-3 will say

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,190
let's start or want to delete this refresh.

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,470
Make sure everything is working.

27
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,710
Looks like it's good.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,740
Now the task we have to accomplish is actually constructing the table that's going to be connect 4.

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,450
So what I am going to do and you don't have to do it this way there's many ways you can bill at this

30
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,810
table to create a table row with each table cell.

31
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,580
What's containing a button inside of it.

32
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,620
And then something else going to do is make sure I call table here.

33
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:43,590
Let's put this row back and say that table and then let's give this table a class equal to board so

34
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,950
we can reference it later.

35
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,770
Although this will be just the only table tagging RHC mail we could just use the table tags or reference

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,540
it later on who will give it a class so it makes a little more sense.

37
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,120
And then finally type button.

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,990
We don't need a name for this button.

39
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,550
And the button itself can be blank.

40
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,280
So the idea is we're going to be clicking buttons on and off we'll have them change color to depict

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,250
whether the chip is inside of that area or not.

42
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:17,790
And we need to add a couple more cells to this row so we can just copy and paste this.

43
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,720
There we go.

44
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,650
So let's save that.

45
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,290
It's going to be seven cells per row.

46
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:32,370
And then I can just copy and paste this row and then continue on and connect four has six total rows.

47
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,910
So I need to do this five more times.

48
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,570
Let's make sure that's one row to row three row for row five row six row I believe.

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,400
But let's actually make sure of this by refreshing our page here I can see a little table it's kind

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,470
of messed up and that's because it's actually not inside of our container class.

51
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,270
Let's bring this div all the way down here.

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,510
Save this refresh.

53
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:10,200
Now I can see I have a seven cell across and the rows and six rows total grape.

54
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:19,270
Finally I want to T.M. connect my script so I'm going to call scripts and I will connect this to the

55
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,810
can say source.

56
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,330
I actually don't need to specify the type for now.

57
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,490
We'll call it my script that just that's what my empty files called right now.

58
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,390
And then I also want to connect it to a query.

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,830
So again we just copy and paste to see the end point to do that here.

60
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,570
You can either do it from the notes or from code that just queried dot com.

61
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,080
So we have our east T.M. all set up.

62
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,170
We're going to do now is style a little bit so that these buttons actually make sense.

63
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,620
You can see here it can kind of click on these buttons right now but it's way too small.

64
00:04:51,540 --> 00:05:00,200
OK so to start off to see SS I'm going to call the board and then every button within that.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:12,500
And then let's give them all a whiff of 100 pixels about the Kallen and a height of 100 pixels going

66
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,560
to save this.

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,460
And here we can see we're starting to get something that looks quite a bit nicer.

68
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,270
So if I zoom out a little bit here we now have our connect four board.

69
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:28,970
Let's keep styling it a little more let's give them all the background color that's gray.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,770
Right now they have a bit of a fade to them.

71
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,780
So if we refresh we can see they're all gray now.

72
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,960
We'll give them a bit of a margin.

73
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,440
So we have a little space in between them save that come appear refresh.

74
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,730
That's nice.

75
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,050
And let's make them round.

76
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,710
So to make them round we use border radius and we can just set this to be at 50 percent and that should

77
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,310
make them circles OK.

78
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,240
And then we get this kind of a weird effect over here when we click and the way to get rid of that is

79
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,720
by giving them a border will give them a four pixel solid black border.

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,810
Save refresh.

81
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,230
And here we can see our board is now complete.

82
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,850
OK.

83
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,360
So our HTL is done and our CSSA is done.

84
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,020
Everything looks to be styled correctly.

85
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,180
Coming up next we're going to be doing is dealing with the majority of our code which is all happening

86
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,010
on the javascript's side.

87
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,240
Thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next lecture.

88
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,910
We're going to pick up right where we left off.
