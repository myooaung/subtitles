Hello everyone and welcome to part three the front end project for this project we're going to be coding

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,950
through the creation of a Kinect for game and we're going to be heavily using j crew for this project.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,480
And just a quick no we probably are using J.Crew more than we actually should.

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,630
So I really want to focus your knowledge of J.A.G. for this project.

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:31,390
We will be using j creates actually built the Kinect for game when in reality it would probably be a

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,680
smart idea just to use Badillo javascript arrays for a lot of the work here.

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,440
We're going to be interacting with the Dom really heavily.

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,560
So keep that in mind.

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,630
We're going to be really focusing on Jay queery for this project.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,800
There are many many ways you could have build a connect for game using the front end stack that we know

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,200
so far this is just one way that heavily features Jake queery and Dom.

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,350
So this project is also completely optional.

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,210
Feel free to only watch to skip a completely ordinary sackless straight on your own.

14
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,380
This project will conclude our formal coverage of the front end stack.

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,190
So really if you've reached this point Pat yourself on the back you've learned a ton already and you've

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,810
basically completed the entire front end stack.

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,900
And after this we'll be talking about the back end with Python and Django.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,410
All right let's take a look at what this project actually looks like when completed.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,610
And then you can decide how you want to approach the project after that in the next few lectures we're

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,490
going to be coding through the solution.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,360
Let's hop over to my browser and show you what the project looks like.

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,830
OK.

23
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,360
This is what the project looks like.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,430
Upon starting the project you get an alert that says Player 1 enter your name you'll be blue.

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,370
So I will just input player 1 and then player to enter your name.

26
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,280
You will be red.

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,990
So he can give this some other name just give it the name be you hit enter and then we see the screen

28
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,990
so says welcome to Connect.

29
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:56,630
For the object of this game's connect for your chips in a row and player one player to alternate.

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,720
But the thing is you only get to pick a column and that is the column where you're going to drop either

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,850
your blue or red chip and it has to go all the way down.

32
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,820
So for player 1 to turn so we can pick this column.

33
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,230
Now we can see our chip dropped all the way down.

34
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,850
So as Player B if I also pick that column it drops on top of that one.

35
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,170
Now we can continue this process until someone has won the game.

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,340
Hopefully you're already familiar.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,090
Connect Four If not you can always just read the rules.

38
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,380
It's a very simple game.

39
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,780
So here let's have blue win.

40
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,540
By correcting for and once we've connected four it says Player 1 has one refresh your browser replay

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,220
again.

42
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,950
And if I refresh my browser I get the alerts again.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,560
So I will give player one a player to be in here that javascript's has loaded and I'm ready to play

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,210
again.

45
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,260
And that's really all there is this game.

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,760
So feel free to either completely skip this project tackle it completely on your own or just have a

47
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,850
code along section with me.

48
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,810
Coming up in the next few lectures.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,680
Thanks everyone.

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,750
And I'll see you at the next lecture.
