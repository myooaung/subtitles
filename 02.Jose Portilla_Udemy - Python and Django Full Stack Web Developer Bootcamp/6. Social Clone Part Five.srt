Hello everyone and welcome to part five of the social club project.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,480
Now we're going to begin by setting up the views your and template files for the groups and post applications.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,810
And given that they're interconnected we're going to have to work with them concurrently so we can't

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,970
just do posts first and then groups first.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,540
Otherwise it won't make too much sense so I have to do both at the same time.

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,150
We'll try to keep a focus primarily on one application at a time.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,340
But keep in mind we're going to be working on both at the same time.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,070
We're going to start off by just setting up the files we need and then the next lecture will actually

9
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,110
start programming.

10
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,180
OK let's suppose that a text editor and create the directories and files all right to begin actually

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,290
creating the directories.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:52,160
I first need actually make the applications so we will go to jingo admin and say Star app and it will

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,170
create the post application.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,160
So say start out for posts and then I will say jingo dash admen star app and I will start the groups

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,610
app so we'll will say group say you could call groups whatever you want.

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,870
You could call it something like subeditors or communities etc. I'll just choose the groups they insist

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,720
that's pretty simple.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,450
Now we're all going to do it inside each of these.

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,370
Let me kind of collapse accounts and collapse simple social and expand and expand groups.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,150
We are going to create the files necessary.

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,410
So let's start off with posts so in posts we're going to make templates.

22
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:33,350
So instead of post I will say new folder and then say templates hit enter and then inside of templates

23
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,170
I'm going to create a new folder called posts and then here are my posts templates and I'm actually

24
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,870
going to create the empty H-how files for now.

25
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,640
So let's start off with that.

26
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,630
We will say whoops that new folder in your file.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:54,080
So inside of this I'm going to create a couple of new files one will be my base h team l file for my

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,910
post which I'll call post underscore base that each T.M. and then I also create a post underscore confirm

29
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,540
underscore deletes but each T.M. they'll be the view that you will confirm and then we're also going

30
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,020
to do.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,270
Let me expand this just a little bit.

32
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,890
We're also going to do a post detail so you can kind of tell.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm already kind of thinking of class based views right now.

34
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,630
You will see a post underscore detail thought HTL and then a couple more here.

35
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,620
We'll create a post form so when someone actually wants to type out the post to go to that post form

36
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,480
and then if we want to actually list the full list view I will create a post underscore list that each

37
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,270
T.M. And then finally we'll create a new file and this will be called user underscore.

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,150
Post underscore list.

39
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,950
And if you click on a user we should see all their posts.

40
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,210
Kind of like seeing someone's Twitter feed so we'll have user underscore posting or score list.

41
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,610
Now we're also going to create one more file in a format that we haven't really seen before and that's

42
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,060
the underscore post-START T.M. And the reason for that is I'm actually going to use this underscore

43
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,990
postdates html file to inject it into other posts that HTL files.

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:16,550
Sometimes if you're single it's team elth page or your simple template is actually getting too big and

45
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,900
overly complicated.

46
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,520
Sometimes you can just break it up and inject it.

47
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,200
And I'll show you how to do that later on.

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,440
But right now we'll just keep that thought in our heads and will keep underscore postdates T.M. as are

49
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,180
actual templates we have those template files and the next we're going to do is actually create a few

50
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,340
more files inside of posts.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,060
So instead of post right now I have models and views but I'm also going to add a or else top pie any

52
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,430
forms that pie will say.

53
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,950
Post your apply and then impose new file forms that apply.

54
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,930
OK so that's what we're going to do with post for now.

55
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,190
So we created those templates and you can always just copy and paste the templates or check out the

56
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,940
notes for the directories of what those templates actually look like.

57
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,250
In case you had difficulty following along.

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,080
But now we're going to do kind of the same thing for groups.

59
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,260
So in-groups we're going to do now is create that templates that victory I'll say new folder templates

60
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:18,570
and then under templates I'm going to say new folder groups and then under groups I'm going to create

61
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,400
a couple of each team.

62
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,180
All files will say new file group underscore based studies T.M..

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,480
So that would be my base h HTML file for the groups and I will extend from that I'll create a new file

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,480
called Group underscore detail each T.M. then I'll create any file group form.

65
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,940
So when someone wants to create a new group to come to this forum page again class based views here.

66
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,500
And then finally we should see a list of all the groups so he will say group underscore listed HTL and

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,590
hit enter.

68
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,240
OK so those are my four template files for groups and then I also want to create a profile here so we

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,330
will say underneath groups new file you URLs that pie.

70
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,480
OK.

71
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,420
And then save all those changes.

72
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,550
Close these now.

73
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,170
And we should have our basic structure or skeleton for dealing with posts and groups and we're going

74
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,360
to do in the next lecture is start off by actually focusing on groups first since there's fewer team

75
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,300
l files or template files to work with.

76
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,630
And if the structure is going to be a little simpler and that will kind of dictate where we need the

77
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,570
posts to look like.

78
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,310
So we're going to try to focus on groups at first but eventually we're gonna have to work on them both

79
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,020
at the same time.

80
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,870
But to make it a little easier we're going to try to focus on groups.

81
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,390
Okay.

82
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,190
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
