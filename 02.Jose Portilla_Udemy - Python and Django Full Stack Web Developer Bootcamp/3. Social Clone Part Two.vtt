00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.080
Welcome back everyone to part two of the social clone project.

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.960
Now that we have the very basic set up let's dive in into actually creating account functionality for

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.850
our Web site.

4
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.810
And as we're doing that we're also going to begin to set up some basic template HCM help files things

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.190
like our base h him file and the index page to him file for the home page.

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.580
All right let's hop over to the Adam text editor and get started.

7
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.130
OK here I am at Adam and we're going to start off doing is creating some basic template files that we

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.180
know we're always going to be using such as a base template and a home page template.

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.590
That means I will come over to templates and I'm going to create a new file under my templates directory

10
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.700
that's the top level.

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.740
I will create a base HVM l file that's where our actual base templates going to need to go.

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.050
And then I also create a new file here called index thought Tim ELB for our actual home page.

13
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.040
And I want to going to do here is type H T M L.

14
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.890
And I will just set up some very basic home page.

15
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.390
So let's just say something like here in our Cotterell body.

16
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.350
Let's create a heading 1 and say something like.

17
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.730
Welcome to star social exclamation point and then right at the top of this what I can do is I know I'm

18
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.250
already going to be extending from base C.M..

19
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.480
So let's do that as well so I'll say extends from base.

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.890
Tim L and then I also put the.

21
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.770
Actually since I nomic something from basically T.M. I'll put everything inside a block.

22
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.810
So let's see let's get rid of all this since I know I'm going to have a content block.

23
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.940
Say a block and then content and I'll put.

24
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.440
Welcome to our social inside of this content block.

25
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.100
Now that I have that that actually means I need to go back to my HMO file or based on each HTML file

26
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.080
and set up a few things there.

27
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.730
Since I'm going to be extending from baseplate him l i need to make sure that this is actually kind

28
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.430
of a normal looking age HTML file.

29
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.920
So I'll keep that right now.

30
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.850
And then inside the body when I'm going to do is set up that actual block.

31
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.160
So will say block and then it's called content.

32
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.420
So I will save that for now there's still a lot more we can add in here that we are going to add in

33
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.180
such as a navigation bar or links to see SS etc..

34
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.670
But for right now keep it simple and we'll just keep it as it is right now.

35
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.650
So that's all I want to do for based on age T.M. and in order to actually connect the base each team

36
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.930
the index age female to my actual web application or web site.

37
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.180
What I need to do is come over to your Olsdorf pie under simple social and under this I'm also going

38
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.230
to create a new file called these up high and basically create a really simple view for our home page

39
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.100
and then link it to the URLs for the entire page.

40
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:55.300
So I'm going to say from Jingo the views that generic import and I will import the template view that

41
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.120
way I can just return back that template view.

42
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:06.760
So class home page and this is going to inherit from template view and then I'm just going to say whoops

43
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.750
template name my template name is equal to index h T.M. they can say I have a lot of autocomplete help

44
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.010
there because I'm using a jingle plugin packed for Adam.

45
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.130
So that save that I have home page template name index.

46
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.500
Now that's looking good.

47
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.110
And now I need to come over to your Olsdorf pie and make sure that actually link is here so let's scroll

48
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.690
down and then I will say not just you URL but also include from jingo CNF configuration that you URLs

49
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.650
and then I'm also seeing from DOT import views.

50
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.180
So it just says go to the current directory which is simple social and then grab views from there.

51
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.520
Well let's add it in to your old patterns and we'll see your own and then using regular expressions

52
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.990
I will say our hat we're care dollar sign basically the home page so when someone just goes to your

53
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.230
local host or whatever it happens to be the very first home page is going to be view.

54
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.160
What's the use the home page.

55
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.980
And remember for class based views we need to say as you call that method off of it.

56
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.830
And then I will assign this name

57
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.250
OK save that there's still a lot more to add to this but let's just make sure that we actually made

58
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.910
that connection correctly and if not we can debug.

59
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.290
I will run the server and let's hop over slide refresh this.

60
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.580
Now it says Welcome to our social great so we link up our home page.

61
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.740
And that should have been pretty straightforward given everything that we've already learned so far

62
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:37.850
on this course.

63
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.980
Now it's actually jump over and start with our AD accounts application.

64
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.270
So I will come over to accounts.

65
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.240
Let me close these.

66
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.410
Don't get confused on anything.

67
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.170
So now everything I'm doing is over on accounts and under models that pie.

68
00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.980
I want to create a simple model for accounts and I'm actually going to use jingoes built in models for

69
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.760
this.

70
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.010
OK now inside this model is that PI file.

71
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:13.070
What I'm going to do is import from Django contrib in poor 88 for authorization.

72
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.200
So a lot of these authorization tools for accounts they're actually built into Django that way we don't

73
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.220
have to mess around creating our own models for users cetera.

74
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.240
So I was going to say a class user.

75
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:32.750
And I'm going to inherit from our models the user and then I'm also going to inherit from models the

76
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:42.050
permissions mixin and then inside of this class I'm just going to have a very simple string representation

77
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.920
of the object and want is going to do here is say if you want the string representation of a user do

78
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.550
the following.

79
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.890
I will say at such as the at symbol.

80
00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:00.600
Kind of like a Twitter handle and then using the format expression and Voisey's self-taught username.

81
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.900
Now you may be wondering well where is username where is that defined.

82
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.320
So that's actually an attribute that comes built in with that user.

83
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.420
So all the models that user has the main attributes and you took up.

84
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.900
You can check out the documentation for more information on this but basically it comes of what you

85
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.250
would expect it to come with.

86
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.340
It has first name last name email username and then maybe one more field where we're going to do is

87
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.650
use this to automatically set up a form so that when someone is signing up for our actual Web site to

88
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.240
become a user on it jingles essentially going to take care of all that on the back and forth.

89
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.940
So let me save that and then let's continue on by creating a view for this.

90
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.270
So I don't want to create a view and we're going to need to connect this to a forum later on.

91
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.740
But I will do the following.

92
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.860
I will say from

93
00:06:49.990 --> 00:07:03.510
jingo Jingo the core your L resolvers import reverse lazy so reverse lazy remember we're using that

94
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:11.570
in case someone is logged in or logged out where they should actually go and then I will say from DOT

95
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.890
import forms.

96
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.190
So what I'm going to do is now that I have forms here I will create a format that PI file that will

97
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.290
connect my forms for logging in or signing up to this actual views.

98
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.310
So before I continue here I will say just class.

99
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:36.010
Sign up and this is going to be a create view which means I need to import that will say from jingled

100
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.090
up views.

101
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.600
Generic import a create view.

102
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.810
So this is for creating a new user and then here I'm just going to say pass because I want to do all

103
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.590
my forms file first.

104
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:55.800
So inside of accounts I'll send you file and then I'll create a Forms up high file and it's kind of

105
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.430
create the forms for signing up.

106
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:03.120
So I was actually again going to be relatively straightforward given that Django kind of doing a lot

107
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.010
of the heavy lifting for us which is kind of the whole point of Django that it does all this stuff right

108
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.750
out of the box becomes batteries included.

109
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.220
So a couple of things I need to import here from Jim with that country of off import.

110
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.760
Get user model so that returns a user model that's currently active in this project.

111
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:31.490
And then I say from Zingo that contrib THYR forms imports and then it going to import a user creation

112
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.690
for.

113
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.880
So as you can see there's already user creation forum built into authorization package.

114
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.230
So a lot of the stuff we're going to be using just comes from this particular package which also has

115
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.730
excellent documentation.

116
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:49.500
So again basically a documentation page shows you how to create user accounts admin accounts etc. as

117
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.610
a whole basically huge page that goes through an entire process of doing this.

118
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.280
So if you ever get confused on this or want some more reference check out the documentation.

119
00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.850
It's actually really good for this.

120
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.170
So it was a jingle that contrib from forms import a user creation form.

121
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.320
This is essentially going to be kind of a sign a page.

122
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:13.620
So when someone wants to create a user and they all say user create form and I will inherit from the

123
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.340
user creation form.

124
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:21.240
Well you want to be careful of is make sure that your class that's inheriting from this user creation

125
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.420
form is not the exact same name as user creation forms.

126
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.460
So here you say user create form and then user creation form we can also say this as user sign up for

127
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.470
him etc. but you don't want these to share the exact same name.

128
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.600
Otherwise sometimes Python will have an error with a self-reference call like that.

129
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.620
So we'll see.

130
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:44.550
In here and I'm going to create my metaclasses tree actually kind of seen before remember I can call

131
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.570
the field attribute inside of this and then put a tuple of fields.

132
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.380
Now these fields are actually already available for me from contrib off.

133
00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:01.670
So the fields that I'm going to have a user fill out is the username their email and then password.

134
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:12.650
I put in as a string password one and then also has a string password too.

135
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.120
So that comes with the authorization user model and it's basically just to confirm your password.

136
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.840
So put in your password once and then confirm it with password too.

137
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.450
So those are the fields I want someone to put in as my Morefield if you wanted to but right now we'll

138
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.680
just keep those basic default fields from authorization.

139
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.770
And then this is kind of the most important part.

140
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:37.750
We say model is equal to get user model which allows us to use right here to get the current model of

141
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:45.620
who's ever accessing that Web site and then we will say if it's and we're going to initialize this with

142
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:54.420
self args keyword arguments and this is essentially we're I wouldn't expect you to memorize this but

143
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.870
instead reference the documentation for this particular thing.

144
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:07.650
So what I'm going to do here say create super and then initialize that with args and keyword arguments

145
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:23.460
and then here we'll just say self-taught fields user name that label is equal to the display name.

146
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.050
So what is this actually doing.

147
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.760
Well basically what's going to happen is when the user comes in and they're ready to sign up we're going

148
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.580
to call user creation form from authorization forms and then we set up the middle class basically saying

149
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.520
OK these are the fields that they want a user to be able to access when they're signing up.

150
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.950
So whenever we're connected to our models or database this is what they're going to have access to the

151
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.430
username to email and then set up and confirm their password.

152
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:52.960
Now if I actually want labels on that form in that template but I can do here under the in it.

153
00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.080
After calling this superclass what you end up doing is saying self-taught fields almost like a dictionary

154
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:03.350
user name label and then you can set up the label for that actual field.

155
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.540
So that's the same thing as setting up a label on a form HVM page.

156
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.870
Except here we're going to set it from the actual forms that PI view.

157
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.420
And then finally I want self-taught fields email

158
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.860
label.

159
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:25.740
I will say this just call the email address so it's a quick note you don't really need to do this.

160
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.230
This is kind of just for your own customization labels.

161
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.170
In case you had a specific thing that you wanted to show.

162
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.250
So for example say you're trying to make a Twitter clone.

163
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.770
Maybe instead of user name you could say something here such as display name say something like Twitter

164
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.380
account handle or etc..

165
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.750
If you are doing something that's kind of specific or customize your Web site where you don't want no

166
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:50.710
user name just to say user instead wanted to say my Twitter account handle on the actual form that way

167
00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.720
when a user's using your web site they have a better understanding what username will actually stand

168
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.410
for.

169
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.530
This is where you would actually do that.

170
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:03.690
You would say self-taught fields access whatever field you want it to that's available to you in forms.

171
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.700
Usually it's just your first and last name.

172
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.890
Use name email and password and then you call that label attribute off of that and then set it as your

173
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:11.490
display name.

174
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.620
So that's actually all we need to do here informs up-I.

175
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.420
And now that we have that ready to go we can come back to have used a pie and set that up.

176
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:26.480
So I'll come back to that pie over here and now instead of St pass let's start filling in.

177
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:33.720
So this is going to take a form class class object attribute and it's just going to be forms the user

178
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.170
create form and note here I'm not instantiating the class so I won't put parentheses.

179
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.530
I'll just leave it like that.

180
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:44.380
So my form class is actually equal to this form class just sitting this attribute equal to that class

181
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:51.180
that we just created and then I'm going to have a success u r l be equal to reverse.

182
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.330
Lazy.

183
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.040
And then I'll say loggin.

184
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.500
So what does that actually mean.

185
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:04.560
It means once someone has signed up for actual web site then in on a successful Sign-Up I will reverse

186
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.100
them back to the logon page.

187
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.020
But remember it's reverse lazy because they don't want this to actually execute until they've hit submit.

188
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.080
All that Sign-Up button otherwise is just a normal reverse.

189
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.910
It would kind of automatically reverse without letting him sign up.

190
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.620
That's why I have reversely there and then I need to finally say the template name for this.

191
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:29.030
So a template name is going to be called two accounts slash Sign-Up h T.M..

192
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.480
So let me save that.

193
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.780
And now let's actually work with templates on our accounts.

194
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:44.310
So underneath the accounts folder I'm going to create a new folder called templates to make sure that's

195
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:44.670
there.

196
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:51.320
So templates and then under that remember we kind of follow this app templates app directory scheme

197
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.500
so under templates I will create something called the Count's directory there.

198
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:01.440
And then finally under here is where I'm going to have to template files a log in each T.M. template

199
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.540
and a sign up bloodies html template.

200
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:12.980
So I'll say new file log in that is T.M. and then will say and you file Sign-Up.

201
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.350
H tim L. OK.

202
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.990
So that's it for now in the next section or next lecture I should say.

203
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:26.000
We're going to do is kind of keep continuing filling out these HMO files and then connecting the views

204
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.660
to your else.

205
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.200
But let's quickly go over what we just did.

206
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:35.810
So over here in accounts we ended up doing was from models not pie inside the accounts.

207
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.660
We basically created this really simple user model.

208
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.260
Technically it's not that simple.

209
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.670
Our job is simple.

210
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.950
The heavy lifting is being done by Django by just importing these two things models that user models

211
00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.980
that permission Nixon and then we're also doing is coming over to the use of Pi and creating a very

212
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.400
simple Sign-Up create view that's essentially creating a new user.

213
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.820
And then we need to connect that to a user create form.

214
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:03.620
So we create a new file called forms up-I and we use this user create form and then you also notice

215
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.570
that we kind of set up our own custom labels for the user name and email.

216
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.810
These are technically not mandatory You don't have to set up your own custom labels but in case you

217
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:12.950
ever needed to do that.

218
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:13.980
That's how you can do it.

219
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.850
All right.

220
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:20.030
Coming up next we're going to kind of mess around for your old pie make the connections and also set

221
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.730
up these log in and sign up that age e-mail templates.

222
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.030
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture where we continue working with accounts.
