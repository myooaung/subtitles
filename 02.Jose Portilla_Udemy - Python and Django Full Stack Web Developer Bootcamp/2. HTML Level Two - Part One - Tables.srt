00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,140
Hello everyone and welcome to part one.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,800
We're going to be discussing tables and set him out.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:17,360
Tables and HTL consists of several tag's working together and those tags are the general table tag that

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,510
lets your age him well know that there's going to be a table here.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:27,320
Then there's the T head tag which allows you to actually set the first row or the header row of the

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,350
table and then inside of that you have th which are the actual elements that we're going to be placing

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
inside of that header or head row the very top row.

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:43,040
Essentially the name of the columns in the table and then beyond that you have the table rows and then

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,320
you have t d for each of the table elements inside corresponding to each column.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,050
Now here I've shown the breakdown with just the opening tags every opening tag would later on have a

11
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,020
corresponding closing tag.

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,750
So with that being said let's go ahead and construct the table to understand all of this and get a real

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,660
sense of how all these different tags work together.

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm going to jump to the Adam text editor now.

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:07,720
All right.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,910
Here I am at the Adam text editor and I also have a browser open to the html file I'm working with right

17
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,800
now which is just called tables that age HTML.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,280
You can call your HTML file whatever you want.

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,070
Let me just collapse that side directories so it can see the full HTML file a little better the first

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,240
time you're going to need is the table type which is basically going to declare that we have a table

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,490
and is going to autocomplete that there and everything we're working with is going to go inside these

22
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,710
table tags.

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,730
First thing I want to do after that is the table head which is the head.

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,440
And this is where your column names are going to go.

25
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,670
So right now if we save this and refresh our Web page we don't see anything because we really don't

26
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,740
have any content in the table yet.

27
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,640
But as I put a th which is basically the actual content that goes to the table head.

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,070
Wolves do something like a number.

29
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,400
Now my table will show something and here it is just a number.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,360
Now let's add a couple more th elements are th tags for something like color and then let's add another

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,780
one.

32
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,750
Th.

33
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:20,870
And we'll do country saved that refresh over here and now we have number color country and note how

34
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,910
there a line there are lines as if they are the titles of the column names that are going to be coming

35
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,320
up.

36
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,730
So then the question is how do we actually add rose to the table.

37
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,150
And then how do we actually add table cells.

38
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:40,480
Well outside of this T head we say TR And that's going to stand for a table row and now we can do is

39
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,700
inside of this table row put in tiddy for our table cells.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,670
So let's start off with a number and that corresponds with the first column which is the number column.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,180
Let's put in the next cell.

42
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,150
And this is in the first row that first TR And now we need a color.

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,550
Let's put in something like red and Alice put in a country.

44
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,070
Let's just say USA will save this and refresh.

45
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,810
And now we can see that we're actually starting to construct the table.

46
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,090
Let me zoom in on this.

47
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,370
It's a little more clear.

48
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:11,980
OK.

49
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,260
So we can see we're actually constructing a table.

50
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,810
A lot of times you want your table to actually have a border and we'll be discussing styling tables

51
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,290
a lot more or we talk about CSSA SS But a quick way to do it is in this table 10.

52
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,500
Just do a space and add in border and Adam text editor is actually going to help you out here.

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,990
And if you just hit enter here automatically thought border for you and then just pasan a number like

54
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,060
one.

55
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,460
And then when you refreshed this after passing that number in you get to see this auto border created.

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,160
And like I mentioned there's a lot more styling can do instead of getting like such an ugly border for

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,630
a table.

58
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,600
But right now so help us differentiate rows and columns.

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,360
OK.

60
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,840
Let's practice adding in one more row.

61
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,580
Again it's TR for the table row and then tiddy for the table cell.

62
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,820
Now let's see what happens if we just add in one table cell values.

63
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,180
I just put in 100 and I click save and refresh here.

64
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,960
Note that I still get that 100 values.

65
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,010
So I can still add in values and basically have blank values for certain columns.

66
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,090
Now it's always suggested they try to fill out your table completely but just keep that in mind that

67
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,340
your table will still be able to generate.

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,700
There won't be an error thrown at all if you only have one corresponding value for your row.

69
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,500
So let's fill that in.

70
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,370
Next what you want is a color.

71
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:41,400
Let's just say blue chips and let's put in one more which is going to be a country unless you say France

72
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm going to save that and let's refresh and there we have it one more row.

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,850
OK.

74
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,110
And that's really all there is to creating tables in him.

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,240
It's pretty straightforward.

76
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,180
Let's just quickly review the steps.

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,810
Everything we've done goes inside these table type.

78
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,190
We have an opening one and a closing one.

79
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,940
And then if you want to have a border here you can just say Borders equal to and then it quotes Harry

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,010
put in one.

81
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,770
If we put in larger numbers such as five basically what's going to happen is you will get a thicker

82
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,550
border.

83
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:18,240
Now I'm zoomed in here so the effect is a little more pronounced but let's make it really large say

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,980
50 and then refresh and see if we get a extremely thick border on the outside.

85
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,490
So you may be wondering well how do I actually edit these borders on the inside.

86
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,940
That's something we're going to discuss a lot more in the CSA section of the course.

87
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,630
Right now you can just put in one.

88
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:38,500
And that should make things clear enough as far as what's a row and what's a column OK.

89
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,570
Then after that we have the T head section and a t head section is differentiated from the TR section

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,160
in the sense that it's actually just the column name.

91
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,050
So it represents and it's in bold versus just regular text so we see number color country you can call

92
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,170
these sort of rewashed that basically defines how many columns your table is going to have.

93
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,170
Now if we remove this t head let me just cut that out save this and refresh.

94
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,800
You still get a table just fine.

95
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,760
So don't want to give the impression that every table requires a head tag.

96
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,000
You can build a table without the head.

97
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,880
So that's totally fine.

98
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:22,190
But you should try to at least for a viewer sake keep in mind is it readable without the T head.

99
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,380
And here I have put in the T head back in and for the head.

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:35,090
Those elements are under the th tag then everything else is a T R for t row the table row and then each

101
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,840
table cell inside of those rows is just Tiddy.

102
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,900
And you have to place them in the order that the columns come in.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,250
Which is why we choose t head.

104
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,340
So we can always make sure we have a reference that corresponds to the actual order of the elements.

105
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,120
All right that's basically it.

106
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Thanks everyone and I will see you in the next lecture.
