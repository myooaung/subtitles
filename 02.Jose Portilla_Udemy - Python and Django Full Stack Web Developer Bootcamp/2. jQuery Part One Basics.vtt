00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.480
Hello everyone and welcome back to part one basic Jake Weary in this lecture we're going to start off

2
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.700
learning how to interact with the DOM with a query and the file for this lecture is part 1 underscore

3
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.270
my document thought East hymnal.

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.370
We're going to be using the Council for our commands but we're also going to show you how you can link

5
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.560
your own age T.M. file to Jake queery.

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.650
Let's hop over to the browser to get started.

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.200
OK.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.790
Here you have my editor open with the file it just referenced part 1.

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.390
My document and then also have it linked here in my browser as well as code.

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.030
Jay queried dot com.

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.310
First I want to briefly walk through the sage Tim L file.

12
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.540
You'll notice here I have a style call and that's basically just in lieu of a CSSA she but I have a

13
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.720
turn blue class which is a color white background blue and then a turn red class which has the text

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.790
color be white or the background be red.

15
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.720
So keep that in mind as we continue through this lecture.

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.450
But you'll also notice that not only do I have a link to bootstrap but I also have a script call here

17
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.020
that connects me to Jake Query and let me show you how you can actually grab that yourself.

18
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:19.180
All you have to do is go to code that Jay queried dot com that's C O D E J Q U E R Y that c o m and

19
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.690
this will take you to this Web site showing you the latest stable versions of the CD and for a query

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.180
and then you can just come here and we're going to be using J.A.G. theory and you'll have a couple of

21
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.380
options uncompressed magnified.

22
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.120
Slim and slim fine.

23
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.610
Basically these are just variations on how large the file size is.

24
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.200
If you get an compress That's the largest possible if you do in a fight that's probably the smallest

25
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.180
possible.

26
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.880
Now what you can do is just click on any of these so we can do fully and compress and you can just copy

27
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.610
this and then paste it into your file and that will give you the source for the actual that yes.

28
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.590
And if you're interested in this you can actually just copy this link right here.

29
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.260
And then put it into your browser and this will actually be the entire database file.

30
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.530
So this is what Jay Korea's just this really large file and this is the uncompress version.

31
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.690
If you come back here and check out the slim modified version we click on that link and then grab that

32
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.180
HTP and put that in your browser.

33
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.500
You'll notice that this is a much slimmer and way more condense so it makes for a smaller file because

34
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.820
those that have as much white space although Good luck reading this because it's frankly a way to compress

35
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.130
for any normal person to read it.

36
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.820
All right.

37
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.410
Living along.

38
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.430
Let's get started with selecting OK query what I'm going to do now is just expand this.

39
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.350
And then open up my Consul here so I will inspect opened up my console and now I'm ready to go.

40
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.980
So to confirm that you have Jay queery loaded what you should do is just type in a single dollar sign

41
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.930
enter and if you see some function come out then you know that J.

42
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.630
Korea has been loaded and you can test this again by saying dollar sign and then passing in a tag that

43
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.770
you want to grab.

44
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.350
So if you're using J.A.G. you want to grab everything off a tag you can just type in dollar sign and

45
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.820
then in print sees whatever tag you're interested in.

46
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.730
So for example for Heading 1 if I get that then I get back everything that has having one as a object

47
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.250
there.

48
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.910
And for example if I want to grab all the list items I say ally and then I get back what is sort of

49
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.450
like an array.

50
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.630
It's not quite energy but it basically acts like one as far as indexing purposes of the list items.

51
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.210
And then you'll notice that I have a special list.

52
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.500
So one of these has an idea special.

53
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.010
OK let's save this to a variable or say a car and we'll call my variable x.

54
00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:01.060
Say dollar sign Heading 1 enter and then with this with Jay query activated if I want to edit any of

55
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.320
the CSSA properties it's really easy I just say X Dotsie SS and then it takes in two parameters.

56
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.640
The first one being the CSSA property.

57
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.890
So let's say the color and then the second one being whatever you want to change it to.

58
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.690
So let's change heading 1 to be red.

59
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.890
And there you see immediately on top there selecting take cre has been turned red now.

60
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.890
And if I want to change the background I can say anything like CSI assess background and then passen

61
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.990
another color looks.

62
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.300
For instance make it really obvious of blue.

63
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.210
So you can see now that work in J.

64
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.390
Crew just makes your life a whole lot easier.

65
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.660
And especially using Django later on in the course.

66
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.960
Now you can edit multiple CSSA properties at once instead of just passing in one argument and one parameter

67
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.310
we end up doing is just passing in an object.

68
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.670
Let me show you what that looks like.

69
00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:03.020
So I can say a variable Meucci SS and this will be an object so I'm going to be creating a javascript

70
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.060
object right now.

71
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.230
But I remember it basically acts like a dictionary.

72
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.620
So here I'll change the color to be white.

73
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.500
I will change the background to be blue.

74
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.890
Which is essentially going to be keeping it blue and then I'm going to create the border CBR read and

75
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.270
then let's finish off our objects.

76
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.280
If I see Meucci SS I see I have this javascript object.

77
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.540
And now what I can do is say X dot Z assess pass my javascript object and then that's going to change

78
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.710
all of them at once.

79
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.130
So you can see it has now a border read although you can't really see the border.

80
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.510
So let's edit that a little more let's make the border something like

81
00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:06.560
20 pixel AUPs pixels solid red and let's change the background to be something like Green hit enter

82
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:14.610
and let's run ex-Nazi SS You see us again and here we can see the green the red and the white.

83
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.400
All right let's revisit the topic of grabbing multiple objects at once so we already saw that with the

84
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.440
list items.

85
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:29.150
But let me clear the page and show that again if I create a variable and call it list items and set

86
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.200
it equal to everything that has a list tag I get back if I check it out.

87
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.920
What essentially looks like an array.

88
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.040
Now technically this is not a javascript array it acts more like what's known as a list in javascript

89
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.740
or a node list but instead what we're going to be showing you is how you can index particular items

90
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.690
off of this.

91
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:56.180
So if I call list items and say Dotsie SS and change the style.

92
00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:04.590
So for instance I say color is blue then it changes everything of a list tag.

93
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.730
We look at this to the color blue.

94
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.590
If I only want to grab one of them what I can do is use the dot EQM method to grab a particular index

95
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.600
item.

96
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:23.290
And the way that works is you say list items dot each queue and then pass on the number of the index

97
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.650
you want.

98
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.410
So for the very first one it's going to be 0 and then off of this you can call CSSA and change whatever

99
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.850
properties you want.

100
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:38.140
So let's change that color to something more obvious like orange.

101
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:44.070
And if we come back here expand this I can see now the very first item in that list has been changed

102
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.110
to orange and everything else is has retained the color blue.

103
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.660
Now you can also grab the last item by saying list items.

104
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.320
Q And then using negative indexing.

105
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.260
So negative one will then return the last item.

106
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.280
So let's make that color something like.

107
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.110
Well let's just make it orange as well.

108
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.270
We'll hit enter.

109
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.000
And if we scroll down here we see now that last item is orange.

110
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.670
OK.

111
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.760
Now let's talk about grabbing text and HVM.

112
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.220
Remember Previously we had to use things like enraged him or text content.

113
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.880
Jay Kareem makes that much easier.

114
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:27.260
So I'm going to say dollar sign H-1 and I don't even really have to save it as a variable I can just

115
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:33.210
call the method or property right here and it's going to be text.

116
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.500
So this says selecting J.

117
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.800
Crew member that's a text to have appear.

118
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.900
If I want to change that.

119
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:48.650
All I have to do is pass in whatever new text I want so I will say brand new text and that changes the

120
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.160
text.

121
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.960
So again it's just the variable or in this case I haven't even save the two variable just the dollar

122
00:08:53.960 --> 00:09:00.090
sign call and then that text whatever text you want if you want to actually change the HVM L.

123
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:10.610
All you have to do is say again either your variable or your tag call and then you can say HVM L. close

124
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.450
friend sees that returns the actually him.

125
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.320
In this case there's nothing special about it.

126
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:22.070
But if I want to edit the aged him out let's make it emphasized and going to say am new and then close

127
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.140
E-M And just like before.

128
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.900
You can't do this if just a text call.

129
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.600
Otherwise it won't actually take the tags into effect.

130
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.760
And here you can see up on the top that is in a Taluk.

131
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.040
Now we're emphasized text.

132
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.910
OK.

133
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.470
Finally let's talk about two more things attributes and values and then classes.

134
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.190
So attributes and values are also very easy to deal with.

135
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:52.970
When you're working Ojay query for instance if we scroll to the bottom of this page we see we have an

136
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.170
input button.

137
00:09:54.170 --> 00:10:01.580
So we have this form with some stuff and initially it says to your name or something and then we can

138
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:08.300
click on submit when I'm going to do is I'm going to grab anything that has input so we can see there's

139
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.830
two of these.

140
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.660
There's the first one and then the second one.

141
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:19.650
So both of these this text box and the submit button you know what I'm going to be doing here is say

142
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.500
input.

143
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:31.190
Q 1 and then if I want to actually effect the attribute of one of these inputs and remember the attribute

144
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:36.890
can be something like what type of input it is rummer or creating an input in each T.M. I have to specify

145
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:43.420
what type it is whether it's a button a radio button checkbox submit text area etc..

146
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:50.840
So all I have to say is a TTR and then just like with CSSA the first argument is whatever the attribute

147
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.140
you're looking for.

148
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.960
So I will effect the type and then the second one is what you actually want to change that attribute

149
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.710
to.

150
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.770
In this case let's change the type 2 checkbox and now that I've hit enter I can see that submit button

151
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.910
went away and it's now a checkbox on my screen.

152
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.810
All right let's show another way to effect a value.

153
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:21.000
So if I want to affect the value of this input text box here what I can do is grab anything with input

154
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.170
and then when I'm going to say is dot e q grab the first item there.

155
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:32.310
So I want to affect that text box and then say V.L. which is going to be the value and it's just a single

156
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.960
parameter here because we're specifically saying I want to affect the value of that text box.

157
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:44.970
So I will say you value enter and I see a text box value has been changed to new value and that's special

158
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.340
with the dot the A-L call.

159
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.550
Now finally Whoops I want to discuss classes.

160
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.750
So remember we have C SS classes and if we go back to our HTL document here I see I have two classes

161
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.530
turn blue and turn red.

162
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:06.680
So it's something to keep in mind when let refresh this page so we can get everything back to normal.

163
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.570
OK.

164
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.250
And let me show you how you can add a class with Shakeri.

165
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.410
All you have to do is have a dollar sign here.

166
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.510
Select something so let's select the header.

167
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.930
In this case it's a one or actually yeah.

168
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:20.540
H-1.

169
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:27.380
And then if you want to add a class you have to do is call at class and then the name of the class.

170
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:34.720
So let's say turn read and then we can see it turned red but I want to remove a class.

171
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.770
It's very similar process.

172
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.870
Call H-1 and then call da remove.

173
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:46.500
Class and then we can remove turn red.

174
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:53.050
Now usually what you end up wanting to do is toggle class not just add a class because if we already

175
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:58.290
have the read class on it we want to remove the read class if it doesn't have the read class already.

176
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.820
Then we want to add it the way you can do that is by using toggle.

177
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.390
So let me show you what I mean.

178
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.370
I'm going to call H-1 again Elicia with blue class.

179
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:19.360
So I will say toggle class turn blue and you can see it turned blue.

180
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.930
But if I run the exact same line of code again toggle class it will turn it back off.

181
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.200
So you can see that it's toggle it on and off.

182
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.170
So now you don't have to worry about class and or move class.

183
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.370
You can just use toggle class instead.

184
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.880
It really depends on your situation whether or not you want to use class or just a simple add or remove

185
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.700
call but know that you have the option there.

186
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.280
All right.

187
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.190
That's really all I wanted to talk about for Jay queery for this particular lecture.

188
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.430
Hopefully you saw how easy it is to work with a query and if you want a reference for all the commands

189
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:54.340
we just showed you can just go to part one basic J queried that J.S. under the Shakeri folder and it

190
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.900
has all the commands in a javascript file that we went through here in the con..

191
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.760
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
