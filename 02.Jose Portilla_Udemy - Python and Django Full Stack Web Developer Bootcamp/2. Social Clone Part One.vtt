00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.810
Hello everyone and welcome to the social club project where we're going to be doing here and part one

2
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.470
is beginning by building our basic set up for the project.

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.830
That is the basic directories and just the basic structure for our code.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.200
We're also going to be giving you a quick tour of how you can customize your own adab environment.

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.810
You'll notice that we actually code out through the second clone project.

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.150
Our environment's going to look a little different style wise such as the UI or the color scheme versus

7
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.610
the previous project so I'm going to show you how you can set up and customize your own out of an environment.

8
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.480
OK let's hop over to Adam and get started.

9
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.270
All right here am I my Adam text editor and you'll notice that for one thing I'm actually going on this

10
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.950
with a Mac operating system.

11
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.370
So it's going to look a little different.

12
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.370
But the other thing you may notice is the actual color scheme and the theme looks a little different.

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.420
So I want to actually describe how you can do this on any system.

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.930
We need to do is go to settings or if you're on a Mac preferences so just open up the preferences or

15
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.160
settings or just restart.

16
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.630
Adam and usually you'll see a link to the settings and that looks like this is basically the same page

17
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.570
where we're actually installing packages.

18
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.100
And if you come over here it's where it says theme's you basically have two things you can really edit.

19
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.270
It's the syntax theme and the UI.

20
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.510
The UI theme that styles the tabs the status bar treeview drop downs etc. and you can actually install

21
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.020
themes that people create.

22
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.630
So there's a ton of community themes here that you can look at or when you actually look over here on

23
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.030
install you can search for themes so click on themes and then take a look and search around for different

24
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.140
themes that you may be familiar with if you work with other IDs or you can just look at the featured

25
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.330
theme packages coming back to themes.

26
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.840
So here I have this study or SETI theme.

27
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.310
That's one of my favorites to work with.

28
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.420
And then you can click here on this little setting's tool and you can edit the theme further to your

29
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.060
liking and you can also select the syntax theme here.

30
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.490
Actually select the syntax so if you like a white background or dark background whatever sort of color

31
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.780
scheme you like you can select that as well and always you can't click here on the settings icon and

32
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.370
then style a little more if you want to further style the Adam text editor.

33
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.800
You can click here on style sheet and using your new CSSA skills you can actually do different stylings

34
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.920
on the actual Adam text editor so you can edit the background color of the treeview the text editor

35
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.090
edit that background color etc..

36
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.330
So go ahead and play around that.

37
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.990
I'm going to leave the settings I have right now and get started.

38
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.160
The actual project.

39
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.000
So I've already created a project folder called simple clone and inside of this I'm going to start my

40
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.720
command line tool to actually create the project.

41
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.260
So we will say Django bash adman and then I will say start projects and I'm going to call it simple

42
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.330
social.

43
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.930
And then enter it you can call it Star social or whatever you want.

44
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.570
Now I have the simple social So there is some social and then I have my settings or els et cetera.

45
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.720
So that's looking good.

46
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.800
And the last thing I want to do is inside of this I'm also going to start an application so I will say

47
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.610
CD into simple social and then list here so I can see you my man is up high and my main project file

48
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.260
or folder simple social.

49
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.480
And then I'm going to say Shingo admen.

50
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.910
You can also use menders up high if you want to start app.

51
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.390
And we're going to start off with the accounts application.

52
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.810
So that's really the main application we're going to be focusing on at first and then later on we'll

53
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.690
add things like posts groups etc. so I'm going to start the accounts application and there we go we

54
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.880
have three here so that's good to go.

55
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.120
And what I'm going to do is add a couple of more directories that we're going to be needing.

56
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.310
Along the way we want the of right now but we will might as well create them.

57
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.600
So underneath simple social I will create a template victory so a new folder templates and if you wanted

58
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.020
to you could also do this straight from the command line.

59
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.370
So there's my templates directory and I'm going to leave those as empty templates that I can later use

60
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.220
for the main project page things like I basically just the smell or smell of them.

61
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.220
A thank you page.

62
00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.540
Then the next thing to do is set up my static folder so I will say static from my folder Sometimes people

63
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.060
also call this assets.

64
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.780
And then what I'm also going to do is set up a couple of folders in here.

65
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.050
So I'm going to set up a simple social sales click on static create a new folder and set up inside of

66
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.500
static loops.

67
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.330
Try that again.

68
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:23.640
New Folder simple social and turn and expands Thetic and there is see simple social and inside of that

69
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.910
and to create two new folders called CSSA for all my CSSA files.

70
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.940
And then new folder in their culture asks for all my javascript files and maybe if you want some top

71
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.490
level CSSA sometimes some people do is instead of static just at the very top level they'll say CSSA.

72
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.910
And then inside of this they'll have some sort of master CSSA file so you can say new file and call

73
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.840
this master that's VSS.

74
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.050
So I'll do that as well just so everything matches along with the actual project notes.

75
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.310
OK so now that we have all that one I'm going to do it just set up my settings up high file instead

76
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.130
of the simple social app to match everything so we can be ready to go.

77
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.840
Well we're actually working with accounts.

78
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.200
So open up these settings that py file Well we're going to do is add in just the usual that we've been

79
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.740
doing plus a couple more lines of code.

80
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.130
So the first thing I want to do is write at the top where it says base directory and I'm going to actually

81
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.020
collapse Mitry now.

82
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.870
So I get a little more room to work with.

83
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:27.380
I will say templates underscore the rectory is equal to was thought path join and then want to join

84
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.240
the base their victory with templates goals and that's ready to go.

85
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.850
And then the next thing to do is scroll down to where it says installed apps and what I'm going to do

86
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.750
is add an accounts.

87
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.700
Now I'm just going to add only accounts for now.

88
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.670
There are still a lot more stuff we have to add and such as groups posts and we're also going to add

89
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.360
in something called humanised and the bootstrap 3.

90
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.590
We'll talk about those when we actually end up using them.

91
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.310
So right now I'll just put an account there and then I'm going to keep scrolling down.

92
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.560
To where it says templates so that list.

93
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.460
As always we come over to their victories and add in that template the IRR that we just created.

94
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.550
So then scroll down and say that and then all the way at the bottom like scroll the way down on I'm

95
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.710
going to do is run into the static URL.

96
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.840
I'm also going to add my static files files underscored the hour.

97
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:26.000
So the directory for my static files and that's going to just be put in as a list is paff join and that's

98
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.500
going to be based directory joined with the word static.

99
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.010
Just so it matches up what I have.

100
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.770
Now some people like to put the static files directory all the way up to at the top here.

101
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.180
The other directories I personally like putting it down here because this kind of where Django by default

102
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.290
indicates where static file should go.

103
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.930
So again the only things added right now where the static files coming all the way back up.

104
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.440
I also added in the template directory and then I edited my accounts installed applications.

105
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.520
So now that we have that I'm going to kind of expand the command line here.

106
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.500
Let me clear.

107
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.240
If you are on Windows it will be seamless.

108
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.920
Since I'm I'm actually just going to be clear.

109
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.910
I'll zoom in a little bit so you guys can see a better idea of what I'm going to be typing here and

110
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:16.460
I'm going to say Python managed up high migrates enter and that's going to do all the initial migrations

111
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.310
and then they'll say Python managed up high make migrations for my accounts.

112
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.430
Enter there and it said no change at the app account.

113
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.900
Perfect.

114
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.320
So then I'll say Python up-I migrate.

115
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.160
And we should see no migration to apply.

116
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:38.900
OK let's confirm that we just that everything right by saying Python manage the API run server enter

117
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.600
and it should be running now.

118
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.450
So let me open this up or copy and paste this.

119
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.430
And now bringing in my actual Chrome browser or whatever browser you happen to be using at that link

120
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.830
at work.

121
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.370
Congratulations on your first jingle power to page.

122
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:51.780
OK.

123
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.360
So that's all I wanted to show for this initial part 1 in the next lecture we're going to dive much

124
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.980
deeper into setting up accounts for actual little simple social clone's site.

125
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.620
So right now you should be able to have the jingle powered web page working and then you're setting

126
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.780
up high file as well as the other directories set up the same way we did.

127
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.150
OK thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
