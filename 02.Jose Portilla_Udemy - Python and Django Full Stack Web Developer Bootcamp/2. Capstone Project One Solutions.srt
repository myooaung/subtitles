00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:10,660
Hello everyone and welcome back to the some project one solutions lecture this lecture will just begin

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,660
cutting out an example a solution for the cap some project let's hop through an editor and get started.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,380
OK so here you have the text editor open as well as the example of what we eventually want the landing

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,460
page to look like.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,650
Say Welcome to the longeing landing page.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,390
Scroll down.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,190
When we hit sign me up it takes us to a think Page.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:33,250
So let's focus on that right now and I'm going to need basically three files one each time I'll file

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,100
for this main page one each time I'll file for the thank you page and the CSSA file for the CSSA the

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,760
project.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,830
Let's start out by creating the H-2A mail for the main project page this landing page.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,520
So I have a aist him l file called Project H Tim L is actually currently linked here so I'm going to

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,120
refresh.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,110
It's cleared now and we should have a blank slate to begin with.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,950
So let's refresh will expand this just a little bit and decrease this browsers.

16
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,320
It matches up.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,460
Now let's get started.

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:10,130
So we're going to do first is actually type in HVM L and do the autocomplete there and then let's get

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,010
the something like trajectory.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,500
Call it landing page and then we also want to make sure that this is eventually linked to that project

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,540
that CSSA file or whatever you happen to call the CSSA file for this project.

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:31,790
So there's our style sheet and then we want to do is have the heading one that says something like welcome

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,940
to the landing page.

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:46,640
And since we're a startup we'll have to say we're a startup that is cool or something whatever you want

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,510
to say is totally fine.

26
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,200
And then we want some filler text all add in the paragraph.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,510
There were Florham ipsum will put in another paragraph again with Florham up some.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,060
And then what we want to do is add in the form.

29
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:14,730
So the form is also going to come here and will do is say H to say something like sign up for our lunch

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,330
call the form.

31
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:29,360
Ted and right now we'll just give it no class or actually we'll call.

32
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,060
Call it the class email form in case you want to access it.

33
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,230
But remember we want to link to the page upon and the action call upon hitting that submit.

34
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,120
So I want to make sure that my action goes to think about the smell and then that means this method

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,390
needs to be get.

36
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,810
And we have discussed really post versus Get yet we will in a future lecture.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,240
But right now you should just know that from our previous discussions in the T.M. forms lectures.

38
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,200
OK.

39
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,210
So we had three inputs we wanted.

40
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,170
We had the first name the last name and the e-mail.

41
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,610
So let's put these in.

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,390
We want the input.

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,040
This type is going to be just a text input.

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,450
And we'll give the name of this to be first so I can reference it later.

45
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,350
We have another input that's also text.

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,700
We'll give it the name last.

47
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,310
We have another input and that's going to be an email input.

48
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:34,310
Now we'll just give it the name email and it would be also smart to pass in values right now.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,000
But we're really not doing anything since this is just a shell landing page.

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,600
We're not actually accepting these values so we won't put anything for input right now.

51
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:50,510
But we do want to do is add in some labels so we'll say this label is for first so that it matches the

52
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,680
name.

53
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:59,440
And then let's say first name for this label the second input you also have a label that's going to

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:08,850
belong to last call a last name and then finally we want to label here and this is going to be the label

55
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:16,260
for email memberships matching the name here and then we'll say email so let's save this refresh and

56
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,860
see what we have.

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,900
So far it's looking pretty good.

58
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,650
I'm zoon then.

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,900
So the fots a little weird but we can see here that I have.

60
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,090
Welcome to Lenny page.

61
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,170
We're a startup that's cool let's change that save in a refresh.

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,910
We're started this cool we have to purchase a lot of maps some sign up for launch.

63
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,720
First Name Last Name and Email something that you may notice however is that the first name last name

64
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,490
and email inputs are all on the same line.

65
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,110
There's a couple of ways we can take care of that.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,730
One way we showed earlier was to put in a blank paragraph and between these to try to get those line

67
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:59,240
breaks so if I click save here I can see that in putting that same paragraph or empty paragraph gets

68
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,460
me what I was looking for the other way to do this which is a little better is by using a break tag

69
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,200
and a break tag basically just says hey break to a new block and that can be used with this command

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:21,030
you just put an open symbol B are and that's your break tag and you can actually just type in your and

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,030
it will automatically fill that in for you.

72
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,290
And then we can put in one more here so we can save that refresh and we can see if we have that line

73
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,870
break.

74
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,250
But then the issue of this break is that they are very close together.

75
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,610
So we end up having to do is add in the break to the labels as well.

76
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,540
So we can add in those breaks.

77
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,230
So it might have been a little easier just to do those two paragraph calls but it looks a little more

78
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,240
professional and nicer to use the actual breaks since the paragraphs are being used.

79
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,180
You could probably use breaks even though there are more of them.

80
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,630
It looks a little more professional nicer because they're the actual use case of the break is being

81
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,300
used here versus the paragraphs themselves.

82
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,750
All right.

83
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,580
So looks like everything's done for each team out on the project page.

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,010
Let's open up the.

85
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,020
Thank you.

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,140
Actually we still need to do the submit button.

87
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,470
So let's type that in real quick.

88
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,030
Well say input submit and the value for this guy is going to be.

89
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,260
Sign me up

90
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,750
and let's give it an ID so he can edit it later because remember we're going to try to make these corners

91
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,130
rounded on this.

92
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,090
So we'll give it the ID some refresh.

93
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,040
We see Sign me up.

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,160
Great.

95
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
So let's continue.

96
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,240
We're going to open up the.

97
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,260
Thank you Tim L..

98
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,670
Here it is blank right now.

99
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,140
Let's start by just typing in HCM l saving this.

100
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:56,230
We want to make sure that we are linking to the eventual CSSA file which is going to be project about

101
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:06,540
C Ss or whatever you happen to have called it save that that I'm going to add in Heading 1 say something

102
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:17,420
like thank you for signing up and then we'll also add in a heading to that's something like we'll reach

103
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,900
out to you soon.

104
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,300
Exclamation point.

105
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,340
OK.

106
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,140
So so far what we've done is we said we have our team I'll set up our project team all set up.

107
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:37,190
So if those have saved if I refresh this and add in some context these guys so at gmail dot com and

108
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,610
click sign me up boom now I get the thank you for signing up.

109
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,280
Last thing I want to do is change the font right now.

110
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,780
We're still on the default Times New Roman.

111
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:54,010
Let me just make this a little nicer by choosing a Google font so I will open up and you have to Fahnestock

112
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,370
Googlebot com.

113
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,340
Roberto is a really nice font that I like a lot but let's use something a little more fun.

114
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,710
So senese the that looks pretty cool.

115
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,760
So I'm going to add that says one family selected.

116
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,570
I'm going to copy and paste this link and I'm going to make sure that it's in both.

117
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,330
Thank you.

118
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
And project files.

119
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,440
And then I'm going to copy and paste the thing I need to specify for CSX which means I should open up

120
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,690
my CSSA file.

121
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,520
And then put in something like body

122
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,630
and then just copy and paste that font family save that save this save that and refreshed to make sure

123
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,140
the font has changed and there it is Wakata landing page.

124
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,780
Things looking at here.

125
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,760
All right.

126
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,630
So next thing you have to do is just edit the CSSA to match what we had earlier.

127
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,610
We're going to continue editing the see SS in the very next lecture so you can take some time just to

128
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,050
go over everything we did in the aged hymnal.

129
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,630
I know we went through it a little bit quickly in this lecture so feel free to take your time with the

130
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,570
actual HTL notes that are available to you under the capstone project one folder or just watch this

131
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,740
lecture at a slower pace or at a faster pace if I'm still too slow for you.

132
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,040
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

133
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,220
We'll finish off this project by editing the rest of the CSSA file.
