Hello everyone and welcome to part one of the Bitstrips section of the course.

2
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.620
A key feature of bootstrap arts default classes.

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.490
You can call these classes to quickly and easily build good looking features for your web application.

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.910
We're going to be going over button classes as well as the container and Jumbotron classes.

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.070
First though we start off by showing how to connect an html file to bootstrap itself.

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.170
Let's get started.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.940
We're going to open up my text editor toonies HTML file as well as my browser and Cziko get bootstrapped

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.950
dot com again.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.310
Let's get started.

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.090
All right so here you have my editor open as well as my browser.

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.930
I have an empty page.

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.150
You know files linked to my browser.

13
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.230
Let's get started by showing you how it actually connected nature T.M. content to bootstrap.

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.050
So I just type.

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.990
H Tim Allen got the basics going and if you go to get bootstrap dot com and click on download bootstrap

16
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.350
will eventually take you to this getting started Ted.

17
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.290
And you basically have two options here.

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.650
One is to download the bootstrap files yourself and then link them locally on your computer so you'll

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.650
be downloading a CSX file and then you can link that locally just as we've done for other CSSA files.

20
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.270
Or you can just use the Cdn which basically is an online host for you to connect to.

21
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.600
So you can just grab this link right here and you can grab all of these if you want but we're keeping

22
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.310
it simple so we'll just grab this right now which is the only link we need.

23
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.050
For this particular lecture and if you scroll down you'll actually see there is pre-compiled bootstrap

24
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.150
bootstrap source code.

25
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.600
But keep scrolling down there's a basic template so usually will probably end up starting with this

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.340
entire basic template which includes things such as Jay queery and some Javascript code.

27
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.780
But right now we don't know enough about that to actually use it.

28
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.260
So we're going to use the very first link we saw here which is the latest compile and a minute fight.

29
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.160
SS So if we zoom in a little more this is the link I'm using.

30
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.430
All right.

31
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.930
So that's ready to go.

32
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.510
Let's actually test it out.

33
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.200
By creating a heading one in the body will say bootstrap exclamation mark.

34
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.320
And let's actually comment out of control or command forward slash the link to that style sheet just

35
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.250
to make sure it's working.

36
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.650
So if I refresh this project that it's CML it's linked to it.

37
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.850
I see bootstrap.

38
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.540
Now if I turn the link back on and uncomment it and refresh noticed what happens to the font the font

39
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.660
changes to boot straps default font and that is one quick and easy way you can tell if bootstrap is

40
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.160
successfully working.

41
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.370
Keep in mind you do need an internet connection for this to work.

42
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.640
If not you'll have to download the files manually.

43
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.810
Either way you're going to need the internet connection at some point in time.

44
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.390
But if you're watching that video it's probably because you have an internet connection.

45
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.650
Let's discuss a container class.

46
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.870
So I'm going to create a DIV tag and right now I'll leave it class list but I'm going to add heading

47
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.860
one that says

48
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.900
Hello world.

49
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.270
Exclamation mark.

50
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.420
Save it refresh.

51
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.550
And I can see that my hello world heading is actually right against the left hand side of my browser

52
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.430
so as expand my browser it's still there on the left hand side.

53
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.370
What I can do to try to center a little bit off that left hand browser is put it in what's known as

54
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.910
a container class.

55
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.410
And what's really nice about bootstrap it basically comes with a bunch of predefined classes free to

56
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.330
easily call in your code and you don't have to worry about memorizing all these class names are going

57
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.140
to be seeing the main thing you have to learn out of this section of course is how to reference the

58
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.570
documentation which will be showing you when we talk about buttons.

59
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.840
But notice the hello world is now in the class container so if I refresh this I see that it's centered

60
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.800
and down a little bit.

61
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.560
So basically just affected the margin spacing.

62
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.980
You can see here as I expand this window or as I begin to collapse it more it's to try that it's best

63
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.070
to say a little more centered or a certain distance off of the left hand side of the browser which is

64
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.750
exactly what we want.

65
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.190
So delete this now and continue on.

66
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.020
OK now that we've explored the container class a little bit it's going to be something we explore a

67
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.210
lot more as we continue through bootstrap it's time to talk about the button classes that are available

68
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:26.950
to him bootstrap if you come to the link at the strip that com slash CSSA which if I expand this browser

69
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.330
you'll see here it's in the top nav bar you can just click on CSSA there is a right hand side column

70
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.420
here we have some sections and click on buttons and basically bootstrap comes with some button classes

71
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.620
that you can easily call and you can call him on three separate types of tags you can call it on an

72
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.410
anchor tag rumor that's a tag of a link to it.

73
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.190
You can call it on a button tag something we haven't actually talked about yet but we're going to be

74
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.670
doing in the section right now and in impot tags something we've used for forms.

75
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.520
We'll actually be discussing forms in the next lecture.

76
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.750
So right now let's explore using the button tech which we haven't actually seen it in action.

77
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.280
Now the button tag basically allows us to create a button scroll back down to where we had the buttons

78
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.870
OK I just scrolled back down to the buttons and let's add a button to our H.T. Malca.

79
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.550
So I will say button and we'll keep the type button and name button to be the default there and let's

80
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.580
say something like click on that button will refresh and.

81
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.210
Now you can see we have a button here that I can click but really nothing happens.

82
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.670
And the reason we really talk about Button tags and H.M.S. the course or the CSSA section the course

83
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.760
is because before we know javascript there's not much we can actually do of these buttons themselves.

84
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.530
Right now we're learning about them because of the typical styling choices you bootstrap on them.

85
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.940
But keep in mind we won't actually be able to really activate anything upon a click of a button.

86
00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.550
Besides a simple connection to another Web site we can do that also if an anchor tag.

87
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.840
It's not until we reach javascript or we're actually going to be clicking buttons and making things

88
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.140
change on the web page.

89
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.890
All right.

90
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.650
So here's my button Ted.

91
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.800
Now let's discuss bootstrap classes with buttons and this is basically the way you're going to be using

92
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.510
the bootstrap documentation.

93
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.440
I keep stressing that documentation is really important with bootstrap and I'm going to show you why.

94
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.340
So he keeps scrolling down and buttons and you see here we have options.

95
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.090
So these are available buttons that quickly create a style button and there's basically just a couple

96
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.610
default button types there's default primary success in forewarning danger and the way you utilize these

97
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.780
classes with bootstrap.

98
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.530
And we utilize bootstrap in general just by specifying class is equal to.

99
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.760
And then you specify whatever class you want.

100
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.980
So let's say if we come back here to our project they smell we want to turn this click button into the

101
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.230
style of a success button.

102
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.320
So we just come here.

103
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.450
Look at success and see it's beauty and space beauty and success.

104
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:08.740
So there's a button or between the success save it.

105
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.560
Come back here refresh.

106
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.910
And now it looks like a success button.

107
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.210
Great.

108
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.520
So coming down we can keep saying that there's more stuff we can add.

109
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.070
So fancy larger or smaller buttons you can continue to add for more classes.

110
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.540
So now it can add PTEN dash Elgie.

111
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.360
So let's do that I'll say between dash Elgie to make that into a large button.

112
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.730
So I come back here refreshed we can see that the bunds gotten a little bit larger.

113
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:44.860
We can continue them see things such as active state so benzyl appear pressed when active we can also

114
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.030
do things such as make it disabled state.

115
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:54.330
So if we want to make it look disabled all I have to do is say disabled is equal to the Seybold So it's

116
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.700
copy and paste that.

117
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.660
And that's actually another parameter property of this button tag will it save it and it lets actually

118
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.300
create another button so we can compare it to.

119
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.410
So I will create one button just copy and paste this.

120
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.780
It has disabled on.

121
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:28.380
Let's say this is I am on the bottom one will say disabled and the one of has I am on we are going to

122
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:34.810
delete this disabled marker on it or the Seybold parameter will save it refresh here.

123
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:39.660
Now you can see the I am on I can click on that and hover over the Seybold Google Chrome this let me

124
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.530
click on it.

125
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.140
It shows that nice little icon it says this is not clickable.

126
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.770
And there's a quick note you can always override these default style so maybe you like the success button

127
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.560
that you want to make the text a different color.

128
00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:01.210
All you have to do is in your CSSA file grab the T.N. between that access call it your own class and

129
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.460
your CSSA file and you could overwrite individual aspects of it.

130
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.940
It will override everything.

131
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.710
It'll just overwrite whatever aspects that you want to overwrite.

132
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.160
So if you want to overwrite the text color a text background you could do that yourself just with your

133
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.870
C Ss and just calling this class a success.

134
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.240
You could do that yourself.

135
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.020
All right.

136
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.740
Now it's finally talk quickly about the Jumbotron which is something we'll be using a little bit throughout

137
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.620
this course.

138
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:34.000
So a view with the Jumbotron actually looks like we're going to hop back over to the get bootstrap page

139
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:40.270
and let me expand this so it can see the nav bar and I'm going to click on components and components

140
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:46.620
as we scroll down we'll see a bunch components are going to talk about later on such as nav bars labels

141
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.940
stuff like that but you keep scrolling down you'll see the Jumbotron component and we see that Jumbotron

142
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.550
is basically a lightweight flexible component that can extend the interview port to showcase key content

143
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.900
so you can think of this almost like a landing page and this is the most basic Jumbotron.

144
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.920
It has some large file.

145
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.120
Here are some large Hedding some simple hero unit whatever and then a button there so we can actually

146
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.350
just copy and paste this

147
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.770
and put it into our ECMO

148
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.200
So we say hello world.

149
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.580
I thought that is the paragraph.

150
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.370
So I'll say something like this is the

151
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.620
paragraph save that.

152
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.390
And let's actually see this now on our project page refresh what we see here.

153
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.090
Now we have an H T M L Jumbotron.

154
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:44.180
Usually however you're going to want this Jumbotron to be within a container so it doesn't take up this

155
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.060
entire page.

156
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:55.450
Well we will do then is put this inside of a container class grabbed this entire jumbo division or the

157
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.600
Vider there stick it inside save it.

158
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.430
And I want to refresh.

159
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:08.840
I can see that it's basically centered like it was here on this page and that's really the main idea

160
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.600
of bootstrap going to come over here.

161
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:11.710
See what you need.

162
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.820
So if you want to know how to use an alert you just come here to the olor and you can read the examples

163
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.740
here you see here there's a class alert roll etc..

164
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.660
So so far we learn about where the basic button classes which you can always check out by coming to

165
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:32.930
the CSSA page and then clicking on buttons and you can see the various button tasks that are available

166
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.180
to you.

167
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.270
Then we also learn about the container class which you didn't think of as just basically centering stuff

168
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.290
on your page.

169
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.800
And then we also learned about the Jumbotron class.

170
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.690
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
