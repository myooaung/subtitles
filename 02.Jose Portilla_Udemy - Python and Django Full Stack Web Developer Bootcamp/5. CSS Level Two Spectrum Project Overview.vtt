00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.030
Hello everyone and welcome to the Spectrum project which is your final project for the CSA sections

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.400
of the course.

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.340
So for this project you're going to be digitally recreating your own version of the art piece known

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.540
as spectrum 5 by an artist known as Ellsworth Kelly.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.110
And it's currently located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City known as the Met.

6
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.750
Let's take a look at what that art piece actually looks like.

7
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.210
So it looks something like this.

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.020
And what we're going to have to do is create your own little web page that has a very similar look to

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.250
this.

10
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.480
Basically you'll be creating a set of table cells that have a color and you're going to mess around

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.880
with the border the margins and the padding which we learn about the box Model Ss to space those table

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.100
cells correctly so that it has some sort of appearance similar to this piece of art.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.440
So you're going to be creating again your own smaller version for the web page using what you've learned

14
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.970
about the box model and you're also going to learn how to pick a color palette to use based off a few

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.470
web sites and I'm going to show you now.

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.670
Let's take a look at an example of what this project may look like and how to choose a color palette.

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.480
I'm going to jump to my browser now.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.850
All right so here I am at my browser and I have a representation of what your final project may look

19
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.210
like it's going to be some sort of variation on this.

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.270
And what we have here are essentially table cells.

21
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.130
So here each of these little blocks is a tedious object inside of a table.

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.580
And you'll notice that we were able to use the box model to add a little bit of spacing in between them

23
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.820
which is what you're going to do.

24
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.570
And then we also noticed that we have kind of a funky font here.

25
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.170
So your project is going to be the following.

26
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.510
You're going to choose a color palette in a second I'll show you the Web site for choosing a color palette.

27
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.700
Then you're going to assign that color palette to some table cells on your web page and then you're

28
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.090
also going to choose a font either use font library or or Google fonts you're going to connect this

29
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.510
heading.

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.240
It can say whatever you want to your new font and you're going to connect the color palette you choose

31
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.790
to these table cells and use the box model to kind of shape and stretch these.

32
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.100
So they look similar to the spectrum of art piece.

33
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.610
So as far as choosing your color palette you can choose color palette at this website.

34
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:17.090
C o o l o r s Daco or coolers Daco or colors thought the pending how you want to pronounce it.

35
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.290
Basically it's colors of an extra o c o.

36
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.440
And basically this is just a color scheme generator.

37
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.490
If you scroll down here you'll notice that there's already tons of pre-made color schemes so you can

38
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.230
click on View all palettes and it will show you various palettes.

39
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.650
So choose any palette here that you like.

40
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.500
This is just on Explorer but you can click here on best way for it to refresh and it will show you the

41
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.010
most popular color palette that are chosen here.

42
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.630
So for instance this my new palette is the one I chose for this spectrum 5 piece so you just come here.

43
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.970
Click on the palette.

44
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.840
So click on View and it will generate the palette for you.

45
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.670
You don't need to watch the tutorial just exit here.

46
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.090
And here we can see the hex codes for each of these colors.

47
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.260
And those are the hex codes.

48
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.190
You're going to be using for your CSSA file.

49
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.060
So again you just in your age HTML file create this table cells needed to create something that looks

50
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.480
like this.

51
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.940
Again this is just a table with one row and five table cells in it.

52
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.010
And you also choose a font.

53
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.890
If Google fonts using the knowledge we learned about in C S S level 2.

54
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:35.530
So connect a font of your choice then create the table and connect it to some sort of palette by inserting

55
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.330
these hex codes into your C Ss.

56
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.670
All right.

57
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.520
So that's basically it.

58
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.150
If you have any questions feel free to post them.

59
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.570
That cuniform again you don't need to choose the exact same color palette or the exact same font and

60
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.480
your spacing and padding doesn't have to be exactly the same as mine.

61
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.830
Here just get a general idea of how to incorporate color palettes from that online resource fonts from

62
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.720
Google fonts and the box model per spacing of these table cells.

63
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.680
Those are the three main things I want you to get out of this project.

64
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.590
Choosing a font of your choice incorporating into a web site choosing a color palette being able to

65
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.500
grab those hex codes and incorporate it into your coloring of your site and using the box model to shape

66
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.090
out these table cells.

67
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.750
Okay.

68
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.990
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

69
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.460
We're going to cut through an example solution.

70
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.130
Again not every solution to this is going to look the same but just get the general idea.

71
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.190
I'll see you at the next lecture.
