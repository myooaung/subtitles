Hello everyone and welcome to an advanced jingoes section and this section will be discussing class

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.930
based views.

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.070
So this is your first advanced Gengel section.

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.640
And basically what these advanced Shingo sections do is it take deeper dives into certain topics of

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.560
Django and this particular section we're going to be discussing class based views or Seabee these previously

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.770
we've created views using functions interviews that py file.

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.410
However Gyngell provides really powerful tools to use object oriented programming or opii in Python

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.270
classes to define views in your views that py file the class based view method offers great functionality

9
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.980
and for most experienced users of Django it's actually their default choice for creating views.

10
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.110
So while I am calling this an advanced topic if you go out into the real world.

11
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.730
Most experienced users of Django actually use class based views as the default method.

12
00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.410
So if you ever look for other Django projects you're most likely to experience class based views instead

13
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.260
of function based views.

14
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.830
Now it's much easier to understand class based views after working with function views which is why

15
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.370
I'm calling this an advance topic OK.

16
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.120
We're going to start off with a simple example of a hello world class based view and then slowly build

17
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.930
up to more complex examples and then talking about something called mixdowns.

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.390
Ok hope you're excited.

19
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.460
Let's get started.

20
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.370
I'll see at the next lecture.
