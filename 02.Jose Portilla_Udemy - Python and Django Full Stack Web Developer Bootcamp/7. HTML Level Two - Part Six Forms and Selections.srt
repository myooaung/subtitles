00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,960
Hello everyone and welcome back to part six form selections in this lecture we're going to continue

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,350
exploring the variety of input methods for each time forms.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,460
And those are going to be things such as a single radio button how to link multiple radio buttons dropdown

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,050
menus and then text area inputs.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,270
Coming up next after this lecture will be an assessment exercise so we can fully understand everything

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,690
it has to do with him all forms and that will end our H-2 him all sections of the course.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,630
But before you reach the next assessment let's get some quick practice with these various input methods.

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:37,930
All right.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,100
So here I have a normal age team I'll file open and it's linked to my browser just called forms.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,110
H Tim L.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,540
And you can see here I've set the tile to hotel feedback so we now know enough HVM that we can try to

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,900
mimic more of a real world situation.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,040
For instance let's say you've stayed in a hotel afterwards that may send you an email to a link asking

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,930
for some feedback.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,890
So we're going to try to mimic what that feedback page would look like and to do this let's just start

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,950
with a heading that says something like hotel feedback form.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,880
Save this refresh over here.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,550
Looks like it's linked correctly.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,280
Great.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,420
Now let's start with our form.

21
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,100
And if you just auto create form you'll have class action method etc..

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,690
Right now we don't really need that.

23
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:27,070
If you want you can set method to just be get right now as I mentioned earlier we're going to be covering

24
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,880
what and post is much more in the future.

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,520
Right now you can just leave it as you see here.

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,100
First thing I want to do is understand how radio buttons work.

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,550
So for instance do you just type an input and and type instead of text you pass in radio.

28
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,130
You can save this refresh and you see a little radio button pop up here and if I click it I can see

29
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,170
it it got filled in.

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,280
Right now if I try to click it again nothing changes I can't click it on and off it's just clicking

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,350
once.

32
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,100
So let's try to expand on this concept by actually asking a question here.

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,040
So in a header or heading 3 I'm going to say this.

34
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:16,580
Are you from inside the US or outside the US so may we have international travelers and we want to know

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,940
do they come from the United States or outside the United States if this hotel is in the United States

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:30,060
or somewhere internationally and then we'll have an input as a radio button and we will label this radio

37
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,270
button and let's review how we can label using that for method.

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,300
So I can say something like for

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:49,890
us and then give this particular radio button an ID of an let's say in USA.

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,190
So let's save that in this label.

41
00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to say something like inside say that refresh and he see are you from inside the US or outside

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,880
the US in the right now I can just highlight the only option available inside and I can only highlight

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,730
it on a can't change anything about it.

44
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:20,230
So let's make another one we'll make another label we'll call this for how USA now we will call this

45
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:30,850
outside and then create another and put we'll make another radio button type and give it the ID to match

46
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,190
that label which in our case is out USA.

47
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,740
We will save this refresh and now we see we have a hotel feedback form.

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,120
We have two options inside or outside.

49
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,880
Right now we have a little bit of a problem.

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,430
I can actually highlight inside highlight outside and that's it that's all I can do right now.

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,710
What I would really like to do is to link these two radio buttons together so that if I click inside

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,200
than outside cannot be selected or if I click outside then inside cannot be selected so I want to be

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,750
able to turn these on and off in respect to each other and the way you do that is you give them the

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,080
same name and that's where this name comes into play.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,220
So let's give this first radio button a name Alosi for location.

56
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,770
And let's give the second one the same name Alosi.

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,730
Now let's save this refresh.

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,500
And we notice if I click inside it's highlighted by click outside inside becomes highlighted so we can

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,540
see now that they're linked because they share the same name and that makes sense because given what

60
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,770
we know about names and the assignment we'll have to assign something to that name.

61
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,300
In this case we can only assign one of these to either be inside or outside.

62
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,820
And that's how you link radio buttons together you just give them the same name.

63
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,110
They can have different labels but if you want to link them together you just give them the same name.

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,100
All right let's start exploring another type of input here.

65
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,310
And this one is going to be let's say Well asks How was your service.

66
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,790
So how was your service.

67
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,020
Save that.

68
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,220
Make sure it worked.

69
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,480
All right.

70
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,620
How was your service and let's actually make this better to instead of just the paragraphs that kind

71
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,110
of matches along with the other one.

72
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,810
And let's make this other one too.

73
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:27,460
So it's not so big a head or two over here as well each to save that refresh over here.

74
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:27,960
So are you.

75
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,560
From inside us outside that's linked together.

76
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,460
How was your service for the service.

77
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,630
Well we're going to do is explore a dropdown menu and the way dropdown menu works is not with the input

78
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,050
tag but with the select tag and the select.

79
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,590
It works like this.

80
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,000
You say select you can give it a class right now.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,990
That doesn't make sense for us because we haven't learned about C Ss So we'll come back to that later

82
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,730
and we can give it a name.

83
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,830
So let's give this the name stars.

84
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:06,380
So we want a drop down menu of how many stars and what we can do is give an option and then this option

85
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
has a value.

86
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:15,710
So let's give a value of great and in-between these option tags is going to be in actual numbers so

87
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,790
we'll say three.

88
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,540
Let's save this and see what this looks like so far.

89
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,770
So here we have the dropdown three in so far.

90
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,170
That's it.

91
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,550
So let's create a couple of more options for the stropped on menu and then we can break down what value

92
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,590
is so going to make another value that just says OK.

93
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:42,880
That's too and then let's make one more option and we will say this is bad.

94
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,050
And it was one star.

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,140
So now if I save this I have my select which in the case a dropdown menu.

96
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,650
I've given a name to my select and I have various options here with what happens in between the option

97
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,490
tags is what's actually displayed to the user.

98
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,930
But behind the scenes they can have their own values.

99
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,660
So let's refresh this.

100
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,310
And now that we say how is your service I see the dropdown gives me three two or one that I can choose

101
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,920
from.

102
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,280
So let's add a submit button to this so we can see what happens when it hit submit.

103
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,020
So outside of this but inside the form I'm going to create a submit button and give it a value called

104
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,040
submit.

105
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,440
Save that and refresh and let's pay attention to what happens to the url after I hit submit.

106
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,910
All Sam from inside the U.S. and my service was too.

107
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,810
So now that I've clicked submit we see here in the URL I have ellos is equal to.

108
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,220
And right now it's actually blank.

109
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,790
And then it says.

110
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,260
And stars is equal to.

111
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,070
OK.

112
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,210
So what I want to do is back in these radio Open's actually fill in a value here that corresponds to

113
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,030
the radio button.

114
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,800
So I will set the value for inside or the inside radio button and set the value here for outside.

115
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,980
Let's save this and refresh and let's actually delete these values here.

116
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,940
Go back to the forums page refresh this.

117
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,160
And now let's try again.

118
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,050
We'll say Hotel feedback form.

119
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,060
Are you from inside.

120
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,530
We'll say we're from inside.

121
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,460
How's the service.

122
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,350
We'll give it one star and notice here.

123
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,670
Now I have corresponding values in both the dropdown menu and the radio buttons.

124
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:33,110
So if I click Submit now I can see here the your L that my ellos see the name is equal to the value

125
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:33,850
inside.

126
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,430
Since I chose inside and stars is equal to the value here.

127
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,200
Bad.

128
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:44,270
And that's a really nice way that you can have your own value names on your back ends but show something

129
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,490
else on the front end.

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,830
So notice that the front end here is wishing for the dropdown menu was three to one but on the back

131
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,830
and I had these set values great Ok bad well might be more realistic is if you actually set values on

132
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,960
two numerical values three to one.

133
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,310
And then here the options are great.

134
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,290
OK bad.

135
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,160
And then you can maybe take mathematical averages.

136
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,100
Behind the scenes that we can learn a lot more about back and stuff later on this course hopefully you

137
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,560
get an idea now of what's possible.

138
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,580
Finally I want to add one more type of input that we want to check out.

139
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,660
And that's the text area.

140
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,290
So I'm going to put a paragraph here and we'll have a question that says something like.

141
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,510
Any other feedback you want to give as a paragraph.

142
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,620
Let's actually make that a head or two.

143
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,060
Way it's the same size everything else.

144
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,480
And we so far have learned about the text input.

145
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,800
In fact it's the default.

146
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,030
So if I click save here refresh I see any other feedback.

147
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,240
But usually you don't want the user to just type everything in one single line.

148
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,520
You want an actual box text area.

149
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,580
So the way we can do that is instead of text where you can say text area and that actually creates its

150
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,170
own text area tag.

151
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,510
So I will delete this

152
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,790
and say text area.

153
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,140
We can give that a name so we can just use the default here or we can say my text and you give it a

154
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,050
number of rows and a number of columns you want it to expands.

155
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,390
So let's save this now refresh and see here.

156
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,430
Now I have my text area so hello this is my text area.

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,120
And now we have multiple lines so we can start typing stuff in.

158
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,120
And we're going to learn more about text areas right now because it's a little different than taking

159
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,980
in a single value because you have whole blocks of text.

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,340
But I just want you to be aware they have a text area here at your disposal.

161
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,690
All right so that's it for the various types of inputs we wanted to cover here under form selections.

162
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,840
Let's do a quick review.

163
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,360
Let me expand this.

164
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,460
We've covered how to do radio buttons remember that just input and the type is radio.

165
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,720
And if you want to link radio buttons together you make sure the group of radio buttons just has the

166
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,760
same name and you can assign values to them so that when you click submit you can get those values back

167
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,930
then for a dropdown menu.

168
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:07,670
Use the select tag with options and you can then again assign values and the values don't have to match

169
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,360
up what the user actually sees as their dropdown options.

170
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,450
And then finally we learned about the text area which allows you to basically make a block for a text

171
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:17,990
area.

172
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,710
And if we come back here to the browser you can see that we can actually kind of play around with this

173
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,230
a little bit.

174
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,210
As far as how far down it can go.

175
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,740
And then finally we have the submit button that we've covered before.

176
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,360
All right.

177
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,710
Coming up next is an assessment exercise so you can get a lot of practice if everything you've covered

178
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,400
in the section.

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,150
Of course.

180
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,860
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
