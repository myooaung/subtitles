00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,750
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,500
Welcome to part one of CSSA level 2 in this lecture we're going to be learning about Funt properties

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,830
of CSA such as size weight text alignment etc..

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,110
And then we're also going to learn how to download and change fonts when dealing with fonts.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,840
We have to keep in mind that not every OS has every font and if you use both a Windows computer and

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,480
a Mac computer or a Linux computer often you'll notice that when you're actually trying to use a file

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,400
that was created on Windows on a Mac or vice versa sometimes the fonts have to change in what we're

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,230
going to be doing is exploring that relationship because sometimes we need to actually provide the font

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,530
for our Web site because the default font isn't available on a certain OS.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,820
Because if this were going to be exploring a few links the first sort of link is about OS support for

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,740
certain fonts with its operating system support so what fonts does Windows support what fonts do Mac

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,860
support etc..

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,290
And then the second set of links is actually going to cover how to download fonts.

14
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,010
We'll be exploring two Web sites.

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,230
Google font's site then another site to show you how you can download your own fonts from the internet

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,300
or connect them using what's known as a CDN.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,290
Let's go ahead and start off just by showing some basic font properties see SS in the editor and then

18
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,210
we'll hop over to the browser and check out how we can actually download fonts and check OS support

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,490
person funds.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm going to hop to the editor now.

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,920
OK so here and my editor and I have two files open a part one Fahnestock CSSA file and a part 1 Fahnestock

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,300
h tim L5.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,960
And if you're looking for the completed version of these files we can always check them out under the

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,550
CSSA level 2 folder.

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,150
Right now I have them blank and we'll be coding through for this lecture.

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,760
Let me collapse that directory.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,690
Lotus I also have my browser open and it's linked to my team l file.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,880
When I first want to do is make some basic T.M..

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,140
Hopefully by now you can actually do this quite quickly using Adams built in help.

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:05,530
What I will do is add in a heading one here H-1 and I'll say something like heading 1 and then I'm going

31
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,510
to add two paragraphs to this first paragraph.

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,100
You're just going to be lordship summer.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,700
That's that essentially filler Latin text.

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,730
And luckily I can just begin to type L O enter in it out of Madingley fills that in for me and I'll

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,890
add in one more paragraph but this paragraph is going to have an ID so I can individually target it

36
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,440
in the CSSA file.

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:33,150
We'll say it is equal to two and then warm up some will save that and let's refresh over here to make

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,300
sure that's working great we have heading 1 lordship some larm some.

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,040
And then what I want to make sure I do is link my CSSA file to make it himself.

40
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,800
Or that always happens in the head.

41
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,820
So I will say link that can begin to type in link enter here.

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,390
There really ship is a stylesheet and the H reference is going to be whatever I call that style sheet.

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,540
So my case is called Part 1 underscore fonts and as I mentioned previously in another lecture it's a

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,750
little unusual to have this sort of naming convention especially if a digit inside the SS file.

45
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,280
But this is just so it matches up with the lecture notes.

46
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,840
OK.

47
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,700
So everything looks good here.

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,140
Let's explore some of the basics of fonts with C.

49
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,550
So let's imagine that I actually want to change the fonts.

50
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,890
Right now it looks like it's in Times New Roman.

51
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,980
That's essentially the default if I want to change it to another font.

52
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:31,610
Maybe something like Arial I can start typing font family and that's going to allow me to then pasan

53
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,600
a property of a different font so we can see that there are some defaults here.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,460
These are very basic.

55
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,110
So let's show you one of the faults there if I just say cursive save this and then refresh over here.

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,920
I can see now I have some default cursive it looks pretty ugly but it can also passen as a string.

57
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,070
And that means that I'm wrapping it in either double quotes or single quotes a font name that I'm familiar

58
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,270
with.

59
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:03,560
Maybe I've worked with a text editor before you're familiar with some font called Aeriel Salome's save

60
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,650
that refresh over here.

61
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,930
Now I can see now it's in aerial versus Times New Roman.

62
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,180
All right.

63
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:15,560
So that's the basics of a font family but something we're going to have to keep in mind is not every

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,990
font family is going to be defaulted on every OS so certain spots are really common between both Owasso

65
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,000
such as Ariel.

66
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,630
It's in like 99 percent of Macs a 99 percent of Windows.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,710
The other font families such as he'll that sukkah is really only existent on Macs and maybe like less

68
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,470
than 10 percent of Windows computers have that font.

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,600
And we'll be discussing some Web sites that can help you choose fonts that will be available on both

70
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,190
OSes and later on we'll show you how to just download your own font so you can provide the font file

71
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,890
yourself.

72
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:57,080
OK let's talk a little bit more about font family so as I mentioned there are those basically default

73
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,290
styles if I want something like monospace I can do that as well for that paragraph.

74
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,710
So let me refresh this here and I can see this is all done in monospace.

75
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,800
Let's say I want to change the actual font size.

76
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:18,310
Well I can change the font size for everything in the body and the way I do that it's just a font size.

77
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,250
And here I can passen pixels.

78
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:27,490
So for instance I can say I want it to be 10 pixels in size refresh over here and I can see now it's

79
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,880
in 10 pixels and size 100 pixels and size make it much larger.

80
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,290
Now it's humongous.

81
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:40,760
OK let's change it back to 10 pixels nexilis do 20 pixels and something to remember is I'm zoomed in

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,020
here in my browser.

83
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,750
So it may not look as large to you.

84
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,740
So keep that in mind.

85
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,510
Now something you're probably wondering at this point in time is well what if I don't know the pixels

86
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,460
I want for the font size.

87
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,870
What if I actually want stuff to have a relationship between each other.

88
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,520
So maybe I want the second paragraph to be twice as large as the basic font size on the page.

89
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,350
How do we actually define that and using pixels as I've shown here is actually not very common.

90
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,400
What's more common is to use what is known as E-M values and values is a dynamic way of sizing things.

91
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:22,740
So when you define the font size property in E-M is equal to the size of the font that applies to the

92
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,140
parent of the element in question.

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,660
And that basically means that if you haven't set the font size anywhere on the page.

94
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:35,330
So let's say I delete this and I haven't set the font size anywhere so we can refresh here.

95
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:41,010
That's the basic font size then the browser default is often 16 pixels.

96
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:48,410
So by default then one E-M which would look like this one E-M would be equal to 16 pixels.

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,330
This is the default right here.

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,030
Which means if I tell another tag to be E-M then it'll be equal to 32 pixels.

99
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,900
Double that.

100
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,980
And then you can get a relationship or a ratio for various tags in your H T.M. what you'll usually do

101
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,650
however is set a font size in the body element.

102
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,770
So he go back here let's comment these out.

103
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:20,940
Usually what you will end up doing is for the body element you will select a font size and you will

104
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,090
have it be some sort of default font size that you choose.

105
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,310
You can do the 16 pixels which is the same as as the browser default where nothing is fine but let's

106
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,580
say font size is 20 pixels and then from there on the other elements that you want to assign you'll

107
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:42,690
use E-M which is going to like to do a ratio of this which is basically a ratio of the desired element

108
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,500
pixel value divided by that parent element which in this case is the body.

109
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,110
So let's see just a quick example of this.

110
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:58,780
I'm going to grab the number to remember that was the second paragraph the state ID and state its font

111
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,480
size is equal to 2.0.

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,930
E-M Let's save that will refresh over here.

113
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,970
Now you can see that we have heading on the first paragraph and now the second paragraph is twice as

114
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,400
large in font size as the first one.

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,980
So what you're doing here is you're stating some default body font size and then from there you can

116
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:31,560
actually call the ID font size as a ratio of it what you should avoid doing is trying to actually call

117
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,960
something like H-1 and make it mimic the font size of a paragraph or vice versa.

118
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,990
Trying to make a paragraph as large and as bold enough so that it looks like an H-1 a heading one that's

119
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,240
really not the point of this.

120
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,870
The point of this is that on your page if you have two elements of the same type but you want one to

121
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,970
be a little larger a little smaller than the other one then you start calling them what you don't want

122
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,040
to do is call E-M to the point where you should have just called heading one or heading to the very

123
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,570
beginning.

124
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,930
So keep that in mind and then what I want to show you now is font styles and font weights as well as

125
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,960
text alignment.

126
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:17,080
So if I call a paragraph here and say font style of paragraph and let me change just font size again

127
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,590
to 1.0 that way everything's the same.

128
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,290
OK looks good I'll say font style here.

129
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,970
Is a tablet so I can save this and now when I refresh my page I can see that everything is italicize.

130
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,700
So you can call font styles her basic things in that manner and you can also call things such as font

131
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,940
weight and that can be things such as bold Lider normal 100 200 etc..

132
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,860
Not every font is going to have every possible font weight.

133
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,450
It really depends on what font you are and what font you use.

134
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,810
And we'll be talking about that in a future lecture.

135
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,900
But we have font weight is bold.

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,410
So let's say that I make this both italic and bold in here I can see when I refresh.

137
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,930
Now they're in bolds great.

138
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,660
And finally I want to talk about text properties.

139
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,630
So if we see one one of the properties you're going to be using all all the time is the text alignment

140
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,380
property.

141
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:21,880
And you can begin to write text dash and you'll see Adam trying to help you out with various text properties.

142
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,650
We've already actually seen text decoration member that has stuff like underline over line line through

143
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,440
what we want to do is talk about text align and text line basically allows you to send her something

144
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,810
just the fight to the left to the right etc..

145
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,870
So if I want to center heading 1 I just say text the line center on that added element.

146
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:48,390
So I will save that refresh my page over here and I can see now heading 1 is aligned to be Center.

147
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:55,790
Great OK we're talking a lot more about alignments and how alignments work with mobile devices when

148
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,510
we talk about bootstrap.

149
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,280
But for right now what I want you to get out of this lecture is the following that you can call font

150
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,600
families have some awareness of that.

151
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,010
Some fonts don't work on every OS.

152
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,770
Now we'll be talking about that in the very next lecture as a continuation of the series.

153
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,700
Then you can call font families for very basic things such as monospace or some of the other options

154
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:26,160
if we take a look or things such as cursive or Sarah first answer if we can save that as well then for

155
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,990
font size what I want you to make sure you get out of the picture is that you can call a pixel.

156
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,850
But what you should probably do is call an E M based off the default for the body.

157
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,110
Then you can call font styles and font weights as well as do text alignment.

158
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,860
All right.

159
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,840
Thanks everyone.

160
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:51,160
In the next lecture we're going to be continuing this one discussion of fonts and talking about what

161
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,930
fonts work with which OS how you can figure that out and how you can download your own font from the

162
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,970
internet to use it for your web site.

163
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,770
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
