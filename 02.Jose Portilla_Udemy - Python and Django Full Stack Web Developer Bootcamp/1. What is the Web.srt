00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,380
Hello everyone and welcome back to how the web works.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,640
And this lecture actually going to be discussing the following ideas.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,780
We'll talk about how the web works what is actually happening when you put a pro into your browser and

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,430
how it connects and retrieves the Web site that will also talk about what we mean when we say full stack

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,000
and full stack web development.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,480
We'll get a brief overview of the Course technologies that we teach here and also why we chose Shingo

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,530
for the course.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,440
Let's get started.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,400
So before we can begin to learn about all the technologies in this course we need to understand how

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,380
the web works and what actually constitutes the full stack.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,380
So what actually happens when you're at home and you open up your browser and visit web site.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,650
Let's break down the basic steps you start off by typing your your L into your browser.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,440
So you're home.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,350
You open up your browser and you type in whatever web site you want.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:00,290
Facebook com google.com etc. then your computer sends this request as a packet which includes the IP

16
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:06,300
address of the Web site you want the IP address allows servers later on to actually identify what Web

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,520
site you're looking for.

18
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,260
And it sends requests through wires or a satellite which eventually links to wires using your internet

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,510
service provider.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,740
So if you're at home your request is eventually sent through either copper wires or optic fiber wires

21
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,330
to the server that we're about to reach or if you're on your cell phone it links to a satellite which

22
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,690
links back down to earth which then ended up going to some sort of physical wire.

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,050
And at a very very basic level the Internet is basically just wires connecting computers with some sort

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,060
of protocol.

25
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,860
So your ISP will then reroute the request the appropriate server location using the IP address as the

26
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,500
guide.

27
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,690
And then once your request reaches the server it can send back the Web site you asking for However a

28
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,220
full web site of content is too big to send back as a single packet of data.

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,880
And the way we solve this is the server sends back the Web site split up into many many packets and

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,860
the packets come with instructions on how to get back to you and reassemble themselves once they reach

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,280
you.

32
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,320
And the packets though actually care how they get to you just the final location.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,390
So all these packets may take different paths to actually get to your computer or back to your cell

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,230
phone or whatever browser you are using.

35
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,430
What they really care about is the fastest way to get back to your destination at your home IP address

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,130
and then once the packets reach you they're reassembled to show whatever page you were looking for.

37
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,900
All of this moves at close the speed of light.

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,450
So it happens very fast.

39
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,090
OK that was a really high level explanation.

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,190
But for our purposes it's really all we need to know for now.

41
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,980
Let's continue on by discussing what we mean by the term full stack.

42
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,980
There are two main components of a Web site.

43
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,900
There's the front end of a Web site in the back end of a Web site the front end of a web site is what

44
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,090
you see as a user on the Web site and then the back end is the technology used to actually decide what

45
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,940
to show you on the front end.

46
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,880
For instance let's say you're looking at Facebook dot com.

47
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,490
So what you see the colors the actual content there that's all the front and stuff the back end is what

48
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,700
the sides if you're a user coming in what pictures or content or comments to retrieve from the database

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,430
and then show it to you on the front and so let's talk a little bit more about that front and the front

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,250
end really revolves around three key technologies.

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,340
L CSSA and Javascript.

52
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,810
You will hear about the front end technologies such as Jake queery and bootstrap which we also cover

53
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,870
in this course but those are actually all things built using those previous three H.M.S. SS and Javascript.

54
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,500
Those are really the three core front end technologies that basically every modern web site uses today.

55
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,310
H.T. email is hypertext markup language and every Web site will have HTL.

56
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,540
Its the structure of the page and you can actually view it by right clicking and selecting new page

57
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:57,970
source.

58
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,610
If you're using the Chrome browser on any Web site so you can open up your browser on this page right

59
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,080
click select View page source and you'll actually see the page Tim L..

60
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,450
For whatever web site you're looking at then there's CSSA which is cascading style sheets.

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,110
And C Ss is the actual styling of the Web site colors fonts borders etc. it's all defined by CSX.

62
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,080
And C Ss is not mandatory but almost all sites have it in order to make the Web site look good.

63
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,190
And then finally javascript allows you to add interactivity to the Web site including programming logic

64
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,390
and he said if interactivity uses Javascript in some way.

65
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,980
Otherwise if the site doesn't actually do anything it just displays information.

66
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,120
The site is known as a static web site.

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,560
OK so the first half of this course is going to focus on the front end and the front end in some way

68
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,300
it's always going to use those three technologies.

69
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:54,500
However it's the back end where a multitude of options come up so the back end of a site has three components.

70
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,590
The language you choose for the back and the framework you choose for that language and the database

71
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,940
you want to connect to technologies such as ph P..

72
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,170
No it's Ruby on Rails Java pythonic cetera are all viable options for a web site.

73
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,680
So how do we actually decide which option to choose will our course Bakan uses the python as the language

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,670
Django as a framework for Python and then sequel.

75
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,310
As the database Python is a great language to learn.

76
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,830
It's simple powerful and already has many libraries for it.

77
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,430
So what does that actually mean.

78
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,970
Well it's simple because the actual syntax of programming through python is based on code readability

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,890
and clarity.

80
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,730
Meaning you're going to save yourself a lot of time programming because of how easy Python is to learn

81
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,340
and type with.

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,130
And then it's powerful and scalable and it also has many libraries already attached to it.

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,680
So if you're interested in an application such as machine learning for your web site data visualization

84
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,530
free web site or even things such as gaming for your web site.

85
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,660
Python already has many libraries you can use to implement those ideas into your project.

86
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,400
And Django is the most powerful and popular framework for Python.

87
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:11,220
It's fast secure and scalable and it's used by many actual web sites such as Pinterest Instagram bitbucket

88
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,310
they all run on Django and then sequel light comes of jinglin Python making it a very easy choice to

89
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,890
use as our database.

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,580
As we continue along the course we're going to be discussing each of these topics in much more detail

91
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,630
but for now you should have a high level view of what we use in this course to turn you into a full

92
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,910
stack web developer with Shingo full stack meaning.

93
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,330
We combined the front end technologies with the backend technologies so you can create a Web site all

94
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,010
the way through from scratch.

95
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,340
Ok now that we have the high level overview Let's go ahead and get started with the rest of the course.
