00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,960
Well everyone welcome back to Part 6 ogic exercise solutions.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,880
We're going to be cutting through the solutions for the previous exercises.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,400
Let's hop over and get started.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,920
OK.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:25,250
For the first problem we had to do was actually console log the length of this name so how can we do

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,580
that.

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:32,780
Well first we need to create a method called the method name lines and then when I'm going to do is

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:40,440
call the function and then have the set of curly brackets here and I will console log.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:50,230
And then I'm going to say this guy name that link and we didn't see an exact example of this of calling

10
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,520
another property off the initial key value pair property the Hopefully are able to figure this out.

11
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,760
So again this refers back to employee or current object.

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,850
Do we have a name which is this property right here.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,690
And then I want to grab the link to that name which I say with that length and that's how you grab the

14
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,410
length off of this name.

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,560
Let's go down to Problem number two and Problem number two we wanted to write a program that will create

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,780
an alert in the browser of each of the object values and the key value pairs.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,780
So for example it should alert.

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,370
My name is John Smith job as programmer age is 31.

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:41,300
So I'll call this method report we call the function won't have a name and then I say alerts and I'm

20
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:48,600
going to say name is in loans concatenate everything we need we want this done name.

21
00:01:48,910 --> 00:02:01,970
And then I also want to concatenate Khama job is and then I want to say this job and then I'm going

22
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:12,350
to concatenate with comma ages and then concatenate that with this dot age and that's all you had to

23
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,130
do for this one.

24
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,020
It's basically a bunch of this calls.

25
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,360
So again this employee and then grabbed the actual properties name job and age and concatenate that

26
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,730
all into a single alert call.

27
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,860
All right.

28
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,280
Finally the last problem.

29
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,930
Problem number three which was add a method called last name that prints out the employee's last name

30
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,120
the con..

31
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,500
This is a little bit trickier because you had to figure out how to split a string to an array in order

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,940
to just grab this right here.

33
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,930
Let's show you how we can do that.

34
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:49,740
You were able to figure it out or create a method called last name type in function and then going to

35
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:58,360
do is say cancel the log and I will grab this name and we had to do was you had to figure out you can

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:06,220
call that split on a string and then as a parameter to that split method you can passen whatever you

37
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,040
want to split on.

38
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,370
And I want to split on a blank space here between the first and last name and then after that that returns

39
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,110
an array.

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,440
So index for the second item in the array which is the last name.

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,270
Index 1 and that's how you can create a method that prints out the employee's last name.

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,390
So again just to quickly review this one.

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,580
This becomes the actual object we're in right now called the Data named property and that's the string

44
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,060
John Smith.

45
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm going to take John Smith and then call split and I pass in an empty string here.

46
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,450
Well it's not empty space there because I want to split on the space and that returns an array of two

47
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:43,870
items.

48
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,940
The first name and the last name John and Smith and I want to grab the second item index one which is

49
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,610
Smith and that's the last name.

50
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,930
OK hopefully you enjoyed those.

51
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,620
And you were able to figure them all out if you had a little bit of trouble with them.

52
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,660
Don't worry about it too much.

53
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,820
We'll get more practice later on the course.

54
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,850
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next section.
