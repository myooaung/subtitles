00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.790
Hello everyone and welcome to part five of CSSA level on in this lecture will briefly cover a CSSA topic

2
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.640
known as specificity.

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.520
Specificity defines the hierarchy of CSA styling and what type of tags overrule others.

4
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.200
We've actually already briefly seen this when we were using the Asterix tag and we saw how even though

5
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.440
we use the Asterix tag in an attempt to cover all the tags in an aged him l document tags the had an

6
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.630
ID call on them.

7
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.750
We're able to maintain their styling.

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.160
We're going to cover the hierarchy of this in this lecture.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.070
Let's get started by jumping straight to the Adam text editor.

10
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.910
All right here I have the part 5 HTML document open and I have a heading for.

11
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.190
For specificity.

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.880
But what I'm going to do is add in an ordered list and each list item is going to have a particular

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.470
tag with it.

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.640
So this first list item is going to belong to a class and we'll call this class top items.

15
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:11.400
And we'll give it the name roll call it just first and then the second list is going to say an ID and

16
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.410
that id will be too.

17
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.210
But it will also belong to the class top items will say it's the seconds.

18
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:32.040
And finally we'll have third WIPs and then another list item called fourth.

19
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.680
So let's save that refresh over here.

20
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.730
Zoom in a bit and we see we have the first second third and fourth item in this list.

21
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.950
The first one has only the class.

22
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.840
The second one has an ID and a class and then the last two third of four or just normal list items.

23
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.080
Let's see what happens as we begin to add in styling.

24
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.720
Let's say we just style everything that has illai to it and we say OK the color of all list items are

25
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.760
going to be read by your freshest page all list items become red.

26
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.430
But now let's say I also grab the top items class.

27
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:17.540
So remember if a class we have to use that period or dot and I call color here and I color blue what

28
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.850
do we think is going to happen here.

29
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.380
Well if I refresh I notice now anything with the class top items has become blue.

30
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.010
So top items is higher in the hierarchy than a general tag call.

31
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.700
That kind of makes sense you would want general tag calls to happen after you have a class and then

32
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.240
further up the hierarchy.

33
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.740
On top of a class is an actual ID.

34
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.050
And remember we do IDs with a hash tag.

35
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:51.550
So right now I have the ID of two and I'm going to specify this to have a border or won't give it a

36
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.450
3 pixel border.

37
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.320
That's solid black save this refreshes page.

38
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.370
Now I can see that on top of not just the normal tag or the class tag ID has superseded that just as

39
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.280
a general no.

40
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.520
Throughout this course we actually won't deal with the issue of specificity too often because we're

41
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.550
going to be using more formatted CSSA focusing on other things or just using bootstrap we won't run

42
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.410
into this issue too often but it's something you should be aware of in case you find yourself one day

43
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.390
working with CSSA and you're unsure why some effects aren't taking place.

44
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.370
Maybe you're accidentally overwriting something due to its specificity in the part 5 underscore master

45
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.650
that CSSA file that comes with the download for this course.

46
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.680
You'll notice that there are two links and I'm going to expand this right now and talk about them.

47
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.690
The first link is the muzzle Developer Network page on specificity.

48
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.920
It talks about the concept.

49
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.220
It actually talks about how it's calculated where specific specificity is actually a weight that's applied

50
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.310
to a given CSSA declaration and it takes a little more about it.

51
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.540
In other one that the other link is here it's called design Sheck.

52
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.220
And it just talks about what the heck is CSSA specificity and actually like this link galop because

53
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:14.560
it just talks about tags versus tags so what wins in class versus class what wins an ID versus class.

54
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.990
What wins in a pseudo class versus a pseudo element etc. and different levels of specificity.

55
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.010
Again not something that we're going to be running into a whole lot throughout this course but it is

56
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.510
something you should be aware of.

57
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.300
OK.

58
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.720
That's really all that I wanted to talk about for this lecture.

59
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.170
Just the fact that specificity exists and probably the main ones are going to be running into is ID

60
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.640
superceding class superseding a general tag call.

61
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.530
Okay.

62
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.670
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture where we begin explaining your assessment for this

63
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.830
section of the course.
