00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,690
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,610
And this lecture will show you how to create edits from the list you as I mentioned.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,870
You can also add the ability to edit attribute values from the list view.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,450
Instead of having to click into that detail view and again this is an easy attribute addition.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,370
Let's quickly show you how to hop over to the editor.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,940
OK so here I am an admin that pi the attribute need to add to this is called List underscore editable

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,520
equals and then you just add in the list of the attributes or fields that you want to be able to edit

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,740
from that list view.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,610
Now keep in mind those attributes are fields that you can edit.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,880
Also have to be displayed.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,530
Otherwise it won't make sense.

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,170
You need to display something so you can edit it.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,360
So I'm going to go ahead and say let's edit the link.

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:59,110
And then I will save this and then bring back my actual browser so bringing in my browser and this is

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,950
what it looks like right now.

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,810
Let me refresh this and you'll notice now in my list view I can edit the changes so maybe I can make

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,070
this 100 minutes here and then save that and can see the changes and you can even see the filter affected

18
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,280
those changes as well.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,330
So this makes it really easy to do both changes or bulk additions from the list view instead of having

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,260
to click in to the actual detail view based off some sort of field.

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,870
So again this hopefully makes your life a lot easier.

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,760
Now as a quick note you should be cautious with this approach because if you intend the multiple people

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,390
to have access to the admin page and have access to this list view you may cause problems.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
If they're trying to edit the same attribute or same field at the same time.

25
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:44,180
Basically whoever clicked Save last ends up having the final say so keep that in mind that you kind

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,400
of play around with this again.

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,600
The attribute is if we can come back here is just list underscore editable and you have to remember

28
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,800
that needs to be under display as well.

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,010
OK thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
