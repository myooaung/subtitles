00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.330
Hello everyone and welcome to the CSSA level on assessment for this assessment.

2
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.090
You will be given an h t m l file it's actually already filled out with content.

3
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.440
It will be your task to edit in additional CSSA file to make the age T.M. look like the solution CSSA

4
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.920
version.

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.580
So there's going to be three files you need to actually complete this.

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.280
You're going to need to grab from the C as it's level 1 folder these three files right here the level

7
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.070
on assessment see assess level an assessment HVM L and then the test solutions see a SS file.

8
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.870
Let's explore the assessment and explain how these three files are going to work.

9
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.380
All right so here we have my editor open as well as my browser and I have downloaded the three files

10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.070
I need.

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.610
The assessment that the SS file the assessment team T.M. file and then the solutions that CSSA file.

12
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.890
So if I open up those files and take a look at first the M L file so C is s level 1 assessment that

13
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.970
h m l.

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.370
This is basically HTL file that we're going to be working with with C Ss.

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.670
So for this test you're actually not going to be editing any aged him out but instead you're going to

16
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.120
be editing a C S file it's link to this T.M..

17
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.200
So what we can do right now is just comments out with control or command forward slash any link to the

18
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.670
CSSA refresh this assessment test.

19
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.900
And this is what it looks like at first it says Welcome to the free blog.

20
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.490
Thanks so much for visiting the site.

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.540
What is this site for.

22
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.730
Etc. and you see there's a link here that takes you to Google.

23
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.870
We can expand this text area.

24
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.850
Please log in to save your post etc. questions or comments sent feedback here.

25
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.230
All right.

26
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.680
So we see we have a very basic html site if we undo the link to the solutions that we assess and then

27
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.030
refresh this.

28
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.410
We can see that there's a ton of styling here so we've given stuff boarder's stuff background change

29
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.990
the font color changed some borders down here etc..

30
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.380
So this Web site is not meant to look better.

31
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.860
In fact I would say it looks worse than it did without the C Ss but it's meant for you to practice various

32
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.600
aspects of C Ss that we learn in level 1.

33
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.880
So what you'll end up doing is once you've opened up the safety mail file you're going to change the

34
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.770
reference.

35
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.670
Apart from the solutions back to your assessment.

36
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:22.140
So you say see a little one test or level one and you will then make sure it matches the SS file.

37
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.880
You're going to be filling out which is C Level 1 assessment.

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.070
Save that refreshed this and right now it's blank.

39
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.840
So now if we go to this file CSSA want assessment that see SS.

40
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.120
We click on it and we notice here that we actually have a bunch of comments in it and basically for

41
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.330
this test what you're going to be doing is just doing the tasks here.

42
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.520
So for instance it says give the body element of the site a light blue background using a hex code.

43
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.910
So remember just to do this first task to kind of walk you through what the assessment will be like

44
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.070
you'll fall.

45
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.430
So it says give the body element.

46
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.150
OK so I know I want to grab the body and give it a light blue background so I'll say something like

47
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.030
background color and if I wanted it to be dark blue or just a normal blue I would say something like

48
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.970
this blue.

49
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.170
If I refreshed this now everything is blue but you'll have to do when you start this task.

50
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.040
Is use a hex code to do this.

51
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.540
So you wants to be a light blue background color using a hex code and don't worry about any particular

52
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.520
shade of light blue.

53
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.540
It's really up to you.

54
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.190
And then you have test to change each one to have a one pixel solid black border etc. so you can see

55
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.560
here you're going to be editing this assess a little by little until it essentially matches what looks

56
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.660
like the solutions.

57
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.130
OK.

58
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.170
And at the very end there's a bonus challenge and you can.

59
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.080
There's a link to Google here that will say a little.

60
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.980
Hence the challenge.

61
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.370
But don't worry about it too much.

62
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.520
Basically just complete tasks 1 through 9 and then the next lecture actually going to be coding through

63
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.090
the solution.

64
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.960
So again you're just working of the CSSA file here.

65
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.590
That's connected to the assessment that if you ever need a refresher on what the final product essentially

66
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.680
looks like reconnects this email file to the solutions.

67
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.310
What I don't want you to do is just immediately open this solution see SS file.

68
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.310
Don't do that until you've given your best shot to the assessment test.

69
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.020
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
