00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,840
Hello everyone and welcome back to Part 9 javascript level 1 project.

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,200
So we've completed all the normal lectures for dropped script level 1 and now it's time to actually

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,140
do a project for this project.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,550
You'll be creating a simple web site that asks the visitor questions using javascript and the prompt

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,480
function that we worked with earlier.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,280
However through all of these questions you're going to be secretly checking to see if there is a spy

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,060
present and the spy is going to answer the questions in a very particular way.

8
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,380
Behind the scenes are going to be using javascript to check for certain correct answers to questions.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,110
And if you find the spy do the correct answers you're going to leave them a secret message in the console

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,000
for them to check.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,380
OK.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,790
You're going to be needing to check the part 9 underscore J s underscore project but a team file has

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,330
the full instructions and the full correct answers.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,230
An example solution of the job secrets file is located under Part 9.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,110
Yes.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,820
So remember to link to your own dot script before getting started.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,230
So again you're only going to be editing a javascript file.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,110
You won't actually be touching any Timo.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,520
All right let's briefly explore the instruction page and see an example of what it should look like.

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,230
After you're done with it and what hop over to the editor room browser now.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,020
OK here you have the actual HTML document open in my editor and also it links to the javascript filed

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,360
a contains the solutions and this is what it looks like over here in the browser.

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,130
So again just quickly to point out if you scroll all the way down on the part 9 javascript project body

24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,830
smell page right here under the script connection.

25
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,460
It will connect to the solution script so it'll actually connect to part 9.

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,970
But yes that's what you can connect it to if you want to see what an example solution looks like in

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,810
your browser.

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,130
But I recommend that once you're done dealing with that you change the source to your own javascript

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,470
file so you can play around with working through the solution again everything you're doing is just

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,560
in a javascript file.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,350
You won't actually be editing and he watched him for this.

32
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,260
So let me show you what he actually asked him ilks like I've linked to here in my browser and going

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,400
to zoom in a little bit so we can read it together.

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,950
But here we have the welcome to part 9 your javascript level 1 project.

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,210
And like I mentioned for this project you're going to be building a generic web site that just seems

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,340
to ask some mundane questions that normal users but secretly you are looking for a spy and anyone visiting

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,380
your web site is going to be asked a series of questions but only the spy is going to give you specific

38
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,730
answers that you expect.

39
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,050
And if all the questions are answered correctly you're going to post a secret message in the Council

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,170
for the spy to read.

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,740
So it's up to you what ever the secret messages be going to use cancel that log.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,530
If the answer the questions correctly.

43
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,230
So here are the four conditions you're going to be checking for the spy.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,860
So the spy has the same first letter of her first name and her last name.

45
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,850
So for example someone could be named Jose Johnson and J and J match.

46
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,000
So that's the first letter and last letter.

47
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,010
So that's a correct condition for the spy.

48
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,660
The spy is also between the age of 20 and 30 exclusive of 20 at 30.

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,810
So for example a 26 year old spy works.

50
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,590
Then the spy is also at least 170 centimeters tall.

51
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,070
Here we have 175 centimeters.

52
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,670
And the spy has a pet name that ends with the letter Y.

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,280
And in this case a pet name of Sammy would work.

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,140
So you're going to ask the spy for their first name last name.

55
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,000
What is their age.

56
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,100
What is what is their height in centimeters and what is their pet name.

57
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,060
And if the answer we think correctly according to these conditions so you're going to check these conditions

58
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,430
using everything you learned about control flow.

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,920
You will log a secret message to the consul and then they can inspect the page look at the consul and

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,070
see if you left them anything.

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,770
All right.

62
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,170
So again we're just using javascript here and you can prompt for the information in any order you want

63
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,240
and you can even do things like separate the first name prompt from the last name prompt.

64
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,210
They'll probably make your life a little easier but all we're doing is just checking to see if these

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,940
four conditions are true.

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,660
This one this one this one and this one.

67
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,980
So let's actually refresh this page and see what happens.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,510
Well this actually looks like we're going to refresh and it says Hello and welcome please and to your

69
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,340
first name we'll say Jose.

70
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,130
And your last name will see Johnson.

71
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,310
How old are you.

72
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,810
We'll say 26.

73
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,930
We'll say we're 175 centimeters in the net.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,520
The name of our pet is Sammy.

75
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,870
Oh OK.

76
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,460
Thank you so much for the information.

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,460
OK.

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,460
And that's it it looks like nothing happened.

79
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:29,450
But if I inspect and go to my counsel it says Welcome comrade you've passed us by test and exam and

80
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,710
we are going to be doing.

81
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,620
Let's refresh page and make sure that if I just put garbage.

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:46,460
So let's say my name is Andy will I am 42 and 10 centimeters tall.

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,720
My name or my pet is I don't know said OK.

84
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,890
And it says sorry nothing to see here.

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,430
OK.

86
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,220
Hopefully you get an idea of what this project's actually getting at in the next lecture.

87
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,370
I'll be coding out some solutions in the script file.

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,230
Thanks everyone.

89
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,240
Hope you enjoy the project.

90
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,220
I'll see you at the next lecture.
