00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,380
Hello everyone and welcome to the CSSA level one section of the course.

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,530
We've now completed h T.M. both sections and it's time to move on to learning about CSSA and the SS

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,570
will have two sections to it Level 1 and level 2.

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,950
CSA stands for cascading style sheets and CSSA really describes how Timah elements are displayed on

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,990
the page and we're going to take this lecture to describe what's the SS is and show you some examples

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,070
of its true power so styling can affect many things such as color font size borders and many more properties

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,420
of h m l.

8
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,220
So far I've been able to create basic h tim l documents while they may have some content and a little

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,330
bit of functionality.

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,070
They basically all look the same and when you're actually on the web you want things to look nice and

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:55,160
usually the fine styling outside of the html file you create a separate CSSA file and then link that

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,540
to the HTML file.

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,100
We're going to show later on some examples that you can actually find styling within the HTML document

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,710
itself.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,710
But it's a much more common and better practice to separate your styling into a CSSA file and then link

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,220
it to the html file in the head of that a small file document.

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,020
And that's where we're going to be discussing that meta data OK.

18
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,980
Let's show a quick example of just how powerful CSSA can be.

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,710
Exploring the same HMO code but with different CSSA linked to it.

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,400
Let me go to this link right here if you can find that just by googling W3 schools see SS and there's

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,920
actually lots of Web sites that show similar examples of this.

22
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,310
So you can just google search CSSA demos and you'll find lots of Web sites like this one.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,570
To open my browser and jump to this link.

24
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:40,550
Ok here I am at my browser and I've come to the W3 schools dot com Web site that has CSSA introduction

25
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,260
and you'll notice here on the left hand panel is actually a really nice reference to a bunch of CSSA

26
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,020
topics such as outlines text fonts etc..

27
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,690
We're going to be covering a lot of these but throughout the course if you feel like you need more reference

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,190
you can just visit W3 school ZCom on CSSA.

29
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,420
Another Web site I want to mention that I like probably a little better than W3 schools is the Mozilla

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,230
developer network.

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,780
They also have a ton of information about cascading style sheets or CSSA they have tutorials introduction

32
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,840
reference and as you become more of a developer.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,610
As you already learned the tools you'll probably be using the reference more than the tutorials and

34
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,920
introduction sections.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,910
So just keep that in mind these are two really great links for you to check out.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,590
In case you want to dive deeper into some of the stuff we talk about during this course but I just want

37
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,540
to show you the s.c.s introduction page which actually has a kind of a fun demo so you can see what

38
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,850
a simple page with multiple styles.

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:39,200
Notice if you scroll down here it says Welcome to my home page and this is HVM L that's linked to SS

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,320
and you'll notice we see that we have the screen header bar.

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,130
You have some different fonts etc..

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,380
A little sidebar but we also have these links to different stylesheets and if I click on one of these

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,870
links to style sheet number 2 for instance you'll notice the website completely changes.

44
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,080
But the fun fact to know here is that this is actually the exact same h HTML code.

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,830
The only thing that's changing is the CSSA file that it's linked to.

46
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,620
So all the changes you see here when you hit on the stylesheets is just sheer CSSA none of the Himself

47
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,460
is changing the content changing just the CSSA changing itself.

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,770
And they can really see me cook Ancel shoot for here just how powerful CSSA is it can make your website

49
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,330
look completely different.

50
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,600
Using the same content and if we click on No stylesheet.

51
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,150
This is what we've been working with just pure H Tim L So the same page just different stylesheets.

52
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,100
There's no stylesheet you can see as you play around with these.

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,960
You can get a vastly different looking website with all the style sheets.

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,640
And after these two CSSA level 1 and level 2 sections are going to be learning about Bootstrap which

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,820
helps streamline a lot of this process and take care.

56
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,290
A lot of the work for you.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,450
But before we hit bootstrap we really should understand CSSA itself that way if we ever need to customize

58
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,050
anything we can do that before we just jump straight into bootstrap.

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,160
OK so let's continue on and start learning about the basics of SS.

60
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,050
Thanks everyone and I'll see in the next lecture.
