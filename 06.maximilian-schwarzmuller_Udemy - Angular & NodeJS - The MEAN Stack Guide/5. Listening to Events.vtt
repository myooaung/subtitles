We want to create new poets and we get that post create component,

00:05.640 --> 00:07.510
thus far it only got a title,

00:07.650 --> 00:12.720
well what do we need to create new posts? As a core minimum,

00:12.720 --> 00:18.310
we need an input and we need a button to save that post, right.

00:18.420 --> 00:26.550
So let's add both in the template of post create, an input, a normal text input or maybe a text area because

00:26.580 --> 00:29.720
we want to be able to enter more text in just one line

00:29.910 --> 00:31.890
so let's add a text area.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.870
Now we don't need a name,

00:33.900 --> 00:40.380
we can omit ID, columns we don't need that, rows I'll set this to 6 so that it's a bit smaller

00:40.620 --> 00:44.610
and if we save that, we see a text area, no style

00:44.640 --> 00:48.270
so it's not that pretty, we'll come back to the styling soon,

00:48.300 --> 00:50.140
let's focus on the logic for now.

00:50.550 --> 00:56.550
As I said we also need a button, let's add a button below the text area where we say save posts like

00:56.550 --> 00:57.600
that

00:57.840 --> 01:00.860
and now of course this doesn't do anything, it looks super ugly,

01:00.930 --> 01:03.560
let's actually do something about that,

01:03.660 --> 01:06.250
let's add a horizontal line between the two for now

01:06.420 --> 01:08.720
but it's still not pretty but we can work with that.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.160
So we can click that button but it doesn't do anything,

01:11.160 --> 01:16.660
we can enter anything here but that of course doesn't create a new post because what's missing, the logic,

01:16.680 --> 01:18.070
well also the styling

01:18.150 --> 01:20.000
but mainly the logic.

01:20.100 --> 01:23.980
How would the browser know what we want to do when we click save post?

01:24.030 --> 01:27.920
It can't and that is exactly the logic we'll add with angular.

01:28.020 --> 01:34.170
Now to do something upon a click here, we need to add a click listener and we do that with a feature

01:34.170 --> 01:41.190
called event binding. Event binding is an angular feature which allows us to listen to events in a declarative

01:41.190 --> 01:47.280
way, which means instead of using javascript where we would go to our code and then try to select the

01:47.280 --> 01:52.610
element with query selector or anything like that and then use add event listener on the element,

01:52.890 --> 01:58.950
instead of doing all that programmatically, we go to our template and we add something there which is

01:58.950 --> 02:02.290
not default html but which is understood by angular

02:02.340 --> 02:09.330
since this is an angular component, we add parentheses and in between there, the name of the event we want

02:09.330 --> 02:13.480
to listen to and that's now not onClick but just click,

02:13.530 --> 02:15.510
so the name without on

02:15.660 --> 02:20.450
and you can of course also listen to things like mousedown, mouseenter and so on.

02:20.460 --> 02:27.870
But here it's click then equal and then quotation marks between which you define the code you want

02:27.870 --> 02:28.760
to execute.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.470
Now that can't be complex code here in the template

02:31.590 --> 02:39.220
and typically you just pass the name of a method of that component class here which should be executed.

02:39.480 --> 02:45.480
So we could add a method, that's a function in a class to that post create component and I'll simply

02:45.480 --> 02:48.670
name it on add post.

02:48.840 --> 02:54.010
The name is up to you but you typically start with an on at the beginning of your method name for methods

02:54.060 --> 02:56.610
that are triggered upon events.

02:56.610 --> 03:01.200
Now in there, we want to get information about that new post,

03:01.200 --> 03:01.920
right

03:02.280 --> 03:08.610
and for now, what I'll do is I'll just throw an alert, post added so that we can see if that worked if we

03:08.610 --> 03:11.190
successfully triggered this.

03:11.210 --> 03:20.240
Now I pass this on add post function name here including the parentheses to click.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.140
What this will do is it will connect both, after reloading if I click save post,

03:24.170 --> 03:25.700
we see that alert appear

03:25.790 --> 03:27.690
so that worked.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.510
Now that's the first step,

03:29.510 --> 03:32.030
we are able to listen to the events,

03:32.090 --> 03:37.670
we're not able to get the input we entered here and we're not able to output anything on the screen

03:37.750 --> 03:39.290
other than that alert.

03:39.290 --> 03:41.420
These are the things we'll work on next.
