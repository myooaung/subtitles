00:02.240 --> 00:06.620
Over the previous modules, we built quite a nice application already

00:06.770 --> 00:10.100
but one crucial thing is missing, authentication.

00:10.190 --> 00:12.230
Right now we got no users,

00:12.230 --> 00:19.910
our posts are created by anonymous users, everyone can create posts, everyone can edit or delete posts.

00:19.910 --> 00:25.970
Now it's time to restrict access and make sure that everyone can read posts but not everyone can create

00:25.970 --> 00:29.110
them and not everyone can edit or delete them,

00:29.270 --> 00:33.560
only the creators of posts should be able to delete them for example.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.240
Now we will implement this step by step since it involves

00:37.250 --> 00:43.880
quite a lot of things and we'll start simple by adding an authentication form, for sign-up and for login

00:43.880 --> 00:50.400
and thereafter we'll dive into how we create users, how we secure our application, how we authorize

00:50.430 --> 00:53.910
certain actions like creating posts and so on.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.920
So let's dive into all these things in this module.
