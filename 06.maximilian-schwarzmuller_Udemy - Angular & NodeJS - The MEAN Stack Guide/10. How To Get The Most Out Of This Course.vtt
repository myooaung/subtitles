So now that you know the structure of this course, the remaining question is, how do you get the most out

1
00:08.160 --> 00:11.840
of this course because that is honestly very important to me?

2
00:12.320 --> 00:18.900
Obviously I strongly recommend watching the videos and watch them in the order I uploaded them because

3
00:18.900 --> 00:25.470
with that order, I did my best to ensure that you have a great learning experience and a good learning

4
00:25.470 --> 00:26.050
curve.

5
00:26.370 --> 00:33.690
You might need to increase or reduce the playback speed for some videos or pause sometimes, because I

6
00:33.690 --> 00:38.900
try to go through the content of this course on an average speed,

7
00:38.910 --> 00:45.570
I'm not super-slow and I try to not be super-fast but everyone is different when it comes to this,

8
00:45.570 --> 00:47.700
some students want a slower pace,

9
00:47.760 --> 00:52.330
some students want a faster pace and really use the tools the Udemy

10
00:52.460 --> 00:55.820
player gives you to adjust these to your needs.

11
00:55.890 --> 00:57.600
Now watching the videos is great

12
00:57.720 --> 01:01.650
but I always recommend that you code along.

13
01:01.650 --> 01:02.470
Write the code that

14
01:02.490 --> 01:06.050
I teach you in this course on your own, follow along.

15
01:06.270 --> 01:11.910
You will find code snapshots provided by me attached to the last lecture of every module so that you

16
01:11.910 --> 01:18.990
can compare your code to mine in case you're facing any errors, because that really enhances the way you

17
01:18.990 --> 01:20.870
learn if you code along and

18
01:21.000 --> 01:28.020
as I said, use the course resources like these attached code snippets but also the extra links I have

19
01:28.020 --> 01:34.940
in the last lecture of every module to dive deeper, to solve errors and to really become a 

20
01:35.000 --> 01:36.360
Node/Angular master.

21
01:36.520 --> 01:38.810
Now finally and that's also important,

22
01:38.880 --> 01:44.820
there is a Q&A section in this course and if you've got any course-related questions, so questions related

23
01:44.820 --> 01:50.880
to the course source code or some logical question about some concept I taught here, please post them

24
01:50.880 --> 01:51.630
there,

25
01:51.660 --> 01:55.450
I do read and reply there regularly. Now

26
01:55.660 --> 02:04.110
asking is great but often, you can solve issues on your own by Googling, by comparing code and you can

27
02:04.110 --> 02:08.240
also help other students. If you see open questions, please

28
02:08.250 --> 02:10.020
also reply there.

29
02:10.260 --> 02:16.160
It can be hard to do that because you're afraid that your answer might be wrong, but who cares?

30
02:16.350 --> 02:20.480
Even if it's wrong, then you'll learn again because someone is going to correct you,

31
02:20.490 --> 02:25.280
I really want you to interact because by answering, you will learn the most.

32
02:25.320 --> 02:31.830
Asking is easy, answering is much harder and it challenges you to think about a problem, to come up with

33
02:31.830 --> 02:32.660
a solution and

34
02:32.730 --> 02:38.360
if you want to become a true master, definitely dive into questions and answer them,

35
02:38.550 --> 02:40.980
that will really help you the most,

36
02:40.980 --> 02:48.780
I promise. And that is how you should get the most out of the course and really become a great

37
02:48.780 --> 02:51.010
Angular/Node developer by the end of it.
