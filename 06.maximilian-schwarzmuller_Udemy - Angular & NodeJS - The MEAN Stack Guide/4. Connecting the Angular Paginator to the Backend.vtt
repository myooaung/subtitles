00:02.310 --> 00:09.580
So let's connect Angular to our new back-end or to our updated back-end. We are fetching posts in post

00:09.580 --> 00:17.010
list component here with get posts and therefore, we have to go to the service, to this getPost method

00:17.010 --> 00:19.270
and work on that. Here

00:19.350 --> 00:20.520
on this URL,

00:20.550 --> 00:27.750
we should attach our query parameters. For that, I'll create a new constant here, name it queryParams, the name

00:27.750 --> 00:31.610
is up to you and turn this into a template expression, we have

00:31.630 --> 00:33.450
two back ticks. Important, 

00:33.510 --> 00:35.400
these are not single quotation marks,

00:35.400 --> 00:36.870
these are back ticks,

00:36.960 --> 00:42.980
that's a special Javascript feature which allows us to dynamically add values into a normal string.

00:43.910 --> 00:48.920
So here I want to create my queryParams by first of all adding that question mark which separates the

00:48.980 --> 00:55.030
other URL from my query parameters and then the query parameters I want to pass onto the back- 

00:55.030 --> 00:55.750
end.

00:55.820 --> 00:58.710
And here we have to make sure we get the naming right,

00:58.760 --> 01:06.890
if on the back-end, we are accepting page size and page, written exactly like this, then we should also

01:06.890 --> 01:09.240
pass query parameters with these names,

01:09.470 --> 01:11.800
so page size and page.

01:11.800 --> 01:19.720
So back in the service here, I'm setting up page size which is equal to a value

01:19.730 --> 01:21.910
I need to get here as an argument,

01:22.130 --> 01:28.700
so there I want to get my postsPerPage, you can name this however you want and this will be a number

01:29.300 --> 01:35.950
and I want to get my current page which will also be a number and now I will use postsPerPage here

01:36.080 --> 01:41.840
and now that's a feature provided by this expression, by the template literal syntax here.

01:42.110 --> 01:44.850
We can add a dollar sign and two curly braces

01:45.080 --> 01:50.620
and in there, I add postsPerPage and then also the other parameter with an & sign

01:50.690 --> 01:54.920
that's separating the pairs of query params.

01:54.980 --> 01:57.890
Here we got page which is equal to,

01:57.890 --> 02:04.370
again using that dynamic value injection here which is equal to the current page,

02:04.520 --> 02:06.630
this argument we're getting here.

02:06.920 --> 02:14.120
Now with that, we're constructing the query params, we now simply add them to the end of our URL plus query

02:14.120 --> 02:15.650
params like this

02:15.650 --> 02:18.050
and now we send an updated request.

02:18.410 --> 02:24.050
This of course means that we need to send the right data from within our post list component.

02:24.410 --> 02:33.130
So back to that post list component, here in getPosts, we should actually send this post per page,

02:33.260 --> 02:38.410
so this public property we added here and as a second value,

02:38.420 --> 02:43.620
well I want to start on page one, so I will simply send a one as a value here, whoops,

02:43.730 --> 02:45.910
and that's a one this too much.

02:45.950 --> 02:54.200
So now we got this post per page and one as our current page. This is now fetching the post for

02:54.200 --> 02:55.270
page one

02:55.430 --> 03:01.260
and if we go back to our application, we already see whatever we do here doesn't matter right now,

03:01.370 --> 03:06.410
we already see we only get two posts here, even though we have three in total.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.100
So we're getting there.

03:08.270 --> 03:13.180
Of course we now need to also re-fetch posts if we change pagination,

03:13.190 --> 03:21.380
so if we go to page two for example. I simply want to execute this line of code again but I actually

03:21.380 --> 03:28.780
want to replace these values we pass as arguments with the values I get from my page data. To be precise,

03:28.790 --> 03:32.650
I want to store that data in properties of my component.

03:32.870 --> 03:34.640
So we got posts per page,

03:34.640 --> 03:39.270
I also want to have my current page here which is one initially.

03:39.270 --> 03:43.360
So now we can use that current page here in ngOnInit,

03:43.430 --> 03:51.810
this current page and I can set it here in onChangedPage. This current page is page data,

03:51.950 --> 03:53.720
so that argument we're getting

03:53.870 --> 03:55.940
and there we have the page index,

03:55.970 --> 04:01.550
just keep in mind we have to add one here because this index starts at zero

04:01.640 --> 04:05.000
but on our back-end, we're working with one, two and so on,

04:04.990 --> 04:09.190
so we're starting at one and you could change everything to start at zero

04:09.200 --> 04:13.250
but I want to start or work with that one based index.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.700
So that's the first part

04:15.020 --> 04:22.850
but I also want to store my page size or posts per page property as it is in my component and that will

04:22.850 --> 04:30.130
be page data and then page size as selected by the user in the dropdown.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.590
And now that's updating the values, I of course now also want to use them here,

04:34.670 --> 04:37.760
I'm already using this post per page and here,

04:37.820 --> 04:40.490
I will use this current page.

04:40.490 --> 04:46.040
And now with that if I save that and I go back, I can go to page two

04:46.220 --> 04:53.130
and now we got that one post on page two and I can go back. And if I change this to five, we see them all, if I

04:53.170 --> 04:54.330
change that to one,

04:54.350 --> 05:00.260
we only see one post per page. And yes we can go through too many pages,

05:00.260 --> 05:02.000
that's one issue we have

05:02.000 --> 05:05.210
and we're also not displaying the right amount of posts here

05:05.270 --> 05:09.630
and additionally, we of course also have the problem that if we delete a post here,

05:09.890 --> 05:15.130
well then we would not update our pagination correctly or we would run into problems here,

05:15.140 --> 05:18.320
I actually want to re-fetch posts when we do that.

05:18.590 --> 05:21.980
So these are all things we'll work on in the next lectures.
