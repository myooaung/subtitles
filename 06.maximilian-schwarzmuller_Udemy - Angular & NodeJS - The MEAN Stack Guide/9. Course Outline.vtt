00:02.450 --> 00:08.540
So now that we know what the MEAN stack is and that we have our basic project set up for this course,

00:08.600 --> 00:11.450
let's see what else is inside of this course.

00:11.570 --> 00:17.840
So we're pretty much done getting started, in the next course module, we'll dive into building the Angular

00:17.870 --> 00:24.050
front-end. You'll get an Angular refresher there too, though I also recommend diving into some dedicated

00:24.080 --> 00:27.790
Angular resources, just as for Node and Express and MongoDB

00:27.830 --> 00:32.030
if you want to learn more. But with that, we'll build the core foundation,

00:32.030 --> 00:36.670
the things we can see or we'll at least start building these in that module.

00:36.670 --> 00:43.160
Thereafter, we'll already attach our backend, the Node/Express backend so that we can actually do more

00:43.250 --> 00:45.230
than just display a beautiful UI.

00:45.650 --> 00:47.820
Well and we also want to work with data and want

00:47.850 --> 00:52.050
to store and fetch that data and for that, we obviously need a database,

00:52.070 --> 00:58.140
so in the module thereafter, we'll add MongoDB to the party and therefore, a really great database.

00:58.190 --> 01:04.490
I'll show you how to add it and how to work with it from Node/Express and therefore also from Angular.

01:04.490 --> 01:10.340
Once we did that, we'll enhance our app. Now that's a very broad term, but we'll add some things to the

01:10.340 --> 01:15.240
Angular app, to the Node backend to turn this into a more realistic and better app,

01:15.260 --> 01:18.250
so this will be a really important module.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.640
Thereafter, we'll already dive into image upload,

01:21.710 --> 01:26.180
that's a super interesting topic which I was often asked about in my other courses,

01:26.210 --> 01:32.090
here we got it, here you will learn how to let the user select an image in your Angular app and then

01:32.120 --> 01:35.610
upload it to your Node/Express server and store it there

01:35.720 --> 01:41.270
and how to then also of course retrieve it. We'll thereafter have a look at another very popular topic,

01:41.400 --> 01:42.580
pagination.

01:42.710 --> 01:48.300
We get a lot of data in our database and we typically don't want to fetch all that data in one block.

01:48.520 --> 01:54.360
That is typically not what you want to do because it impacts performance, there is more data to download.

01:54.530 --> 01:57.680
So here I will show you how you can add pagination, so

01:57.710 --> 02:04.820
how you can select chunks/slices of your data to display on a given page. And thereafter, we'll dive

02:04.820 --> 02:06.270
into authentication,

02:06.350 --> 02:09.260
how can we add users, sign-up, login

02:09.260 --> 02:15.410
and how do we store the information whether a certain user is logged in in our client-side app and use

02:15.410 --> 02:18.840
it to reach protected resources on the server.

02:18.950 --> 02:25.120
Thereafter, we'll dive into something which is kind of related to authentication, authorization.

02:25.150 --> 02:33.290
Authorization is about ensuring that only users who created a post let's say, can edit and delete

02:33.350 --> 02:34.200
that post,

02:34.280 --> 02:37.190
so we'll add this in that module.

02:37.190 --> 02:42.650
We're nearing the end of the course thereafter and we'll dive into error handling,

02:42.800 --> 02:48.780
what does this means and how could we elegantly handle errors in our Angular app.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.430
Once we're done with that,

02:50.550 --> 02:56.360
we're pretty much done and we'll put some optimizations into place, both on the back-end

02:56.360 --> 02:56.990
and the front-end

02:57.110 --> 03:01.360
regarding our code, our code structure but also regarding performance.

03:01.670 --> 03:06.650
And finally, we'll of course deploy our application, actually in two different ways,

03:06.650 --> 03:09.300
on one server and on multiple servers and 

03:09.410 --> 03:14.630
I will explain the differences in this module of course. And with that, we're done and we'll have

03:14.630 --> 03:21.560
a complete MEAN app finished and deployed. And I'm very confident that once you finish this course,

03:21.770 --> 03:25.710
you'll have all the knowledge you need for your next MEAN project.
