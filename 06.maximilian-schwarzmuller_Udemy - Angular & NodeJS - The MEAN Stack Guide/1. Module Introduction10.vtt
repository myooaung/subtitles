00:02.280 --> 00:06.700
Our project is done. A lot of cool features were added,

00:06.840 --> 00:12.330
image upload, pagination, connecting the different models on the back-end, authentication, authorization,

00:12.360 --> 00:15.030
error handling,

00:15.030 --> 00:16.880
I'm very happy with it.

00:16.980 --> 00:20.270
Now it's time for some optimisations in our code

00:20.340 --> 00:22.730
but also from a performance perspective.

00:23.070 --> 00:29.700
So let's dive into our project again and see what we can improve and what we might want to change to

00:29.700 --> 00:31.620
really make it deployable.
