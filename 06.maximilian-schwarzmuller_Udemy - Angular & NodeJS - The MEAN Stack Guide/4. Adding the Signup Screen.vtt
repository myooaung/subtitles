00:02.110 --> 00:08.210
We got the login screen, let's at the sign-up screen. The sign-up screen unsurprisingly will look a lot

00:08.210 --> 00:09.780
like the login screen.

00:10.160 --> 00:16.430
So I will actually just copy these three files and add them here in the sign-up folder.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.750
Now of course I will rename the file names,

00:18.830 --> 00:25.110
so for the login-component.css file, I got sign-up component, for the login typescript file, I got

00:25.110 --> 00:27.850
sign-up and for the login.html

00:27.900 --> 00:28.790
file,

00:28.940 --> 00:30.580
I got sign-up.

00:30.830 --> 00:35.790
Now it really depends, if you have the exact same templates now,

00:36.020 --> 00:42.680
you can just reuse one template and then for example, create a login and sign-up component and a third

00:42.770 --> 00:48.860
shared component, auth form or anything like that which you just include into the login and sign-up

00:48.860 --> 00:50.650
component through it's selector.

00:50.780 --> 00:56.510
Here I'm really splitting it up to be very explicit about how this works and to really make it clear

00:56.510 --> 00:58.500
that we got two separate routes here

00:58.610 --> 01:02.150
but you could optimize this and merge a lot of the features

01:02.330 --> 01:07.810
or alternatively you might have a sign-up form where you want to listen for different inputs.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.020
Here I will use the same inputs, sign-up component templates therefore looks a lot like the login template,

01:15.200 --> 01:18.680
I will rename this here to sign-up form though,

01:18.760 --> 01:26.530
this local reference, the button at the bottom will say sign-up and the method here will be renamed to onSignup

01:26.630 --> 01:28.160
but that's already it,

01:28.250 --> 01:29.690
sign-up.

01:29.690 --> 01:36.000
Now we can go to the typescript file and there, I will rename the component to sign-up component,

01:36.050 --> 01:37.460
I will leave it like it is.

01:37.460 --> 01:44.610
However this will be called onSignup not onLogin and of course, I will point to the signup-component.html

01:44.730 --> 01:47.810
file and the signup-component.css file here.

01:47.810 --> 01:56.830
And with all that added, we can go to the app module and register the sign-up component.

01:56.830 --> 02:00.440
So here below the login component, I'll add the sign-up component,

02:00.520 --> 02:06.300
let my IDE automatically add the import part at the top which is important, save this

02:06.610 --> 02:11.160
and with that added, go to the app routing file and register a route for it.

02:11.350 --> 02:15.680
You can simply duplicate the login route, replace login with sign-up

02:15.790 --> 02:20.680
and of course replace the component you want to load with the sign-up component,

02:20.710 --> 02:25.610
also make sure to import that type into that file because you are using the type here.

02:26.810 --> 02:31.970
Now of course, I also want to update the header, so that we have a link leading to that sign-up component

02:31.970 --> 02:32.530
here.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.890
So let's go to the header component,

02:35.120 --> 02:43.420
let's replicate our list item here and go to /signup and replace the caption with sign-up.

02:43.790 --> 02:49.180
And with that if we reload, we got sign-up here and you can see we switch,

02:49.190 --> 02:55.820
you can tell by the caption on the button and again, feel free to edit these forms to really suit your

02:55.910 --> 02:59.170
needs and well, reflect the data you want to get.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.640
I don't want to focus too much on creating the form here,

03:02.690 --> 03:07.620
I want to focus on what we do on the back-end and how we then authenticate future requests,

03:07.670 --> 03:14.780
for example when we want to create a post which is why I keep that part here relatively short. We are able

03:14.780 --> 03:19.380
to sign-up and login now, at least from Angular's perspective,

03:19.670 --> 03:25.580
the next part of course is to create the back-end for this, create routes which allow us to do that

03:25.790 --> 03:30.190
and also handle new users with Mongoose and store them in the database.
