WEBVTT

00:02.220 --> 00:06.660
So now that we had this brief refresher on the very basics of angular,

00:06.660 --> 00:11.220
it's time to work on the real application we're building and we want to build a beautiful application

00:11.220 --> 00:16.590
right. Now we could write all the css styles on our own and write everything from scratch on our own

00:17.190 --> 00:20.310
but this is an angular or especially a mean stack guide

00:20.310 --> 00:24.700
and I want to focus on these mean stack components and not so much on the styling.

00:24.720 --> 00:32.000
Therefore I'll use angular material which is a package actually also created by parts of the angular

00:32.010 --> 00:36.590
team which gives us a set of pre-built angular components

00:36.600 --> 00:37.590
and that's important.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.360
It's not just a styling package,

00:39.360 --> 00:40.940
it's not like bootstrap,

00:41.010 --> 00:46.740
It's actually an angular package which ships with a couple of angular components which we can drop into

00:46.800 --> 00:47.950
our application.

00:48.030 --> 00:51.350
Now we'll still write all the core logic of our application on our own

00:51.510 --> 00:57.430
but all the nitty gritty details and to be honest, quite a lot of the styling will be taken care of.

00:57.510 --> 01:02.720
Now this uses Google's material design so of course you have to like that to be happy with that

01:03.000 --> 01:07.470
but I think it looks quite nice and if we have a look at the components part on material.angular.io,

01:07.520 --> 01:13.470
we can see it has a bunch of pre-built components that should give us everything we need to build

01:13.470 --> 01:21.180
a nice application, to include things like header, include things like our buttons, our inputs, things

01:21.180 --> 01:22.080
like that.

01:22.080 --> 01:28.420
So this is what I want to work with and to add it to our project, I'll quit my development server for

01:28.410 --> 01:32.920
now and I need to install this, so I will run npm install

01:32.940 --> 01:39.160
--save, this will install a new dependency into that project, npm is that package manager

01:39.450 --> 01:43.500
and now it's @angular/material.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.010
Now don't hit enter yet,

01:45.210 --> 01:47.140
this is one way of adding it.

01:47.220 --> 01:54.600
Now if you're using the latest cli version which you very likely are, cli version 6+ to be precise,

01:55.170 --> 01:57.250
then you've got a different command available

01:57.360 --> 02:03.220
and if you don't use that latest version, you could always update by running npm install -g @angular

02:03.240 --> 02:04.590
cli by the way.

02:04.590 --> 02:09.690
So if you use that latest version and your project was created with the latest version too, you can run

02:09.780 --> 02:11.480
ng add,

02:11.490 --> 02:15.840
now that's a cli command, @angular/material

02:15.840 --> 02:22.590
and what this will do is it will also install the material package but also already configure your project

02:22.590 --> 02:23.830
to include it

02:23.880 --> 02:28.220
and I'll of course show you what this means, what included actually means.

02:28.530 --> 02:33.570
And by the way, I also got a series on YouTube and my web page which you can check out,

02:33.570 --> 02:38.730
you'll find a link to it in the last lecture of this module where I give a little bit of a more detailed

02:38.730 --> 02:40.670
walkthrough of angular material,

02:40.800 --> 02:44.750
I also got another course here on udemy where I dive deeper into it, in this course

02:44.820 --> 02:47.130
this will not be an angular material course,

02:47.130 --> 02:53.170
I just want to use it and that will therefore just explain the basics you need to know about using it.

02:53.190 --> 02:58.290
So now it's done setting it up and what it did is in the package.json file,

02:58.290 --> 03:03.740
it added a new dependency or two new dependencies to be precise, angular material,

03:03.750 --> 03:06.560
this package and the angular cdk.

03:06.600 --> 03:12.360
Now the material package actually is split up in two packages you could say, one for the logic behind

03:12.360 --> 03:16.700
the components and one for the concrete implementations and the styling,

03:16.740 --> 03:24.220
the cdk is the logic, material is then logic plus styling and more on that in that series I just mentioned.

03:24.510 --> 03:30.480
This is included, this is installed as a dependency. In the angular.json file which configures our

03:30.480 --> 03:33.780
project, it also did one thing, it added

03:33.790 --> 03:44.160
this input here, this style here which simply includes a default theme of the material design package, indigo pink

03:44.160 --> 03:49.800
so that's just some color, sets a styling for all these components and you can actually switch that with

03:49.800 --> 03:51.100
another pre-built theme,

03:51.120 --> 03:54.830
you can see all of them in node modules at angular

03:55.110 --> 04:03.300
and then there search for material here and then in material, you should find a folder pre-built themes,

04:04.200 --> 04:05.510
this one

04:05.510 --> 04:09.400
and there you see for files indigo pink, deep purple amber and so on.

04:09.450 --> 04:15.900
Now we're using indigo pink here and you can always switch this, so you can also use purple, green, deep

04:15.900 --> 04:16.800
purple, amber,

04:16.800 --> 04:20.370
I'll stick to this one but you can switch this with one of the other files.

04:20.370 --> 04:22.780
So this is the styling that is added,

04:22.920 --> 04:27.690
now what else did the ng add command do for us?

04:27.690 --> 04:34.770
It added that our app module, there it now imports the browser animations module, a part of the angular

04:34.770 --> 04:41.340
framework because some of these components provided by angular material use animations and therefore

04:41.340 --> 04:43.080
this is included too.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.750
And that's basically it,

04:44.760 --> 04:47.070
you can also see a lot of what it did here,

04:47.080 --> 04:53.860
so it updated package.json, angular.json, app module, style.css, now also the index.html file,

04:54.030 --> 05:00.720
there we can see what it did is it included imports to the material icons so that you can use these icons

05:01.020 --> 05:07.560
and the roboto font so that our text actually has the normal material design too.

05:07.580 --> 05:09.170
So that is what now happened,

05:09.170 --> 05:10.720
now we can restart ng server,

05:10.730 --> 05:14.440
we can start using angular material. And to use it,

05:14.480 --> 05:21.290
we actually just need to import what we need and use the component in our template.

05:21.290 --> 05:25.200
So first of all, let's start by pimping that post create component

05:25.340 --> 05:28.460
and for that, let's look at form controls in the official docs,

05:28.460 --> 05:29.740
that sounds promising

05:29.900 --> 05:32.600
and what we need is some some input, right,

05:32.600 --> 05:33.640
we need some inputs,

05:33.710 --> 05:36.440
we want to be able to add a text area,

05:36.440 --> 05:45.210
so we get our input and text area elements which we can use and here, if we check out that example

05:45.220 --> 05:50.290
code, we can also see how such an input is created with the material package.

05:50.300 --> 05:57.850
Essentially we add this matInput thing to an input element, we can ignore that form thing for now.

05:57.890 --> 06:05.360
So let's go back to our project and to use such an input element, we need to unlock it because by default

06:05.570 --> 06:10.040
none of the components provided by angular material is available in our application

06:10.190 --> 06:16.880
and this is done to save space, that our final application is as small as possible and we don't import

06:16.880 --> 06:20.780
things which we don't use. Now I want to use something of course,

06:20.780 --> 06:27.560
so let's actually move that import here up to the top to keep all the angular imports in one place and

06:27.560 --> 06:38.790
then let's import something from @angular/material and that something I want to import here is just

06:39.240 --> 06:42.140
a module,

06:42.350 --> 06:44.790
it's the matInputModule

06:45.760 --> 06:49.790
and we can take that module and add it to the imports array

06:49.890 --> 06:54.370
and what this does is it unlocks all the input related components.

06:54.400 --> 07:01.060
So now we can go back to the post create component html file and there, the text area we simply add matInput

07:01.150 --> 07:02.670
to it,

07:02.730 --> 07:06.810
this is the selector which turns this into an angular material input.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.050
Well let's save this

07:08.260 --> 07:11.160
and I don't see a big difference, do you?

07:11.170 --> 07:17.350
Now the reason why we don't see the difference is that actually all these input components only work in conjunction

07:17.350 --> 07:20.670
with another component we have to add as a wrapper

07:20.830 --> 07:23.770
and that's the mat form field component.

07:24.630 --> 07:29.310
Now that's just another component provided by angular material and we put our inputs in there.

07:29.370 --> 07:34.490
Now I said we don't have to worry about that form thing and we don't, we won't use a form yet but

07:34.810 --> 07:38.900
this is something we need to add to get a styling that looks better,

07:39.030 --> 07:45.080
so now we can see angular material seems to do something, we don't have that ugly input from before.

07:45.330 --> 07:51.970
Now it's also not super pretty yet but we'll get there. To turn this into a prettier component,

07:52.050 --> 07:59.960
what I'll do is all use another component from the angular material framework and that's the mat-card.

08:00.090 --> 08:08.370
So let's add another import in the app module, mat-card module, cart is a special container, a

08:08.440 --> 08:15.120
look you will probably know from other pages. Let's add the mat card module to the imports array

08:15.390 --> 08:21.620
and then in the post create component, I'll wrap my mat form field here with mat-card.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.390
Now this creates such a card

08:24.390 --> 08:30.420
look, if I put it in there and we save that, you will see now it's indented a bit more and you see there's

08:30.420 --> 08:31.850
a slight shadow below that.

08:31.860 --> 08:35.930
Now we can't see it that well because it's a bit hard to see, it's taking up all the width,

08:35.980 --> 08:39.440
so let's restrict that width by also adding some custom styles to that,

08:39.480 --> 08:47.370
we can still do that. I'll add a new file, post create component.css for the styling for this component

08:47.700 --> 08:53.130
and we need to import this by going to the typescript file of the component and adding style urls

08:53.130 --> 08:53.890
here,

08:53.940 --> 08:56.390
now that's an array of external stylesheets,

08:56.430 --> 09:03.150
we can only have one template but we can have multiple styles and there I'll point at post create component.css

09:03.190 --> 09:03.960
.

09:04.170 --> 09:10.690
Now we can write our own css code there and I will target my mat-card elements,

09:10.710 --> 09:18.690
that's cool we can use the angular selectors here as style targets, so I'll target mat-card here and

09:18.690 --> 09:24.810
actually restrict the width to let's say 80% and add margin

09:24.810 --> 09:28.530
auto to center this. Now if we save that,

09:28.530 --> 09:34.890
now we can see the card here a bit better and we got our form field in there and if we type, you see

09:35.100 --> 09:36.400
this is our form field,

09:36.420 --> 09:38.840
now this is taking shape. Now

09:38.850 --> 09:41.430
I'm still not perfectly happy with that,

09:41.430 --> 09:47.330
I also want a change to look of my text area a bit more, so I'll also target my text area in that component

09:47.490 --> 09:52.090
and the cool thing is these styles will be scoped to this component,

09:52.230 --> 09:58.260
so even if we use a text area or a mat-card in another component, these styles will not apply to

09:58.260 --> 09:58.620
it,

09:58.650 --> 10:02.340
it will just apply the styles to the elements in this component.

10:02.340 --> 10:07.310
So I'll take my text area and set the width of it to 100% here actually,

10:07.320 --> 10:09.350
however for this to have an effect

10:09.360 --> 10:16.120
I also need to take the wrapping element, mat form field and give that a width of 100%

10:16.150 --> 10:21.910
and now if we save that, you see the input is spanning the entire width here

10:23.180 --> 10:25.800
and now I want to put my button into the card too.

10:25.850 --> 10:29.380
So I'll take that button, put it below that mat form field,

10:29.620 --> 10:35.060
remove the hr tag here and of course it would be nice if the button would look prettier too.

10:35.230 --> 10:40.240
So we can turn it into a material design button by including one more thing from the angular material

10:40.240 --> 10:46.370
package, the mat button module here and then I will add this down there,

10:46.390 --> 10:49.920
mat button module.

10:49.920 --> 10:56.120
So now we're including the mat button module and now we can go back to our html code and turn

10:56.120 --> 11:02.860
this into a nice looking button by adding mat button or mat raised button to get this raised button

11:02.860 --> 11:06.550
look and you can find out which values you can use

11:06.550 --> 11:10.540
of course in the angular material docs, in case you want to dive deeper,

11:10.540 --> 11:16.180
you can always dive into the docks, read through them, check the API documentation for a full list of the features

11:16.180 --> 11:18.870
you can configure, things like that.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.240
So now this is the button, now it would be nicer if it had some color

11:22.240 --> 11:28.030
and thankfully if you check out the docs, you find out that you can add a color property, I'm just splitting

11:28.030 --> 11:30.420
this over multiple lines to make it easier to read.

11:30.430 --> 11:37.880
So here I will add color and you can set this to primary or accent or warn,

11:37.890 --> 11:42.420
now warn is some warning color, red, don't want to do that,

11:42.460 --> 11:48.400
I want to use my primary color, whoops, primary and now this will use the indigo color in this case because I'm

11:48.400 --> 11:50.350
using the indigo pink theme.

11:50.440 --> 11:54.270
You can of course also use accent and maybe I actually prefer this,

11:54.280 --> 11:55.800
I think it's even clearer to see.

11:55.990 --> 11:58.490
So now we get the button, we get the input here,

11:58.510 --> 12:00.610
now this is looking prettier.

12:00.790 --> 12:08.710
Now it's time to add a toolbar and then also add a real post management because right now we're not

12:08.710 --> 12:10.140
really adding new posts,

12:10.150 --> 12:13.100
we're just overwriting some text which we output.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.190
Time to change that.
