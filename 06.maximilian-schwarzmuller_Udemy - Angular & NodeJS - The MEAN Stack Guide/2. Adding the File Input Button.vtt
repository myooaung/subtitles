So image upload, how do we implement it?

00:05.190 --> 00:13.440
Well let's start with creating a new post and there, I want to add a new button, let's say below the title

00:13.440 --> 00:14.520
but it's really up to you

00:14.550 --> 00:16.140
where you position this of course

00:16.320 --> 00:20.550
and when we click this button, a file picker should open.

00:20.670 --> 00:25.680
And in that file picker, we should then be able to pick an image file,

00:25.680 --> 00:28.990
we probably also want to see a preview of the image here then

00:29.280 --> 00:37.350
and I of course also want to be able to then hit save post and upload that image, store that image

00:37.470 --> 00:46.350
somewhere on our server and store a path to the image, so that we know where it's stored in the database

00:46.440 --> 00:50.010
because we will not store the image itself in the database,

00:50.010 --> 00:51.840
it would really be too big for that,

00:51.840 --> 00:53.480
that would be too inefficient,

00:53.670 --> 00:59.380
instead we'll just store the path to the image as it is stored on our server in the database.

00:59.430 --> 01:01.440
So that is what we want to do,

01:01.740 --> 01:10.510
let's start simple and let's add this file picker then. For that, I will go to my post create component

01:10.630 --> 01:11.300
here

01:11.620 --> 01:17.680
and I want to add a new button and I'll add it below the title, let's say, the position is of course really

01:17.680 --> 01:18.480
up to you

01:19.310 --> 01:24.450
and you could add a mat-form-field here but I don't really need one.

01:24.530 --> 01:29.900
Instead I'll just add a div so that we have a block level element and there, I'll add a button which I'll

01:29.900 --> 01:33.410
give the mat-button directive,

01:33.500 --> 01:36.710
so that we turn this into a Angular material button

01:36.950 --> 01:39.170
and I'll say pick image.

01:39.360 --> 01:46.190
If we now save this and ngServe is already up and running, we can go back and we see that pick image

01:46.250 --> 01:47.630
button here which we can click.

01:47.900 --> 01:53.630
Now right now, you can see I get the validation errors when I click this button because by default, it tries

01:53.630 --> 02:00.890
to submit the form. To change this, I'll set the type of this button to button, the alternative and the

02:00.890 --> 02:05.230
default would be submit and it would then try to submit the form with button,

02:05.240 --> 02:07.130
we should no longer get this behavior.

02:07.130 --> 02:09.980
Now we can click the button without submitting.

02:09.980 --> 02:12.050
Now that's a nice first step

02:12.050 --> 02:14.430
but of course we're not entirely there yet.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.330
First of all, I want to change

02:16.330 --> 02:23.500
that look slightly, I'll turn this into a mat-stroked button, so that it will have an outline like this

02:23.750 --> 02:30.020
but of course the real thing that is missing is the functionality to open that file picker dialog.

02:30.020 --> 02:35.610
Now we do actually have a default input which we can use of type file.

02:35.930 --> 02:41.660
When we add this, we get this file picker here which already has a button actually

02:41.660 --> 02:44.610
and where we then can select files and choose them.

02:44.630 --> 02:49.960
Now that picker looks a bit ugly and it doesn't have the default material styling,

02:50.030 --> 02:54.540
so I want to hide this picker, not remove it from the DOM it should be there,

02:54.650 --> 03:00.410
it should just be hidden and instead whenever we click that button, I want to simulate a click event

03:00.440 --> 03:01.580
on that picker

03:01.580 --> 03:04.580
so that we use that default picker functionality

03:04.700 --> 03:07.170
and we store the picked file in that input

03:07.340 --> 03:11.330
but we don't actually see that ugly interface, that's the idea.

03:11.330 --> 03:12.960
Now to make that happen,

03:13.130 --> 03:15.950
what I'll do is I'll first of all hide that input.

03:15.950 --> 03:21.530
We can do that in the CSS file of this component, there I will select the input with the attribute

03:21.530 --> 03:22.060
selector,

03:22.070 --> 03:28.570
so where type equals file and I will then set the visibility to hidden.

03:28.940 --> 03:34.280
If we do that, then the file picker is gone but it's still part of the DOM

03:34.400 --> 03:38.190
as you can see if you inspect the elements, here it is,

03:38.210 --> 03:39.780
so that still works

03:40.130 --> 03:46.640
and now we can proxy our click on the button onto this input. To do that,

03:46.670 --> 03:50.750
I'll give this input a local reference with a hashtag, file picker,

03:50.840 --> 03:52.390
you can name this however you want

03:52.760 --> 03:55.190
and then here on the button, I'll add a click listener

03:55.850 --> 03:59.560
and on this click listener, I'll simply execute file picker click.

04:03.070 --> 04:07.760
So I'll execute this click method on the file picker.

04:07.900 --> 04:14.210
And now with that if we save that, I can click pick image and open the default file picker.

04:14.250 --> 04:18.980
So now we successfully proxy that and we can pick a file and it will be stored.

04:19.020 --> 04:23.710
The next step is to register this input as an input of our form

04:23.850 --> 04:29.670
and for this, I'll actually switch to the reactive approach for creating and handling that form

04:29.790 --> 04:36.750
since that gives me more capabilities, more features and I also want to add my own validator to validate

04:36.750 --> 04:43.650
that we only upload image files for example and that is an advanced functionality which is way easier

04:43.650 --> 04:47.300
to implement if we use the reactive forms approach.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.530
So let's switch to this in the next lecture.
