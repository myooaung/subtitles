00:02.120 --> 00:05.040
So here here's our frontend, our angular app

00:05.090 --> 00:10.680
as we left it, it's far from being finished and we will revisit it later in the course

00:10.790 --> 00:15.290
but for now let's do some polishing. One polishing or one addition I want to do is

00:15.360 --> 00:17.500
it would be nice to have some labels here right

00:17.630 --> 00:20.230
and actually you can add labels easily

00:20.330 --> 00:29.460
to your forms in angular material by going to the html code and adding a placeholder attribute and

00:29.480 --> 00:37.040
there, we could say title or maybe post title and we can also add that to the text area and say post

00:37.040 --> 00:43.160
content there and you will see that if you add such a placeholder, you get it as a label here and you

00:43.160 --> 00:47.780
automatically get this floating label look here which is quite neat.

00:47.780 --> 00:53.600
Now one other thing I want to do is if I enter a new post here, right now you can see the values stick

00:53.600 --> 00:54.130
around,

00:54.200 --> 00:56.310
this form doesn't get cleared

00:56.740 --> 01:04.970
and we can clear it in on add post where we get access to that form by accessing form and then calling

01:05.360 --> 01:08.500
reset form, like this.

01:08.810 --> 01:16.160
If we now save that, let's try this again. Let's enter something here and let's click save post and you see

01:16.280 --> 01:17.900
this now resets the form

01:17.930 --> 01:23.510
and also the validity, not just the values so it doesn't just clear the form, it also resets the validity

01:23.930 --> 01:26.780
which of course is exactly the behavior we want.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.480
Now that's almost all,

01:28.520 --> 01:35.390
one other thing I want to add for now already is I want to add an action bar to the posts, whilst the

01:35.540 --> 01:37.690
functionality is missing right now,

01:37.790 --> 01:39.550
we will add it later,

01:39.620 --> 01:43.050
I want to be able to edit and delete such posts. Again

01:43.070 --> 01:46.700
the logic behind that and the code will be added later.

01:46.760 --> 01:53.430
That means I want to have an edit and a delete button here on this expand panel or on this expansion panel.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.070
If we check the official docs,

01:55.070 --> 02:00.440
we can see that there is an action bar or an action row component

02:00.500 --> 02:07.370
we can nest into our expansion panel and that looks pretty promising. With that code copied if we go back

02:07.370 --> 02:09.570
to the post-list.component here,

02:09.710 --> 02:15.560
we can add that below the paragraph in the expansion panel and we get a button here in the code snippet

02:15.590 --> 02:21.620
too and I will simply say add it, I will actually add two buttons because I also want to have a delete

02:21.620 --> 02:22.890
button here.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.490
You can also make this all caps to be closer to the original material style

02:27.500 --> 02:31.740
by the way where buttons tend to be all capitalized.

02:31.880 --> 02:36.030
Now the buttons if we add them like this can be seen,

02:36.050 --> 02:37.880
let's quickly add a post here,

02:38.330 --> 02:44.240
here are the buttons but they are not looking that spectacular. To make them look a bit more spectacular,

02:44.360 --> 02:52.070
what I will do is I will add some colors, for the edit button I'll assign my primary color or maybe

02:52.070 --> 02:56.220
the accent color, whichever one you prefer and the delete button,

02:56.300 --> 03:01.490
here I will use my warn color because people should certainly be careful when clicking these buttons

03:01.850 --> 03:03.740
or this button specifically.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.150
So now with that added, if we add one more post,

03:07.250 --> 03:08.760
we see edit and delete. Now

03:08.900 --> 03:13.920
since my accent color is this pink color, it looks very much like the delete button,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.500
so I will go for primary here to have a greater difference between the colors,

03:19.550 --> 03:21.470
so let's add one more post here,

03:23.020 --> 03:27.100
yep that looks better and that is the last thing I wanted to prepare.

03:27.100 --> 03:33.780
Now again, we will improve this code a lot, later we will add an edit and delete functionality,

03:33.790 --> 03:41.060
we will also add more components, more pages on our frontend but for now, it's enough about angular,

03:41.140 --> 03:43.060
let's move on to the backend,

03:43.090 --> 03:48.670
let's move on to node and understand how that works and fits into our angular application.
