00:02.610 --> 00:09.270
Congratulations, you completed this course and you hopefully learned a lot about Angular, Node/Express

00:09.300 --> 00:14.760
and MongoDB and most importantly how to connect all these topics.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.790
I hope that you like the course, that you learned a lot,

00:17.820 --> 00:22.660
I hope that you also now feel confident continuing this road,

00:22.940 --> 00:25.780
here are some next steps you could take.

00:25.890 --> 00:31.810
Obviously you can dive deeper into Angular, Node and Express and MongoDB and how to use all of that,

00:31.830 --> 00:35.480
this course is no in-depth course on any of these topics,

00:35.520 --> 00:41.010
it is really about connecting all these things and I did my best to also provide a good introduction

00:41.010 --> 00:42.060
to these topics.

00:42.060 --> 00:47.790
If you want to become a true master, take dedicated courses focusing on one topic at a time,

00:47.790 --> 00:51.060
for example my Angular, The Complete Guide Course, there

00:51.060 --> 00:56.430
I dive into way more features in greater detail. But these are next steps you can now take

00:56.490 --> 01:02.240
now that you have the big picture and that you know how all these things work in general. And another

01:02.270 --> 01:05.140
thing you should do is practice,

01:05.140 --> 01:07.230
build other dummy projects,

01:07.290 --> 01:08.750
choose your own projects,

01:08.820 --> 01:10.620
clone popular webpages,

01:10.620 --> 01:16.710
build your own basic Amazon clone with the technologies taught in this course. You'll hit a lot of

01:16.710 --> 01:17.460
problems

01:17.520 --> 01:24.630
but if you overcome them, you will learn a lot and therefore practicing, building dummy or demo projects,

01:24.900 --> 01:27.700
that is really something which will help you a lot too.

01:27.780 --> 01:36.840
And finally, help other students. Join discussions, find peers to discuss ideas or thoughts or questions

01:37.260 --> 01:39.500
and interact with other people,

01:39.510 --> 01:41.080
go to meet-ups

01:41.100 --> 01:47.380
This is a great way of diving deeper too and exploring other views on certain topics

01:47.690 --> 01:50.450
and of course a great way of solving problems

01:50.520 --> 01:58.140
and if you do these things, then you're well prepared to dive into a full career in this tech stack and

01:58.140 --> 02:02.860
become a better and better and better Angular and Node developer.
