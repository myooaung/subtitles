Let's start with redirecting the users. They should be redirected

00:06.190 --> 00:09.260
if they do login or if they do logout.

00:09.520 --> 00:15.890
Now the question of course is where do we redirect to and where do we execute that redirection logic?

00:16.150 --> 00:23.020
Now for redirecting, the auth service is a great place because there we do both, logging in and logging

00:23.020 --> 00:23.980
out.

00:24.160 --> 00:29.620
So to redirect the user, I will have to inject the @angular/router here,

00:29.620 --> 00:37.840
so add a new argument to the constructor which is of type router and router is an object or a class

00:38.080 --> 00:43.390
imported from @angular/router. With that import added

00:43.450 --> 00:50.800
and with that injection added here in the constructor, we can use it in login, here in the subscribe

00:50.800 --> 00:55.660
method when we know that we have a valid token. There at the very end,

00:55.840 --> 00:59.450
I want to reach out to my router and call the navigate method

00:59.800 --> 01:02.180
and I want to navigate back to the home page.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.680
You can of course navigate anywhere but I guess this makes sense away from the login page.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.810
I also want to navigate there

01:11.000 --> 01:17.630
if we do logout. There once we cleared everything, I want to leave the page on which I am and go back

01:17.630 --> 01:19.200
to the home page.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.150
So that's a very simple logic but it should work.

01:22.310 --> 01:32.140
If we now save this and I do go to login page after this reloaded, I can enter my credentials here and

01:32.170 --> 01:33.550
I am redirected

01:34.150 --> 01:39.530
and if I go to the new post page and I click logout, I'm also redirected back to the starting page,

01:39.550 --> 01:40.790
so that's great.

01:41.020 --> 01:47.800
By the way, one other thing you might notice is that we have to wait a very short time span if I click login,

01:48.180 --> 01:54.670
the time it takes for us to send that request and validate the user on the server. It would be nice to show

01:54.670 --> 01:55.760
a spinner there,

01:55.840 --> 02:02.560
that's just a minor thing but I want to add such spinners to the login and the sign-up components, maybe

02:02.560 --> 02:08.290
instead of the button. We of course already have the spinner component included in the app, so we can

02:08.290 --> 02:11.290
simply add mat-spinner here

02:12.190 --> 02:19.330
below the button in the sign-up component and also in the login component and I want to show

02:19.330 --> 02:20.910
it instead of the button.

02:21.220 --> 02:25.360
For that, we need to know if we are loading or not.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.500
Now we got an isLoading property in both components already,

02:29.500 --> 02:38.540
we just need to set it when we are loading. So in onSignup, I will set isLoading to true and the same in

02:39.100 --> 02:43.930
onLogin. In both places, I set isLoading to true

02:44.140 --> 02:46.320
and in the templates, I can then use it.

02:46.360 --> 02:52.050
I want to hide that button if we are loading and on the same hand,

02:52.060 --> 02:53.450
I want to show the spinner then,

02:53.500 --> 02:57.860
so if we're loading, hide the button and therefore of course the checks should be opposite,

02:57.880 --> 03:00.820
if we are not loading, it should be shown and therefore it's hidden

03:00.820 --> 03:07.270
if we are loading and the spinner should only be shown if we are loading. And in the sign-up component,

03:07.840 --> 03:13.660
in the template there, it's the same logic. Spinner will be shown if we are loading, sign-up button that will

03:13.660 --> 03:20.080
be shown if we are not loading, implemented by adding the exclamation mark. With that,

03:20.080 --> 03:29.260
now we can go to the login page and there if I do you enter my credentials, we see that spinner

03:29.410 --> 03:31.240
for a short time span

03:31.240 --> 03:37.690
at least. Now I just recognized I already did have a spinner of course here, so we can remove that bottommost

03:37.690 --> 03:38.630
spinner,

03:38.630 --> 03:43.970
the thing I was missing is changing that isLoading value but I already had the spinners in place.

03:44.020 --> 03:47.750
So let's update the templates to remove the bottommost spinner

03:47.980 --> 03:53.780
and with that if I go back, we again should be already having a spinner, yes, looking good.

03:53.890 --> 03:56.730
So we get that spinner already and we are redirecting,

03:56.740 --> 03:57.720
that's great.

03:57.730 --> 04:04.480
Next step is to guard routes because now I'm logged out and I can still access the new posts page by

04:04.570 --> 04:12.730
typing in /create or for example, I can edit a post by typing in edit and then some post ID and

04:12.730 --> 04:14.960
it will also still load the post page.

04:14.970 --> 04:20.830
Well turns out that this was a post which doesn't exist anymore but it would work for a valid ID.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.590
So that is something I will edit in the next video.
