Well, we're done with the course.

00:04.340 --> 00:10.670
We built an amazing app and you hopefully learned a lot, about many awesome Angular features, Node and

00:10.670 --> 00:16.790
Express and Mongoose and Mongo features and how to connect them all to build an entire app where you

00:16.790 --> 00:24.380
have both a beautiful client-side Angular driven application and a powerful back-end powered by Node

00:24.470 --> 00:26.630
Express and MongoDB.

00:26.630 --> 00:33.350
Now it's time to deploy our application which means move it from our local development environment to

00:33.410 --> 00:36.900
a real server in the Internet where we can access it.

00:36.910 --> 00:38.820
