00:02.210 --> 00:05.180
So that was a lot of talking about mongodb and so on,

00:05.180 --> 00:13.490
time to finally set up our mongo database and then of course connect it to our angular node express

00:13.610 --> 00:14.860
application.

00:15.020 --> 00:16.270
How do we do that?

00:16.520 --> 00:22.710
Well we need a mongo database for that and a good place to start is mongodb.com.

00:22.730 --> 00:27.790
Now you've got two options when it comes to setting up the database,

00:27.830 --> 00:33.500
you can download mongodb onto your machine and set it up there, on mongodb you can click

00:33.500 --> 00:36.010
that download button which you should find there,

00:37.670 --> 00:43.490
that should take you to the download center and there, you can choose the community server where you

00:43.490 --> 00:49.310
can choose your operating system, the latest stable release, download that file and then on the following

00:49.310 --> 00:51.340
page, you actually don't need to sign up.

00:51.350 --> 00:57.830
You can skip this or the download will start automatically to be precise and thereafter, you can dive

00:57.830 --> 01:03.240
into the documentation like the quickstart guide where you will be instructed on how to install this.

01:03.260 --> 01:07.440
Now for this course, I'll use a different solution, a cloud solution.

01:07.880 --> 01:13.250
There is a free sandbox available, doesn't cost you anything and totally is enough for the purposes of

01:13.250 --> 01:18.140
this course and for real apps of course you will probably need a paid solution but that's also true if you

01:18.140 --> 01:19.540
host the server on your own

01:19.940 --> 01:26.180
and that free sandbox will be a cloud hosted mongo database which you can conveniently use and which

01:26.180 --> 01:31.760
you can then use from your node express app you're building on your machine and you'll be deploying

01:31.820 --> 01:34.040
on a real server later.

01:34.040 --> 01:39.940
So after you click on free sandbox, you can click on get started for free to be scrolled down,

01:40.130 --> 01:45.170
then you can create an account here where you won't need a credit card as you can see

01:45.500 --> 01:52.430
and once you did all that, you can sign in, a step to which I will fast forward because I already have

01:52.430 --> 01:53.700
an account.

01:53.750 --> 02:00.880
Now once you are signed in, you should be in a new project or at least have the option to click build

02:00.890 --> 02:02.260
a new cluster,

02:02.510 --> 02:06.600
if you have to create a new project, first simply give it any name of your choice,

02:06.610 --> 02:08.260
the other setting should be OK.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.440
So then you can build and you cluster and there choose AWS,

02:12.440 --> 02:17.450
so basically always where you see that free tier available thing, use North Virginia,

02:17.450 --> 02:25.430
so in this case here go down and then for cluster tier, you want to go with the cheapest shared cluster

02:25.430 --> 02:35.240
where it also says free next to it. So with that, you can continue, choose the default settings down there,

02:35.240 --> 02:37.310
basically you will always have the cheapest settings

02:37.310 --> 02:43.370
obviously since it should be for free, you can leave the cluster name as it is and then click create

02:43.370 --> 02:44.230
cluster.

02:44.390 --> 02:47.090
It will check that you're not a robot

02:47.090 --> 02:53.120
and once you're done, this will configure a so-called mongodb cluster for you which is a server that

02:53.120 --> 02:56.260
hosts some mongo database, some mongodb database

02:56.510 --> 03:02.570
and it's a cluster because it's actually a combination of multiple servers or it can be such a combination

03:02.570 --> 03:07.470
to be precise so that your database is horizontally scaled if it needs to be,

03:07.510 --> 03:11.870
however not for our cheap free tier option here.

03:11.870 --> 03:15.400
Now as it correctly prompts us, we can already have a look at the security settings

03:15.410 --> 03:20.760
now with that cluster getting initialized and we want to add a mongodb user here.

03:20.990 --> 03:28.730
So under security mongodb users, click add a new user and there you basically want to create an atlas

03:28.880 --> 03:34.400
admin or anyone who has read and write access to any database,

03:34.390 --> 03:42.570
so we want to give the user a relatively big access rights. You can then enter a username here, like

03:42.590 --> 03:50.310
Max and then auto-generate a secure password which you should copy and store safely

03:50.610 --> 03:55.160
and I will store it in my code for now, just copy it in here,

03:55.170 --> 03:58.320
of course that's not the place where we will store it in the end,

03:58.470 --> 04:06.300
click add user and with that user added, that will be the user which is able to access our database.

04:06.300 --> 04:13.140
Now we also want to add an IP whitelist and add an IP address here and there, you can simply choose

04:13.320 --> 04:14.730
your current IP address,

04:14.730 --> 04:21.060
just keep in mind throughout this course if you work on that project over a couple of days, your IP address

04:21.060 --> 04:22.200
might change,

04:22.200 --> 04:27.900
so you probably want to update it here in case you're suddenly seeing that you can't access your database

04:27.900 --> 04:28.520
anymore.

04:28.740 --> 04:31.450
You could of course also allow access from anywhere

04:31.620 --> 04:34.380
but I want to use my local address. Now important,

04:34.410 --> 04:40.620
once you deploy your application, this should of course be the IP address of the server you deployed

04:40.620 --> 04:45.580
your app to because in the end, it will be your nodejs server which is accessing the database,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.080
it just happens to run on our machine.

04:48.180 --> 04:51.560
So let's click confirm here for the security whitelist

04:51.810 --> 04:53.660
and now with that, we got that all set up.

04:53.670 --> 05:00.000
Now this will take a while and here our cluster will take a while and whilst this is taking a while, we

05:00.000 --> 05:08.610
can go back to our project and already install a package that helps us connect to that backend database.

05:09.030 --> 05:11.550
Now we'll have a look at this in the next lecture.
