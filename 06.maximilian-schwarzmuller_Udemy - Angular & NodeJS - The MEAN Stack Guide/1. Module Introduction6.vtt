Welcome to this module.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.620
In the last module, we added image upload,

00:06.810 --> 00:13.440
now it's time to work more with our general post data again. Whilst we work with the files in the last

00:13.440 --> 00:14.040
module,

00:14.040 --> 00:20.790
now I want to handle pagination which means I want to control that we don't always display all posts

00:21.240 --> 00:27.870
but that we can switch between different pages, so between different sets of posts and we only display

00:27.870 --> 00:29.650
two posts on the first page,

00:29.760 --> 00:31.570
two posts on the second page,

00:31.650 --> 00:37.320
two posts on the first page and we can switch between these pages to load the appropriate posts for

00:37.320 --> 00:38.050
each page.

00:38.250 --> 00:44.340
That's a common pattern because we don't want to download all posts by default because if we have more

00:44.340 --> 00:50.520
posts in our database, then we would download a lot of data which would not only mean that we transfer

00:50.550 --> 00:52.580
more data over the wire,

00:52.590 --> 00:58.060
it would also mean that we display a lot of data which might be hard to navigate through

00:58.080 --> 00:59.140
for the user.

00:59.190 --> 01:01.800
So let's add pagination in this module.
