00:02.380 --> 00:06.840
So back in the app, I deleted the old post, let's create a new one.

00:06.850 --> 00:10.300
There is a bug in our app right now which I overlooked previously.

00:10.510 --> 00:15.600
If I create a new post here, then we see we can edit it

00:15.670 --> 00:21.050
and if I do change something, I can indeed successfully edit it as it should be the case

00:21.220 --> 00:28.870
but if I try to save it without making any changes, I get not authorized and this is probably thrown

00:28.870 --> 00:35.410
by the back-end due to some other reason and not really due to us not being authorized. If we have a look

00:35.410 --> 00:42.910
at our back-end now here in the posts controller for the update post method, we somehow seem to get

00:42.940 --> 00:46.010
into this part here.

00:46.060 --> 00:52.540
Now this probably is the case because if we submit a post where we don't edit anything, it's not updating

00:52.540 --> 00:57.280
the posts and therefore nModified indeed is not greater than zero.

00:57.340 --> 01:02.480
So let's console log the post here if I want to look into that

01:02.740 --> 01:09.590
and let's also console log the result to see if that assumption of the source of that error is correct.

01:09.610 --> 01:17.890
Let's save that and let's go back to our app and reload it and let's try submitting this again.

01:17.930 --> 01:23.720
Of course we get not authorized and if we have a look at our server side log now, we see this is the post

01:23.720 --> 01:26.360
which was created and that is looking good,

01:26.360 --> 01:27.800
that's the most important thing,

01:27.980 --> 01:35.210
it's not missing any information but indeed, nModified is zero here because Mongoose is clever enough

01:35.450 --> 01:38.090
to not override the post in the database

01:38.090 --> 01:44.000
if we didn't change anything. Our error message of course is a bit misleading because we're always assuming

01:44.000 --> 01:47.340
that we can only get there if we're not authorized.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.150
Now what would be correct is to check whether we did find something,

01:52.150 --> 01:52.480
so if

01:52.570 --> 01:58.250
n was one and not just if we did not modify anything.

01:58.250 --> 02:04.670
So the simple fix is to change nModified to n because this will just check, did we find any post where

02:04.670 --> 02:10.550
we tried to do something and that now can only fail if we're not authorized, it will not reach this code

02:10.610 --> 02:16.450
if we were authorized but didn't update anything because we didn't change anything.

02:16.460 --> 02:24.660
So with this change in place if we now go back and reload, I can now save the post and it works as before.

02:24.680 --> 02:29.680
So this is this tiny bug fixed, was overlooked before, should be working correctly now.
