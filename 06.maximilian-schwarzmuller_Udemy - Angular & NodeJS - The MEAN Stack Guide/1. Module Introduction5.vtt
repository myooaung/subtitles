Welcome to another module. In this module we'll dive into something super exciting, uploading images. Because

00:09.400 --> 00:16.250
thus far in our project, we're of course able to create new posts but with text only, 

00:16.270 --> 00:16.620
right,

00:16.630 --> 00:19.990
we fetch a title, we fetch some content.

00:20.050 --> 00:25.610
Now that's nice but if we're really honest, it's not super exciting.

00:25.720 --> 00:31.810
So in this module, we're going to change this, every post we create will from now on also have an

00:31.870 --> 00:37.780
image and of course not an image we as a developer decide but an image which the user should be able

00:37.780 --> 00:38.770
to upload.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.950
So let's implement this step by step in this module.
