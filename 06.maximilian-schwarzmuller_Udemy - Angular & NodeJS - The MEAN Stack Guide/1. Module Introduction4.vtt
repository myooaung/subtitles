00:02.410 --> 00:07.870
So by now we actually already have a basic mean app up and running,

00:07.870 --> 00:15.750
we got our angular frontend and we got our node express backend which also talks to our mongo database,

00:15.880 --> 00:19.840
so we get all the core pieces up and running and we got them connected.

00:19.890 --> 00:25.900
Now we could end here but that would not be the most exciting course right because we only scratched

00:25.990 --> 00:27.160
the surface.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.110
There are many more features I

00:29.240 --> 00:36.590
definitely want to show you and I want to practice with you because they are important in modern applications,

00:36.760 --> 00:41.020
that includes things like authentication and better error handling, things

00:41.030 --> 00:42.470
I'll come back to later

00:42.550 --> 00:46.030
but it also includes a little bit more work on our frontend,

00:46.030 --> 00:52.510
for example we can't edit our posts yet. We also manage all on one single page

00:52.510 --> 00:57.370
and yes we have a single page application but that actually means something different,

00:57.460 --> 01:02.030
we should have different pages just all rendered with angular, 

01:02.050 --> 01:02.610
right.

01:02.710 --> 01:08.020
So these are things we'll work on in this module before we then dive even deeper and add more and more

01:08.020 --> 01:08.940
features to the app.
