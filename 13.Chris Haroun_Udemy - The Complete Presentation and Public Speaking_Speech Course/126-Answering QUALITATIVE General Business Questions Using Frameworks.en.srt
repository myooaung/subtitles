1
00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:03,155
Let's discuss answering qualitative

2
00:00:03,155 --> 00:00:06,488
general business questions using frameworks.

3
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:09,513
Now, if you're asked about a business topic

4
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,458
or an issue or most business questions

5
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,458
not involving quantitative concepts,

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,387
you can use several different qualitative frameworks,

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,419
right, and tell your audience

8
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:23,246
that you're using these frameworks, too,

9
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:24,259
okay, if you want.

10
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:25,956
And I'll give you plenty of examples.

11
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:27,703
For example, okay, so this is the first one.

12
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,484
If you want, and again I'm just giving you

13
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:33,631
a menu of ways to answer questions,

14
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,787
if you want, you can answer qualitative questions

15
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,608
using what is called the S.W.O.T. Analysis.

16
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:40,697
Right?

17
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:44,465
And the S.W.O.T. Analysis stands for

18
00:00:44,465 --> 00:00:47,196
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,

19
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:48,762
and threats.

20
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,689
Okay, and you can use that framework

21
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:51,971
when answering questions,

22
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:53,753
and it buys you time, right?

23
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,400
So say somebody asked you about a general

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,361
business problem or issue or question,

25
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,653
and it's not quantitative in nature,

26
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,938
you can use S.W.O.T.

27
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,511
You can say, well, in terms of the strengths,

28
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:07,543
I think that the most important thing

29
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:09,800
to consider is this.

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,946
Moving on to the weaknesses,

31
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,050
we have to also consider the risks,

32
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,525
which are blah blah blah.

33
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:18,670
Then in terms of the opportunities,

34
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,837
if we act now, I think our company

35
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:23,588
can gain market share because of.

36
00:01:23,588 --> 00:01:26,145
And then, lastly, on threats.

37
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:27,094
The biggest threat, though,

38
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:29,080
is most likely blah blah blah.

39
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,512
But you see how I kind of

40
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:34,823
gave myself a lot of time to think of answers.

41
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:35,656
Right?

42
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:37,051
And it shows that you're,

43
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,512
I don't know, you structure your answers

44
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,740
and crystallize your thoughts much better this way.

45
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,065
Anyway, okay.

46
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,136
So that's S.W.O.T.

47
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,158
S-W-O-T, okay?

48
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:48,638
Now, let's talk about answering questions

49
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:52,219
using what's called the Porter 5 Forces

50
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,020
Analysis Framework, right?

51
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,572
And I'm not gonna go into too much detail

52
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:58,095
on this, because you can go to Wikipedia

53
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,074
to research this.

54
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:01,011
This is not a business course.

55
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:04,649
But the five forces that impact a lot of companies

56
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,284
are competition, supplier power, right,

57
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:12,328
threat of entrance, and then the power of

58
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:15,174
the buyer or suppliers to source products.

59
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:16,057
Right, et cetera.

60
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:17,150
And there's one other one you can see

61
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,822
right here as well, okay, so you can

62
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,471
go through that if you want

63
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:23,581
in a lot more detail by going to wikipedia.com

64
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,670
and just searching for Porter 5 Forces.

65
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,588
Again, this is not a business course.

66
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:28,590
Okay.

67
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,481
Let's move on.

68
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:33,143
So if you have a marketing-related question,

69
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:37,044
you can answer it using what's called the BCG framework.

70
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:39,843
Okay, BCG stands for Boston Consulting Group,

71
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:42,026
which is one of the great consulting firms

72
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:42,991
that rejected me.

73
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,106
And I interviewed there, too.

74
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:46,314
Broke my heart, but that's okay.

75
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:49,613
So the Boston Consulting Group matrix

76
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,151
will basically categorize products

77
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:54,522
into four different quadrants

78
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:58,750
based on growth and all that stuff per this graphic here.

79
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,107
Again, I'm not gonna go into too much detail

80
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:00,940
on this, right?

81
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,768
But you can categorize products as

82
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:04,667
question marks

83
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,750
or stars, right, or cows,

84
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,429
I guess cash cows, or adorable dogs,

85
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:11,661
like that one there.

86
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,965
And my son, Matthew, when he saw the star there,

87
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:16,583
he said, "Dad, that's from Super Mario Galaxy."

88
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,957
And I was like, "Yeah, it is."

89
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:18,820
Pretty cool, eh?

90
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,411
Anyway, so that's a framework you can use

91
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,065
for marketing-related questions.

92
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,712
If you wanna do more research on that,

93
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:24,689
you can do so online.

94
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,279
But it's a very simplistic framework

95
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,172
that you can use if you have questions.

96
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:29,172
Let me know!

97
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,671
Let's now talk about answering questions.

98
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,898
Qualitative questions, using P.L.C.'s framework.

99
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,892
That's Product Life Cycle Framework.

100
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:38,819
Okay.

101
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,174
And so on the y-axis here,

102
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:43,122
you've got revenue, right,

103
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,661
and then on the x-axis here, you've got time, right?

104
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:46,568
And there's different phases

105
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,401
for a product.

106
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,684
There's introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.

107
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:52,500
Okay, so you can use that framework

108
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,667
if you wanted to, as well.
