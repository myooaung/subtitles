00:00:01.185 --> 00:00:04.115
Okay, we're still talking about PIMCO, right?

2
00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:05.294
P-I-M-C-O

3
00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:06.327
We talked about pictures,

4
00:00:06.327 --> 00:00:09.840
lets move on to the I which is inspiration, okay?

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.922
Marketing in presentations work best

6
00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:14.120
when they're artistic,

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.926
visual, of course, and inspiring.

8
00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:19.316
And there's so many amazing examples,

9
00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:22.517
not just in images, but also in video,

10
00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:26.517
and while using music to make something inspirational.

11
00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:28.993
And we talked a lot about images,

12
00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:31.997
and we discussed how, creating the content of our course,

13
00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.634
images to use to start a presentation

14
00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.925
can be really, really powerful.

15
00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:40.155
Right, but all people want to be inspired, right?

16
00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:40.988
Who doesn't?

17
00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:42.706
Everybody wants to be inspired.

18
00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:44.728
And we could do this through storytelling.

19
00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:46.486
We can do this through quotes

20
00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:49.133
which I encourage you to include on your slides

21
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.842
regardless of what type of presentation you're giving, okay?

22
00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:55.552
And we talked a lot about quotes earlier in the course.

23
00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:57.176
Include them if you want

24
00:00:57.176 --> 00:00:59.729
to make a speech more inspirational, okay?

25
00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.810
And I love this quote.

26
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.008
I know I've used it a lot, but it's so prophetic.

27
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:07.343
People might not remember what you said,

28
00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:10.696
but they'll never forget or they'll always remember

29
00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.613
how you made them feel.

30
00:01:13.836 --> 00:01:16.559
Okay now, we're gonna talk about how to insert

31
00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:20.726
(mumbles) photos and images a little bit later on.

32
00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:25.870
But I want you to just check out some of these images here,

33
00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:31.742
and examples of being inspirational in a presentation.

34
00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.046
And hopefully, these give you some ideas

35
00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.980
on what to include in your presentation.

36
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.981
And as always, if you have questions

37
00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:41.124
just please leave me a question here, within the course

38
00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:43.832
as I'm here to offer my humble support and help.

39
00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:44.665
Thanks.
