00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.800
Welcome to journal exercise number 14,

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.419
Creating Your Slides.

3
00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.907
If you want, please download it and use any

4
00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:10.798
of the presentation slides that we've already discussed

5
00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:12.666
in the course, you know, when you work

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.703
on completing this exercise, which again,

7
00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:17.719
is exercise number 14 in your success journal.

8
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:21.149
What I mean by this, is you can download any

9
00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:24.321
of the presentations in the resources section

10
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:26.751
of this course that we've already discussed

11
00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:28.642
in previous lectures.

12
00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:31.195
Then, if you want, you can customize

13
00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.637
and change the presentation

14
00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.538
that you downloaded for the course.

15
00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:37.799
And so my goal is always to help you work smarter

16
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.663
and not harder and give you a menu of options.

17
00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:43.552
If you don't want to download a presentation

18
00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:47.074
from this course, then use the templates provided

19
00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:49.651
in whatever presentation software

20
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:53.070
or internet presentation program that you want to use.

21
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.919
All of the major presentation products

22
00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:57.942
have templates that you can use.

23
00:00:57.942 --> 00:01:01.699
And for more examples on how we created presentations

24
00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.840
and images and other content using mini presentation

25
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.214
and image video and animation products,

26
00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:11.375
please watch the lectures, in act four,

27
00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.625
scenes one, two, and three.

28
00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:17.664
In addition, please watch some of the case studies

29
00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:20.521
from the current section, okay, our current scene,

30
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:23.109
I should say, which is act four scene four.

31
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.224
And do this if you want to use slides based

32
00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:28.084
on the presentations that I've already created

33
00:01:28.084 --> 00:01:29.843
and attached for you.

34
00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:31.468
Again, my job is to expose you

35
00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:34.855
to many different presentation options and it's really

36
00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:37.432
to help you to work smarter and not harder.

37
00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:39.737
Okay, so here's how we're going to do

38
00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:44.147
and complete this exercise which is exercise 14.

39
00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:46.105
Please open up your success journal

40
00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:50.059
and turn to exercise number 12, not 14 yet.

41
00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:52.984
Please open up exercise 12.

42
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:54.841
So what we're going to do, is we're going to use

43
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:59.499
the content that you created in exercise number 12,

44
00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.345
and use that to help create our slides.

45
00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:07.092
Okay, and, I'm going to call each step in the process

46
00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:09.675
Step A, B, C, and step D, okay?

47
00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:13.066
This will make sense in a second.

48
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:16.780
So please make sure that you've completed exercise number 12

49
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.796
before completing this exercise which is exercise 14.

50
00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:22.248
Thanks, okay.

51
00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:26.331
Step A, if you want to put a title on your slide,

52
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.722
you have the option of copying and pasting the title

53
00:02:30.722 --> 00:02:34.468
from journal exercise number 12 in step number one.

54
00:02:34.468 --> 00:02:37.846
Please look at this image here.

55
00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:42.105
Copy the presentation title onto your first slide.

56
00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:44.422
If you want to create a title from scratch,

57
00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:48.326
you can always revisit exercise number 10.

58
00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:50.826
Okay, let's move on to Step B.

59
00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:54.694
In exercise number 12 in your journal,

60
00:02:54.694 --> 00:02:58.861
please look at step number two for this image here.

61
00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:04.212
If you need help with the content of this step,

62
00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:08.082
you can always revisit exercise number four.

63
00:03:08.082 --> 00:03:12.324
Now, in this current step, which again is Step B,

64
00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:16.374
you have the option to create a slide or two or three,

65
00:03:16.374 --> 00:03:20.638
based on how you're going to start your presentation.

66
00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:24.486
For example, you could put a quote on a slide

67
00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.331
or an image, et cetera.

68
00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.785
And, if you need help with this,

69
00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:32.046
you can even watch act three scene one again,

70
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:35.938
which explains how to start your presentation.

71
00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:39.505
Please make sure not to put too many words on each slide.

72
00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:41.957
And don't worry as we're going to discuss

73
00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:44.872
how to prepare for your speech in a lot of detail

74
00:03:44.872 --> 00:03:47.133
in act eight of this course.

75
00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:48.787
Okay, we're done with Step B.

76
00:03:48.787 --> 00:03:50.787
Let's move on to Step C.

77
00:03:51.987 --> 00:03:54.547
In exercise number 12 in your journal,

78
00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:58.380
please look at step three for this image here.

79
00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.838
If you need help creating the middle content

80
00:04:02.838 --> 00:04:05.820
of your presentation, meaning the stuff in between

81
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.106
the start and the end of your speech,

82
00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:10.140
then please revisit exercise number seven

83
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.043
and watch act three scene two,

84
00:04:13.043 --> 00:04:17.115
which covers adding content in a lot of detail.

85
00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:21.302
So, for this current step, which again is Step C,

86
00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:24.885
please make one slide for each content line

87
00:04:26.678 --> 00:04:28.602
from your final table

88
00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:30.560
that you created in exercise number 12.

89
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.136
I'm going to read that again.

90
00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:35.577
So for this current step, which again is Step C,

91
00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:39.393
please make one slide for each content line

92
00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:41.529
from your final table

93
00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.577
that you created in exercise 12.

94
00:04:43.577 --> 00:04:45.365
And just, please make sure

95
00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:47.582
that you don't use too many words at all, okay?

96
00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:48.583
Less is more.

97
00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:52.161
If possible, use a picture instead of words or both, okay?

98
00:04:52.161 --> 00:04:54.445
And if you need to create animations

99
00:04:54.445 --> 00:04:59.012
or add more advanced options to explain a complex topic,

100
00:04:59.012 --> 00:05:02.387
you can always watch any of the lectures in act four

101
00:05:02.387 --> 00:05:04.930
to help you with this.

102
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.022
Okay, we're done with Step C.

103
00:05:07.022 --> 00:05:09.374
Let's move on to Step D, okay?

104
00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:11.781
In exercise number 12, in your journal,

105
00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:16.163
please look at step number four for this image.

106
00:05:16.163 --> 00:05:20.411
If you need help with the content of this step,

107
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.977
you can always revisit exercise number nine.

108
00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:27.285
Now, in this step, which again, is Step D,

109
00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:31.257
you have the option of creating a slide or two or three

110
00:05:31.257 --> 00:05:35.036
based on how you're going to end your presentation.

111
00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:38.918
For example, you could put a quote on a slide

112
00:05:38.918 --> 00:05:40.560
or an image, et cetera, okay?

113
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.677
Or something kind of cool and inspirational.

114
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:47.355
And, if you need help with this, you could even watch

115
00:05:47.355 --> 00:05:49.819
act three scene three again,

116
00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.077
which explains how to end your presentation.

117
00:05:53.077 --> 00:05:55.852
Please have fun creating your slide,

118
00:05:55.852 --> 00:06:00.282
and remember to use a few, but not necessarily all,

119
00:06:00.282 --> 00:06:03.916
of the PIMCO slide creation concepts

120
00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:06.055
that we discussed in act four, okay?

121
00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:07.764
We did that in scene one of act four.

122
00:06:07.764 --> 00:06:11.347
So, PIMCO stands for pictures, inspiration,

123
00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:17.894
minimalism, consistency, and O for original, okay?

124
00:06:19.342 --> 00:06:22.300
Okay, so try to include at least two of those PIMCO things

125
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.800
or items in your slides, okay?

126
00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.138
Okay, so I included instructions

127
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:31.232
on how to complete this exercise in your success journal

128
00:06:31.232 --> 00:06:34.901
in exercise number fourteen, in case you want

129
00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:37.566
to review the instructions for this exercise

130
00:06:37.566 --> 00:06:39.389
that I just explained to you.

131
00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.303
And, as you complete the exercise,

132
00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:44.734
please don't think much about your delivery

133
00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:48.547
or preparing your delivery as we'll discuss these topics

134
00:06:48.547 --> 00:06:52.047
in acts number six and eight respectively.

135
00:06:52.884 --> 00:06:56.055
So, thank you, and congratulations

136
00:06:56.055 --> 00:06:58.555
on completing act number four.
