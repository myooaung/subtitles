1
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:02,816
When you present,

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:07,004
you can almost never have enough passion, okay?

3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,781
When you practice your presentation

4
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:13,617
and you record yourself with your smartphone,

5
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:16,373
computer, or other video recorder,

6
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:21,155
watch to see that you have enough passion in your delivery.

7
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,911
I want you to speak from the heart,

8
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,453
like you're having a conversation

9
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:28,620
and not giving a stale delivery, okay?

10
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,744
Do you ever flip through many TV channels

11
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:36,182
and you stop for a second,

12
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:40,776
and somebody is speaking in a really boring, monotone way?

13
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:44,792
Well obviously you immediately change the channel, right?

14
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,440
You know, quite often when you stay

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,034
on a certain TV channel, when someone

16
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:52,274
is speaking right from the heart with passion and emotion,

17
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:54,694
you stick it out for awhile and you kind of watch to see,

18
00:00:54,694 --> 00:00:57,428
what are they talking about, right?

19
00:00:57,428 --> 00:01:01,240
Now, I'm certainly overdoing, you know, this, a little bit.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,818
But I'm doing it on purpose just to get my point across.

21
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:07,912
And I humbly believe that you can almost never be

22
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:12,405
too passionate about life and almost everything, okay?

23
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:16,405
And so, when you speak on stage, take it all in.

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,263
Savor and enjoy every single word.

25
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,989
What are we here for, okay?

26
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,982
Just think about how great actors like,

27
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:30,795
like Liam Neeson, speak with passion, right?

28
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:33,428
These great actors can make something

29
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,803
incredibly boring sound amazing, right?

30
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:39,852
And Morgan Freeman does this, too, right?

31
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:43,238
And when you make something boring sound exciting,

32
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:46,277
like cloud computing, like Mark Benioff does,

33
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:49,027
then you can sell anything, okay?

34
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,043
And for those of you that have taken my previous courses,

35
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:57,967
you know how passionate I am about networking

36
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,058
and using LinkedIn to network.

37
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:04,187
You know, I have to hand it to guys like Liam Neeson,

38
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:07,901
as they're, they're better than I am

39
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:11,938
at presenting networking concepts, like LinkedIn,

40
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:14,312
better than I am, right?

41
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:16,664
So, check out Liam Neeson here kind of

42
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:18,071
talking about LinkedIn, and he does it

43
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,904
much better than I do.

44
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:25,201
Okay, so, all the world's a stage.

45
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:30,569
Please watch this next video, which was a trailer

46
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,710
for an HBO show that was canceled, called Vinyl.

47
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,073
The trailer's outstanding, right?

48
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:42,303
And Martin Scorcese and Mick Jagger actually produced this.

49
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:44,840
Right, it's too bad it was canceled, right?

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,009
Watch the passion in this delivery, right,

51
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,926
from this record producer, and then try to feel

52
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:57,132
or understand what is being said

53
00:02:57,132 --> 00:03:00,306
when the record producer in this video says,

54
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:04,050
"Do you remember the first time you heard a song,

55
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,367
and it made the hair on the back of your neck

56
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:07,516
want to stand up?"

57
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,599
Check it out.

58
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,624
Okay.

59
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:18,339
You want to deliver a passionate experience, you know.

60
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:21,579
I kind of say this again and again and again, right,

61
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,732
as repetition is really the mother of all skill

62
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:28,950
but people might not remember what you said

63
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,269
but they'll never forget the way you made them feel, right?

64
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,813
And that trailer that you just watched

65
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,353
from that canceled show called Vinyl,

66
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:39,008
I don't really remember what they were talking about

67
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:42,991
but I remember the passion that was being said, right,

68
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:47,200
and I love it because that trailer we study musicians,

69
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,628
and musicians that sing with passion are the ones

70
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:50,843
that are successful, right?

71
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:55,536
It's not usually about the stuff they sing about, right?

72
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:59,281
Just think about the most memorable Oscar speeches ever,

73
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,939
right, you probably remember how this person made you feel

74
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,729
and not really what they said.

75
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,013
Delivery is everything.

76
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:13,783
The medium is often more important than the message.

77
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:17,181
And so, please have fun up there, right?

78
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:21,591
This is your time and your moment to shine, okay?

79
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:24,299
And don't be stale and boring, you know?

80
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,890
That's not who you are anyway, be you.

81
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,816
Who gives a damn what people think when you are yourself,

82
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:32,785
passion kicks in, okay?

83
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:36,352
You can't have passion unless you are you, okay?

84
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:39,267
Be the you that your friends and family love.

85
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:43,069
Just let the audience get to know you, okay?

86
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,152
And again, have fun doing it as well.
