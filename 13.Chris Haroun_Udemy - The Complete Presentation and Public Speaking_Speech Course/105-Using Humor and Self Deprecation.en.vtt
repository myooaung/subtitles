00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:03.038
Humor that works really well,

2
00:00:03.038 --> 00:00:05.310
is usually self deprecating humor.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.942
Meaning when ya, when you make fun of yourself

4
00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:10.932
in some kind of authentic way.

5
00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:11.765
Okay?

6
00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:14.820
Or you make fun of your own product in some way

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.024
that is self deprecating from a corporate perspective.

8
00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:22.238
Especially when there's a massive anticipation

9
00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:24.039
of a product being released.

10
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:24.887
Alright?

11
00:00:24.887 --> 00:00:27.357
And here's an awesome example, right?

12
00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:32.089
In 2007, when Steve Jobs gave the epic introduction

13
00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:36.248
of the iPhone speech, before he showed the iPhone,

14
00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:37.497
or what it would look like,

15
00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:39.249
he actually threw this up. Right?

16
00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:40.564
It's pretty funny. Pretty funny.

17
00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:41.397
Right?

18
00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:44.249
And I even saw Warren Buffett's presents

19
00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.687
and he said that, what did he say again?

20
00:00:46.687 --> 00:00:48.780
Oh, yeah, he said, "I'm getting older

21
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.012
and I'm getting closer to salvage value now."

22
00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:53.400
Right? Which in finance and accounting terms means

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.608
an item that, that's being depreciated quite quickly.

24
00:00:56.608 --> 00:00:58.938
Anyway, it's funny.

25
00:00:58.938 --> 00:01:01.860
And making fun of yourself works exceptionally well.

26
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.327
And I personally believe that humility

27
00:01:04.327 --> 00:01:06.673
is a universally liked trait. Right?

28
00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:10.126
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile.

29
00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:13.282
So, you know, be yourself no matter what they say.

30
00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:15.797
And you know what, if the audience doesn't laugh,

31
00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:19.029
which occurs when I throw up this pie chart,

32
00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:20.129
(crickets chirping)

33
00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:21.402
hear those crickets?

34
00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:23.110
That happens to me a lot.

35
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.224
Then I kinda look down and I embarrassly say,

36
00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:28.901
"Gosh, tough crowd, tough crowd."

37
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.587
But you know what, that humility, right,

38
00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:34.277
where no one laughs, right, where you feel embarrassed,

39
00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:36.074
I think it, I might be wrong,

40
00:01:36.074 --> 00:01:38.398
but I think it actually makes you more likable.

41
00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.081
Because it shows vulnerability, right?

42
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:45.197
Which is an admirable trait because it's a normal,

43
00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:48.614
human feeling, right, to feel vulnerable.

44
00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:52.462
And you know, more often than not, you win over the audience

45
00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:54.608
by being you, by being you.

46
00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:58.716
And Bill Gates has a wonderful sense of humor.

47
00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:01.916
And he makes fun of himself a lot.

48
00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:04.212
He makes fun of himself trying to be cool.

49
00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:06.414
Kind of like I do, right, I know I'm not cool.

50
00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:08.267
See here, dab, is that how it works?

51
00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.871
Or is it this way?

52
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:11.207
Alright, anyway, sorry.

53
00:02:11.207 --> 00:02:12.885
Embarrassing, I know.

54
00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:16.622
Okay, but Bill Gates is so much happier now that he's

55
00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:18.078
making the world a better place.

56
00:02:18.078 --> 00:02:21.262
Good guy, God bless him, good for him.

57
00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:23.181
And if you want to experiment with a low, low,

58
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:26.057
low budget video of yourself you can do so.

59
00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:29.171
And I'll give you an example in a couple minutes

60
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:30.305
of one that I did.

61
00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:32.805
But here's the example, first,

62
00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:36.537
of a probably not so low budget video that

63
00:02:36.537 --> 00:02:40.483
Bill Gates made, which was very self deprecating.

64
00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:43.186
And he showed this video, and it was awesome,

65
00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:45.869
on his last day of work at Microsoft.

66
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.325
And I love this, right.

67
00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:50.334
I love the fact that, you know,

68
00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:51.996
Bill Gates really makes fun of himself.

69
00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:54.590
It makes him instantly much more likable.

70
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.234
Right, so check out this video of him

71
00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:58.846
that he released to the public on the last day

72
00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:01.302
of him being the CEO of Microsoft.

73
00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:02.724
Check that out, it's funny.

74
00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:05.469
(light jazz music)

75
00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.405
And we're gonna study wedding speeches in act number 11.

76
00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:13.219
But during my wedding speech, eight million years ago,

77
00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.879
in the year 2000, wow, a long time ago,

78
00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.574
I put together a very self deprecating video.

79
00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:24.075
And I actually, I started giving the speech

80
00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:26.646
at my wedding reception at 6pm,

81
00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:29.546
which was a couple hours after the church ceremony,

82
00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:32.715
and I got up there and I gave a quick speech,

83
00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:36.632
and I basically, I started the speech by saying

84
00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:39.467
you know, thank you, everybody for coming

85
00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:42.879
and all that good stuff, and then I say

86
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.255
I almost didn't make it to the church today.

87
00:03:45.255 --> 00:03:46.679
You know, something happened.

88
00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:49.891
And I want to share with you what happened.

89
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.656
Right, and so I showed this,

90
00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:54.937
I showed this, uh, I showed this video.

91
00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:57.081
I had a lot of fun doing it, too.

92
00:03:57.081 --> 00:03:58.873
Anyway, check that out if you get a chance.

93
00:03:58.873 --> 00:03:59.951
It's pretty fun.

94
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:03.541
But I, I have to be honest with you.

95
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.717
You know, things really didn't work out this morning,

96
00:04:05.717 --> 00:04:06.950
with the groomsmen and I.

97
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.954
In fact, things were pretty chaotic.

98
00:04:09.954 --> 00:04:12.274
Things got so crazy that I decided

99
00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:14.509
to videotape the entire event.

100
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.002
And I kind of want to share it with you today.

101
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:17.835
(audience chatter)

102
00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:20.695
So, without further ado, I'd like to present

103
00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:21.590
the video.

104
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.570
(light music)

105
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.334
(birds chirping)

106
00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:27.400
How'd you guys sleep last night?

107
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.083
[Woman With Pink Towel] I couldn't sleep for a while.

108
00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:30.091
How about you?

109
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:31.885
[Woman In White Robe] Oh, I slept very well.

110
00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:32.718
Really?

111
00:04:32.718 --> 00:04:33.804
Yeah, yeah it was good.

112
00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:36.211
I went to bed around 9:30 or 10.

113
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:37.093
[Woman In Pink Robe] Oh my god.

114
00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:37.926
Yeah

115
00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:38.935
I wonder what the guy's are doing.

116
00:04:38.935 --> 00:04:41.664
Oh, I'm sure they're doing okay. This is pretty much,

117
00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:43.919
pretty well organized. Probably waiting at the church

118
00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.213
as we speak right now.

119
00:04:45.213 --> 00:04:46.046
Really?

120
00:04:46.046 --> 00:04:46.879
Yeah.

121
00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.624
(light music)

122
00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:52.374
(birds chirping)

123
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.893
(record scratch)

124
00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:03.709
Ah! I'm late!

125
00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:06.209
(polka music)

126
00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:19.210
Chris! I want to have a word with you.

127
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.549
Dad, I'm running late for the wedding.

128
00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:22.152
Come here.

129
00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:25.933
(suspenseful music)

130
00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:27.797
I hear that you're getting married today.

131
00:05:27.797 --> 00:05:30.881
Yeah to Christine. She's fantastic.

132
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.232
Christine is a lovely girl.

133
00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:34.471
We all met her, and we all love her.

134
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:35.910
Sit down, son.

135
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.993
Okay, dad.

136
00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:44.674
(Chris coughing)

137
00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:47.674
I have a word of the wise for you.

138
00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:55.244
Keep your friends close but keep your wife closer.

139
00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:04.282
(polka music)

140
00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:24.813
Oh, breakfast of champions.

141
00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:33.916
Oh my god, I'm running late.

142
00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:35.833
Oh, the ring! The ring!

143
00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:38.570
Ah, she's gonna love this.

144
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.403
Whoops!

145
00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:41.211
Fluffy! No!

146
00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:50.809
Amy, Jamey!

147
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:51.642
Chris, come on, let's go!

148
00:06:51.642 --> 00:06:52.658
We're late, we're late!

149
00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:53.516
You don't understand!

150
00:06:53.516 --> 00:06:56.050
The cat ate the ring!

151
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.986
What?

152
00:06:56.986 --> 00:06:58.102
What do I do?

153
00:06:58.102 --> 00:06:59.425
The cat ate the ring.

154
00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:00.291
What are you talking about?

155
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:01.355
The cat ate the ring!

156
00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:02.366
No, it can't be!

157
00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:05.181
Chris, you come here, you drive.

158
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:06.932
You get to the wedding, I'll get the ring.

159
00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:08.558
Alright, alright, alright.

160
00:07:08.558 --> 00:07:10.487
Come on, let's go!

161
00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:12.987
(polka music)

162
00:07:17.554 --> 00:07:19.429
I hear that you have been having some abdominal pain,

163
00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:21.613
something that physicians actually requested

164
00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:23.594
a radiograph of your abdomen.

165
00:07:23.594 --> 00:07:25.957
Are there any emotional problems, problems at home,

166
00:07:25.957 --> 00:07:29.367
depression, symptoms of like, poor eating?

167
00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:30.462
Is something wrong?

168
00:07:30.462 --> 00:07:32.738
(twinkling music)

169
00:07:32.738 --> 00:07:35.887
Radiographs actually demonstrate buttons, odd coins,

170
00:07:35.887 --> 00:07:39.054
and other consumed items like jewelry.

171
00:07:40.756 --> 00:07:41.802
We need to discuss this.

172
00:07:41.802 --> 00:07:43.078
Talk to me.

173
00:07:43.078 --> 00:07:45.730
(twinkling music)

174
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.123
Talk to me!

175
00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:48.846
(twinkling music)

176
00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:51.855
We clearly have issues to discuss.

177
00:07:51.855 --> 00:07:53.270
I'm late!

178
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.187
(fast paced music)

179
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:02.734
Fluffy!

180
00:08:02.734 --> 00:08:04.690
Fluffy! Cough it up!

181
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.518
Fluffy come on! Cough it up!

182
00:08:07.518 --> 00:08:10.435
(fast paced music)

183
00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:31.629
Fluffy, please try some Pepto Bismol, please.

184
00:08:34.354 --> 00:08:36.090
Come on, Fluffy, come on.

185
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.540
Please, Fluffy, please!

186
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.457
(fast paced music)

187
00:08:44.439 --> 00:08:46.624
The ring! The ring!

188
00:08:46.624 --> 00:08:50.124
Oh my god, I've got to get to the wedding!

189
00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:54.566
♫ Going to the chapel and we're

190
00:08:54.566 --> 00:08:57.566
♫ Gonna get married

191
00:08:58.514 --> 00:09:03.329
♫ Going to the chapel and we're

192
00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:05.473
Hey Soil, how's it going buddy?

193
00:09:05.473 --> 00:09:07.013
Hey listen, I'm coming to pick you up.

194
00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:07.978
Are you ready?

195
00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:11.220
Yeah, 10 minutes. Come right now.

196
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.275
Alright, well, I'll be right over.

197
00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:16.907
Buddy, let's go! We've got to pick up the other groomsmen.

198
00:09:16.907 --> 00:09:18.703
They've got all the alcohol for the reception.

199
00:09:18.703 --> 00:09:19.581
Ready?

200
00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:21.548
I'm alright. I hate my job.

201
00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:22.666
Oh really? Don't worry about it man.

202
00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:23.499
Let's go to the wedding.

203
00:09:23.499 --> 00:09:25.666
Let's go to the wedding.

204
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.850
(horn honking)

205
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.659
Guys, come on. Let's go!

206
00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:34.076
(lazy music)

207
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:01.314
Guys, wait up, I'll be right there.

208
00:10:02.807 --> 00:10:03.640
Guys?

209
00:10:04.563 --> 00:10:07.063
(polka music)

210
00:10:14.098 --> 00:10:15.765
Gonna get married.

211
00:10:18.605 --> 00:10:20.188
Goin' to the church

212
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.613
(circus music)

213
00:10:40.924 --> 00:10:42.811
Did you feel something?

214
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:45.394
Yeah, I did. Come on.

215
00:10:47.164 --> 00:10:49.581
Guys come on, move the car.

216
00:10:52.267 --> 00:10:54.767
(polka music)

217
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:07.743
(car horn honking)

218
00:11:07.743 --> 00:11:08.851
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're going off the road!

219
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:09.684
Whoa!

220
00:11:09.684 --> 00:11:10.606
(tires screeching)

221
00:11:10.606 --> 00:11:11.524
(car horn honking)

222
00:11:11.524 --> 00:11:12.357
Ah!

223
00:11:12.357 --> 00:11:13.190
Ah!

224
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.803
(bubbling water)

225
00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:24.691
Guys!

226
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:25.524
I'll come after you!

227
00:11:25.524 --> 00:11:27.891
(spring bouncing noise)

228
00:11:27.891 --> 00:11:28.724
Whoa!

229
00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:38.563
(heart beating)

230
00:11:44.689 --> 00:11:47.689
(persevering music)

231
00:12:37.994 --> 00:12:40.661
(wedding march)

232
00:12:59.022 --> 00:12:59.855
Meow

233
00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:08.096
Okay, again, I was terrified, but you know what?

234
00:13:09.753 --> 00:13:13.554
People never know how scared you are, right.

235
00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:17.005
You're never as terrified, you never look as terrified

236
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.278
as you feel.

237
00:13:18.278 --> 00:13:21.547
And at that beginning point, when I was introducing,

238
00:13:21.547 --> 00:13:24.193
you know, before the whole crazy video,

239
00:13:24.193 --> 00:13:26.530
and the cat thing started, when I was standing there

240
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.334
with Christine, my wife, in my tux, I was terrified, man.

241
00:13:31.334 --> 00:13:32.180
I was terrified.

242
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.742
I think I'm a better presenter now, a lot better

243
00:13:33.742 --> 00:13:35.787
because I just don't care anymore, what people think.

244
00:13:35.787 --> 00:13:39.319
I don't know if that's a good thing, but anyway.

245
00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.768
I'm gonna show you how to make a way, way,

246
00:13:40.768 --> 00:13:44.074
way, way, better speech in act number 11.

247
00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:46.824
(staccato music)

248
00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:52.353
I saw the most amazing motorcycle

249
00:13:52.353 --> 00:13:54.076
when I was about 12 years old.

250
00:13:54.076 --> 00:13:55.896
When I was living in Mississauga.

251
00:13:55.896 --> 00:13:58.444
Okay, Mississauga is just outside of Toronto.

252
00:13:58.444 --> 00:14:01.230
The motorcycle was a Ducati and it was beautiful.

253
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.015
It was back in the 80s and it looked just like this.

254
00:14:03.015 --> 00:14:04.191
Okay?

255
00:14:04.191 --> 00:14:07.510
I was with my best friend Sohill

256
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.401
and we were a couple blocks away from my house.

257
00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:14.021
And we saw this beautiful Ducati motorcycle

258
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:17.155
parked on the driveway, and of course

259
00:14:17.155 --> 00:14:19.984
I had to sit on it, right.

260
00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:24.562
And it was gorgeous but it was way too big for me.

261
00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:25.738
Right, way too big, right.

262
00:14:25.738 --> 00:14:28.461
And I remember I was kind of teetering like this on it,

263
00:14:28.461 --> 00:14:30.588
and when I got off the Ducati the whole thing

264
00:14:30.588 --> 00:14:31.835
fell down, right.

265
00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:33.662
And it smashed the orange lights.

266
00:14:33.662 --> 00:14:34.629
I'll never forget it.

267
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:36.078
On the side of it.

268
00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:39.783
And I did, right at that moment, right.

269
00:14:39.783 --> 00:14:42.450
I did what you would expect someone of my,

270
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.201
I did what you would expect someone of my impeccable

271
00:14:45.201 --> 00:14:47.120
moral character would do.

272
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.219
I looked around, and I ran as fast as I could.

273
00:14:51.219 --> 00:14:54.386
Right, I ran and I wasn't coming back.

274
00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:59.756
And I looked around, and I saw Sohill looking at me

275
00:15:01.823 --> 00:15:05.990
and he said, "Chris! That's not right, come back!"

276
00:15:08.064 --> 00:15:10.690
Alright, so I came back. I came back, right.

277
00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.322
My friend Sohill.

278
00:15:12.322 --> 00:15:15.379
He's very honest, so you gotta love him, right.

279
00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:16.634
I said, "yeah, yeah, yeah"

280
00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:20.291
And walked back, nervously to the bike, right.

281
00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:22.264
And I was scared, I was scared.

282
00:15:22.264 --> 00:15:26.156
And a neighbor next to the house of the bike owner

283
00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:28.214
walked over to us and said,

284
00:15:28.214 --> 00:15:29.806
"What is your name, son?

285
00:15:29.806 --> 00:15:31.821
And what is your phone number?"

286
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:35.103
And to make a long story short,

287
00:15:35.103 --> 00:15:38.170
my mom paid for the repairs to the bike.

288
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.515
And I had to pay her back every week out of my allowance

289
00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:43.098
for about a year or so.

290
00:15:43.098 --> 00:15:45.674
And I learned a very, very valuable lesson that day.

291
00:15:45.674 --> 00:15:50.501
Which was never, ever, ever would I talk to Sohill again.

292
00:15:50.501 --> 00:15:51.750
Okay, okay.

293
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.003
Of course, this has to be a relevant story, too, right.

294
00:15:55.003 --> 00:15:58.462
So it would be amazing if I was discussing

295
00:15:58.462 --> 00:16:02.629
a beautifully designed product at some product release event

296
00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:06.063
or corporate speech and then I could,

297
00:16:06.063 --> 00:16:09.331
I could talk about the Ducati and that sort of thing,

298
00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:11.151
et cetera, I think you get the idea.

299
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:15.204
So humor and self deprecation works in a speech

300
00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:20.041
and it works really, really well when you tell a story

301
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:21.224
at the same time.

302
00:16:21.224 --> 00:16:23.613
And I think the audience really identifies with it

303
00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:25.446
and enjoys it as well.

304
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:32.537
♫ It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile

305
00:16:32.537 --> 00:16:36.704
♫ Be yourself no matter what they say
