1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,465
Move around if you can while you present

2
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:06,224
as energy makes people pay attention

3
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:09,043
and not enough people do this.

4
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:11,518
Okay, so, I gave a keynote once

5
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:14,945
at the University of Tulsa finance event,

6
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:18,119
it was called Friends of Finance.

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,202
It was a luncheon in 2015

8
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:24,480
and they were really, really nice.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,966
They were awesome and I really enjoyed it.

10
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:27,820
It was cool.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,820
It was cool.

12
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:33,322
Actually an article was published about me presenting

13
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:34,946
in a couple of local newspapers,

14
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:37,155
you can google it, whatever.

15
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:40,734
They called me "a techie venture capitalist

16
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:45,509
"wrapped in a perpetual motion machine with arms,"

17
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:49,389
or a motion machine with arms, whatever it was.

18
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,039
I think that was a compliment.

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,946
Not sure, whatever.

20
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:55,636
But I love to move around when I present

21
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:59,135
as I get really excited and even more passionate

22
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:00,881
about what I'm saying.

23
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:05,699
You know what, 99.99999% of people stand still

24
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,961
when they present, and here are some examples

25
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:12,826
of me presenting at other events, like my TEDx talk

26
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:16,233
or when I presented in front of other companies.

27
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:18,031
I just love to walk around.

28
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,364
I love to move around a lot.

29
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:23,996
It's just what I do,

30
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:27,496
and it gives me a lot more energy as well.

31
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:32,082
And I've found when I do that fewer people yawn,

32
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:35,270
and it's just, I don't know, it's just me being me.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,670
And when you go to a concert, if the performer

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,519
stays in the same place the whole time,

35
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,088
that's really boring, right?

36
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:47,013
The highest-grossing concerts have a lot of movements,

37
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,021
and the worst concerts ever have the artist

38
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,091
just kind of stay in there.

39
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,265
I mean what's the point of going?

40
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:54,815
I can just kind of listen to them on Spotify, right?

41
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,086
How boring is it just watching them sing

42
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:01,763
or watch a presenter just stand there and talk.

43
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:05,783
You know, I can just listen to radio instead.

44
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:09,677
It's hard to lose interest if someone moves around a lot.

45
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:13,460
It shows they have energy and that they're passionate

46
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,791
and that they're different than other people.

47
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,076
Motion creates emotion because, you know,

48
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:24,243
staring at someone for a while is lame, it's boring, okay.

49
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:28,222
Now think about a time when you went to a concert

50
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:30,715
and this singer walked into the audience.

51
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,081
You remember that, right?

52
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,988
Or close to the audience, okay.

53
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:37,911
But do you remember the song or the content they sang?

54
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,738
Probably less likely, okay.

55
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:43,724
Remember, the medium is more important than the message.

56
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:46,845
The way you present's more important than what you say.

57
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:49,457
And I want people to remember your speech,

58
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:51,927
your performance, your experience,

59
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,994
and I never want them to forget it.

60
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,754
Okay, and if you do move around,

61
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:58,427
without overdoing it of course,

62
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:01,177
then people will never forget it.

63
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:07,514
Powerful effect when you present is to stop walking

64
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:12,263
when you want to say something really important.

65
00:03:12,263 --> 00:03:14,969
I did this when I was doing my TEDx talk

66
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:17,052
and here's a little clip.

67
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,928
And also, please make sure to wear soft bottom shoes,

68
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:30,520
when you're walking around the stage.

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,160
Especially if it's, it's usually not a carpeted stage,

70
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,993
it's usually, it's hardwood or whatever,

71
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:39,277
concrete, whatever.

72
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:42,605
But just people hear the sound of you walking,

73
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,204
and that's all they'll remember, right?

74
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:47,537
And so, sometimes I'll move,

75
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:55,158
sometimes I'll move to a different spot on the stage

76
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,910
when I talk about a new topic.

77
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,743
Okay.

78
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,667
Or, think about how rock stars move around the stage

79
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:06,443
to address or sing songs to people

80
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,281
that are in different seats.

81
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:12,448
They want to engage the entire stadium or coliseum, right?

82
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,108
Why can't we do this when we present as well

83
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,494
if it works in concerts?

84
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:21,131
I'm not telling you to run around like 1872,

85
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:23,258
Mick Jagger on the stage at Wembley Stadium,

86
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:26,495
I'm just telling you to kinda, you'll mix it up

87
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,440
because motion creates emotion.

88
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,528
And sometimes use a catwalk,

89
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:34,195
where these singers will walk on

90
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,933
to get closer to the audience.

91
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,618
And if you've got a really big stage

92
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:42,506
I want you to mix it up and move around.

93
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:45,887
A lot of times I'll actually enter into the crowd.

94
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:46,835
I love that.

95
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:47,785
I do in my class as well,

96
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:50,314
I think I might drive my students a little nuts.

97
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,038
But they always pay attention.

98
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:54,526
I walk around the class sometimes when I teach,

99
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,957
just to kind of mix it up,

100
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:59,751
and I'm challenging myself, too, to make it different.

101
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:03,918
Now, I always check to see if the microphone will work

102
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:08,414
that far away meaning off the stage, the day before,

103
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:11,124
when I test the equipment,

104
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:14,286
or if it's the day of, I'll ask the technical person

105
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:17,414
setting up the presentation, if available,

106
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:20,905
if the microphone or the wireless headset

107
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:23,045
can work anywhere in the room or not.

108
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:24,610
No, I'll actually, I'll test it out.

109
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,677
Sometimes you'll hear feedback

110
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:30,250
if you walk too far away or certain areas.

111
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,718
Microphones are like that, and sometimes you don't know why,

112
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:34,288
it's like your barbecue, they work really well

113
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:35,796
in certain spots and not others.

114
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:39,129
So you've got to test it out beforehand.

115
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:43,000
You know, microphones are usually used during Q&A as well,

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,729
so just make sure you test all this stuff out.

117
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,214
Ask a technical person, again, if they're available,

118
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,739
if the microphone works everywhere on the stage or not.

119
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:55,656
As a side note, please, please know

120
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:00,622
that if you're wired up with a wireless mike,

121
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:04,205
it can work in many different places, okay.

122
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,239
Just watch this video and you'll know what I mean.
