1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,424
Please don't forget the So What Test

2
00:00:02,424 --> 00:00:04,826
when you're presenting.

3
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:08,420
Is this slide or this topic relevant or not?

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,670
Is the music in this slide,

5
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:14,823
if you're gonna use it, right, relevant?

6
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:16,935
Is the quote relevant?

7
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,556
Is the image relevant?

8
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:22,439
So it's crucial that you please remember

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,818
the characteristics and background of your audience

10
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,058
in order to make sure that your speech

11
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:29,978
is relevant to them.

12
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,706
And if you aren't sure if it is,

13
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:34,249
then please review Journal Exercise Number One

14
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,186
called Who is the Audience

15
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:39,450
or Customers Plus Their Characteristics.

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,529
Also, please review Journal Exercise Number Three

17
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:46,821
on What is the Number One Goal or Purpose

18
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:48,474
of Your Presentation?

19
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:50,377
We do that just to make sure

20
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:52,361
that what we are saying is relevant,

21
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:55,625
and always thinking of the So What question.

22
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,458
So What?
