00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:10.029
Welcome to the first of three intermissions.

2
00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:11.578
This will be a lot of fun.

3
00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:15.036
In each of the three intermissions in this course

4
00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:17.973
we're going to have a presentation exercise by you

5
00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:20.908
and then a critique and discussion of one

6
00:00:20.908 --> 00:00:23.074
of my presentations.

7
00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.740
I strongly recommend please that you complete

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.687
all three intermissions as you work your way

9
00:00:28.687 --> 00:00:30.091
through the course.

10
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:34.092
I want you to please notice how you're progressing

11
00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:37.372
and how much better your presentation became

12
00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:39.691
throughout the course.

13
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:44.356
There's three parts to this and all of the intermissions.

14
00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:45.628
There are three intermissions and three parts

15
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.173
to each of them.

16
00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:50.495
The first part is a presentation exercise.

17
00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:54.412
The second part is an exercise critiquing

18
00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:56.907
the presentation that you gave.

19
00:00:56.907 --> 00:01:00.468
And the third part is a discussion and critique

20
00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:03.983

21
00:01:03.983 --> 00:01:06.738

22
00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:09.954
and critique of a TedX talk that I gave.
