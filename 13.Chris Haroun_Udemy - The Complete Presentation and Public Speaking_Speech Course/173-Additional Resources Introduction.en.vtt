00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:02.168
Welcome to act number 12.

2
00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.615
This is a very short act,

3
00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.264
and I just included a number of resources for you,

4
00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:08.972
including a number of quotes you can use,

5
00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:13.837
and I also included all of the PowerPoint presentations

6
00:00:13.837 --> 00:00:17.805
again as well just so you had everything in one location,

7
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:22.605
right, and there's also just a quick little lecture

8
00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:26.401
or link to Google Slides of my students

9
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.304
from the business university that I teach at

10
00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.137
and just how they present it,

11
00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:32.525
and I was just so proud of them

12
00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:35.405
because they presented in front of LinkedIn's management

13
00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:39.627
as well as Electronic Arts management and sales force.

14
00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:41.890
We actually used the headquarters of LinkedIn for it,

15
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.405
so they did a great job.

16
00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:44.877
Check out the pictures of them if you want.

17
00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.200
They were awesome.

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.457
And I also included a documentary

19
00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:52.040
on how we made the trailer for this course,

20
00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:56.504
and I actually hired a crew to do it.

21
00:00:56.504 --> 00:00:59.645
There's this great guy named Adad

22
00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.928
that is a San Francisco State graduate

23
00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.441
that did an amazing job,

24
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:05.491
and we had a lot of fun with it, as well,

25
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:07.603
and if there's any additional resources

26
00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:10.864
that you want me to add to act 12,

27
00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:14.114
just please let me know, and thank you.
