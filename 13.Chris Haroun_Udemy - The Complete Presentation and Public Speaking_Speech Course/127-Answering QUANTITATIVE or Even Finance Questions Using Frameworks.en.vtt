00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:03.047
In terms of answering quantitative

2
00:00:03.047 --> 00:00:06.217
or even finance related questions, here's a couple

3
00:00:06.217 --> 00:00:08.713
of different frameworks you can use.

4
00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.943
This is gonna be very finance heavy.

5
00:00:11.943 --> 00:00:14.567
If you don't care about finance

6
00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:18.074
or accounting related questions, you can just skip this,

7
00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:20.199
but this might really apply for banking

8
00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.281
or people that work in the finance industry

9
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:25.698
or even for CEOs or strategy consultants.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.800
Again, if this matters to you, if you care about M and A,

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.232
mergers, acquisition, et cetera, keep watching this section.

12
00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:35.972
Otherwise, just skip ahead, please.

13
00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:36.805
Thank you.

14
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.527
The first one we're gonna discuss is M and A

15
00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:42.855
or mergers and acquisitions.

16
00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.780
This is a Q and A crutch you can use.

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.901
In this case, company X is considering

18
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.925
acquiring company Y and somebody in the audience

19
00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:53.893
asks you, "how would you analyze this scenario?"

20
00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:55.635
Or "what do you think?"

21
00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.212
You start off by saying this.

22
00:00:58.212 --> 00:01:01.396
Is company Y a competitor in a different market

23
00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:03.254
or in the same market?

24
00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:07.013
And then what you can do is you can then drill down

25
00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:10.245
per this graphic here, I'm not gonna go into too much detail

26
00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.271
on it.

27
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.582
You can read through this and apply this if you want to.

28
00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:17.364
You can see that the crutch is there.

29
00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:19.109
Let's use the first crutch.

30
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.733
If the audience member asks you a question

31
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:25.125
and says it's a competitor, first of all,

32
00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:28.149
you talk about expense synergy scenarios.

33
00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.020
You discuss synergistic headcount expense cuts

34
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.412
in G and A, S and M, or R and D and you keep drilling down

35
00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:38.245
until you get to an EPS accretion.

36
00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:42.917
If an audience question pertains to a similar market,

37
00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:45.829
then use the other crutch, here, which is

38
00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.374
the revenue synergies scenario.

39
00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.237
Then you just discuss how company X can use

40
00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:54.215
its existing distribution channels to sell

41
00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.307
company Y's products.

42
00:01:56.307 --> 00:01:57.876
You keep drilling down until you get

43
00:01:57.876 --> 00:01:59.604
to an EPS accretion number.

44
00:01:59.604 --> 00:02:01.460
Keep it very high level.

45
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.532
Let's move on to buy versus build.

46
00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:07.282
The question could be as follows.

47
00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:11.815
Company X is considering entering a market by buying

48
00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:13.095
or building.

49
00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:14.759
How would you advise?

50
00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:19.047
You can then ask, if you wanted to, "what is a TAM

51
00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:22.085
"as a percent of the market to capture?

52
00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:23.380
"What's the cost to build?

53
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.726
"What's the cost to buy?"

54
00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:27.781
Or you can discuss your thoughts on those items

55
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:28.839
if you want to.

56
00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.089
This is very finance heavy.

57
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.996
You can look at the building crutch.

58
00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:37.172
Is building cost effective?

59
00:02:37.172 --> 00:02:39.907
And you can drill down and discuss, do you have

60
00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:41.666
the talent to build?

61
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:44.017
How many years would it take to be a credible competitor

62
00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:45.842
by building the product yourself?

63
00:02:45.842 --> 00:02:48.180
Is this really the best use of your capital?

64
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.276
What happens if building this product fails?

65
00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:55.682
How much is it gonna cost to finance building this product?

66
00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:58.100
What's the impact in the short term and long term

67
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.267
earnings per share or EPS?

68
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:05.204
And then you can look at the buying crutch.

69
00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.107
Is buying cost effective?

70
00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:09.924
Is it urgent that we get to market faster?

71
00:03:09.924 --> 00:03:12.515
What happens if the deal doesn't work out?

72
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:15.684
Are there integration issues or breakup penalties?

73
00:03:15.684 --> 00:03:19.939
What's the impact on short or long term earnings?

74
00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.101
That sort of thing.

75
00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.518
Let's talk about another crutch question.

76
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.838
Company X is considering an IPO.

77
00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:30.404
How would you advise?

78
00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:31.799
You can discuss, well it depends.

79
00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.348
What valuation?

80
00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:37.348
And you can look at the go versus not go crutch.

81
00:03:38.245 --> 00:03:40.597
Let's talk about go first.

82
00:03:40.597 --> 00:03:42.884
Go, we selected go here.

83
00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:47.492
The competition's P/E, PEG, and price to ratio

84
00:03:47.492 --> 00:03:50.935
and other multiples are more expensive.

85
00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:53.108
The IPO market is robust.

86
00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:56.533
If recent companies in the same sector had successful IPOs.

87
00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:58.532
That's the go scenario.

88
00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:01.303
Then we look at the no go crutch.

89
00:04:01.303 --> 00:04:04.772
No go if the competition's valuation is cheaper

90
00:04:04.772 --> 00:04:06.854
with similar growth.

91
00:04:06.854 --> 00:04:08.836
The IPO market is awful.

92
00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:12.567
If recent companies in the same sector had terrible IPOs

93
00:04:12.567 --> 00:04:14.820
as well, and the market's in a tailspin.

94
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.403
That sort of thing.

95
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:20.951
Let's move on to Q and A crutch question number four

96
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.330
which is explain how to build a financial model

97
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.676
from scratch.

98
00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:27.253
This is very finance heavy, so again, if you're not

99
00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:30.534
in a finance oriented situation, you can just skip

100
00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:31.367
the rest of this.

101
00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:33.941
I wanted to be thorough.

102
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.565
Explain how to build a financial model from scratch.

103
00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:40.469
We need to know, is this a public or a private company?

104
00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.501
If it's a public company, here's a public company crutch.

105
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:48.402
Get model data at sec.gov for the past 10 years

106
00:04:48.402 --> 00:04:52.069
using 10-Ks or the S-1 if it's a recent IPO.

107
00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:57.925
Also talk to I.R. which is investor relations.

108
00:04:57.925 --> 00:04:59.781
Then create the income statement, the balance sheet,

109
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:01.155
the cash flow statement.

110
00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:03.058
Then you analyze past trends and forecast

111
00:05:03.058 --> 00:05:05.972
the next five fiscal years and if possible,

112
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.940
after you've done your research, speak with the CFO.

113
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.386
If it's a private company, you can find out

114
00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:15.538
what the TAM is, which is the total adjustable market.

115
00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:18.149
And if you can't find out what the size of the market

116
00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:20.836
is online from looking at reports from consulting firms

117
00:05:20.836 --> 00:05:23.378
like McKinsey or Gartner or Forest or et cetera,

118
00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:25.236
then what you do is you add up the revenue

119
00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:27.570
from the top 25 firms in that sector.

120
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.205
Then you decide what percent of the TAM

121
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:35.122
the company will likely have in 10 years.

122
00:05:35.122 --> 00:05:38.642
And then you project sales and make most income statement

123
00:05:38.642 --> 00:05:42.691
elements a percentage of revenue, et cetera.

124
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:46.164
Q and A crutch question number five.

125
00:05:46.164 --> 00:05:49.155
Company X is going public.

126
00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:50.883
You have to create a model.

127
00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:54.437
Explain how DCF works and relative valuation metrics

128
00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.963
like price/earnings and price to revenue.

129
00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:58.130
This is a lot.

130
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.056
Let's look at the DCF crutch first.

131
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:04.852
You're gonna project your income statement,

132
00:06:04.852 --> 00:06:07.557
balance sheet, your cash flow statement for 10 years.

133
00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:09.329
You're gonna calculate free cash flow

134
00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:12.485
which is basically EBITDA minus capex.

135
00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:15.843
And then you're gonna calculate WACC, W-A-C-C,

136
00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:19.510
meaning, what's the cost of debt and equity.

137
00:06:20.357 --> 00:06:22.563
And then you also gotta know what the risk free rate is,

138
00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:24.419
the market return, the beta, et cetera.

139
00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.410
And then we'll discount that 10 year free cash flow

140
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.876
and a terminal value as well.

141
00:06:29.876 --> 00:06:31.378
Let's move on.

142
00:06:31.378 --> 00:06:34.339
The P to R crutch, price to revenue crutch.

143
00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.434
You forecast the income statement for five years.

144
00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:39.028
You look at revenue in year five.

145
00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:43.811
Then you apply the appropriate sector revenue multiple.

146
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:46.418
Make sure you look at the revenue growth rate

147
00:06:46.418 --> 00:06:48.773
for the comps, too, comparisons.

148
00:06:48.773 --> 00:06:51.410
Then you apple the appropriate price to revenue multiple

149
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.380
in five years.

150
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.924
This is not a finance course, that's why I'm going

151
00:06:55.924 --> 00:06:57.584
through this quickly.

152
00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.578
Lastly, the price to earnings crutch.

153
00:07:00.578 --> 00:07:03.713
You forecast the income statement for five years.

154
00:07:03.713 --> 00:07:06.880
You look at non-GAAP EPS in year five,

155
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.580
meaning pro-forma EPS in year five.

156
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.529
Then you apply the appropriate sector EPS multiple.

157
00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:16.865
And make sure to use the EPS growth rate

158
00:07:16.865 --> 00:07:19.267
that the comps have, too.

159
00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:22.945
Then you apply the multiple to your earnings per share

160
00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:24.028
in year five.
