00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:02.309
If somebody asks a question

2
00:00:02.309 --> 00:00:05.317
and they're nervous, or stumbling a little bit,

3
00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.626
or they have issues finishing the question

4
00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:10.983
that they're asking you, here's what you can do

5
00:00:10.983 --> 00:00:13.878
and this has happened to me a lot as well,

6
00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:16.352
you smile a little bit, not too much,

7
00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:20.160
you smile a little bit, and you nod,

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.268
when they're asking the question,

9
00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:24.545
and this reassures them and helps them out along the way

10
00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.838
and if it's a great question, really a great question,

11
00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:32.005
then I want you to start your answer with great question.
