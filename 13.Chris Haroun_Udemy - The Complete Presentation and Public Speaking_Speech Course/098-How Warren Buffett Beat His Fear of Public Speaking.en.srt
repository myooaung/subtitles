1
00:00:00,644 --> 00:00:04,372
Warren Buffett and I have three things in common.

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:08,479
The first thing is that we both got rejected by HBS

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,605
which is Harvard Business School,

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,114
two thirds of which is BS.

5
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:13,909
I know I've used that joke a lot before

6
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:16,076
but hey, they rejected me.

7
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:19,306
Okay, the second thing that Warren Buffett

8
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:21,724
and I have in common is that we were both

9
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:24,298
absolutely terrified of public speaking, right,

10
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:28,591
and we both took the Dale Carnegie public speaking course

11
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:32,351
at the age of 20, right, and I've got proof.

12
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,741
He took that at 20 as well, right?

13
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,544
So here's the course I took.

14
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:39,175
Back then, books looked really old like this, right?

15
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:40,133
Yeah.

16
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:43,514
So anyway, I took it and just to prove to you

17
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:44,764
that I took it,

18
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:50,609
I got the actual receipt here

19
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,002
and if you want, you can zoom in if you can

20
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,574
and you can calculate my age as well, okay?

21
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:56,802
I took that at 20.

22
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:59,377
Alright, put that away.

23
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:02,815
Okay, so I didn't know who Warren Buffett was obviously

24
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:04,212
when I was 20.

25
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:06,401
I didn't know much then, right,

26
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:09,442
but we both took that Dale Carnegie public speaking course

27
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:10,831
when we were 20, okay,

28
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,017
and my mom and my wife hate the fact

29
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:16,728
that I don't throw anything out at all, right?

30
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:19,418
You'll see from a lot of the props I use in this course

31
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:22,245
I keep everything, right,

32
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:24,006
except for my Wayne Gretzky rookie cards.

33
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:26,513
I use those on my bike so it sounds like a motorbike

34
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:27,495
'cause I'm an idiot.

35
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:28,328
Okay.

36
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,599
Okay and so, oh, by the way,

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,785
if you get a chance,

38
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:35,118
I want you to read this book here, okay?

39
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,838
It's a great book.

40
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:38,671
It's timeless.

41
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:40,599
It was initially published in the 30s, right?

42
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:45,224
It's published by this brilliant man named Dale Carnegie,

43
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:48,534
right, and so Dale Carnegie wrote this book,

44
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:51,122
How To Influence People.

45
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:53,044
That's the book I read, just kidding.

46
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:54,519
How To Win Friends and Influence People.

47
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:57,419
And it's timeless and Warren Buffett loves it as well

48
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:59,176
and he actually wrote this other one too.

49
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:02,409
It's kinda old school but people don't change, right?

50
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,168
So there's been six million copies

51
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:06,256
that have been sold of this version.

52
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:08,803
It's called How To Stop Worrying and Start Living

53
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:10,849
and Dale Carnegie talks about living

54
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:14,934
in day-tight compartments which means one day at a time.

55
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:15,767
Right?

56
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,977
So check it out if you can.

57
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:18,245
I think they're both great reads

58
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:20,095
and Warren Buffett loves it as well.

59
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,751
It's really timeless, it's really timeless, right,

60
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,036
and without Dale Carnegie, you wouldn't have

61
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:27,076
all of these great motivational speakers out there.

62
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:29,160
He was the first, okay?

63
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,532
Okay, so why are you mentioning Dale Carnegie, Chris?

64
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,047
So what?

65
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:38,047
Okay, well, on Warren Buffett's wall

66
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:42,910
is not his business degree from Columbia University, right,

67
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,362
or University of Nebraska, right?

68
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:45,301
He has two degrees.

69
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:50,207
On his wall is actually his public speaking certificate

70
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:52,865
that he earned from Dale Carnegie.

71
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,748
It's pretty amazing.

72
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:58,242
You see, Warren Buffett was terrified of public speaking.

73
00:02:58,242 --> 00:02:59,842
He's just like us, right?

74
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:02,003
He was terrified of public speaking, right,

75
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:05,156
and he said that if he didn't confront his fear,

76
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:08,596
he would not have been successful, okay?

77
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:11,827
Now, the third thing that Warren Buffett

78
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:15,244
and I have in common is a huge admiration

79
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:18,592
for Dr. Martin Luther King,

80
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:22,567
not just what he stood for but his prophetic ability

81
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:25,111
to inspire a crowd, right?

82
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:27,499
He's amazing, he's amazing.

83
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,583
Dr. King's epic I Have a Dream speech

84
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,202
is still the best speech that I've ever seen

85
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:37,261
that's been filmed, right, and that's saying a lot

86
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:41,559
as his I Have a Dream speech was given by Dr. King

87
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:45,935
more than 50 years ago, on August 28th 1963.

88
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,162
Incredible.

89
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:51,409
Nobody comes close to delivering a speech like Dr. King did,

90
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,788
right, and it's not just the brilliant content

91
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:56,727
of his message but it's the prophetic,

92
00:03:56,727 --> 00:04:00,527
perfect and passionate delivery that he has, okay?

93
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,198
It's genius.

94
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,210
So please watch it here, right,

95
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,968
if you haven't seen it in the past few weeks,

96
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,563
months or years, okay?

97
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:11,133
The way he changes his tone and his voice

98
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,800
really touches your heart, okay?

99
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:19,425
Now, Warren Buffett's favorite line from a Dr. King speech

100
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:23,960
was when he said, "we shall overcome

101
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,342
"and that scaffold swayed the future", okay?

102
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:30,375
"We shall overcome and that scaffold swayed the future."

103
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,793
Right, so it's really poetic and prophetic

104
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,798
and I'm actually getting butterflies

105
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:37,371
just thinking of this, okay?

106
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:40,990
And so Dr. King's delivery and confident

107
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,302
changing tone is really a work of art.

108
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:46,574
It's a masterpiece, okay,

109
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:49,840
and so this next speech here by Dr. King

110
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,844
is really worth listening to as well

111
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:54,786
and you'll hear him use those powerful words

112
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:56,298
that he created the epic

113
00:04:56,298 --> 00:05:00,565
scaffold swayed the future quote here, okay?

114
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:03,564
And there's so many incredible parts to his speech

115
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:06,882
just like "the arc of the moral universe", right?

116
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:08,351
That's what he says as well, right?

117
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,313
It's amazing, it's amazing.

118
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:13,825
So I mean, I personally forget about citing poets

119
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:17,240
like Robert Frost or the writings of Shakespeare.

120
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,819
We should all spend more time

121
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,462
studying Dr. King's speeches for some many reasons, okay?

122
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:26,001
Now, Warren Buffett was so scared, this is funny,

123
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:27,517
he was so scared of public speaking

124
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:31,078
that he didn't wear glasses at his wedding

125
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:32,508
when he gave his speech

126
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:35,413
so he wouldn't have to see the crowd, right?

127
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:38,524
You see, Warren Buffett ran to his fear and confronted it

128
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:42,691
and if he didn't, we wouldn't know who he is today.

129
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,504
So you have to please run to your fears

130
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:47,510
and confront them right now

131
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,188
and turn any perceived weakness into a strength.

132
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:52,299
Why?

133
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:54,842
Because your competition certainly won't, okay?

134
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,727
This is holding you back, okay?

135
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,690
This is holding you back between where you are now

136
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,612
and greatness, okay, and Warren Buffett said that

137
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,782
learning how to embrace public speaking

138
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,567
and not fearing it changed his life

139
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,057
and Warren Buffett's really interesting

140
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:11,893
from a public speaking perspective

141
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,593
because he's so likable when he presents

142
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:16,404
and when he's being interviewed

143
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:19,677
because he is number one, personal, right?

144
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,215
Number two, he's self-deprecating.

145
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,521
He makes fun of himself, right,

146
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,764
and number three, he talks about what scared him

147
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:28,383
which is public speaking, right?

148
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:30,061
He's human.

149
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,660
And I suppose if somebody showed the opposite

150
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,611
of those three items I just mentioned

151
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,639
when speaking in an interview,

152
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,904
they wouldn't be nearly as likable, right?

153
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:43,943
So should you take the Dale Carnegie course?

154
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:47,419
Well, if you want to practice in front of people, right,

155
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,674
lots of people then yes, take it

156
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,310
'cause I always humbly believe

157
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,485
that an investment in yourself

158
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:56,474
is the best investment you will ever make, right,

159
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:58,905
and I cut a lot of lawns when I was a kid

160
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:00,214
to pay for the course, right?

161
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:01,644
It was a bit pricey when I was 20.

162
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:05,018
I remember it took me a while, okay, it took me a while.

163
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:08,903
It's worth it though and if it's available in your town,

164
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:11,234
it's available all over the world by the way, right,

165
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:12,994
and you can also search online

166
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:15,159
for what's called Toastmasters

167
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:18,470
or other public speaking in-class courses

168
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,186
where you live if you wanna practice

169
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:23,084
in front of a lot of people, right, but here's what I say.

170
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:25,699
I say challenge yourself.

171
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,296
I want you to dare yourself

172
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:29,429
and run to your fear by volunteering

173
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:33,107
to please speak at work or at religious events

174
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:34,917
or whatever, at school events

175
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:38,026
or other organizations, charities, et cetera, okay,

176
00:07:38,026 --> 00:07:40,433
'cause that's really a great way to practice, okay,

177
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:43,100
and I wanna end act five, right,

178
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:47,751
with you watching these four very short videos

179
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:51,470
