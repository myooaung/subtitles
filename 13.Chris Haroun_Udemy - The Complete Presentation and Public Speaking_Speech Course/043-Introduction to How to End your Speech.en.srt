1
00:00:01,236 --> 00:00:05,048
Business presentations usually end with a conclusion,

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,715
next steps, or a call to action.

3
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:12,617
Personal or award receiving presentations

4
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:14,938
often end with thanking people,

5
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:17,717
which we'll cover in two lectures from now,

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,489
not the next lecture, the one after that.

7
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,201
We will also cover the presentation Q and A strategy

8
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,383
in Act Seven.

9
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:28,122
So in the next few lectures,

10
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:30,245
I'm going to explain many different ways

11
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:32,440
to end your speech,

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,284
and please feel free to use one of the strategies I mention,

13
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:40,356
or combine a couple of them.

14
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:44,681
For example, instead of just ending with a conclusion,

15
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:47,945
you can also end with thanking people,

16
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,695
giving credit to others, asking for the sale,

17
00:00:52,617 --> 00:00:54,874
or networking by asking people

18
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:57,689
to connect with you on LinkedIn, et cetera.
