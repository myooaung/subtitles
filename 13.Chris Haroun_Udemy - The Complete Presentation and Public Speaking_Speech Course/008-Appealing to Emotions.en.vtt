1
00:00:01.404 --> 00:00:05.226
Great movies, great commercials and great presentations

2
00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:07.320
appeal to emotions (thuds fist on chest).

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.796
You set the tone and the soundtrack for your life

4
00:00:10.796 --> 00:00:14.082
and for your presentations, okay, and we'll talk about music

5
00:00:14.082 --> 00:00:17.469
and presentations in act four, scene two.

6
00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:20.558
Okay, so in your presentation I want you

7
00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:23.409
to think of certain emotions

8
00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:26.014
that you want to appeal to.

9
00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:30.858
I want you to be passionate and inspirational and creative,

10
00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:33.894
not just with your slides, but with the content

11
00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:38.120
and how you articulate and structure your thoughts.

12
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.169
So think about the first time you heard a song

13
00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:45.582
that made the hair on the back of your neck wanna stand up.

14
00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:49.749
Okay, think of how that awesome sonic architecture

15
00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:52.887
made you feel inspired, optimistic,

16
00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.948
full of hope and unstoppable.

17
00:00:55.948 --> 00:00:57.762
Okay, emotions.

18
00:00:57.762 --> 00:01:01.542
Think of the time in your life when you were surrounded

19
00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:04.542
by loved ones at maximum exuberance.

20
00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:08.688
Think of that epic moment in your life

21
00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:11.457
and replicate how you felt,

22
00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:13.485
how your loved ones felt,

23
00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:15.568
how your colleagues felt.

24
00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:19.767
I want you to recreate that moment in your mind

25
00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:23.320
so you can not only appeal to emotions when you present,

26
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.260
but also feel it (thuds fist on chest) in your heart,

27
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.427
your mind, your soul, in every cell that makes you.

28
00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:36.049
And so my personal example is two events,

29
00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.549
one was in 1993 when I was with my friends

30
00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:44.455
and Joe Carter hit a home run to win the World Series

31
00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:46.817
for my baseball team, the Toronto Blue Jays.

32
00:01:46.817 --> 00:01:50.417
Okay, and the other moment for me was more recently,

33
00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:54.615
a couple years ago, in 2015, when my three sons and I

34
00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:58.605
lost our voices because Jose Bautista,

35
00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:00.191
our favorite baseball player,

36
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:04.358
hit a home run and we couldn't contain our enthusiasms.

37
00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:10.194
So, think of an event you personally defied the odds

38
00:02:10.194 --> 00:02:12.768
and surprised everyone, especially yourself,

39
00:02:12.768 --> 00:02:14.637
because an accomplishment in your life.

40
00:02:14.637 --> 00:02:19.286
Okay, now I mention all this because without passion

41
00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:21.425
in our hearts and in our minds

42
00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:25.156
when we present, we can't reach our full potential

43
00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:28.462
and we can't inspire others, okay?

44
00:02:28.462 --> 00:02:31.613
Now, some of you are watching this and thinking,

45
00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:33.446
"Wait a second, Chris,

46
00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:39.536
"my company is so conservative I can't be different,

47
00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:43.291
"I have to conform to the corporate culture here."

48
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.208
Well, my humble challenging response is no more

49
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.759
and never again, no more conforming,

50
00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.831
you know, no more suppressing emotions,

51
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.391
you know, no more suppressing who you are,

52
00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:02.308
no more not being you, no more and never again.

53
00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:06.745
You have friends and those that love you

54
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.294
because of who you are and your emotions, right?

55
00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:13.339
Those people love you because you are you,

56
00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.892
no more presenting and not being you ever again, okay?

57
00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:20.295
Otherwise what's the point,

58
00:03:20.295 --> 00:03:22.263
what are we here for anyway, right?

59
00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:25.887
Don't try to be someone else, be you, okay?

60
00:03:25.887 --> 00:03:29.366
I want you inspire and empower your audience

61
00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:31.702
who are your friends, okay, they love you,

62
00:03:31.702 --> 00:03:34.334
they love you for who you are

63
00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:36.999
and not for who you're tryin' to be.

64
00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.598
Now, as a quick side note,

65
00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:43.246
if you're having problems getting into an inspirational

66
00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:45.337
or great emotional (snaps fingers) state

67
00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:48.365
to write your masterpiece of a speech

68
00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:50.079
listen to this in the background

69
00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.202
or any classical music that is inspiring.

70
00:03:53.202 --> 00:03:55.006
You know, sometimes I like to,

71
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:57.174
I just go to Spotify and listen

72
00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:58.796
to what are called Soundscapes,

73
00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:02.395
which is just music from, classical music in a words,

74
00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:04.450
from awesome movies, right?

75
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.796
You know, scores or musical pieces that really inspire me

76
00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:10.495
are movies like Interstellar,

77
00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.762
listen to that soundtrack, it is off the charts, right?

78
00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:18.060
Or a great baseball one for me is the movie The Natural,

79
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.771
where Robert Redford hits this incredible home run

80
00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:25.112
at a very old age and the music in the background,

81
00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:27.995
you know, it just really makes the movie, right?

82
00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:32.115
So listen to music like that, Soundscapes, if you want,

83
00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:34.692
or classical music that would get you

84
00:04:34.692 --> 00:04:37.017
into that frame of mind or even something peaceful

85
00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:40.467
and relaxing and Enya, whatever it takes, okay?

86
00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.797
Now, it's crucial to tap into the right emotions

87
00:04:43.797 --> 00:04:46.825
when you present, this is what Bollywood

88
00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:50.242
and Hollywood films do really well, okay?

89
00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:55.242
I love this scene from Pixar's Ratatouille

90
00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:59.959
where the chef, who is me and who is you,

91
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.804
prepares the ultimate food presentation

92
00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:06.460
and appeals to emotions of a difficult man,

93
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.732
okay, appeals to emotions of that customer, okay?

94
00:05:09.732 --> 00:05:12.973
You know, this man, this customer is so hard

95
00:05:12.973 --> 00:05:15.232
to get through to that you will never

96
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.699
have to present anyone this difficult emotionally

97
00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.897
or emotionally communicate with them

98
00:05:19.897 --> 00:05:22.421
and this strict food critic loved

99
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.714
the restaurant presentation experience

100
00:05:24.714 --> 00:05:28.047
only because it reminded him of his life

101
00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:32.614
and the food his mom used to cook for him.

102
00:05:32.614 --> 00:05:36.089
You see, the chef appealed to emotion.

103
00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.448
Okay, so pause me please and check out this video

104
00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:43.594
as it's incredibly touching emotionally.

105
00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:47.011
(beautiful classy music)

106
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.514
Okay, and when I say that you and me are the chef

107
00:05:51.514 --> 00:05:54.606
I'm not saying you're a rat, I just am.

108
00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:56.039
Okay, whatever, sorry.

109
00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.206
Okay, now, I wanna also talk about experiences of yours

110
00:06:01.238 --> 00:06:06.106
that address emotions and examples from your life, okay?

111
00:06:06.106 --> 00:06:08.115
Another Pixar example here, it's relevant,

112
00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:09.162
remember the So What test?

113
00:06:09.162 --> 00:06:10.380
It's relevant.

114
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.713
In 2008 I met a guy that worked at Pixar

115
00:06:15.324 --> 00:06:19.736
and I asked him what movie are you working on now

116
00:06:19.736 --> 00:06:22.118
and he said, "Well, Chris, we're making this film

117
00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:25.535
"about this older man and this little kid

118
00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:30.359
"and they use balloons to pick up a house

119
00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:33.474
"and they travel somewhere."

120
00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:36.141
And I remember at that time how foolish I was

121
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:38.974
'cause I said this, right, I said,

122
00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:41.315
why would you do that,

123
00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:44.355
that's an absolute merchandising nightmare,

124
00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:46.178
you'll never be able to sell toys like that.

125
00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:49.286
You know,, why would you do this, right?

126
00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:52.453
And he said, "At Pixar we don't care,"

127
00:06:53.702 --> 00:06:55.349
but he said it in a nice way,

128
00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:59.079
he said, "We make movies from our hearts

129
00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:02.075
"that appeal to emotions, real emotions,"

130
00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:04.914
and now Up is actually my favorite Pixar movie.

131
00:07:04.914 --> 00:07:07.600
And one of my favorite soundtracks as well,

132
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.667
it's a great piece, I love it, I love it,

133
00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:12.510
I think it's the best, probably the best Pixar

134
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.677
they've ever made, in my humble opinion, okay.

135
00:07:14.677 --> 00:07:17.756
So, why am I bothering you with this, so what?

136
00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:21.425
Because I want you to know that appealing to emotions

137
00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:23.475
is important when you present,

138
00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:26.302
you know, whether it's a wedding presentation

139
00:07:26.302 --> 00:07:28.948
or a less happy occasion,

140
00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.958
or a company speech, a toast,

141
00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.214
and many other types of speeches.

142
00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:38.770
Okay, last Pixar mention, I promise,

143
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.665
but if you have a moment, please, please, please watch

144
00:07:42.665 --> 00:07:46.473
this short video here and feel the emotional

145
00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:50.640
and think about how you might be able to somehow incorporate

146
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.253
a few emotions into your masterpiece of a speech

147
00:07:57.253 --> 00:07:59.261
from this masterpiece

148
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:02.740
of an emotional rollercoaster of a scene.

149
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.907
So, again, watch this video and then please come back to me.

150
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:12.894
Now, welcome back.

151
00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:17.061
Did you notice how many emotions you felt during that video?

152
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.242
The amazing thing is there wasn't even one word

153
00:08:23.242 --> 00:08:24.825
spoken in it, okay?

154
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:30.978
That was a beautiful story told without words, okay?

155
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:36.475
We can visualize and feel emotions by discussing

156
00:08:36.475 --> 00:08:40.967
personal anecdotes or relevant examples in our speech

157
00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:45.134
from real examples in our lives, keep it real, you be you.

158
00:08:46.306 --> 00:08:49.281
Now, I'm not saying to create

159
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:51.098
a four-minute emotional rollercoaster

160
00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:53.280
exactly like that video,

161
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.015
but small 20 seconds of sound bites (snaps fingers)

162
00:08:57.015 --> 00:09:00.610
or stories or personal examples of yours

163
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.299
really help to add astounding character development

164
00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:09.607
or descriptive divinity or whatever you might call it.

165
00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:13.254
People might not remember what you said

166
00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:15.951
but they'll never forget how you made them feel.
