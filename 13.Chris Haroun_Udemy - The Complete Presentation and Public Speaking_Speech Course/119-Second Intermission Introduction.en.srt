(dramatic music)

2
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:10,580
Welcome to the second of three intermissions.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,340
In each of the intermissions we're going to have

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,139
a presentation by you and then we will critique it,

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,580
to make sure it's absolutely perfect,

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,381
so that you're ready on game day.

7
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:22,911
I strongly recommend, please,

8
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:24,525
completing all three intermissions

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,900
as you work your way through the courses,

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,362
because I want you to please notice

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,652
how you're progressing and how much better

12
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:35,652
your presentation becomes throughout the course.

13
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:39,744
And so the first part of this intermission

14
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:43,911
is a presentation exercise, which is the very next lecture.

15
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,802
The second part of this intermission

16
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:52,521
is an exercise critiquing the presentation that you gave.

17
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:56,004
And the third part, of this intermission

18
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:59,253
is comparing how you just did

19
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,719
on your second intermission presentation

20
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,518
with how you did during the first intermission presentation.

21
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:06,353
Okay?

22
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:09,302
And the fourth part here is going to be a discussion

23
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,475
and a critique of one of my presentations,

24
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,642
which I gave to a company.

25
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:19,925
And don't worry if all this stuff sounds complicated,

26
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:23,242
as I'm gonna walk you through every single step.

27
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:24,355
I'll see you in the next lecture.

28
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:25,188
Thanks.
