1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,039
Let's talk about minimalism.

2
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:04,859
Less is more.

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,692
Simplicity works best.

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,989
Making slides that have minimal detail on them

5
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:12,589
is not for every occasion

6
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,378
as complex software program

7
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,577
or engineering related presentations

8
00:00:16,577 --> 00:00:19,509
can be tough to minimalize, okay?

9
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:23,342
But you can do it and it's actually less work.

10
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:27,171
It's easier to understand as well, okay.

11
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:29,149
And just as a side note.

12
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:33,160
I'm gonna explain how to articulate more complex topics

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,248
in the case study section of this act

14
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:38,709
when we talk about using animation to build upon

15
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:41,679
and explain very complex topics.

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,958
But when it comes to minimalism,

17
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:47,451
I wanna stress that I really believe that less is more

18
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,598
in business communications

19
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:50,880
and I want you to really try hard

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,080
to never have more than three bullet points on a slide

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,619
because we just can't retain more than three things

22
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,036
at a time, right?

23
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,520
It is what it is

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,120
and so try to experiment with even less than three ideas

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,867
on a slide if you can.

26
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,960
Simplicity works extraordinarily well, right?

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,349
And we're conditioned

28
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,028
to not read instruction manuals anymore

29
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:19,979
or to hit that F1 key on a keyboard for help, right?

30
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,840
My kids don't even know what that means F1, right?

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,379
The way it works now is if it's not intuitive

32
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,817
then you gotta rethink it please.

33
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:29,283
Just keep it simple.

34
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:33,035
Kinda like this device that Steve Jobs pioneered.

35
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,055
It's just got one button, right?

36
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:37,325
There's no instruction manual on how to use this.

37
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:40,102
And I used to be a software programmer for years

38
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,824
and we used to create these complex

39
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:46,096
client server-based applications, right?

40
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:49,013
But what's happened is in software,

41
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:53,195
all you gotta know how to use is a browser.

42
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:56,024
Forward, back, home, stop, refresh.

43
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:57,355
That's it, right?

44
00:01:57,355 --> 00:02:00,332
You never really have to learn how to use a website, right?

45
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:03,905
If it's not intuitive then people won't pay attention

46
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,436
so if it's not intuitive,

47
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:07,876
please rethink your slide structure.

48
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:09,396
Just keep it simple, right?

49
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,563
And use simple language as well, okay?

50
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:16,724
Steve Jobs was amazing at this, right?

51
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:21,503
He used to use words like insanely great on his slides.

52
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:25,503
And one online magazine company that I wrote for

53
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:30,043
actually asked me to write at an eighth grade level.

54
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:30,985
I know it sounds out there,

55
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,425
but I guess minimalism works, right?

56
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:37,235
And you wanna cast your net as wide as you can.

57
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:40,945
And so minimalism on slides is very effective too

58
00:02:40,945 --> 00:02:44,361
when it comes to showing contrast

59
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,694
like in these sample slides.
