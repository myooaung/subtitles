00:00:00.835 --> 00:00:03.177
I love using my hands when I present.

2
00:00:03.177 --> 00:00:05.055
Quite often I only use one hand

3
00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:09.222
as the other hand is holding this little clicker here, okay?

4
00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:13.379
If I have to hold a microphone in one hand,

5
00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.817
then I make sure it's close enough to my mouth,

6
00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:16.943
make sure you do that, right.

7
00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:18.169
I've actually made a lot of mistakes

8
00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.889
in speeches where it's too far away.

9
00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:21.786
Right, make sure it's up here, okay?

10
00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:24.385
But if I do that I have the clicker in the other hand,

11
00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:27.146
right and I actually use this clicker hand

12
00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:30.841
for body language when I'm talking, right,

13
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.810
when I'm talking.

14
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.116
Anyway.

15
00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.446
We're gonna cover non-hand-based body language

16
00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:38.293
later in the current scene, okay?

17
00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:42.728
But I like to point out slides,

18
00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:44.193
and never at the audience

19
00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:46.115
as it could come across as arrogant,

20
00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:49.492
I'm talking to you, like that, okay?

21
00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:52.451
And as mentioned earlier in the course

22
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.931
if you're presenting in other countries,

23
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:56.642
practice in front of somebody familiar

24
00:00:56.642 --> 00:01:00.394
with the dos and don'ts of that culture, okay?

25
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:04.561
You know, for example, a thumbs-up works in many countries

26
00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:08.445
but less so in other regions like the Middle East.

27
00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:11.129
You know, when I give presentations in Dubai

28
00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:13.912
I try not to use gestures like that, okay?

29
00:01:13.912 --> 00:01:16.993
Okay, moving on to using the laser pointer, right?

30
00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:18.238
And I don't know if this is gonna work,

31
00:01:18.238 --> 00:01:20.487
so I'll just point it had my hand here, right.

32
00:01:20.487 --> 00:01:22.094
I love laser pointers, right.

33
00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:23.186
You can see that green, right?

34
00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:24.739
I don't know if you can see it on the back there.

35
00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:28.914
Anyway, I love laser pointers.

36
00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:32.322
I like to use the ones that are green, right,

37
00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:35.204
because red is not the best color to use

38
00:01:35.204 --> 00:01:37.556
in many countries, right?

39
00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:38.965
Red kind of means urgent, right?

40
00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.594
And I've actually been criticized

41
00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:44.119
by some of my UTME students for using red font

42
00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.559
in some speeches, right, in some of my courses,

43
00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:48.417
so I got rid of a lot of that, right.

44
00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:51.159
So, you know, customer's always right.

45
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.688
Anyway, so I love using a pointer, right,

46
00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:56.159
if I have to point at something,

47
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.724
and again, green is kind of a cool one to use.

48
00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:00.080
Obviously you don't point it into the crowd

49
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.528
because you can blind somebody.

50
00:02:02.528 --> 00:02:03.361
Is that working?

51
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:04.194
You see that on your face?

52
00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:05.027
There you go, I got you a little bit there.

53
00:02:05.027 --> 00:02:05.860
Sorry.

54
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.321
Okay.

55
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.590
Okay, it's just prepare and be aware, k?

56
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.511
And the safest color to use in most countries

57
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:15.623
is apparently not green, it's blue, right,

58
00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:17.905
and I googled it, therefore it must be true

59
00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:18.790
as a reference, right?

60
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.389
But apparently blue is the safest color

61
00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.464
to use for fonts, okay?

62
00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:24.138
And again, practice with somebody

63
00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:26.058
that's familiar with the local customs.

64
00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:27.535
Thank you, okay.

65
00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:30.929
Now, when you point it at the screen, right,

66
00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.009
say this is here is the screen

67
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.709
and I have, you know, slides up here, right?

68
00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.573
Don't turn your back to the audience completely, right,

69
00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:41.996
as it can be insulting, right?

70
00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:43.715
It can be insulting, right?

71
00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:45.581
Just kind of turn sideways,

72
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:47.717
and you get to practice it a lot too, right?

73
00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:51.526
And I like to make a fist too to express something

74
00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:53.154
that I'm passionate about, right.

75
00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:53.987
It's just me.

76
00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:58.154
And like my son I like to dream big,

77
00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:03.283
and I use a wide array of hand gestures.

78
00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.080
That being said here are three hand gestures

79
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.268
that are worth avoiding, okay?

80
00:03:09.268 --> 00:03:11.774
Number one, avoid crossing your arms

81
00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:15.116
as it shows that you are potentially close-minded

82
00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:18.787
or too confident, right?

83
00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:19.920
Another one is this.

84
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.307
Try to avoid putting your hands in your pocket,

85
00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:27.170
I should say, as it shows that you're not really

86
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.917
taking this presentation seriously enough,

87
00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:33.271
and it's a cultural no-no

88
00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:36.594
in some countries as well, okay?

89
00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:38.066
Yeah, okay.

90
00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:39.457
And then lastly, avoid putting your hands

91
00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:42.882
on your hips as this could show that you're,

92
00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:44.248
I don't know, you're kind of arrogant, whatever.

93
00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:46.113
You know, it is what it is.

94
00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:47.923
And then just given social media,

95
00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:50.739
every appearance is crucial, okay?

96
00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:51.572
Everything you do

97
00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:55.254
because just one picture of you

98
00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:56.817
presenting with you hands on your hips,

99
00:03:56.817 --> 00:03:59.219
even if it's for a split second, right,

100
00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.949
it gets tweeted immediately, right?

101
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.826
And it can dilute the underlying presentation content

102
00:04:04.826 --> 00:04:06.275
or message, right?

103
00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.823
And all people will remember is the picture

104
00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:11.545
of you, you know, potentially being too confident.
