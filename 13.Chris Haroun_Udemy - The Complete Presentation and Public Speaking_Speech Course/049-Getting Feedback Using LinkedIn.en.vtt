00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:04.503
Do enough people like our speech content?

2
00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:07.139
We want to be sure that we are very happy

3
00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.399
with the content before we start creating

4
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.218
our slides in Act Four, or before we start working

5
00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:15.350
on our delivery in Act Number Six.

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.517
So how can we get feedback from many people for free

7
00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:24.315
on the content or script of our speech?

8
00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.978
Well, the easiest way to do it

9
00:00:26.978 --> 00:00:29.835
is to share your speech content over LinkedIn

10
00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:33.661
by publishing your speech script as an article on LinkedIn,

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.780
and then checking out to see if there's a decent

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.141
enough number of views, or likes on the article,

13
00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.027
relative to other articles that you might

14
00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:45.033
have personally published.

15
00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.956
And so as a quick side note, if you need help

16
00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:52.123
on how to write a great online article, please watch this.

17
00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:58.654
Okay, when you write a script or article version

18
00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:02.663
of your speech, please do your best

19
00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:06.029
to only have three sentences per paragraph

20
00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:09.615
as we won't have more than three bullet points

21
00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:11.800
on any particular slide anyway

22
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.123
when we make our slides during Act Four

23
00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:17.495
of this presentation course.

24
00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:21.940
I published my preliminary TEDx talk script on LinkedIn

25
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.190
in order to get feedback, and a lot of people are shy,

26
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.250
or don't want to comment on an article,

27
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.378
so sometimes I'll ask friends of mine

28
00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:35.457
to read my LinkedIn posts, and then send me a message

29
00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:37.207
telling me their thoughts.

30
00:01:37.207 --> 00:01:40.641
In fact, it's interesting, I never send an article

31
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.626
to my Udemy students ever until I first

32
00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:47.518
see how the article does, and if it gets

33
00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.522
a positive reception on LinkedIn

34
00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.856
as I want to make sure that I really try

35
00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:57.727
my best to add value to you as your time is precious,

36
00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:00.564
and I sincerely appreciate, and I'm always grateful

37
00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:02.533
for your time.

38
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.597
So here's an example of a failure of mine

39
00:02:05.597 --> 00:02:08.259
when it comes to posting articles online.

40
00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.231
I wrote an article on LinkedIn

41
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:13.155
about how a Hall of Fame baseball player

42
00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:15.535
didn't pitch for one day every week,

43
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:19.964
and how this was smart as he was able to rest,

44
00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:21.868
and not burn out.

45
00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:25.905
Now I only got about 60 views on the article

46
00:02:25.905 --> 00:02:28.566
because not everybody is a huge baseball fan like I am,

47
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:32.662
and so I misjudged who my target audience was.

48
00:02:32.662 --> 00:02:36.412
So per this video, you can see how many views

49
00:02:38.747 --> 00:02:41.739
my articles get relative to my other articles.

50
00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.857
So my T or T.E.A. article got more than four times

51
00:02:45.857 --> 00:02:49.894
as many view as my Sandy Koufax baseball article,

52
00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:52.351
and it's actually really interesting to see

53
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:56.518
what LinkedIn posts of yours, or mine get more views

54
00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.482
than our other ones, and I actually play around

55
00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:02.469
with the titles and images a lot,

56
00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.253
and sometimes a LinkedIn post of mine

57
00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:08.357
will get barely any views, and then all I do

58
00:03:08.357 --> 00:03:12.256
is I change the title, and or the image,

59
00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:14.239
and then it gets a lot of clicks,

60
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.800
and it took me awhile to learn this,

61
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.985
but after awhile you kind of understand

62
00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:22.764
what sells and what doesn't sell.

63
00:03:22.764 --> 00:03:26.096
And so I changed the title and the image,

64
00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:28.334
but I left the content exactly the same

65
00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:30.822
for one of my articles.

66
00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:32.244
It's the one with Bill Gates here,

67
00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:35.047
the picture on it, and I got no views

68
00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:36.886
until I added a picture of Bill Gates,

69
00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:38.370
or hardly any views.

70
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.594
Anyway, going on.

71
00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.653
A bit off topic here, so what Chris, (so what sound effect)

72
00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:43.736
but it's important for me to stress this

73
00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.680
as putting in the right images

74
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.847
can help you a lot when you create a presentation.

75
00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.992
And the same thing can be said about the titles

76
00:03:53.992 --> 00:03:57.019
of your speech if you need a title that is.

77
00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.008
And so the bottom line here is that

78
00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:03.836
your LinkedIn contacts are your personal focus group

79
00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:07.919
for feedback on the content of your presentation.
