00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:03.568
Preparing the delivery using body language

2
00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:06.537
is often very much overlooked.

3
00:00:06.537 --> 00:00:09.832
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.

4
00:00:09.832 --> 00:00:11.692
And so, start with a smile

5
00:00:11.692 --> 00:00:13.896
unless it's inappropriate to smile

6
00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:16.040
for the speech you're giving.

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.916
In act number 11, we're gonna talk about

8
00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:20.976
25 different types of speeches to give,

9
00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:24.209
and a few of them, smiling is not appropriate.

10
00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:25.218
And in act eight,

11
00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:28.076
we'll discuss how to prepare for presentations.

12
00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:31.490
And if you're giving a speech in another country,

13
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.728
we're gonna talk about how to prepare,

14
00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:37.811
as not all body language works in all countries.
