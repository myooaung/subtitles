1
00:00:00.664 --> 00:00:02.573
Now that we understand

2
00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:05.980
how to make powerful content for our presentations,

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.677
we can discuss how to make the slides for our speech.

4
00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:12.215
And so, welcome to act number four,

5
00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:15.727
which is all about making your slides.

6
00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:18.742
In this act, there's gonna be four different scenes.

7
00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:20.286
In act four, scene one,

8
00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.912
we're gonna to talk about

9
00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:26.079
creating the slides and discussing what software to use.

10
00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:29.597
In act four, scene two, we're gonna learn about

11
00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:32.157
how to add and manipulate images.

12
00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.717
It's really easy and a lot of fun.

13
00:00:34.717 --> 00:00:36.931
In act four, scene three, we're gonna learn

14
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:39.930
how to add videos and other content.

15
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.820
And then in act four, scene number four, we're gonna discuss

16
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.274
case studies on how I made the slides

17
00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:49.054
for 10 different speaking occasions

18
00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:52.493
using many of the concepts and software products

19
00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:55.173
that we discuss in this act.

20
00:00:55.173 --> 00:00:57.994
And so the 10 case studies where I'll be giving

21
00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:01.493
you all of the slides as attachments if applicable,

22
00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:03.489
are as follows.

23
00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.949
Case study number one, my TEDx talk slides.

24
00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:08.476
Okay, I'm gonna give you an explanation

25
00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:10.422
and the slides will be attached, okay?

26
00:01:10.422 --> 00:01:13.254
We already talked about critiquing my TEDx talk

27
00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:16.240
in the last section which was intermission,

28
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.142
so this time I'm just going to talk

29
00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:20.442
about how to make the slides,

30
00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:22.878
or how I made those slides from that presentation,

31
00:01:22.878 --> 00:01:24.616
and I actually used a couple of different

32
00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:26.757
software products, it wasn't just PowerPoint,

33
00:01:26.757 --> 00:01:29.085
there are others, too, okay?

34
00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:31.870
The other nine case studies are as follows.

35
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.415
And again, I'm gonna explain

36
00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:37.289
how I made the slides if applicable

37
00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.930
for these case studies later on in act number four.

38
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.729
So the other nine case studies are as follows.

39
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.903
Again, I'm gonna explain how to do it.

40
00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:50.428
Case study number two is my introduction to

41
00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:53.009
finance and accounting course.

42
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.899
And I use a lot of, I had a lot of fun with this,

43
00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.723
I used PowToons and other cool products for it.

44
00:01:58.723 --> 00:02:02.406
Case study number three is what finance job,

45
00:02:02.406 --> 00:02:06.233
which was another one of my courses, here on Udemy,

46
00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:08.421
and I'm gonna show you how I used Prezi

47
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.530
and a bunch of other cool applications to make that.

48
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.949
Very easy.

49
00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:16.407
Case study number four is my foreign language MBA.

50
00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:18.688
I translated one of my courses

51
00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:19.965
into a lot of different languages.

52
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.748
I'm gonna show you the software I used

53
00:02:21.748 --> 00:02:23.807
to make those presentation slides.

54
00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.379
Case study number five,

55
00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.836
I have a free course, please take it if you can, okay?

56
00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:31.437
It's called My 40 Teaching Tips.

57
00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:34.363
I'm gonna teach you how I made the promo for that.

58
00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:35.374
It was a lot of fun.

59
00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:36.252
I really liked it,

60
00:02:36.252 --> 00:02:39.602
and that course, if you're interested in teaching online,

61
00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:41.701
it's a free course,

62
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:44.708
and I discuss 40 mistakes I made, that sort of thing,

63
00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:45.613
so you can,

64
00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:47.622
again, work smarter not harder if you want to each online.

65
00:02:47.622 --> 00:02:48.622
Okay, sorry.

66
00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:52.127
And then case study number six is going to be

67
00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:55.460
a presentation that I gave to a company.

68
00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:58.248
Moving on to case number seven,

69
00:02:58.248 --> 00:03:01.710
we're gonna talk about my venture capital conference,

70
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.800
I'm gonna talk about the slides,

71
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.663
and how I created them.

72
00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:08.421
Then in case number eight, we're gonna talk about

73
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:10.232
making course images.

74
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:13.062
How do you make images for courses here on Udemy?

75
00:03:13.062 --> 00:03:14.716
There's a bunch of software products that I use.

76
00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:16.201
It's real easy, really fun.

77
00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:17.392
You'll love it.

78
00:03:17.392 --> 00:03:19.880
Case study number nine, I'll talk about how I made a promo

79
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.659
for one of my other courses.

80
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.598
And then, case study number 10,

81
00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:27.320
we'll talk about just making videos,

82
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.153
for your presentation,

83
00:03:31.224 --> 00:03:34.014
for a wedding or business speeches, etc.

84
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.216
It's a lot of fun.

85
00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:38.147
And by this time you start act number five in this course,

86
00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:41.501
you're gonna be armed with many innovative and powerful

87
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.638
and fun to use slide creation applications.

88
00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:48.239
And we're gonna create an artistic masterpiece

89
00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.460
with our slides,

90
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.957
and please enjoy the slide creation process

91
00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:56.468
as we don't really get to be creative too often

92
00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:57.468
in business.

93
00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:03.191
Now, in terms of the what, why, and how of act number four,

94
00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:06.712
we're gonna cover how to design and create

95
00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:08.841
incredible slides, images, animations,

96
00:04:08.841 --> 00:04:10.715
and additional presentation materials

97
00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:12.582
for our presentations.

98
00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:14.154
And I'm gonna expose you

99
00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:17.959
to many different software products.

100
00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.912
Many different ones, in order to help you kinda

101
00:04:19.912 --> 00:04:21.760
make your amazing slides.

102
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.370
It's my job to give you a menu,

103
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.723
and you choose what you want to use.

104
00:04:26.723 --> 00:04:28.794
Why are covering many types of applications,

105
00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:31.518
aside from Powerpoint, Keynote, and Google Slides?

106
00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:34.101
Because, I want you to be ready

107
00:04:35.054 --> 00:04:37.008
to use another application

108
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:38.732
if you have to do something very innovative

109
00:04:38.732 --> 00:04:41.599
that's not covered in those three aforementioned products,

110
00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.322
Powerpoint, Keynote, and Google Slides.

111
00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:47.700
And you might even want to use more than one

112
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.633
software application to create your slides,

113
00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:51.690
which I do a lot,

114
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.331
and again, I'll give you plenty of examples.

115
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.432
Okay, so we talked about the what of this act.

116
00:04:57.432 --> 00:05:00.298
So, how are we gonna do all of this?

117
00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:02.773
Well, in each lesson of this act,

118
00:05:02.773 --> 00:05:04.522
which is act four,

119
00:05:04.522 --> 00:05:08.722
I'm gonna discuss important slides creation concepts,

120
00:05:08.722 --> 00:05:10.972
and then I will discuss how

121
00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:15.212
I made the slides for that particular lecture

122
00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:18.070
immediately after each lecture,

123
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.737
in an optional how-to lesson per this image.

124
00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:26.366
You can even download these slides

125
00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:28.184
and play around with them

126
00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:30.178
or just use some parts of them

127
00:05:30.178 --> 00:05:33.061
to make your own presentations if you want to,

128
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:37.154
as I really want to help you work smarter and not harder.

129
00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:41.680
And again, we will have a lesson on slide design concepts,

130
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.235
and then immediately after each one,

131
00:05:44.235 --> 00:05:45.375
we're gonna have that optional,

132
00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:48.470
how did we make these slides lesson.

133
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.125
And if all you're interested in is high level slide design,

134
00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:56.204
and not how to make the slides using software,

135
00:05:56.204 --> 00:06:00.121
then just skip the optional lessons as follows.

136
00:06:01.476 --> 00:06:04.462
And the different presentation software applications

137
00:06:04.462 --> 00:06:08.402
we're gonna discuss in the optional how to use lessons,

138
00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:12.514
include the most recent versions of Powerpoint, Keynote,

139
00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:15.239
Google Slides, PowToons,

140
00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:17.489
Canva.com, Final Cut Pro X,

141
00:06:18.763 --> 00:06:21.505
Haiku Deck, Piktochart,

142
00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:24.539
Pixomaker, Paint, and Procreate,

143
00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.187
and then Prezi as well,

144
00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:28.431
and I know that's a lot,

145
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:29.323
but don't worry,

146
00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:32.233
as I'm gonna make it really easy to understand,

147
00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:35.367
and really easy to use these programs.

148
00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:38.703
I also realize that some of you use Mac,

149
00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:40.228
some of you use Windows,

150
00:06:40.228 --> 00:06:42.591
some of you use Chromebooks,

151
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:44.833
and some of you use iPads that are tablets,

152
00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:48.607
as a result, I'm gonna cover presentation software products

153
00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:51.942
that will work on every single device.

154
00:06:51.942 --> 00:06:55.119
So, Keynote, for example, only works on you know,

155
00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.791
Apple related products, right.

156
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:00.122
So, if you don't have an Apple related product,

157
00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:01.062
you won't use that one,

158
00:07:01.062 --> 00:07:04.025
but I'm gonna give you plenty of other stuff you can use.

159
00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:06.329
And, if you ever have any questions

160
00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:08.579
about how any slides I made

161
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.739
or any feature that I don't talk about,

162
00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:13.899
that are of interest to you,

163
00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:16.110
then just please, ask me questions in this course.

164
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.600
Thank you.

165
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.767
Now, many people prefer to use just one application,

166
00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.081
like Powerpoint or Keynote or Google Slides,

167
00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:26.258
and that's cool.

168
00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:27.982
All the power to you,

169
00:07:27.982 --> 00:07:30.799
but I really want to humbly help you

170
00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:34.128
and broaden your horizons and your exposure

171
00:07:34.128 --> 00:07:36.616
to other types of software programs

172
00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:38.207
that are fun to use,

173
00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:41.104
and are awesome for presentations.

174
00:07:41.104 --> 00:07:44.279
And I'm assuming that you have no background,

175
00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:48.113
at all, using any of the software products, okay?

176
00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:49.649
Good.

177
00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:54.506
Now, you're gonna notice that we're skipping Photoshop.

178
00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.416
This is controversial.

179
00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:59.695
We're skipping it because it's not that easy to use,

180
00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:02.045
and I speak for myself personally.

181
00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:02.973
When you use Photoshop,

182
00:08:02.973 --> 00:08:04.573
you have to deal with lots of layers and stuff,

183
00:08:04.573 --> 00:08:06.782
and it's too complicated for me.

184
00:08:06.782 --> 00:08:09.124
You know, I like to keep it simple, whatever, okay.

185
00:08:09.124 --> 00:08:12.441
So, I'm gonna include all slides,

186
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:15.924
for this act, which is act four,

187
00:08:15.924 --> 00:08:19.795
as attached resources, in every single lecture in this act,

188
00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:21.763
as we discuss them.

189
00:08:21.763 --> 00:08:26.637
And you can also go to the resources section in this course

190
00:08:26.637 --> 00:08:29.271
and see all the attachments

191
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:31.592
for the course listed there.

192
00:08:31.592 --> 00:08:32.425
And I just want to say

193
00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:36.807
that I had a lot of fun creating this part of the course.

194
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.355
As you get to kinda, you know, be like an artist,

195
00:08:39.355 --> 00:08:41.380
and you get to be creative,

196
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.616
and I'm gonna use many different styles of slides,

197
00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:49.070
and you can just pick whatever style you like the best.

198
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.066
Now, in the next lecture, meaning right after this one,

199
00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:56.949
which is one of the optional how-to lectures,

200
00:08:56.949 --> 00:09:01.474
we're gonna discuss how we made this particular lecture

201
00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:04.724
using only Powerpoint and nothing else.

202
00:09:05.808 --> 00:09:09.582
And then after that additional, optional lecture,

203
00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:13.741
we're gonna discuss the high level differences between all

204
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:16.265
of the many software applications I mentioned

205
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:17.751
in this lecture,

206
00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:19.613
and I hope you enjoy it

207
00:09:19.613 --> 00:09:23.780
as much as I have enjoyed putting it all together.

208
00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:26.849
I find that when you have fun,

209
00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:30.808
and you know, pay a lot of attention to detail,

210
00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:32.301
and you're somewhat creative,

211
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.718
then the quality of your work

212
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.918
goes up a lot,

213
00:09:37.918 --> 00:09:40.531
and you tend to deliver your presentation,

214
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.057
with much more passion.

215
00:09:43.057 --> 00:09:46.463
So, we're gonna cover delivery again in act number six,

216
00:09:46.463 --> 00:09:50.342
but for now, let's enjoy the entertaining process

217
00:09:50.342 --> 00:09:51.820
of making our slides together.

218
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.653
Thank you.
