1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:04,523
As I mentioned earlier, please don't have too much coffee

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:08,690
when you present, it can make you a bit figdety or jittery.

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,947
Let me put that down there.

4
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:16,050
I know I talked about drinking too much coffee before

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,624
but I wanna show you a failure of mine

6
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:24,158
during the Q and A session after one of my speeches.

7
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,177
So check this out.

8
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:26,260
This was bad.

9
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:31,374
So here's an example of me in the Q and A session of one

10
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:36,153
of my presentations, watch how my foot is shaking so much

11
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:40,531
that you probably aren't focusing on what I'm saying.

12
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,908
Okay, okay, let's move on now to head movements.

13
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:48,491
Nodding for yes and vice versa adds effect.

14
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:52,463
Especially when somebody is asking you a question

15
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:56,296
and they have an issue finishing the question,

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,930
maybe because they're nervous, which has happened to me.

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,793
And you kinda nod and help them through it.

18
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:07,791
And we're gonna discuss the Q and A session in Act Seven

19
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,361
which is in the next act.

20
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,361
Lastly, don't cover your mouth ever.

21
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:18,371
I try not to, although I probably do it sometimes

22
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:21,288
subconsciously, but when you do it,

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,211
it actually might show that you're hiding something

24
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,330
and I know that sounds a little bit out there

25
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,827
but I worked at a hedge fund called Citadel years ago

26
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:36,118
and they hired 25 FBI and CIA veterans to train us

27
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,227
on how to tell if an executive is lying.

28
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,311
And apparently covering your mouth indicates

29
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,478
that you might be lying, so even if you cover your mouth

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,817
out of habit, example, if you have a goatee,

31
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:55,984
just please try not to, just for your presentation.
