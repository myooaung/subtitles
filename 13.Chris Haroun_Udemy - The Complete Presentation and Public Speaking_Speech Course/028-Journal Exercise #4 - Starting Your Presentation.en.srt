1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,220
Please open your success journal

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,673
and turn to exercise number four called

3
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:07,658
starting your presentation.

4
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:11,605
We discussed in a lot of detail many different ways

5
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:13,291
to start your presentation.

6
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,454
This exercise here is going to help you create

7
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:20,621
an impactful and perfect start to your presentation.

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,604
So please choose one or more ways to start

9
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:28,312
your presentation based on the questions

10
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:31,948
you can answer in this exercise, exercise number four.

11
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,899
For example, you might decide to start by thanking

12
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,399
the audience and telling a personal story.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,833
You know, another example is you might start

14
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,166
by saying a quote and showing a picture.

15
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:51,885
It's so incredibly important to please start

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,656
your speech the right way.

17
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:56,226
That's why I spent so much time on this.

18
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:59,807
In this exercise I included more than 40 pages

19
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:02,498
of different ways that I have researched

20
00:01:02,498 --> 00:01:04,786
that you can start your speech with.

21
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:07,461
Please take your time with this exercise.

22
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:11,280
Lastly, whenever see a yellow shaded box like this one

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,780
at the end of any of our journal exercises

24
00:01:16,217 --> 00:01:18,839
please complete the yellow box

25
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,968
as we're going to copy and paste

26
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:24,409
from these yellow boxes later in the course

27
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:28,345
when we create our final presentation, thank you.
