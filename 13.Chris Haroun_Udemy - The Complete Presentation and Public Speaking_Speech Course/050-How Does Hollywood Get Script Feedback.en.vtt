00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.786
How does Hollywood get script feedback?

2
00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:08.504
I love this website called Quora, that's Q-U-O-R-A.com

3
00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:10.847
as you can ask very detailed questions

4
00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:14.362
that experts often answer for you.

5
00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:17.460
So how do professional screenwriters

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.094
get feedback on a work in progress script?

7
00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:23.725
Well, I want to Quora and I did a search

8
00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:26.429
and according to this guy, Ken Miyamoto

9
00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.313
who used to be a scriptwriter and reader at Sony Pictures,

10
00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:32.700
he starts with getting feedback from his wife.

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.170
I do the same thing too, right?

12
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.111
And Christine, my wife, she's so awesome.

13
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.453
She'll always give me the most honest feedback, right,

14
00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:43.787
then what Miyamoto-san does

15
00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:47.672
is he gets feedback from his manager which is interesting

16
00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.566
because I suppose that Ken Miyamoto's manager

17
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.141
is the key decision maker.

18
00:00:53.141 --> 00:00:57.633
So his main client I suppose is his manager, right?

19
00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.072
It's your call on if you wanna get feedback

20
00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:01.056
from your manager.

21
00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:02.871
Up to you as I don't know the politics

22
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:05.807
or culture of your company, okay?

23
00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:09.557
The stars all need to be aligned for a script

24
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.706
to make it in Hollywood

25
00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:16.258
and the same thing goes for business model presentations

26
00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:20.390
and funding startups in venture capital, right?

27
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.419
Most don't ever get funded.

28
00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:24.431
In fact, more than 50% of all companies that get started,

29
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.268
slow down, Chris, slow down,

30
00:01:26.268 --> 00:01:29.906
more than 50% of all companies, right, that get founded,

31
00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:33.298
right, go bankrupt within a couple years or so.

32
00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:37.147
So make sure to listen to the feedback you get, right,

33
00:01:37.147 --> 00:01:39.764
and if you ever read my feedback in Udemy,

34
00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:43.936
sometimes people will say that I speak too quickly

35
00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.223
in some presentations, okay, and they're right.

36
00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:48.176
The customer's always right.

37
00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:52.865
So Ken Miyamoto has four additional go to people

38
00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:57.032
that he uses to read his scripts according to quora.com

39
00:01:57.032 --> 00:02:00.893
but for you and me, these additional four or so people

40
00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:04.803
that can review our content should be perfect examples

41
00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:08.803
of who our target audience is going to be, okay?

42
00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:13.030
And I remember before my wedding,

43
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.830
I practiced to my best friend at that time, Jason Denny.

44
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.735
He's a smart guy but I also practiced

45
00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.356
to my aunts and uncles.

46
00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.196
Is it aunt or is it aunt?

47
00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:27.081
My aunts or uncles, right and also to some other friends

48
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.634
and I tried to get people that were,

49
00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:31.702
kinda representative of different age groups and whatnot,

50
00:02:31.702 --> 00:02:34.020
demographics, right 'cause you only get married once

51
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.254
so you only get one opportunity to give a great speech,

52
00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:39.097
right, and we'll study my speech later, my wedding speech.

53
00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:41.506
There were mistakes in it but whatever, we'll see.

54
00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:45.673
Okay, so include mentors when you're getting feedback

55
00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:51.363
only if one, they're successful at giving presentations

56
00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:53.944
and two, they are representative

57
00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:57.837
of your target market audience, okay,

58
00:02:57.837 --> 00:03:02.264
and I'm sure that many Hollywood scriptwriters

59
00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:06.107
ask for feedback from other successful scriptwriters, right,

60
00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:08.597
makes sense, which is why I want you

61
00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:12.519
to please ask for feedback from successful public speakers

62
00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.764
that you know, okay?

63
00:03:14.764 --> 00:03:17.921
And we can always critique ourselves

64
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.902
using the CAP methodology, C-A-P methodology

65
00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:24.985
that we studied in this course, okay,

66
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:29.022
but we need to ask for a lot of feedback

67
00:03:29.022 --> 00:03:31.308
on the content of our presentation

68
00:03:31.308 --> 00:03:34.877
as again one perfect presentation can change your life

69
00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:38.634
and the lives of many people around you, okay?

70
00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:41.909
So please make sure to listen to the feedback you get

71
00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.074
as the customer is always right.

72
00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:46.994
Remember what happened with BonoGate.

73
00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:48.056
It's kinda like Watergate.

74
00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:49.942
BonoGate with Apple.

75
00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:52.069
When Apple actually forced iPhone users

76
00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.668
to download the new U2 album, right?

77
00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:59.533
I was excited, I'm a big U2 fan but not everybody is, right,

78
00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:02.160
and it actually upset a lot of customers, right?

79
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.575
That being said, I talk a lot in act six

80
00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:08.138
about the importance of putting passion into your delivery

81
00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:09.980
and into your presentation

82
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.489
and actually, if you get a chance,

83
00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.098
listen to this U2 album called The Joshua Tree that was,

84
00:04:17.098 --> 00:04:20.098
it was kinda emblematic and defining

85
00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:22.674
of my youth and generation I guess

86
00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:24.739
back in 87 when it came out.

87
00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:26.191
Damn, I'm old.

88
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:29.911
But if you listen to it, you can really hear the passion

89
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:32.351
in Bono's voice when he sings.

90
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:35.547
Every word of it from the opening line on the album

91
00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:38.415
of "I wanna run, I wanna hide,

92
00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:42.183
"I wanna tear down the walls that hold me inside", right?

93
00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:46.931
I actually still have the single of With or Without You

94
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:50.280
from way back then, right, and it's interesting

95
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.735
because what would happen is they would put

96
00:04:52.735 --> 00:04:55.455
and this is relevant, okay, so what, okay?

97
00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:58.091
They would put the song on this side that matters,

98
00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:59.772
right, the A side, right,

99
00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:01.816
and then and it's called With or Without You, the song,

100
00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:04.348
and on the B side was a song that they never really released

101
00:05:04.348 --> 00:05:06.661
called Walk to the Water, right?

102
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:10.190
So A, B testing, whatever, you get the idea.

103
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.781
Right now, everything is digital, right?

104
00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:13.333
So anyway, whatever.

105
00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:14.440
So what, Chris?

106
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.938
Well, not only do I bring this up

107
00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:20.696
because the importance of passion in your speeches

108
00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:23.279
but also back then and even now

109
00:05:25.037 --> 00:05:27.315
artists and scriptwriters and musicians

110
00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:29.326
create too much content, right?

111
00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:31.736
So what they do is they throw it on the other side

112
00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.659
of the product that,

113
00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.916
on the other side here of this thing, right?

114
00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:37.581
Anyway.

115
00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:40.096
Okay, so again, this is the B side.

116
00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:42.677
So keep all the excess material you have

117
00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:46.326
in your speech handy as I'm gonna show you

118
00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:50.174
how to discuss it during the Q&A session in act number seven

119
00:05:50.174 --> 00:05:53.574
which will make you look incredibly well-prepared, okay,

120
00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:57.491
and again, although I'm a huge U2 fan, my kids,

121
00:05:59.222 --> 00:06:01.021
my kids think U2 is as cool

122
00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:03.810
as Carlton singing Tom Jones

123
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.339
from my favorite TV show when I was a kid.

124
00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.089
Carlton rocks as does Will Smith.
