1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:04,539
If you're starting a presentation by introducing a speaker

2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,449
then ask the speaker or their assistant,

3
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:10,331
well in advance, to send you their bio.

4
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:11,880
If it's available, 'k?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,400
And if it's relevant for the introduction.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,209
Okay, then if you can add something

7
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:18,381
personal to the introduction.

8
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:20,490
You know, it could be the first time that you met

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,511
this person or a personal and flattering

10
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,151
story about this person you're going to introduce.

11
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:30,009
And so, here's the example of an introduction

12
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,671
that I did as a Venture Capitalist

13
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,149
at a Venture Capital conference that I organized

14
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,711
and I introduced all of the speakers, right.

15
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,204
And I'm gonna give you plenty more examples on

16
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,370
how to introduce speakers

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,287
in act 11, scene four and scene 11,

18
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:46,989
okay?

19
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,008
So just go to act 11 you'll see, okay?

20
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,393
But I wanna discuss just

21
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:54,842
one of the introductions that I did for a speaker

22
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:57,302
that I think is the smartest and most successful

23
00:00:57,302 --> 00:01:00,469
person here in Silicon Valley history.

24
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,892
And I probably spent an entire day

25
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,824
just preparing this intro.

26
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,824
And I memorized it, too.

27
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,432
Before I give this example though

28
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:15,264
there's a five step outline that I created for you.

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,776
To make it easier to start a speech

30
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:20,394
when you're introducing somebody.

31
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:23,144
Step one, say who the speaker is.

32
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:28,032
Step two, say at least one complimentary thing

33
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,401
about the speaker from their bio

34
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:32,973
or from the summary section from the top

35
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,514
of their Linkedin profile if available.

36
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:39,234
Step three, list in chronological order

37
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,773
their background and accomplishments.

38
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:44,194
And sometimes it can go on forever because these people

39
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:47,303
you introduce are just so ridiculously successful.

40
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:51,470
Step four, say what the speaker is currently doing.

41
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:56,794
And then step five, end with how grateful you are

42
00:01:56,794 --> 00:01:58,373
that they are speaking.

43
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,553
So, here's the script I used

44
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,426
at a Venture Capital conference

45
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,809
a while back when I was MC.

46
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:07,147
I was actually kind of nervous but I completely

47
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:09,838
over prepared and it worked out okay.

48
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,171
Here's actually how it went.

49
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,604
Our keynote speaker is Andy Bechtolsheim.

50
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,587
Andy was the very first investor in Google.

51
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:24,755
Legend has it he wrote a check to Google Inc.

52
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:27,051
before Google's co-founders had

53
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:29,808
legally registered the company name.

54
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,857
He had to actually explain to Larry and Sergey

55
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:35,079
how to cash that check.

56
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,996
True story.

57
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:40,182
Not only is Andy Bechtolsheim one of the best

58
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:43,152
Angel investors in the history of Venture Capital

59
00:02:43,152 --> 00:02:45,452
but he was a full bright scholar.

60
00:02:45,452 --> 00:02:49,740
He was also the very first employee at Sun Microsystems

61
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,311
and in 1995 he left Sun to start Granite Systems

62
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,894
which he sold to Cisco in 1996.

63
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,857
Andy held a senior position at Cisco until 2003

64
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:05,682
when he left to start a company that he sold to Sun.

65
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:08,681
He is currently involved in several incredibly

66
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,350
forward-thinking and disruptive companies

67
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,870
for which he is the chairman and founder.

68
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,799
One of which is Arista Networks and the other one is DSSD.

69
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,281
It is my pleasure, my honor and my privilege

70
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,262
to introduce our keynote speaker,

71
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:28,312
Doctor Andy Bechtolsheim.

72
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:32,400
Okay, I made a mistake there though when I gave it.

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,914
I said Doctor and he's not.

74
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,703
And he's so humble, he got up and he said

75
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:39,993
he said, "Chris, I actually never finished my PhD's

76
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:42,076
"so thank you, but I'm not a Doctor."

77
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:45,423
And PHD I think stands for pluming, heating and dishwashing.

78
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:46,423
I don't know.

79
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:50,490
So again I'm gonna you plenty of examples

80
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,882
and templates

81
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:55,080
in act 11 when we discuss 25 different

82
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,240
presentation and speech examples.

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,073
Thank you.
