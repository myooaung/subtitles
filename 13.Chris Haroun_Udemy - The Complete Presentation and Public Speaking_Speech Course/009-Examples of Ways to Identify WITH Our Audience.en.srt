1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,039
Here are some ideas on how to personalize a speech.

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,040
And I'm going to include these and more

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,447
in your success journal as part of an exercise

4
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:12,459
in the next lecture,

5
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:16,139
in case you ever need to access these personal touches,

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,616
or even a simple exercise or example in your speech.

7
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,528
Try to involve your parents or

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,949
something personal that others can relate to.

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,116
And I'm gonna give you five personal examples, okay?

10
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:34,070
And when you do this, you have to ...

11
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:37,808
You have to tie it into your speech,

12
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:39,089
remember the so what test,

13
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,180
(music)

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,197
in order to make it relevant, okay?

15
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:44,797
And we're gonna discuss many ways to craft the

16
00:00:44,797 --> 00:00:48,736
beautiful content of your speech in Act Three.

17
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:51,236
Okay. Here's the first example

18
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:57,515
of personalizing content in order to appeal to emotions.

19
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,848
My first memory was in 1977.

20
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:02,935
Okay, these are all real stories.

21
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:07,018
My mom, in 1977, took me to the first movie ever,

22
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:10,675
that I ever went to, which was Star Wars.

23
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:15,033
And I couldn't read so my mom read the scrolling,

24
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,173
yellow words to me.

25
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:19,222
I didn't understand any of it.

26
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:21,123
But I knew at that point in my life

27
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,373
that I wanted to be a film maker

28
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:26,373
or do something with filming, right?

29
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,141
Second example, okay?

30
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:33,301
My father grew up in Egypt.

31
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,603
And actually, no joke,

32
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:38,103
today, which is March 25, 2017

33
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:44,740
is the 50th anniversary that my dad came from ...

34
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,081
Moved from Egypt to Canada.

35
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:48,782
Right, 1967.

36
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:51,763
It's a pretty amazing story, pretty amazing story.

37
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,342
Actually, the story is that he,

38
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:55,913
totally went off script here but whatever.

39
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:58,286
They wanted to put him into this stupid war

40
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,383
in the middle ... you probably know what war it was.

41
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:01,522
And he thought it was ridiculous.

42
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:05,104
So he bribed an army official so he could fail his eye exam.

43
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:07,253
And then he left the country, thank God.

44
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,670
Anyway, whatever.

45
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,314
Okay, so my dad he talks about Egypt,

46
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:17,784
and I've never gone to Egypt, right?

47
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,034
But I actually,

48
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,373
I asked him, "What was it like growing up there?"

49
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:27,544
He said, "Chris, on every Saturday my fondest memories was

50
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:31,672
going on long walks with my father in the marketplace

51
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:34,013
where I lived in a town called Zayed,

52
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:36,596
which is south of Cairo, right?

53
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,552
My dad showed me on Google Earth,

54
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:43,464
recently the path that they took.

55
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,392
Which you can see here.

56
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:48,904
My dad and his dad would always stop right here

57
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:51,371
for a loaf of (Egyptian accent) fresh bread,

58
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,395
that's how my dad says it.

59
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:53,857
It's better when he says it than me.

60
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:57,514
I say fresh bread he goes, (Egyptian accent) fresh bread.

61
00:02:57,514 --> 00:03:00,593
My dad taught me about how they would

62
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:04,085
put sliced olives into the bread

63
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:08,725
and the combination of olives and bread was prophetic

64
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:12,356
and had different meanings for me to interpret

65
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:15,797
as he would discuss the bread of life

66
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:18,973
and the essence of the olive branch.

67
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:21,902
This led me to believe that we can achieve

68
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,199
peace and harmony through ...

69
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,099
You get the idea.

70
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,050
But I'm just trying to make it relevant.

71
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,319
Remember the "so what test", right.

72
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,036
You can tie it in beautifully to a speech.

73
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:34,106
Just separately, off script again,

74
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:36,186
this is just me being me,

75
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:38,363
if you get a chance, if you've never been to

76
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,863
where your mom or dad grew up,

77
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,721
Sit down with them through Google Earth

78
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:48,069
and ask them to show you where they grew up and record it.

79
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,688
It's really nice.

80
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,523
The third example of a personal example

81
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,816
is that Warren Buffett once guest lectured

82
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:57,511
in one of classes at MBA school.

83
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:59,409
He said something that really

84
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,155
changed my perception on investing.

85
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,891
He said that the New York Stock Exchange

86
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,608
is the only store in the world

87
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,488
where consumers sell stuff and it goes on sale, right?

88
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:12,442
That's, let's think about that.

89
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:15,403
It's a nice little anecdote or way to talk about investing,

90
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:18,814
if you're presenting about investing, right?

91
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:20,705
My fourth personal example is:

92
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:24,322
my father told me once never to take a short cut

93
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:27,994
I've never taken before when I'm in a hurry.

94
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:31,131
So I apologize for showing up two minutes late today.

95
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:34,515
You could do something self-depricating like that

96
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:35,910
at a conference if you're late.

97
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,115
And you're not going to be late.

98
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,948
Okay, my fifth personal example is

99
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:45,089
I thought my life was over.

100
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:49,256
It was 1991, I was at McGill University in Montreal.

101
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,100
I took accounting for the first time

102
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,883
and I got a D.

103
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:56,394
I tell this story as well in my ...

104
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,563
I teach a course on you and me called

105
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,295
The entire MBA in one course.

106
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,998
Before I talk about the finance and accounting section,

107
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,284
I talk about this.

108
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:04,328
I got a D in accounting.

109
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:07,684
I got a D in accounting because I memorized accounting

110
00:05:07,684 --> 00:05:09,117
instead of understanding it.

111
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:12,500
You see, if you understand something,

112
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,593
then you remember it.

113
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:17,769
If you memorize it, it doesn't sink in longer term.

114
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:20,129
I took the course again and I did better later, of course.

115
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:22,296
So, I've already mentioned

116
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:26,002
how you've got to be yourself at all times.

117
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,457
Senior people really don't like it when you're

118
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:32,290
nervous around them or treat them differently.

119
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:34,807
I don't know why we do this when

120
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,598
people that are more senior to us

121
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:39,226
in our organization walk by.

122
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:41,278
They don't like it.

123
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:42,690
They feel uncomfortable, actually.

124
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,572
They feel just as uncomfortable as you sometimes.

125
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:46,759
And our peers certainly don't like it.

126
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,613
And our subordinates hate it as well.

127
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:51,358
People actually lose respect for us

128
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:55,525
and I lose respect for myself when I used to do that.

129
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,990
It's kind of like this,

130
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,493
I'm just telling you be yourself.

131
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,831
It's like when you, I don't know if this happened to you

132
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:04,073
but it happened to me a couple times.

133
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:08,781
Where you interview for a job or you go on a date.

134
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:11,308
And you're just yourself.

135
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:14,270
You almost don't care anymore, right?

136
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,393
And things work.

137
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:19,374
You get the job or the date went really well.

138
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:23,387
I've been so fed up in my life when I've interviewed.

139
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:25,449
I remember getting rejected a lot and I prepared a lot

140
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,416
and I remember going into one interview and I said,

141
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,857
"I just don't care anymore," I said it to myself.

142
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,550
I was just myself.

143
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,441
I got the job.

144
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,941
Anyways, the point is be real.

145
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,749
Be yourself when you present.

146
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:43,176
And your ability to communicate with your audience

147
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:46,238
will go through the roof, okay?

148
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:49,578
So here's some other examples of what you can use

149
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,765
in a presentation to tap into emotions

150
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:54,634
and give personal examples so you can

151
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,347
identify with your audience.

152
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:59,720
And make sure to ask yourself the "so what" test so

153
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,691
it can be relevant and then tie it into your presentation.

154
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:06,391
Okay, so being personal is why people love watching

155
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:10,116
wedding speeches more than corporate speeches, right?

156
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,517
Okay, so here's some more examples for you

157
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,480
that you can use.

158
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,666
I'm just gonna give you the first sentences.

159
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:20,385
When I was younger growing up in ...

160
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:24,037
Another one is this: one of my heroes is "x"

161
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,287
and they said once that ...

162
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,988
One of my favorite movies that I've ever seen is

163
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:31,608
yada yada yada.

164
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:35,163
Right? Or I once went to U2 concert.

165
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,656
And the lead singer named Bono

166
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,427
he got up halfway through the concert,

167
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:40,599
it was very loud I remember

168
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,486
and he said,(British accent) "I'd like you all

169
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,616
to please not make any noise as I sing this next song

170
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,499
and give you this introductory speech here."

171
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,902
My accent's awful. I'm trying. Okay? I'm trying.

172
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,960
He said this (hands clap) "Every time I clap,

173
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,308
somebody dies in the world of a rare disease."

174
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:59,058
And he kept clapping.

175
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,372
And then somebody in the audience, it was really quiet,

176
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,290
"Then stop freaking clapping you hands then."

177
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,540
(laughing)

178
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:11,430
It was pretty funny, right?

179
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,263
It's actually a true story.

180
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:13,707
It didn't happen to me but I read about it online.

181
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:15,488
It's online so it has to be real, right?

182
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,321
Pretty funny.

183
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:19,143
And apparently Bono, he actually ended up laughing as well.

184
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:20,815
Pretty funny. Okay.

185
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:22,232
Wait. Ummm, okay.

186
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,213
And so another example is this.

187
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:28,731
I'll make this one up, right?

188
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:32,269
I don't want to be too Toronto or Canada-centric.

189
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:35,283
My father used to take me to Ebbet's field

190
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,443
to see the Brooklyn Dodgers play.

191
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:41,030
I brought a ticket stub with me. Right?

192
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,666
Again, this one is not real.

193
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,503
My dad took me for my birthday.

194
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,240
The ticket was six bucks then

195
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,391
which was a lot of money back then.

196
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,443
And I'll never forget,

197
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,586
as we were playing the New York Yankees

198
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:56,123
and Jackie Robinson was playing that day.

199
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:59,262
And I got to sit by my number one role model

200
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:03,194
and my best friend ever while watching my second role model

201
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:06,767
who positively impacted the game forever.

202
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,135
That day we listened to Vin Scully on the radio

203
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:10,364
giving the play by play.

204
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:11,931
(Vin Scully radio announcement)

205
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,899
And I'll never forget while sitting in the stands

206
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,439
my dad told me that...

207
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:18,843
You get it, it's just an example.

208
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:21,551
But really personalize it, right?

209
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:24,171
Just make it real, make it about you.

210
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,539
And you know what, dude?

211
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,843
Sorry, I say dude sometimes to my friend.

212
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:30,260
You don't have to practice it

213
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:34,189
if you just kind of tell a story about yourself.

214
00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:36,385
You can't screw that up, right?

215
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,218
Okay.

216
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,926
And so this one's true actually,

217
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:42,477
this story I'm gonna tell ya.

218
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:45,069
Before I tell this one to you, I gotta go down my elevator.

219
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:47,042
(elevator dings)

220
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:51,209
(elevator beeps moving floor to floor)

221
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:55,573
Okay. I found it.

222
00:09:58,997 --> 00:09:59,988
This one's true, okay.

223
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:01,337
This is personal.

224
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:03,219
I've shown this to you before, okay.

225
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:06,302
This is one of the first Macintosh's.

226
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,409
When I was younger, in the sixth grade, and the eighth grade

227
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,667
they thought I had a learning disability,

228
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,617
the teachers or whatever. Right.

229
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:14,528
My parents were so awesome

230
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:17,478
in trying to boost my confidence and everything.

231
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,728
And so what happened was my

232
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:25,361
I had to go to these special places

233
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:29,356
and they tested my knowledge of stuff whatever.

234
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:30,302
I got the worst grades.

235
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,705
I was the worst student when I was younger.

236
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:36,288
And the reason was that I wasn't passionate

237
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:41,092
about what I was doing. Right?

238
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:44,938
And then one day, I was so awful in school,

239
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:46,486
my dad bought this.

240
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:49,337
This changed my life. I keep it with me everywhere.

241
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:52,337
See I have the Bluejays here. Right?

242
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:56,058
Pretty neat. My favorite number is number four.

243
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,164
All that stuff.

244
00:10:57,164 --> 00:11:00,846
Anyway, my dad bought this thing and it changed my life

245
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:05,689
because I was incredibly passionate about using this thing

246
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:08,569
to create presentations and stuff.

247
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:11,473
It was just fun. Right? It was my passion.

248
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:15,632
And without it, I probably wouldn't have been happy.

249
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:17,549
Anyway, that's just me.

250
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:22,868
Now the point is that we gotta be passionate

251
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,963
as a team here, you and I. Okay?

252
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,584
We gotta be passionate about what we're doing

253
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:29,924
as we go through this. Okay?

254
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,878
Whenever you give that personal story,

255
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:33,307
of course you gotta keep it relevant,

256
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:34,140
(trumpets sounding)

257
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,973
Tie it in. Okay?

258
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,829
People will remember it because of that.

259
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,797
And there's so many other ways to personalize

260
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:42,706
and bring real life stories

261
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,351
and relevant emotions into a speech.

262
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,292
(trumpets sounding)

263
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,258
The point is that we must be passionate as a team here.

264
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,490
In our company, right?

265
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,635
If were gonna go from number two

266
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:54,670
in market shares to number one.

267
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,974
See I just kinda tied in the whole McIntosh,

268
00:11:56,974 --> 00:12:00,601
computer thing, into a corporate speech.

269
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,103
You get the idea.

270
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:04,832
And there's so many other awesome ways to personalize

271
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:06,164
and bring real life stories

272
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:09,231
and relevant emotions into a speech.

273
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:11,797
And here's some more examples. Right?

274
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:15,344
You won't feel true happiness in life until

275
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:17,917
you hold your child for the first time.

276
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:18,951
Okay, that's true actually.

277
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:20,518
It happened to me when Andrew was born

278
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,976
and I was like I didn't realize I had this type

279
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,308
of happy emotions like this.

280
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,890
You'll see. It's exuberant.

281
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,227
Or another example is, and you can personalize your own way.

282
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,700
I'm not gonna go off-script.

283
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,117
But my near death experience was or this.

284
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:40,530
One day that changed my life forever was...

285
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,439
Yada yada yada.

286
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:45,488
See you're interested when you start a sentence like that.

287
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,529
One day that changed my...

288
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:47,833
Everyone kinda stops.

289
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,368
If in the audience you have lot of people

290
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,796
using these things, which are awful.

291
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:54,237
When they hear something like that, you know,

292
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:56,301
one day that changed my life was...

293
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:59,933
They'll kinda put this down and listen up.

294
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,095
And I kinda like you to do it

295
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,067
at the beginning of your presentation.

296
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,152
Cause that way, once you get them

297
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:03,985
(fingers snapped)

298
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:06,675
they're hooked. Okay. In a good way.

299
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:10,346
Or you could say I overcame my fear of public speaking

300
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:12,657
with, whatever it might be.

301
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,667
But I really want you to open up.

302
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:18,591
Because humility and or transparency builds trust

303
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:20,469
and helps you bond with your audience

304
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:24,620
because they share the same emotions that you have.

305
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,913
And the more human that you come across as,

306
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:32,143
the more your audience will be able to identify with you.

307
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:36,014
And the more affective your presentation will be.

308
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,398
I think you get the idea.

309
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:41,342
Just make sure you audience feels emotions

310
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:44,697
when they watch or listen to your presentation.

311
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:49,180
Just like how great movies or music or your heroes

312
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,347
or speakers that you admire make you feel emotions.

313
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:58,571
Like hearing a great song makes ya kinda shiver.

314
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:03,895
Okay so make sure of course that if you are pressed for time

315
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:08,062
these personal stories have to be very very short.

316
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,744
Now we're done with this lecture

317
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:17,671
but please watch this incredibly emotional

318
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:22,114
and yes, a bit extreme reaction from an amazingly,

319
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:25,697
passionate person who won an academy award.

320
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:28,452
I don't remember exactly what he said

321
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,387
but I remember how he made me feel.

322
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:32,755
It was in 1999. I was in New York City,

323
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:36,130
on the upper west side, in a bar on 73rd street,

324
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,615
around that area.

325
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:42,106
So anyway, this is a guy that won best actor award

326
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:44,831
for "Life is Beautiful".

327
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:46,111
I want you yo watch it.

328
00:14:46,111 --> 00:14:49,528
Please watch it and then come back to me.

329
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:56,290
Now I'm not saying that you should act exactly like this.

330
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,490
But I want you to feel what the audience felt that day.

331
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,391
Like what Sophia Loren on the stage felt.

332
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:05,254
And what everybody in the audience felt that day.

333
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,423
And the billion people or so

334
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:09,511
that were watching that live around the world.

335
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:13,687
And that guy, Roberto, he didn't care what people thought.

336
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,437
He was being himself.

337
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:17,602
And God bless him.

338
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:19,269
What a great speech.

339
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:25,422
Notice in that video he talks about people that he loves

340
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:26,755
and his parents.

341
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:30,319
You don't get more joy and more emotion

342
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,155
than you can get it this speech.

343
00:15:32,155 --> 00:15:33,730
Because it is right from the heart.

344
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,367
It is so real.

345
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:39,534
It's a masterpiece of emotions and the audience loves it.

346
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:44,547
And the audience will love you.

347
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:46,555
So please watch it again if you want to.

348
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,305
And just bookmark it.

349
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,603
Watch the video over again

350
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:54,585
if you're ever unhappy at any point in your life.
