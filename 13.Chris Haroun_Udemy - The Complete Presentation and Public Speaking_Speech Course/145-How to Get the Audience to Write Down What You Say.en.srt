1
00:00:00,687 --> 00:00:01,887
How can we get the audience

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:04,096
to write down what we are saying?

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:06,356
Okay, so, here's a trick for ya.

4
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:07,428
If you want the audience

5
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:09,712
to write something down

6
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:11,476
or students write something down,

7
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:12,932
and I do this all the time.

8
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:15,259
All you have to do is say this:

9
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:17,280
"Here's a list of three"

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,526
"blah blah blah blah blah," right?

11
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:19,359
So you can say,

12
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,996
"Here's a list of three crucial things we need to remember."

13
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:24,791
Right, and so, whenever I say that

14
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,473
in my university class settings,

15
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:27,956
everybody writes it down.

16
00:00:27,956 --> 00:00:29,695
And it's fascinating because

17
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,100
that's always been the case.

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,332
But one thing I've noticed

19
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,087
with media publications

20
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,149
is that the best articles,

21
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,321
or the most read ones,

22
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:40,914
are the ones that have numbers in the titles.

23
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:43,825
"Five reasons why you should get a new job."

24
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:47,825
Or, "Seven reasons why you need to get a raise."

25
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,780
Or, "Seven ways to get a raise."

26
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,613
That sort of thing.

27
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:53,299
Right, so, it works really well

28
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,864
when you use numbers because

29
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:57,600
what happens is people hear this in the audience

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,433
and they think,

31
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,062
"Oh, this is gonna be easy to understand."

32
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,134
"It's just a list of numbers."

33
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:02,544
"Okay, I'll write it down."

34
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:04,903
Right, and I use the word crucial as well.

35
00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:06,520
Kinda like,

36
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,007
I wrote a certain book a while ago

37
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,029
and the word crucial is in the title.

38
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,397
Right, so it's action oriented.

39
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:15,317
Right, okay, anyway, no self promotion.

40
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:18,168
Okay, separately, never say

41
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:20,003
the following is not important

42
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,396
or won't be on the exam,

43
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:22,640
because what happens is

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,873
all students stop paying attention

45
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:27,166
for the following item you're about to discuss.

46
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,627
Right, and I know you did that in school too.

47
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:31,497
(laughs) We all stop listening when

48
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:33,531
the teacher said, "the following is not on the exam."

49
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,129
"Blah blah blah," that sort of thing.
