1
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:04,987
I used to be absolutely terrified of public speaking

2
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:07,401
much more than you are or you were.

3
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:09,983
And it really held me back in my career

4
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:11,634
for a lot of my life.

5
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:14,200
I actually remember in business school

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,731
at Columbia University, and even during

7
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:18,985
the training program at Goldman Sachs,

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:23,157
I would always ask way more questions than my peers did

9
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:26,824
as I was really scared of being cold cocked.

10
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,772
I was scared of being put on the spot to present.

11
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:35,939
I was even "sick" when I was supposed to give a speech

12
00:00:37,532 --> 00:00:38,851
when I was in high school.

13
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,045
I'll never forget that on a particular day.

14
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:45,407
And I found every reason not to do public speaking

15
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,421
for many many years.

16
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:50,226
And I eventually realized that you really

17
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:54,391
can't achieve all of your goals in life if you can't

18
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,997
confront your fears and master public speaking.

19
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:59,707
It's important.

20
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:03,540
And so finally I decided that enough is enough

21
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,939
and I needed to confront my biggest fear.

22
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,988
So what I'd do is I thought,

23
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:11,388
"How can I?

24
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:13,404
"How can I confront this fear?

25
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:16,420
"How can I confront this fear and eventually

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,151
"turn that weakness into a strength and enjoy it?"

27
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:20,976
And I thought, "That's crazy, Chris.

28
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:23,693
"You'll never enjoy something fearful."

29
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:28,187
A lot of people are just as fearful of public speaking

30
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:32,612
as they are getting really really hurt physically.

31
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:35,636
So I thought, "What can I do to confront my fear?"

32
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:39,440
So I actually do a lot of charity work.

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,190
I've always liked helping others,

34
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:46,517
so what I did was I volunteered in the prison system

35
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:50,328
here in California through my church.

36
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:52,686
And the reason I did this is because I wanted to

37
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:56,141
help these poor kids that were about 20 years old

38
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,318
that didn't have the luxury of having two loving parents

39
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,151
growing up like I did.

40
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,059
A lot of them had deadbeat fathers.

41
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,861
Never a deadbeat mother, it was usually the father left.

42
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,778
It was sad.

43
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,950
Many of these kids were put in prison

44
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,263
for ridiculously minor incidents.

45
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:18,506
And that could have been me if I were in the wrong place

46
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,889
at the wrong time, or without two loving parents

47
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,727
that watched over me.

48
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,290
And you know exactly what I mean.

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,416
If you got caught for doing something at the wrong time

50
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,922
you could have got in a lot of trouble.

51
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:31,341
You know maybe your parents pushed you back

52
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:33,820
on the right path, but these poor students,

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,146
or these poor kids I should say,

54
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,944
in jail, they didn't have that.

55
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:40,113
They didn't have the luxury of having two loving parents.

56
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:41,646
So here's what I did.

57
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:44,790
I volunteered at a prison in Redwood City, California,

58
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,959
called the Maguire Correctional Facility

59
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,895
which is right here.

60
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:50,986
You can see in this video.

61
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,923
I'm zooming right into it.

62
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,389
So I started giving speeches there to kind of help

63
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,415
those poor kids that were incarcerated.

64
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:04,197
I wanted to teach them life skills and mentorship

65
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:07,640
and really inspire them to turn their lives around.

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,550
Right, it's never too late.

67
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,239
I was only supposed to present to a couple inmates

68
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,504
at a time, and they gave me a police pass.

69
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:19,132
They did a background check and everything

70
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,215
to get me to go in there.

71
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,179
And then something absolutely terrifying happened to me.

72
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,301
I was actually scared.

73
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:29,984
I showed up at the prison on a Sunday morning,

74
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:32,740
or Sunday, actually it was around 1:00 p.m.

75
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,698
that day on a Sunday which is the usual time

76
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,023
I would show up.

77
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:39,002
The priest that was supposed to conduct mass

78
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:40,667
didn't show up that day.

79
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,056
This is not a religious thing.

80
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,013
I would help anybody, okay.

81
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,905
But the priest that was supposed to conduct mass

82
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:50,627
didn't show up that day, and the warden said to me,

83
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:53,203
"Well Haroun, it's up to you.

84
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:55,453
"You have to conduct mass."

85
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,239
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,270
I seriously thought about coming up with an excuse

87
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,699
like I did in high school.

88
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,546
I thought about turning around and walking away

89
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:09,598
and just finding some excuse not to do it.

90
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:11,507
This is kind of like a personal intervention.

91
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:14,098
I had to force myself to follow through.

92
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,440
And I said, "Screw it, I have to confront this fear

93
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,408
"of mine right now because it's holding me back,

94
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:21,835
"and I can't take it any more."

95
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:24,666
And when you go to religious service, quite often

96
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,565
what happens is you read a passage

97
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:30,402
from say the Old Testament or whatever it is.

98
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,635
And then the priest or the religious leader

99
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:35,718
gives a speech based on that passage.

100
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:39,487
And of course they have many weeks

101
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,758
to prepare for each speech.

102
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:42,768
And they've spent their whole life doing this as well

103
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:45,386
citing whatever book it is that they read from.

104
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,668
And I thought, "How the heck am I going to

105
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:51,239
pull this off without any preparation

106
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:54,906
and, more importantly, without passing out?"

107
00:04:56,435 --> 00:05:00,435
So, I got to get some water for this one. Sorry.

108
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,787
Alright, so I cleared the security doors,

109
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:09,181
cause you have to go through a lot of security checks.

110
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:10,491
You have to go, there's two doors closed,

111
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:12,257
one behind you and one in front of you,

112
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:13,609
and there's a camera and you have

113
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,120
to say your name and look up.

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,354
Anyway, a lot of checks.

115
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:21,715
And then the officer there escorted me to the breakout room

116
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,257
where I was to present to these inmates,

117
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,316
many of which should not have been there.

118
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:31,786
And so I stood in front of them absolutely terrified.

119
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,997
My knees were shaking.

120
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:38,841
Many of them were crammed and seated in this small room

121
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,815
and they had these orange jumpsuits on.

122
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:42,270
And when you go, you're not allowed

123
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,351
to wear anything orange for obvious reasons.

124
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,470
And a lot of them have their arms crossed like this.

125
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,056
And some of them had tattoos on their heads

126
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:52,344
and right here with profanities.

127
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,651
Tattoos, right, it was really intimidating.

128
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:58,324
And again many of them didn't deserve to be there.

129
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,320
And that could have been me if I was caught

130
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,917
at the wrong time in my life.

131
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,407
And so I read that the pamphlet, right,

132
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,884
they give me a pamphlet that was given by the church.

133
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:11,433
Remember the priest wasn't there so I had to fill in.

134
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:16,265
And that particular gospel passage that I read from

135
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:20,141
was all about hope and faith and all that good stuff.

136
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:24,540
And so after I finished reading the passage,

137
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,139
I was supposed to give a speech about the topic

138
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,847
that I just read

139
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,423
which was about hope.

140
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:35,006
And so I stared at the inmates.

141
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:38,043
They had their arms crossed.

142
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:40,575
They were staring right back at me.

143
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,186
Some of them had these really negative looks on their face.

144
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:44,229
You can imagine.

145
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,883
So I started giving a speech that I made up on the spot.

146
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,376
I had no idea what I was going to say.

147
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:54,709
So I said this, "Do you believe in God?"

148
00:06:56,938 --> 00:07:01,045
And a bunch of the inmates kind of went, "Yeah."

149
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,630
I then paused.

150
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,263
I said, "Does God believe in you?"

151
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:09,287
And a couple more inmates said, "Yeah."

152
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:12,771
Then I said this, "Well if you don't believe in yourself,

153
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:17,163
"then you might have to question your faith."

154
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:20,043
I paused again for a few seconds.

155
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:23,275
And I felt a sense of calmness and peace

156
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,025
and love in my heart.

157
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:29,770
Almost like this public speaking handicap

158
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,550
that had been holding me back for so many years

159
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,967
had been lifted from me.

160
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,771
I'm getting shivers just thinking of it right now.

161
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:41,681
My knees stopped shaking as I saw many of the inmates

162
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:44,093
uncross their arms.

163
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:45,999
They opened up.

164
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,582
A few of them I remember took deep breaths.

165
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:53,920
And I saw one man's angry eyebrows rise.

166
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:57,647
I'll never forget that.

167
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,403
Another one smiled at me.

168
00:08:00,403 --> 00:08:02,237
Actually it was the one with the crazy tattoo that said,

169
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:03,878
I can't say it, okay.

170
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:06,577
And another one looked up at the ceiling

171
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:10,380
as if there was some kind of sense of temporary relief.

172
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,768
It was a eunuch experience for me.

173
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:17,101
The only thing I can remember saying is,

174
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:20,713
"Thank you."

175
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:24,572
I paused and my heart opened up.

176
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:30,823
I actually said this too, "You need not worry

177
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:33,208
"as God already knows what's gonna happen.

178
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,658
"And that should really give you peace of mind

179
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:40,222
"and instill a sense of self-worth and confidence

180
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:43,125
"and happiness and hope in your heart."

181
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,625
So since that day,

182
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:50,258
my biggest fear has become my biggest sense of joy.

183
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,771
And I only wish that I had the guts

184
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:57,771
and that I had that revelation and sense of love

185
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:02,662
and humbly empowering the empowerers events

186
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,745
occur earlier in my life.

187
00:09:05,991 --> 00:09:08,427
So whether or not you think you can do something,

188
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,177
you're right, and quite often you

189
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,103
are your biggest enemy.

190
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,669
I think of those prisoners staring at me

191
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:18,202
with the negative looks.

192
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:20,635
That might be you staring at yourself in the mirror.

193
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:23,597
You got to change your perception.

194
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,543
So now I love to teach.

195
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:27,284
I love to teach many classes and seminars

196
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:30,070
on how to give presentations.

197
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,164
And many students open up and feel that

198
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:34,626
they can accomplish anything.

199
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,247
And one of my proudest moments when I was teaching

200
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:37,786
was there was this guy.

201
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,173
His name was Yon.

202
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:41,923
And he approached me at the very beginning of class.

203
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:43,972
I'd teach for a couple of months in a row.

204
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:46,346
And he said, "Chris, I'm really scared of public speaking."

205
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:48,848
And I said, "Okay, okay, halfway through this course,

206
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,236
"you're gonna present to the entire class, right."

207
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:54,174
And he was kind of scared and I got him to do it

208
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,991
and he aced it, and then at graduation

209
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,612
I had him speak as well.

210
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:00,047
And I literally had a tear in my eye.

211
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:01,297
It was amazing.

212
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:06,584
So I want you to embrace this fear right now if it's a fear.

213
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:09,220
I want you to turn your biggest perceived weakness

214
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,285
into your biggest strength, okay.

215
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,356
And people might forget what you say,

216
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,769
but they'll never forget the way you made them feel.

217
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,772
They never forget the way you made them feel.

218
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:22,733
And when you put your heart into anything

219
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,232
your mind stops caring what others think,

220
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:28,555
and you become more confident when you speak

221
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:31,472
in front of large groups of people.

222
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:35,806
A little cheesy, but here I go.

223
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,230
Confidence is key.

224
00:10:40,644 --> 00:10:44,727
So just like Bob Gibson in pitching on the mound.

225
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:47,393
And when I was younger it was.

226
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:48,315
This is too tight.

227
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,918
Let me undo this a bit.

228
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,567
When I was younger, for some reason

229
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:56,220
people left the tags on their baseball hats.

230
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,061
So I'm gonna try and act cool and do that as well.

231
00:10:59,061 --> 00:10:59,942
Official, MLB.

232
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:01,875
Okay, here we go.

233
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,191
Okay, this is actually a Saint Louis hat

234
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:04,352
that Bob Gibson used.

235
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:06,190
Not the exact same one, but the same style.

236
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,023
So just like Bob Gibson on the mound pitching,

237
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,482
we have to revisit this chart.

238
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:16,399
Let me draw it for you.

239
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,509
I'm gonna step over here.

240
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,087
Hopefully you can still hear me without the microphone.

241
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,254
So here's the chart, okay.

242
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,642
On the x axis here is your age, okay.

243
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,726
And then on the y axis is give a shhh darn,

244
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,492
give a darn, okay, okay.

245
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,242
So stay with me here.

246
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:43,451
In the middle here is what I call the triangle of despair.

247
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:50,337
And when you're younger, you are here

248
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,701
cause you don't care what people think.

249
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:53,811
Right, my kids are like that.

250
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:55,904
I was like that too.

251
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:59,706
Then when you're older, like me, you're here

252
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:02,255
and you don't care what people think.

253
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,736
Cause I'm old and I'm here.

254
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:06,797
Old people don't have confidence problems.

255
00:12:06,797 --> 00:12:08,114
Young kids don't either.

256
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:11,129
Otherwise they wouldn't have meltdowns at restaurants.

257
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:15,709
And so most people are stuck in this triangle of despair.

258
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:18,626
And the key is I want you to remain

259
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:23,022
at this low level here like when you were a kid.

260
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,736
Remember when you were a kid and you were really creative

261
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:27,313
and you didn't care what people thought.

262
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,860
So I want you to stay at this level.

263
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,442
I want you to skip this stupid triangle here

264
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,217
cause it's holding you back.

265
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:35,230
It's holding you back when you care about

266
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,397
what other people think of you, within reason of course.

267
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:43,482
So Bob Gibson is an incredible pitcher.

268
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:48,662
Good, I didn't hit the camera with that.

269
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:52,352
I don't want you to be in jail,

270
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:53,692
(prison bars slamming)

271
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:55,693
this triangle of despair, okay.

272
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,193
I want you to break out of this jail.

273
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:02,448
Successful, confident people are never in this prison,

274
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,809
this triangle prison, right.

275
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:06,584
We need to break out

276
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:08,175
(prison bars opening)

277
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:09,342
of this prison

278
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:14,928
and only then will you be confident enough

279
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:18,754
to present from your heart and free your mind

280
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:22,607
of despair and be confident by being you.

281
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:26,190
