1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:04,952
Please make your speech interesting and entertaining.

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:07,688
If you're gonna do this, then please make sure

3
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:11,198
to make the content somewhat relevant.

4
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:12,451
Here's there ways to make

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:15,642
your presentation a bit more interesting.

6
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,212
#1, mention an interesting fact

7
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:20,213
by showing the cover of a newspaper

8
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:23,392
on a date that is important for your audience.

9
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:24,225
How?

10
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,933
Well, the first way to make your presentation

11
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,750
more interesting is go online

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,459
and you buy or you access a newspaper

13
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:35,626
from a certain date so it's important to your audience.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,688
Remember, remember the so what test, okay,

15
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,105
meaning why is this relevant.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,718
Here's a great idea.

17
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:47,234
If you're presenting to a company or an organization,

18
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:51,272
you can talk about the day the organization was founded,

19
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:53,291
that company was founded, okay?

20
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:57,451
And then buy or get the newspaper from that day

21
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:01,327
and show some cool items from that day in the newspaper.

22
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,636
Here's an example and here's the website you can go to,

23
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:05,919
and there's many others as well,

24
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:09,894
and of course, make it somewhat relevant as well.

25
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,911
If you're presenting at a wedding,

26
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,397
show the newspaper the day the person

27
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:17,722
that you are talking about was born,

28
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:21,826
or if it's a speech that, your parents wedding anniversary,

29
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:25,224
show the newspaper from that day.

30
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:28,057
For my Dad, on March 25th of 2017,

31
00:01:28,937 --> 00:01:31,205
they marked the 50th anniversary that he immigrated

32
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:33,882
from Egypt to Canada, and we're thinking

33
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:37,689
of doing a special 50th anniversary thing for my Dad,

34
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,340
and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,004
the newspaper from that day and kinda walk through that.

36
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,671
It's kind of a nice, cool touch.

37
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,684
And then you can say something interesting like

38
00:01:47,684 --> 00:01:51,550
nothing has changed, or we have come a long way,

39
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,216
or if it's an international crowd, say something in

40
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:59,252
a foreign language in order to be inclusive of them.

41
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,647
(speaking in a foreign language)

42
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:06,675
The more things change, the more they stay the same.

43
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:10,770
You can also go to this website and enter the date

44
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,862
and you will find out exactly what happened

45
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:14,675
on this day in history.

46
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:17,613
If you're having issues coming up with an interesting way

47
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:20,131
to start your speech, then just spend an hour or two

48
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:22,385
going through that day in history

49
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:24,787
and I promise you you'll come up with something.

50
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:27,101
Again, make sure it's somewhat relevant to the topic

51
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,193
and we covered this topic already.

52
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:34,659
For more information, please go to Act Three, Scene One

53
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,967
in the lecture called Starting

54
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:40,800
by Mentioning an Interesting Historical Event.

55
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,860
Unfortunately, your audience cannot pay attention

56
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,318
for more than 15 minutes or so

57
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,151
and this is why TEDx talks are interesting

58
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,927
as most of them are are 15 minutes or less.

59
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,519
We talked about the first way.

60
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,939
Let's talk about the 2nd way now.

61
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,702
The 2nd way to make your presentation more interesting

62
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:03,707
is to personalize the content of your presentation.

63
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:08,618
Reality TV or watching YouTube stars is interesting

64
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:13,293
because it's so real and it doesn't feel scripted.

65
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,322
People might forget what you say in your speech,

66
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:19,728
but they'll never forget how you made them feel.

67
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:22,097
My kids actually, they don't want TV that much.

68
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:24,101
It's a different generational thing.

69
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,655
They watch these YouTube stars.

70
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,061
It's really interesting

71
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:29,593
and they follow the lives of these YouTube stars

72
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,597
like this guy named Rowan Atkins.

73
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:36,167
He's got way more than 10 million followers

74
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,219
and people love it because he's real

75
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,345
and he's documenting his life.

76
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,842
So what's not to love about you being you?

77
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,763
We've covered how to be personal

78
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,610
in a bunch of lectures already.

79
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,153
More information on being personal

80
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:52,723
can be accessed in Act Three, Scene One

81
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:56,660
in the lecture called Starting by Introducing Yourself.

82
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,517
The 3rd way to make your presentation more interesting

83
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:04,733
is through storytelling and being incredibly inspirational,

84
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,011
which we've covered in Act Three, Scene One in a lecture

85
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:11,314
called Starting with Inspiration and Motivation.

86
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:14,950
You can tie in these examples into your presentation

87
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,531
in so many different ways.

88
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:21,632
One way is to show an image or a video and then explain

89
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:24,988
how it's interesting to what you're presenting.

90
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:27,120
It has to tie in remember.

91
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,870
We know that stories work exceptionally well.

92
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,533
Here's some examples that you can use

93
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,572
to make your presentation more interesting

94
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:38,489
by using images, video, or stories.

95
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:43,613
The first example is when the odds are against a group

96
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:46,626
of people and they overcome a challenge

97
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,543
as David beats Goliath.

98
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:51,783
It's so interesting here in Silicon Valley

99
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:54,345
because when I invest in companies,

100
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:56,677
I'm not worried about competition from big companies

101
00:04:56,677 --> 00:04:59,637
like Microsoft, Cisco, or Oracle.

102
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:02,389
I'm worried about a couple girls or guys in a garage

103
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,803
that are gonna disrupt an industry

104
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,687
'cause innovation comes from small groups of people.

105
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,937
David always beats Goliath.

106
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,731
Here's another example if you want to make your speech

107
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,575
more powerful and interesting,

108
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:19,042
you can talk about these stories.

109
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,130
If you have a formidable competitor,

110
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,900
you could say something like this is your time.

111
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,745
Their time is done.

112
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:30,510
It's over for them because our new strategy is,

113
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,683
you get the idea.

114
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:36,161
And just remember since the beginning of time,

115
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,494
people love stories since ancient times.

116
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,841
When I was a kid, I remember at camp with my parents

117
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,056
we'd just kinda sit around a fire

118
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:49,321
and my Dad would tell cool stories and my Mom, too.

119
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:52,523
I loved asking them what it was like growing up,

120
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,396
that sort of thing.

121
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,821
Stories are interesting and entertaining, too,

122
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:00,979
and if we don't entertain, then we know the Smartphones

123
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,146
will win, and it's so hard to get your audience back

124
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:07,853
once you've lost them.

125
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:10,290
So show a video or an image or tell

126
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,765
an interesting story every now and then.

127
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:15,420
It's so incredibly hard again,

128
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,087
to regain an audience once you've lost them.

129
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,260
That's probably why on Udemy,

130
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,323
lessons are usually well-under 20 minutes each.

131
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,403
Udemy kinda know that people might not be able to

132
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:30,061
pay attention for that long.

133
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:31,835
At least that's the way I am, personally.

134
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:35,274
And just remember, when you went a movie one day,

135
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:39,863
remember this, that was so good and so interesting

136
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:42,237
that you didn't look at your watch even once

137
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:45,452
during the movie, and that's what we're aiming for here

138
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:47,224
when we talk about the eye insider

139
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:50,148
making things more interesting.

140
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:54,551
We want to give an unforgettable performance and

141
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:58,718
an unforgettable experience, and not just a presentation.

142
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,066
Steve Jobs was so successful at this,

143
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,703
not only because his content was awesome,

144
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:08,685
but because his delivery and the whole experience

145
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:12,545
of his presentation was very interesting.

146
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:15,069
Whenever he released a new product,

147
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:19,888
it was free PR, all over the world, every media avenue

148
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:21,633
covered it because it was interesting

149
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,480
the way that he presented it.

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,125
We're gonna talk a lot about delivery

151
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,292
in Act Six of this course.

152
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,309
Here's another example of keeping it interesting.

153
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,387
Talk about dreams.

154
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,750
Everybody loves to dream and your audience

155
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,129
will pay more attention and think that the presentation

156
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,955
is more interesting because it's inspiring

157
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:45,158
and the one thing that all people have in common

158
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,454
is they want to feel inspired.

159
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:51,687
We all love how David can beat Goliath, et cetera

160
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:55,854
and if David can beet Goliath, we can crush our competition.

161
00:07:57,136 --> 00:08:01,874
On January 1st, I sent this video I'm about to show you

162
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:04,835
to all my Udemy students thanking them

163
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:08,924
for inspiring me, and this video was actually from

164
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:12,007
one of my Udemy students named Randy.

165
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,601
He did a great job putting this together

166
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:19,381
and not just the video, but also the dialogue

167
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,172
right from the speaker as well as the music,

168
00:08:22,172 --> 00:08:25,525
right from this movie, I think it was called Inception.

169
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:29,931
It is groundbreaking, and this video blew me away.

170
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:33,681
Please check it out and then come back to me.

171
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,363
Okay, welcome back.

172
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:39,196
I'm now gonna change the subjects.

173
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:44,599
You see how I moved a bit here?

174
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:47,845
In Act Six, we're gonna talk about body language

175
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:50,048
and why moving to a new position helps

176
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:53,601
when you talk about a new subject.

177
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,129
Let's discuss dealing with a crisis.

178
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:59,330
How do you motivate an audience to deal with a crisis?

179
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,121
One way is by showing an interesting speech

180
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:07,853
and nobody gives a better speech than Al Pacino.

181
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:09,499
He is inspiring.

182
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,125
He is personal.

183
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,802
In this video clip, Pacino is transparent

184
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,510
and most importantly, he is real.

185
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,743
And of course, this speech is a bit extreme,

186
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:23,412
but the reason I want you to watch these clips

187
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,162
is to give you ideas,

188
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,681
even if it's just a few words or a sentence

189
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:32,996
to include in your masterpiece of a speech.

190
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:34,641
Remember, a light bulb comes down in a few short moments

191
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:38,724
and when you talk in public, that is one of them.

192
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:44,492
Okay, let's revisit quotes.

193
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:48,337
Remember we're talking about the eye insider,

194
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,731
how to keep your speech interesting.

195
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:53,981
I love quotes, but mainly short quotes.

196
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,382
If you show them, make sure that you and the audience

197
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,712
like the person who said it, obviously

198
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:04,764
and again, keep them short because less is more,

199
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,030
just like a tweet.

200
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,302
In fact, in every word of a quote that you're gonna read,

201
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:14,312
or memorize or whatever, pretend that it costs you $100

202
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:17,034
and that will make sure that you have fewer words.

203
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,420
Less is more.

204
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,253
And for 150 awesome quotes to use,

205
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,947
I attached in this exercise a PDF of these quotes.

206
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:31,062
Quotes keep your presentation interesting.

207
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:33,681
Just for more details, I don't want to be redundant,

208
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:37,479
please see Act Three, Scene One in the lecture called

209
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:40,222
Starting with a Quote, 150 Examples Attached.

210
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,305
That's the name of that lecture.
