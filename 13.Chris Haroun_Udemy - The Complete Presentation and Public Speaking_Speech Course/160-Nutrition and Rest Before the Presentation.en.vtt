00:00:00.814 --> 00:00:03.925
Please bring at least one high energy protein bar

2
00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:06.598
and eat it before your speech for extra energy

3
00:00:06.598 --> 00:00:09.836
like a CLIF bar, right, and don't eat too much

4
00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:13.240
complex carbohydrates for breakfast as it might

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.027
make you tired.

6
00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:16.449
We're all different though, right.

7
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.630
Don't have sugar on your breakfast like syrup and stuff

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.017
or anything that can dry your mouth a lot

9
00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:26.445
and always bring a bottle of water,

10
00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.453
I know I've said this before right as they sometimes

11
00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:31.294
forget to give you one there, okay, and if you need

12
00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:34.059
more time to answer a question during the presentation

13
00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.142
you can always take a sip, just kidding, sort of.

14
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.006
Actually, I'm not, okay, all right.

15
00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:45.902
It, you can also cough when thinking

16
00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.069
of the answer.

17
00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:53.864
Yeah, so the answer is this, right, just kidding, sort of.

18
00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:56.191
Right, don't drink too much coffee otherwise you might

19
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:57.974
get the shakes and of course bring an aspirin,

20
00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.735
throat lozenge just in case.

21
00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:02.470
Don't drink anything too colorful.

22
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.967
Very important, right for example, blue Gatorade

23
00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:05.865
which I love.

24
00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.928
Buy clear Gatorade.

25
00:01:07.928 --> 00:01:10.368
Right as it actually quenches your thirst

26
00:01:10.368 --> 00:01:12.618
and there's no color in it.

27
00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:15.881
This Is kind of funny but in one of my courses

28
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:18.631
I drank different colored Gatorade in different lectures

29
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.970
by accident.

30
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.691
So my tongue in my mouth was different colors in each one

31
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.441
and I love blue Gatorade and after I drank it

32
00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:32.732
my son actually said to me WTF dad, why the face, okay,

33
00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:37.359
WTF dad, you look like you just ate a Smurf.

34
00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.607
Don't eat Smurfs.
