00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:04.302
(clacking)

2
00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:07.753
This, this is called a clapper board

3
00:00:07.753 --> 00:00:10.579
and I'm sure you've seen them before.

4
00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.105
They're used when you're making films, okay and,

5
00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:17.499
so why am I holding onto this, right?

6
00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.494
Well, one of the primary uses of a clapper board is to make

7
00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:25.499
sure that the audio is synchronized with the video because

8
00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.997
audio and video is sometimes recorded separately, right.

9
00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:33.731
And you'll see it sometimes you'll be wearing a mic,

10
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:36.832
a lavaliere mic they call it, or a hidden mic,

11
00:00:36.832 --> 00:00:40.207
when you're acting and somebody else will be holding this

12
00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:44.043
this long pole right over you which has another microphone,

13
00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:47.628
right, and they're doing that to record background noise,

14
00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:50.081
right, if they're gonna make it surround sound

15
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:53.871
or 5.1 or 7.1 or whatever it's called these days, right.

16
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:57.454
And what happens is when ya clap it, right,

17
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.526
I'll try and hold it like this so the light doesn't reflect,

18
00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:03.022
there right there, yeah, oh, light's in your eye, sorry.

19
00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:06.003
When you hold it like this,

20
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:10.290
then the post production film editors can make sure that the

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.915
audio and the video are synchronized.

22
00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:15.022
I think I broke part of it.

23
00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:16.176
Oh, the screws fell out, all right.

24
00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.929
Let me put that down.

25
00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.857
All right, you get what you pay for, right.

26
00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:21.812
I got it cheap on Amazon.

27
00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:24.666
All right, so people don't realize how important the

28
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.166
correct audio is for a speech.

29
00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:31.118
You need to change your tone every now and then

30
00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:35.568
from somewhat loud to softer based on what the content is.

31
00:01:35.568 --> 00:01:36.591
Okay?

32
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:40.759
And the next time you watch your favorite television show

33
00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.205
the second before you see the next scene the music changes,

34
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:46.038
right?

35
00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:47.647
Look for it, you'll see.

36
00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:50.130
They do that, right, just for a split second the music

37
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.371
changes and then the scene changes.

38
00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:56.371
And this challenges or actually changes the tone

39
00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.710
or the mood for the next video part of the scene.

40
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.877
It's the opposite of thunder or lightning coming before

41
00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:09.576
thunder, yeah, it's the opposite, anyway it's the opposite.

42
00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:11.819
It's a subconscious thing to get you ready for the next

43
00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.866
scene, okay, just watch for it.

44
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.609
And it's important to change your tone every now

45
00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.875
and then so you don't sound too monotone,

46
00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:21.135
but you don't wanna overdo it,

47
00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:22.576
you sound too arrogant, right.

48
00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:26.990
So, you practice your delivery, record yourself

49
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.617
and make sure that you alter your tone every now

50
00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.465
and then, okay?

51
00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:35.282
And here's two examples from my talks,

52
00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:37.985
or my presentations for what it's worth.

53
00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:40.194
And I make a lot of mistakes, right,

54
00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:42.949
but here are two examples that I think worked out

55
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.614
well, whatever, when I change my tone a little bit in

56
00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:50.185
order to express important points.

57
00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.938
The first one is from one of my TED talks.

58
00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:57.438
Decade ED-Tech Secular Growth Opportunity.

59
00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:00.686
Now, I've talked a bunch about the teacher,

60
00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:02.884
I wanna talk about the student now.

61
00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.827
What a great time to be a student.

62
00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:06.928
See how I stressed that?

63
00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:07.878
What a great time to be a student,

64
00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:10.534
or I think I said, "What great time to be a student," right?

65
00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:13.970
And you know what, it's interesting I love movies,

66
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.533
like we all do, right?

67
00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.127
And I got the idea to alter my tone in that line you

68
00:03:19.127 --> 00:03:23.692
just saw, right, from the movie Gladiator, right,

69
00:03:23.692 --> 00:03:27.199
and I encourage you all to please watch how actors

70
00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.102
change their tone when they present in movies.

71
00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.061
And again I got it from the,

72
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:35.385
I got the idea from Gladiator from an actor named

73
00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:39.552
Oliver Reed and sadly Oliver Reed never saw the movie

74
00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.133
as he passed away before it was released,

75
00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:44.641
before Gladiator came out.

76
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.947
And so what they had to do is they had to use CGI

77
00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:51.298
in order to show him in some scenes, but anyway,

78
00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:54.565
please watch this video clip which is brilliantly called

79
00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:55.953
Win The Crowd, right,

80
00:03:55.953 --> 00:03:57.962
that's what they called the clip, right.

81
00:03:57.962 --> 00:04:02.941
Watch how Oliver Reed changes his tone through his epic

82
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:07.514
delivery here in the Gladiator film when he talks to

83
00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.045
Russell Crowe about the Colosseum

84
00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:11.875
and again that's where I got the idea for my line

85
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:12.951
in my TEDx talk.

86
00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.034
Check it out.

87
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.656
Okay, the second example is from one of my YouTube videos

88
00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:26.814
on how to write a professional journalist, right.

89
00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:28.647
And check it out, here it is.

90
00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:31.397
From your heart even sleep on it.

91
00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:34.808
Then read it the next morning.

92
00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.823
If you still get, you know, the feeling that you wrote it

93
00:04:37.823 --> 00:04:42.166
from the heart and you still get chills and it's so good,

94
00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:44.123
then post it, okay.

95
00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:45.981
And the reason I say that is...

96
00:04:45.981 --> 00:04:48.060
And so I said, "It's so good."

97
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.677
Right, you heard that?

98
00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:51.927
And again I got the idea of changing my tone from the

99
00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:55.930
Gladiator scene that I just you to watch a second ago

100
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.958
and so when you watch movies please learn from how

101
00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.692
these actors present as it can make your speech much

102
00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:08.165
more powerful than your competition speeches, okay.

103
00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:09.875
And just watch how your favorite actors

104
00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:13.369
and actresses change their tones as they're incredibly

105
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.330
engaging when they do that which makes sure that the

106
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.622
audience stays very much engaged as well.
