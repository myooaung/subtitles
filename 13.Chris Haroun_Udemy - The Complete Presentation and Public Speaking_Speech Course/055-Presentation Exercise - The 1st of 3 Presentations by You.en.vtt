00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:03.589
For your first presentation exercise,

2
00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.356
please record yourself with your smartphone

3
00:00:07.356 --> 00:00:11.463
or your smart tablet or laptop or desktop computer

4
00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:12.929
or video camera, okay.

5
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.096
Just present any presentation you want

6
00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:19.669
along with slides that you have

7
00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.419
or will create if possible, okay.

8
00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:25.400
Why are we doing this?

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.148
Well, because I want you to notice the dramatic improvement

10
00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:34.315
in your presentation skills by the end of this course.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.372
Okay, so for this exercise present based on the content

12
00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.830
that you have created so far in your success journal.

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.330
Or any speech you gave or will give, okay.

14
00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:49.421
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

15
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:51.128
Please don't skip the rest of this

16
00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:52.907
to the next lecture, okay.

17
00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:54.603
I want you to please just do this.

18
00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:57.501
Just hear me out, hear me out, okay.

19
00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.546
Make the slides to the best of your abilities, please.

20
00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:02.347
And don't worry, as we will work on

21
00:01:02.347 --> 00:01:05.575
how to make amazing slides later.

22
00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:08.199
If you can't video yourself with the slides,

23
00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:11.953
then just save your slides as something along the lines

24
00:01:11.953 --> 00:01:14.944
of, "Intermission Number One slides."

25
00:01:14.944 --> 00:01:18.027
And again if you've not completed any

26
00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:22.842
or all of the exercises in the success journal,

27
00:01:22.842 --> 00:01:25.519
than just give a presentation based on

28
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.367
a real presentation that you've given

29
00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:30.386
at some point in your life.

30
00:01:30.386 --> 00:01:33.803
Or better yet present on this topic here,

31
00:01:35.686 --> 00:01:38.578
"You 2.0 What Your Perfect Life

32
00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:42.245
"Will Be Like in 2025 and Making It Happen."

33
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.703
Okay?

34
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.614
After you finish recording this video

35
00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:51.587
and making the slides to the best of your abilities

36
00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:54.249
then please save it and put it aside

37
00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.513
as we're going to revisit this crucial video

38
00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:00.907
and these slides that you're going to make.

39
00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:03.128
Okay, we're going to revisit them.

40
00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:05.085
During the second intermission,

41
00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:09.245
which we'll do right after we complete Act number six,

42
00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.433
which is the act that deals with the delivery

43
00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.481
of your presentation.

44
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.972
And so please do the best you can with the slides

45
00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:21.061
as I want you to please compare the slides

46
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:25.023
that you'll create for this intermission

47
00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:26.913
with the slides that you will create

48
00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.735
in the next two intermissions, okay.

49
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:31.535
And in terms of creating slides,

50
00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:34.594
I'm gonna teach you how to do it

51
00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:36.649
right after this intermission.

52
00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:40.640
But I want you to please notice the before and after

53
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.179
differences between your slides and your presentation

54
00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.752
so that you can notice the improvements.

55
00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.773
And don't worry if you're not prepared.

56
00:02:50.773 --> 00:02:53.095
Nobody needs to see this, just you.

57
00:02:53.095 --> 00:02:56.567
Just record it and make it as long or as short

58
00:02:56.567 --> 00:03:00.096
with as many or as few slides as you want to.

59
00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:01.796
It's your call, okay.

60
00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:03.359
I just want to help.

61
00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.905
Then you'll create a better version

62
00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:10.072
of this same presentation in the next intermission exercise.

63
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.888
Thanks a lot.

64
00:03:11.888 --> 00:03:13.378
And please have fun with this.

65
00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:14.211
Thank you.
