1
00:00:01,115 --> 00:00:05,992
Let's talk about the Q&A crutch concept introduction.

2
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:08,924
It's helpful to have frameworks prepared

3
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:11,288
when you're answering questions

4
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:14,862
and you don't need to have the perfect answer,

5
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:16,612
you just have to have a logical framework

6
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:19,215
when you're answering questions.

7
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:21,557
I call this methodology a crutch.

8
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:24,200
I'm gonna give you a couple of crutches.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,053
And again, crutches mean stuff you can fall back on,

10
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:28,701
if you need to.

11
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,720
The answers that I'm gonna provide

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,153
are generic enough to include in many types of answers,

13
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:39,436
if needed and I'm gonna give you a lot of stuff here.

14
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,186
For example, when I was in school

15
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:46,635
and during an exam, when I had to write an essay,

16
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:49,988
I would structure the answer like this.

17
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:54,032
Let's assume the topic is to write about X.

18
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,868
So here's the structure for the introduction

19
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,304
or the first paragraph.

20
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:02,231
The topic of X is controversial

21
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:04,804
as there's many reasons to be in favor or X,

22
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,227
including example number one, example number two,

23
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:10,395
example number 3 and example number 4,

24
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,198
but there are many risks to consider,

25
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,349
including risk one and risk two.

26
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,500
The next paragraph is this.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,583
In terms of example one, bla bla bla.

28
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:24,839
Next paragraph after this is this one.

29
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,741
Moving on to, good transition words,

30
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:30,761
moving on to example number two, bla bla bla.

31
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:33,294
And the next paragraph after that is this.

32
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:37,821
We also must consider example number three, bla bla bla.

33
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:41,228
And the next paragraph after that one is this one here.

34
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:45,395
Lastly, let's discuss example number 4 bla bla bla.

35
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,385
The next paragraph after that one is.

36
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:51,182
Moving on to risk number one bla bla bla.

37
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:54,714
This is kind of a straw dummy of a risk.

38
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,401
You want to give a risk that doesn't obfuscate

39
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:02,360
or confuse your audience or your reader of this essay

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,328
to the extent that they won't want to purchase the product

41
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:05,614
or believe your logic.

42
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:06,992
You want to make it kind of like,

43
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:09,044
I don't know if you've ever seen in the corn fields,

44
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,538
here in American, they have a lot of scarecrows

45
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:13,672
or fake people.

46
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:16,829
They're fake and so you want to create

47
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,945
kind of a straw dummy of a risk

48
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,665
that you can list and then beat up,

49
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:23,381
but it has to be credible as well,

50
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:25,499
it has to be sincere.

51
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:27,609
The next paragraph is this.

52
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:30,960
To be objective, we need to also discus risk number two,

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,127
which is this.

54
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,912
And then here's the concluding paragraph.

55
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:39,467
In conclusion, X is a logical solution

56
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:42,007
because of example one, two, three and four

57
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:46,285
as risk one and risk two are easy to overcome.

58
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:48,452
As such, X is appropriate.

59
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,734
We're not writing an essay, I get it.

60
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:55,426
I just want to give you structures to think about using.

61
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,336
By the way, for those of you that are interested

62
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,828
in writing the GMAT, this is the exact methodology

63
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:04,263
I use when writing the essay portion of the GMAT

64
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:05,358
and I'm sure that it's applicable

65
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,907
to other standardized tests as well.

66
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:10,157
Okay, we're done with that.

67
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:14,923
I kind of wanted to mention that,

68
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:17,815
because if you're stuck during a question,

69
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,710
during a presentation, it's framework

70
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,694
you can kind of fall back on.

71
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:22,678
There's a bunch of other frameworks

72
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:24,151
I'll talk about too.

73
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:27,560
And again, these frameworks buy you time to think

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,701
as it takes a few seconds to repeat the framework

75
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,034
to the audience.

76
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:36,709
Most importantly though, using that framework

77
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:41,135
shows that you think and you communicate logically

78
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:43,468
in a well structured manner.

79
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:47,576
When it comes to frameworks to use

80
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:49,446
when giving a speech to answering questions,

81
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,947
we're gonna discuss three things.

82
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:55,800
One, qualitative frameworks or crutches to fall back on.

83
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,923
Two, quantitative frameworks or crutches to fall back on.

84
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:02,474
And three, help I have no idea how to answer this,

85
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:04,096
so please give me a framework that I can use

86
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,248
to answer any question.

87
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,919
That's what I call that one.
