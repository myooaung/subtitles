00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:05.661
Alright, let's kick off P.I.M.C.O. With P for pictures.

2
00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:07.078
Fix my hair here.

3
00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:11.051
Please take every opportunity you can to replace

4
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:15.043
too many words with pictures or images.

5
00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:17.571
Okay, there's a saying that a picture is worth

6
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:21.891
a thousand words and I certainly believe it.

7
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:26.312
And this is why Pinterest and Snapchat and Instagram

8
00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:29.344
are more popular than the Economist or writing

9
00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:32.232
letters or reading boring newspapers online

10
00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.482
with no images.

11
00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:38.803
So, people don't read as much as they used to.

12
00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:40.781
You know, if you get a really long email,

13
00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:43.552
you know what I mean, you're probably not going to read it.

14
00:00:43.552 --> 00:00:47.920
If somebody posts a really long text entry in Facebook,

15
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.203
most people won't read it.

16
00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:54.370
And media consumption attention spans have changed a lot.

17
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.141
And we've got to adapt to this because on slides

18
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:02.971
we have to have more pictures than words, right.

19
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:05.162
It's just a new concept.

20
00:01:05.162 --> 00:01:07.581
People don't want to read as much as they used to.

21
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.891
I mean, when was the last time you read a 5000

22
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:12.152
word editorial, right?

23
00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:13.461
It's tough to finish these things anymore

24
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:16.002
because there's so many distractions, right.

25
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.221
And they're visual distractions usually, right.

26
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:22.621
So, we're gonna use images and pictures whenever

27
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:25.272
we can instead of words on our slides.

28
00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:28.101
And if we use words, we're going to try to use

29
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:30.211
fewer words if we can unless it's an

30
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.461
incredibly inspiring quote.

31
00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:35.883
And just pretend that in general that every word

32
00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:39.509
that you put on a slide that is not a pertinent

33
00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.259
quote costs you $100.

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.008
Now, we understand why pictural websites rock

35
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.088
like Instagram or Snapchat and Pinterest

36
00:01:50.088 --> 00:01:52.749
versus boring text websites or boring slides.

37
00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.589
I think you guys get the idea.

38
00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:57.048
Okay, and it's not that often you get to be incredibly

39
00:01:57.048 --> 00:02:00.309
creative in business and putting images on a slide

40
00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:02.337
is actually a lot of fun.

41
00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:06.920
And beautiful images, you know, make your presentation

42
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.670
a visual masterpiece.

43
00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:11.709
And so, again, whenever you can, please replace

44
00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.000
text with images and just think how Facebook had

45
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.800
to buy Instagram or Snapchat has been incredibly

46
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.648
successful or why Pinterest has been very successful.

47
00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:25.749
And so, when we were younger, we were all encouraged

48
00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.579
to be very creative at school and artistic.

49
00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.408
And I actually remember, it's a bit off topic here,

50
00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:35.768
sorry, but I remember as a kid laughing so

51
00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:37.351
hard until it hurt.

52
00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.779
And then when we finish school and we join a corporation

53
00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.960
we don't create and we don't laugh like we used to anymore.

54
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.710
Why is that the case?

55
00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.256
Well, I say why not?

56
00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:53.299
Presenting hasn't really evolved like technology

57
00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.808
and (inaudible) communications have evolved.

58
00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:00.288
And just visualize whenever you can.

59
00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:03.389
For example, I teach a course that covers

60
00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.408
finance and accounting and it can be a very dry

61
00:03:06.408 --> 00:03:07.825
and boring topic.

62
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.091
But I try to make it more interesting with

63
00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.591
a visualization of a road map.

64
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.301
And it's kind of like when Nike advertises,

65
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:22.930
they don't use all text, they use visuals

66
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.901
and a few words like just do it.

67
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.789
And you've all seen those commercials.

68
00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.299
And just check out how much better Nike ads

69
00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.011
or commercials have gotten compared to their older ones.

70
00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:37.638
And here's some new cool ones here.

71
00:03:37.638 --> 00:03:40.080
And then some old ones, you can see the difference.

72
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.261
See how there's too much text on the older ones?

73
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:45.611
Pictures work incredibly well.

74
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.600
And Nike adapted and they are incredibly

75
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.669
successful because they adapted.

76
00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.240
They changed with the times.

77
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.341
And they were thought leaders, too.

78
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:55.629
And we're gonna adapt as well and we're gonna

79
00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.869
be thought leaders.

80
00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.408
We're gonna use visuals as often as we can

81
00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:03.680
to replace too many words on a slide.

82
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.318
And a picture alone is worth a thousand words.

83
00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:11.409
Most other text is not inspiring.

84
00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.101
Quotes are fine because they inspire us.

85
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.360
Visuals are crucial because nobody can really

86
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.527
concentrate for more than 10 or 15 minutes anymore.

87
00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:24.771
Short video clips are great as well.

88
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:28.400
They're great visuals to mix it all up.

89
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.011
And I presented recently to a business school,

90
00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:35.729
I think the MBA program was (inaudible).

91
00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.348
And I wanted to explain Silicon Valley to them

92
00:04:38.348 --> 00:04:42.040
and how it's changing and how people don't

93
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.464
want to work in Palo Alto anymore because

94
00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:46.469
it's shallow Alto, just kidding.

95
00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.971
People actually want to work in San Francisco.

96
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:50.920
It's a bigger city, it's, I don't know,

97
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.341
if you're young and you're single,

98
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:53.469
you kind of want to live in a big city

99
00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.400
and not the suburbs, right, where I live now

100
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.079
which is a little bit more boring than a big city.

101
00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:01.619
So, what I did, was I showed these slides,

102
00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:04.800
and then I also showed a video on how the

103
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.971
San Francisco skyline is changing as salesforce.com

104
00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:13.320
built the tallest building in the history of the city.

105
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.941
So, just show these types of visuals and break up

106
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:21.141
your presentation with video clips or people

107
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:25.080
will focus on their smart phones and not on you.

108
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.501
And once you lose an audience, it's almost

109
00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:29.834
impossible to win them back.

110
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.410
And so, when you use images in presentations,

111
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.317
of course, keep the audience characteristics in mind

112
00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:41.760
and show images that everyone recognizes

113
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.640
or identifies with, right.

114
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.304
And in articles that I wrote online in my ink.com

115
00:05:48.304 --> 00:05:52.091
column or on LinkedIn, often the ones that do

116
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.480
the best, meaning the ones that get the most views

117
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.381
or likes, whatever, have images of characters

118
00:05:58.381 --> 00:06:00.214
that we all recognize.

119
00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:06.040
And I'll go in to much more detail on image

120
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.469
manipulation in the next scene, but here are a

121
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.669
few resources for you to access online images

122
00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.920
for your presentations.

123
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.478
So, for photos, you can use, just see the URLs here,

124
00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:23.429
the web addresses, imagechef.com or dreamstime.com

125
00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:26.596
or istockphotos.com, freeiconspng.com.

126
00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:33.170
You can also get music, right, at premiumbeat.com.

127
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.571
A lot of music I put actually into my trailers

128
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:37.071
I'll get from premiumbeat.com.

129
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:40.240
And for videos you can go to a website to

130
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.657
get stock footage called videoblocks.com.

131
00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:47.748
That's what the professional journalists use,

132
00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:50.349
they go to videoblocks.com.

133
00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:52.248
A guy from Forbes told me about that recently.

134
00:06:52.248 --> 00:06:54.440
It's a good resource, use it please.

135
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.600
And simplistic images that reveal emotion work

136
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.811
really, really well.

137
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:03.941
And with Nike you think I can do it, etc.

138
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:06.888
But let's take a look at Coca-Cola.

139
00:07:06.888 --> 00:07:09.811
There's a reason that that brand is so successful

140
00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:13.309
because that brand is all about simplicity

141
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:14.892
and emotion, right.

142
00:07:16.989 --> 00:07:19.621
And Coca-Cola actually created the concept of

143
00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:23.090
Santa Claus dressed in white and red.

144
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.109
If your kids are around, I should have said in

145
00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:27.291
hindsight, mute that please.

146
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:29.709
But there's a reason why Pepsi doesn't use

147
00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:33.120
Santa Claus very often in commercials, but Coca-Cola does.

148
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.286
Again, they created just the concept of what Santa wears.

149
00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:38.619
Right, Santa is real.

150
00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:42.598
Okay, so, if these brilliant marketers on Madison Avenue

151
00:07:42.598 --> 00:07:46.240
and all over the world went over huge groups of

152
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.990
people with simplistic messaging that elicits

153
00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:53.360
an emotion then that's exactly what

154
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.360
we're gonna do, okay.

155
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.857
And when you see advertisements or billboards,

156
00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:00.571
commercials from now on, when you're on the highway,

157
00:08:00.571 --> 00:08:03.744
just look at the best ones and just check out

158
00:08:03.744 --> 00:08:06.404
how simplistic they are because they draw on

159
00:08:06.404 --> 00:08:10.144
an emotion, you know, from the viewer.

160
00:08:10.144 --> 00:08:12.256
And then what happens is you see that they incorporate

161
00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:14.923
that into the billboard picture.

162
00:08:16.424 --> 00:08:17.502
And I want you to do the same thing,

163
00:08:17.502 --> 00:08:20.443
please do the same thing with your slides.

164
00:08:20.443 --> 00:08:24.144
And you can actually also de-emphasize an image

165
00:08:24.144 --> 00:08:28.125
by blurring it out a little bit kinda like I do here.

166
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:31.355
And focus on words via software.

167
00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:34.696
And I'll cover how to do that later in the course.

168
00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:36.856
Image simplicity works, right.

169
00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:39.864
I mean check out Google, they're website here

170
00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:42.942
versus the cluttered version of Yahoo's website.

171
00:08:42.942 --> 00:08:47.095
I mean how many people use Yahoo to search anymore?

172
00:08:47.095 --> 00:08:51.262
And subconscious imagery also works really, really well.

173
00:08:53.085 --> 00:08:56.195
Take a lot of time on this and really enjoy the process.

174
00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:57.478
It's a lot of fun.

175
00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:59.233
And here's an example.

176
00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:01.483
Look at this logo of FedEx.

177
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:04.044
The world on time.

178
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:07.771
That's their moniker or whatever, their catchphrase.

179
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:09.350
But look at the logo of FedEx.

180
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.541
Do you see the arrow?

181
00:09:10.541 --> 00:09:11.541
Look closer.

182
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.381
See the forward arrow, right.

183
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:18.731
This is a very forward thinking company.

184
00:09:18.731 --> 00:09:21.861
And I actually kind of use this in my logo as well

185
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.028
on my website.

186
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:27.512
Except I wanted to kind of elicit or subconsciously

187
00:09:27.512 --> 00:09:31.240
sew a message of how the sky is not the limit

188
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.536
and there's an arrow pointing up in my logo.

189
00:09:34.536 --> 00:09:37.843
Humor and self deprecation in images works

190
00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.334
really well, as well.

191
00:09:39.334 --> 00:09:40.762
And we're going to cover this in more detail

192
00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:43.762
in act six when we discuss delivery.

193
00:09:48.492 --> 00:09:52.192
And there's a guy named Marc with a C that used this

194
00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:56.359
in a presentation that I thought was pretty funny.

195
00:09:57.512 --> 00:09:59.942
And it also works for Bryan with a Y as well

196
00:09:59.942 --> 00:10:02.232
per this image here.

197
00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:04.264
And the bottom line is that I want you

198
00:10:04.264 --> 00:10:06.642
to please try to replace as many words as you can

199
00:10:06.642 --> 00:10:09.984
in your presentations with images.

200
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:13.952
A presentation that is delivered with passion

201
00:10:13.952 --> 00:10:16.483
and with images is certainly a winning combination.

202
00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:20.454
Plus it's so much more fun to make presentations

203
00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:22.204
with images, as well.
