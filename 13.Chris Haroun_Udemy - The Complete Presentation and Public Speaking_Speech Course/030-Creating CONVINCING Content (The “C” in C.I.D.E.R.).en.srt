1
00:00:00,356 --> 00:00:04,078
When you give your presentation, you need to prove

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:07,407
that your bottom line message is convincing.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,067
You might want to consider ways of being

4
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:14,103
qualitatively as well as quantitatively convincing

5
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:19,089
as there might well be data-focused people in the audience.

6
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,179
I was recently on a panel,

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,185
and a guy that was on that panel with me

8
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:25,919
was named Carl Page.

9
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:27,455
He's actually the older brother

10
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:29,944
of Google Co-Founder Larry Page.

11
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:32,360
In fact, Carl mentored Larry Page

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,459
when Larry first started Google.

13
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,813
So what, Chris? Why do you mention this?

14
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:39,514
Well, this was an opportunity for me to ask

15
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:43,977
Carl for advice on why he and his brother are so successful.

16
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,727
He actually told me that his dad,

17
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:50,516
who was a great professor in Michigan,

18
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:54,696
told them that without data to back up a thesis

19
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:58,279
then it's just an opinion and nothing more.

20
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:02,395
If you don't have data to back up a thesis,

21
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,209
it's an opinion and nothing more.

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,976
I thought that was interesting.

23
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:11,217
So, please consider finding data to back up your speech

24
00:01:11,217 --> 00:01:14,084
if it's a corporate speech.

25
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:18,251
I've been trying to be a guest columnist or guest writer

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,059
in The New York Times for years.

27
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:24,657
I keep submitting my articles to The New York Times

28
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:27,241
but they won't publish it.

29
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,021
A friend of mine told me,

30
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:32,927
"Chris, it's because you need to have more data"

31
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,835
or proof of my arguments or statements.

32
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:37,910
I guess this is why I haven't really

33
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,946
been in The New York Times yet.

34
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,534
You gotta have a lot more footnotes

35
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,359
kinda like you do when you write papers.

36
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,026
On a personal level,

37
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,189
my dad reads The New York Times every single day

38
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,997
and my dream is for him to open up

39
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:55,014
The New York Times one day and say,

40
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,514
"Jackie, look here, Chris wrote an article

41
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:04,507
"in The New York Times (speaks in foreign language)!"

42
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:08,090
I guess we never stop looking for approval.

43
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,885
So, data is important.

44
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:16,196
Any time you can insert a picture instead of boring words

45
00:02:16,196 --> 00:02:19,699
then your audience will be more engaged.

46
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,809
It's like if you're on an airplane

47
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,814
and in the seat pocket in front of you

48
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,717
there's People Magazine or The Economist.

49
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,501
What would you read?

50
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,548
Most people would start off with People Magazine

51
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:36,174
because it's light, it's more entertaining,

52
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,989
it takes less amount of time to digest.

53
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,968
It's just images and it's fun to look at.

54
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:45,216
What's really popular today

55
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:48,138
is something called infographics

56
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:52,275
which is a visual way to look at data or trends.

57
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:55,361
Here's a few very simple examples

58
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:57,694
from the cover of USA Today.

59
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:02,852
Here's some other examples here of infographics.

60
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:06,973
News websites are really on a downfall

61
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,321
unless they become much more Pinterest-like.

62
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:16,018
Visual-based websites are on the upswing

63
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:19,508
and infographics seem to be replacing traditional

64
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:23,311
news stories because they're just more fun to read.

65
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:26,744
Pictures work best, or else we would

66
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:30,001
take notes on what our kids would say

67
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,480
instead of taking pictures of them.

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,665
Do both if you can.

69
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:39,455
There's a reason why Instagram and Snapchat are successful.

70
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:43,455
So, we need to adapt our presentation styles too

71
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:47,505
in order to be more visual

72
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:51,362
and appeal to all demographics in the long run.

73
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:54,746
To learn how to create an infographic yourself,

74
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:58,299
please see the lecture in this course called

75
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:00,958
Act 4, Slides Scene 3:

76
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,837
Creating Animations to Explain Complex Topics.

77
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,596
We'll get there soon.

78
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,498
Now let's talk about how to get data

79
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:12,998
or informational sources for our speeches.

80
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:17,905
If you want to be really, really convincing

81
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:21,186
then mine your own data through online surveys

82
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:24,769
that you can create using Surveymonkey.com.

83
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,529
I actually paid for this sample survey.

84
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:32,866
Here are the results.

85
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:37,797
Your company can pay for this market research as well

86
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,910
if you're giving a corporate presentation.

87
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,389
My wife Christina is going to kill me

88
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,431
when she sees the MasterCard bill.

89
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:44,264
Just kidding.

90
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,557
I wanna help you.

91
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:47,233
I wanna be resourceful.

92
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,713
So here's the infographic results

93
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,046
of that Surveymonkey report.

94
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:58,141
Here's a cheaper way to do it.

95
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:00,141
You can go to Fiverr.com

96
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:03,590
Five with two Rs

97
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,019
F-I-V-E-R-R .com

98
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,786
You can also get a poll there as well.

99
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:13,953
(gentle guitar music)

100
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:21,275
Let's say you're doing a presentation

101
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:24,549
on a certain topic and you want data

102
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:28,689
but you have no idea what kind of data and where to start.

103
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,070
Well here's another cool product for you.

104
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,059
It's this really neat website called Wolfram.

105
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:37,142
(uptempo jazz music)

106
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,271
Now if your company has a very, very big budget

107
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:45,947
you can use this product

108
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,459
that McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group,

109
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:50,886
and other top consulting firms use.

110
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:55,357
Consultants are paid to analyze data and help companies.

111
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,422
Quite often, they use data

112
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:01,589
as their main source of ways to prove to their clients

113
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,169
that they have to change their business model.

114
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,501
You might be able to get a free demo of this product.

115
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:13,035
It's a company called Quid.

116
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,405
It's Q-U-I-D .com

117
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:18,837
Coincidentally, their office is one floor below

118
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,504
Udemy's office in San Francisco.

119
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,220
(uptempo jazz music)

120
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:37,460
Alternatively, if you are giving a presentation

121
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,393
on a company that is publicly traded

122
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,483
you can go to whatever government website

123
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:47,650
these companies have to list financial data at by law.

124
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,026
For example, let's say you're giving a presentation

125
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,917
on the future of the auto market and which companies

126
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:58,540
might be influential in this market one day.

127
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,045
Well what we could do is we could go to Sec.gov

128
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:06,505
that's the Securities and Exchange Commission.gov

129
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:08,126
that's a government website of course

130
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:11,664
and find the annual reports for companies like Google

131
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:15,831
and then we can quote these annual reports just like this.

132
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:23,746
Now let's say you're giving a presentation

133
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,978
and you want to put data in your presentation

134
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,453
on the topic of Human Resources.

135
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:32,702
You have no idea what to present and you just need ideas.

136
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:36,317
Go to Google and see what the auto response is

137
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:39,038
for "what is human resources"

138
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,780
"why does human resources etc."

139
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,947
Just check this out.

140
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:46,579
When you start typing something, a drop box appears

141
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:48,916
and you can kind of find out

142
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,691
what the most popular searches are

143
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,413
and it might spark an idea for you.

144
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,924
Here's another one for you.

145
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:59,460
Go to Quora.com, that's Q-U-O-R-A.com

146
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,528
and search on your presentation topic

147
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:04,861
for data or reference ideas.

148
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,760
(upbeat space rock music)

149
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:19,000
For example, if we're presenting on Nintendo.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,417
You get the idea.

151
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:23,582
There are many ways to get data

152
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:26,297
or facts for your presentation.

153
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:28,902
The examples we just went through

154
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,006
can really help you come up with cool ideas

155
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,849
for your presentation as well.

156
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:37,935
The best way to make it engaging data

157
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:41,882
is by using interesting charts that are convincing.

158
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:46,359
Okay, this one's really not that convincing (chuckles).

159
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:51,274
Citing facts from reputable sources makes sense as well.

160
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:54,106
"According to the Ministry of Transportation,

161
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:55,046
"blah blah blah."

162
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:59,298
This works better than a generic comment like this,

163
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,837
"According to people familiar with the matter,

164
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:04,286
four out of five Canadians comprises 80%

165
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,831
of the population in Canada."

166
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:10,998
So just try to have reputable sources like big publications.

167
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,626
Also, try to use at least one

168
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:19,309
staggering statistic in your presentation.

169
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:21,623
Steve Jobs actually did this a lot

170
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,185
and of course it worked out incredibly well

171
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:25,771
for him when he presented.

172
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:30,504
Use facts to convince people and build up your argument

173
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,504
if it seems far-fetched.

174
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:36,181
For example, during my TEDx Talk,

175
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:39,721
which we'll analyze in more detail later,

176
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:43,185
I tried to convince people that everyone in the world

177
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:47,352
has as much access, or should have as much access,

178
00:10:48,223 --> 00:10:52,390
to unfiltered internet data sources as food and water.

179
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:57,079
That, I said, is a basic fundamental human right

180
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,059
we should all have.

181
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,892
I know it sounds really far-fetched.

182
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,202
But I approached it this way

183
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:05,699
so people didn't just throw it aside as being ridiculous.

184
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,249
Maybe they did, who knows.

185
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:09,682
But I started like this:

186
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:13,557
I started by discussing the Berlin Air Lift in 1948

187
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:18,035
and how the Allied Nations flew literally 200,000 flights

188
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,963
over Berlin in that year, 1948

189
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:25,002
to drop off basic necessities like food and water

190
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:29,137
to those that were imprisoned behind this Berlin Wall.

191
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:31,945
Then later, I spoke about offering

192
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:34,835
unfiltered access to the internet

193
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:39,002
as being a fundamental human right, a basic necessity.

194
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:44,394
Similarly, lawyers use the same convincing tactic.

195
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:48,606
If you watch TV shows about law or movies about law,

196
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:52,773
watch how lawyers use qualitative logic to be convincing.

197
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,242
In fact, please check out this epic courtroom scene

198
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:02,409
of Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men.

199
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,671
It's not too realistic, but you get the idea.

200
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:10,300
It's entertaining and the content and delivery is superb.

201
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,383
Check it out!

202
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,501
It can't be convincing if nobody understands it.

203
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:23,721
There's a brilliant man named Rubin Gruber.

204
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:27,888
He and I were on the Board up at McGill University

205
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,317
for a special startup group called The Dobson Cup.

206
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:37,535
We would analyze business models from students

207
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:40,043
and then vote who wins best business model of the year,

208
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:42,237
that sort of thing.

209
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:43,776
But I only mention this because

210
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:46,724
I had dinner with Rubin when I was up there.

211
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,904
He started Sonus and a bunch of other great companies.

212
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:53,153
He rarely fails; he's so incredibly successful.

213
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,752
So I actually asked him,

214
00:12:55,752 --> 00:13:00,729
"Rubin, why are you so successful? What do you do?

215
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,937
"What's your secret?"

216
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:04,583
And he mentioned the usual stuff, like,

217
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,828
"I've always done what I've been incredibly

218
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,486
passionate about, I love what I'm doing..."

219
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,863
I drilled down, as I always do, and he said

220
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:14,693
that before he starts a tech company...

221
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,955
He lives in Boston.

222
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:18,356
Before he starts a tech company, he flies up to Montreal

223
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:21,126
and has dinner with his 90-year old mother,

224
00:13:21,126 --> 00:13:23,607
who is not a techie at all.

225
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:25,604
He says that if she doesn't understand

226
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,528
the business model during dinner,

227
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:33,348
then he does not invest in the company or start the company.

228
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:35,412
I thought that was quite brilliant.

229
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:39,555
It's genius because if not every one understands

230
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:41,560
your product, you're not going to have many people

231
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,761
want to buy it.

232
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:46,174
If not many people understand your business model,

233
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,018
you're not going to get many investors.

234
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:51,971
Actually, when I worked at a large hedge fund

235
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:55,244
called Citadel, Management would always critique by saying,

236
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:59,342
"If you can't explain it, then you don't understand it."

237
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:03,206
You don't have to include all of this when you present.

238
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:06,269
I just want to save you some time.

239
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,535
So you know where to go if you need access

240
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:11,822
to stuff online to beef up the arguments

241
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:14,799
or data within your presentation.

242
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,446
During the presentation, you can right-click

243
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:22,615
during the Q&A Session and show additional slides

244
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:26,592
or data-oriented slides that you didn't include

245
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:29,175
or you have as extra resources.

246
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:32,617
Here's an example here.

247
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:34,921
You can right-click on, for example, PowerPoint,

248
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,717
and go to a bunch of slides later on

249
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:38,887
and it will make you look like a million bucks.

250
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:41,757
Don't worry if that sounds a little bit confusing right now

251
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:45,906
because I'm going to cover exactly how to do this,

252
00:14:45,906 --> 00:14:47,913
exactly how to answer questions in the Q&A Section

253
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,450
in Act 7 of this course, called,

254
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,950
"Q&A and Reading the Audience"

255
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:57,321
Alright, we are done with "The C in CIDER, C-I-D-E-R"

256
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:59,063
which again stands for Convincing.

257
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:00,469
In the next lecture, we're going to talk about

258
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:03,873
the "I" in CIDER, which stands for Interesting.

259
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:04,706
Thank you.
