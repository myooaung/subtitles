1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:04,373
I'm not a PR or a public relations expert by any means.

2
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:08,457
But I've seen a lot of executives answering questions,

3
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:12,270
when there is a crisis or potential crisis

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,574
occurring with their company, or their product,

5
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:16,080
or their service.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,460
And there's definitely an art to this.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,498
And I've seen CEOs turning a crisis weakness

8
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:23,532
into an incredible strength.

9
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:26,143
Or at least a less bad situation, right?

10
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:27,476
It, for example,

11
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,235
if the question is about a product that had an issue

12
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:35,163
the CEO could respond by saying this.

13
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:37,530
Thank you for the question.

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,710
Here at XYZ Company,

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,700
we have always had the highest quality products

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,080
in the industry, as our products are tested three times each

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,478
before we sell them.

18
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:51,060
Unlike the competition that only test the product one time,

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,893
et cetera.

20
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:52,888
You get the idea.

21
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:55,704
And you'd never mention the competition's name, right?

22
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:56,537
You don't mention the company.

23
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:58,276
It makes you look bad, okay?

24
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:01,226
Okay so I want to discuss a real life example

25
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:02,597
of this in action.

26
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:03,755
Okay.

27
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:07,926
When the late great CEO of Intel, Andy Grove,

28
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:11,176
answered a crisis of an issue question,

29
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:15,497
about Intel's Pentium Processor.

30
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:18,095
Which at that time, back I think it was the early '90s,

31
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:19,209
or '94 whatever.

32
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,202
The Pentium Processor actually miscalculated

33
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:25,744
certain incredibly complex calculations, okay?

34
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:27,911
And Mr. Grove, Andy Grove,

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,592
went on all of the major news programs

36
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,771
to discuss the strategy for dealing with this issue.

37
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,308
I remember this was back in 1994

38
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:37,395
and I searched online everywhere

39
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:40,534
and I can't find that video otherwise I'd show you, okay?

40
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,788
It, you know what this was actually,

41
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:44,873
it was interesting, right?

42
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:47,044
Because this was the first time many people

43
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:49,356
ever heard of Intel, right?

44
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:50,751
Who made you know chips inside a PC

45
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,517
you can't see, feel or touch, right?

46
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:56,017
So he ended up unintentionally

47
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,143
using this

48
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,988
as an unintentional,

49
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:04,088
brilliant, free PR campaign.

50
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:05,834
Kind of like when Apple introduces a product

51
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,667
the media's all over it.

52
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,238
It's free PR, right?

53
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,873
Separately,

54
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:11,827
Andy Grove wrote about this

55
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:14,606
in one of my favorite business books ever.

56
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,575
Which is called Only the Paranoid Survive.

57
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:17,858
Read if you get a chance.

58
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:22,202
It actually deals with the Michael Porter Five Forces model.

59
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:23,035
But it adds

60
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:27,274
one more force which is a strategic inflection point, right?

61
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:28,916
Like when an industry changes.

62
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,281
And the example he gave in this book,

63
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,576
I'm sorry I'm going off topic here

64
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:33,267
you can skip ahead in the next section if you want.

65
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:34,769
The example he gave in the book

66
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,454
was the Japanese companies that were competing with Intel

67
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:41,409
you know back in the '70s and '80s.

68
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:42,889
In the RAM market.

69
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:43,722
DRAM market.

70
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,059
And Intel couldn't compete,

71
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:47,066
it was a strategic inflection point on price.

72
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,536
So Intel transitioned to make processors

73
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,775
which is the brain of the computer instead.

74
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:52,827
Anyway read if you get a chance.

75
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:56,123
It's a great read and God bless Andy Grove.

76
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:56,956
Thank you.
