00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.686
When you spend too much time reading your slides,

2
00:00:03.686 --> 00:00:07.853
the audience also focuses only on the slides and not on you.

3
00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:12.237
So please try to minimize reading slides

4
00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:16.163
and I tend to do it mainly when there is a quote

5
00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:18.774
that I can't completely remember, which to be intellectually

6
00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:23.363
honest is the result of me not preparing enough.

7
00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:27.357
However, by the time you're done with the preparation

8
00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:30.813
portion of this course, which is in Act Number Eight,

9
00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:33.784
then you'll be more than ready to present.

10
00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:35.940
And you'll actually be very excited to do it

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.752
and you're gonna enjoy giving the presentation to the extent

12
00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:42.477
that you'll actually be a little bit sad when it's over.

13
00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:44.394
Kinda like a good book.

14
00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:47.877
When I turned the last couple pages of this one,

15
00:00:47.877 --> 00:00:50.939
I was sad, it's like a part of you that's gone, you know?

16
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:55.106
And another I guess silly little analogy or example is,

17
00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:59.393
you know when you really study hard for a test,

18
00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:03.357
like really really hard, and you go into that test,

19
00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:05.282
and this is very rare for me at least,

20
00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:08.219
but you go into the test, and you ace it,

21
00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.205
and it's so easy but you enjoy it because you prepared

22
00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.910
so much for it, it's kinda like that, it's kinda like that.

23
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.494
So anyway.

24
00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:21.003
You should only look at the slides quickly to see

25
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:25.116
where you are in the presentation as one word or a couple

26
00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:29.283
words should remind you what you need to talk about.

27
00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:33.521
And we'll cover this in a lot more detail

28
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:36.742
and I'll give many many more preparation tips

29
00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:38.792
in Act Number Eight when we talk

30
00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:41.625
about how to prepare for a speech.
