00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:12,999
We're shooting a profile shot,

00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:17,166
with the sun in the background, glistening on the water.

21
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:39,042
Out of the sun.

22
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:40,804
What are you saying?

23
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:42,417
Well we're setting up our last shot here.

24
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,007
It's pretty nice out here at Baker Beach.

25
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:44,886
Oh, we're getting the bridge right over there,

26
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,062
the sun right over here, and our day crew

27
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:49,526
and it's been going really good.

28
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:50,359
Good.

30
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:58,239

32
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,025

Yeah.

35
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:06,929
(Cameraman chuckles)

36
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:11,245
You, Tom?

37
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,078
Good day?
