00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.797
Please open up your success journal

2
00:00:02.797 --> 00:00:04.426
and turn to exercise number five

3
00:00:04.426 --> 00:00:07.098
which is called creating the content.

4
00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:08.848
Let it all out, okay.

5
00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:11.538
In this exercise,

6
00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:14.066
we will write down the content, right,

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:18.233
and potential ideas that we wanna include in our speech,

8
00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:21.407
including stuff you might wanna say,

9
00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:22.717
quotes you might wanna use,

10
00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:25.577
images, video, props, whatever it is,

11
00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:27.386
entertaining things,

12
00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:29.378
different or unique ideas,

13
00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:30.726
educational content,

14
00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:33.504
and other relevant content, okay.

15
00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:37.671
And please only complete the left-hand green shaded column

16
00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:41.032
in this exercise, okay?

17
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.397
As we will complete the silver and gold shaded columns

18
00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:48.277
in future exercises and not this one, okay?

19
00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:50.698
And I actually included 100 rows,

20
00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:54.978
but please feel free to add or delete rows, okay?

21
00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:56.915
And just please take your time with this

22
00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:01.176
and just have fun and literally let it all out, right?

23
00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:02.625
Even if you're not sure

24
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:06.167
where to put the content in your speech or the images

25
00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:08.298
or if one should be included or not.

26
00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:11.287
Just let it all out, okay?

27
00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:16.018
Also, think about how you want your audience to feel.

28
00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:18.525
What emotions do you want them to feel, right?

29
00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:22.026
Don't think of structure in the content yet at all, okay?

30
00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:26.407
Just free form document and let it all out.

31
00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:29.306
And if you don't feel like you're in the right mood

32
00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:32.207
or the right creative frame of mind to do this exercise

33
00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:35.517
then just please pause me and come back to this exercise

34
00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:37.167
tomorrow morning, right?

35
00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:38.786
Or on a weekend, all right?

36
00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:41.266
Just get up early any day to do it, right?

37
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.087
And it's crucial please.

38
00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:47.526
It's crucial that you spend a lot of time doing this.

39
00:01:47.526 --> 00:01:48.447
And if possible,

40
00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:52.127
do it when you're in the right frame of mind, right?

41
00:01:52.127 --> 00:01:55.271
And so here's a quick example.

42
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:58.745
If we are presenting about how we are going to

43
00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.087
take market share from competitor X

44
00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.465
that might we include these line items.

45
00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:07.632
(upbeat techno music)
