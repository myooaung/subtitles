1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,895
Keep your delivery simple

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:03,984
and try not to use words

3
00:00:03,984 --> 00:00:07,203
that you wouldn't normally use in a conversation.

4
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:08,811
Keep it really simple.

5
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:11,597
And I worked at a hedge fund called Citadel,

6
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:14,401
and I remember my boss telling me,

7
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:16,622
"Chris, if you can't explain it

8
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:18,110
"in easy understandable terms,

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,120
"then you don't understand it."

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,130
And he was right.

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:21,963
It's true.

12
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:24,531
And Steve Jobs was great at this,

13
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:27,140
as he said that the iPod Shuffle

14
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,380
was as small as a pack of gum,

15
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,305
or that the iPod was the size of a deck of cards,

16
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:35,384
something we can all identify with.

17
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:37,521
So, simple works well,

18
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,565
just like how images work well

19
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,416
and much better than too many words.

20
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,195
And there's a reason why People Magazine

21
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,713
is always one of the top selling magazines in the world.

22
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:50,361
And the same thing can be said for National Geographic,

23
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:52,526
just given the incredible image focus

24
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:54,246
within National Geographic.

25
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:57,118
And so, the bottom line is

26
00:00:57,118 --> 00:01:00,932
delivery should be as simplistic as possible

27
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:03,167
in a way that addresses as many people

28
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,481
in your particular audience as possible,

29
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:07,993
which is what we covered in act one.
