1
00:00:00,716 --> 00:00:02,340
Please engage your audience.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,539
Involve them.

3
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:05,236
Ask them questions.

4
00:00:05,236 --> 00:00:07,845
They're gonna pay a lot more attention this way,

5
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:09,445
and they're gonna feel like they're actually a part

6
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:11,733
of the whole presentation experience

7
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,125
that you're giving them,

8
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,120
and they're gonna retain a lot more this way as well

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,093
if they're engaged.

10
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:19,807
And I personally love to go off script a lot

11
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:23,724
when I'm presenting, and I engage the audience.

12
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,789
How you doing?

13
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:27,640
We're good, yeah?

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,923
Excellent, excellent.

15
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:31,909
Well, I just want to thank you for the opportunity

16
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,072
to let me speak here.

17
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:36,453
I'm very humbled to be a part of this, right?

18
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,773
I've never been happier, never been happier,

19
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,811
and for the first time in my life

20
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:42,358
I feel like I don't have a job.

21
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:44,146
I love it, it's fun, it's fun.

22
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:48,518
So, Mark Twain had this great saying,

23
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:50,407
he said that the two most important days

24
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:52,687
in a person's life are number one,

25
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,287
the day they're born,

26
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,751
and number two, the day they find out why.

27
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,383
Pretty cool, huh?

28
00:01:00,383 --> 00:01:01,640
And so I humbly believe

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,871
that if you get up in the morning

30
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,811
and you tell yourself you're going to work

31
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,337
then, with all due respect,

32
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:09,073
you're doing it wrong.

33
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,476
You need to find your passion.

34
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:13,441
You need to find your raison d'Ãªtre.

35
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:14,274
Gregory, was that right?

36
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,298
Did I pronounce that right?

37
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:17,218
So that was good, right?

38
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:18,387
You need to find your purpose.

39
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,719
You know, what was the reason you were put on this earth.

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,434
And so, for me it's teaching.

41
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:23,267
I love it.

42
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,105
I wish I'd discovered it much earlier in my life.

43
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:29,010
I wish I did, and Udemy has certainly changed my life,

44
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,623
and I'm very grateful, very grateful.

45
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:34,378
So, in terms of my background, I'm from Canada.

46
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:37,485
Every now and then you'll hear me say out and about, right?

47
00:01:37,485 --> 00:01:39,635
Any Canadians here?

48
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:40,890
Right there.

49
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,524
One, two.

50
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:46,826
That's what I'm talking about right there.

51
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:47,730
Excellent, excellent, so yeah.

52
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,627
I'm from Canada originally.

53
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:50,963
I started a couple of tech companies,

54
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:53,672
worked in consulting, came down to the States

55
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:57,050
to work on Wall Street, did the whole business school thing,

56
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,558
worked for a hedge fund,

57
00:01:58,558 --> 00:01:59,729
came out to the west coast,

58
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,113
and worked for a venture capital firm.

59
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,879
And I keep saying the word work, right?

60
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,569
Those were jobs, those were jobs.

61
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,033
And then I started teaching at nights,

62
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,784
and I absolutely love it.

63
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:13,537
And teaching is very similar actually

64
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:17,218
to working in venture capital where I used to work,

65
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:18,051
and the reason I say that

66
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:21,124
is when you work in venture capital you sit on boards,

67
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:25,193
and your mission is to help your companies grow.

68
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,638
And as a teacher your mission is to help

69
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:30,099
your students grow career wise,

70
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,025
and help them find their passion, and their purpose as well.

71
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,233
It's a great gig.

72
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,253
It really is.

73
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:39,585
And the wonderful thing about what all of us do

74
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:43,752
is our passions are to help others be more successful.

75
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:48,149
And there's not many professions like that in the world.

76
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:49,580
You just be yourself.

77
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,108
That's all I'm saying, okay?

78
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:55,200
I even have fun games when I present,

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,584
and I have half the room

80
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:59,008
competing against the other half of the room.

81
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:02,830
And I make the courses more interesting

82
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,750
by creating these really fun games, right?

83
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,089
So, try and be creative, right?

84
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:10,335
And I'll show you an example here of a video right here.

85
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,806
Here's an example

86
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:14,894
from slides I use in my class

87
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,022
for university business students, right.

88
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,234
I have one side is the blue side,

89
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:22,496
the other side is the red side, or the red team, right?

90
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,839
And then what I do is I have them compete with each other

91
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,506
in boxing matches, right, or boxing rounds.

92
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:31,103
And I call it accounting boxing,

93
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:34,928
or legal boxing, or business boxing, whatever it is, right?

94
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,551
And then I show them funny video clips here and there

95
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,666
to let them know which team is winning, red or blue.

96
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,175
That sort of thing, okay?

97
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,041
I just try to be different and have fun with it,

98
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,874
otherwise, you know what?

99
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:47,877
It gets boring for me too, right?

100
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:49,037
I wanna mix it up,

101
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:50,725
I wanna mix it up and have fun with it, right?

102
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:52,805
Otherwise what's the point?

103
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:55,083
And you want to be creative like this

104
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,811
to not only engage the audience

105
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:01,119
but so your presentation can be memorable, right?

106
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,469
Because it's so original which is a concept

107
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:06,255
we have covered a lot in this course, okay?

108
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:10,443
And most importantly, if you have a blast

109
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:13,503
making the content for which you're about to deliver

110
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,960
to the audience and engage them with it,

111
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,672
they'll love it because you're gonna be

112
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,267
so much more passionate delivering something

113
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:24,131
that you really had a lot of fun making,

114
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,676
kind of like an album, right?

115
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:28,835
These incredible musicians, they love writing music,

116
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,449
and they love delivering the music too

117
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,187
in concert or whatever it is, okay?

118
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:36,180
So just enjoy making and delivering these presentations

119
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,963
like a musician enjoys writing music

120
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:42,579
and delivering it as well.

121
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:46,165
And I want you to give an experience

122
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,600
and not a boring presentation.

123
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,911
And a great way to do this

124
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:52,007
is to get the audience involved

125
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:54,433
like they have at concerts, right?

126
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:57,393
So, at the end of a two-hour concert, you know,

127
00:04:57,393 --> 00:04:59,641
everyone is still so engaged

128
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:03,513
that they put up their lighters in the air.

129
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,103
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm dating myself.

130
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,848
We used to do that.

131
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,481
I think maybe people, I don't know, maybe people,

132
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:09,314
what do they do now?

133
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,961
They don't put lighters up, right?

134
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,014
I think they put up their iPhones or whatever

135
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:14,539
and make it look like a lighter.

136
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:17,949
Anyway, I digress, I'm rambling.

137
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:21,327
And in summary try to engage your audience.
