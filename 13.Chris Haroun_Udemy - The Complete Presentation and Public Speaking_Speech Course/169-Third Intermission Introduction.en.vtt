00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:11.027
Welcome to the third of three intermissions,

3
00:00:11.027 --> 00:00:12.977
this is it, this is it,

4
00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:15.887
you should be proud of yourself for getting this far.

5
00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:17.513
The first part of this intermission

6
00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:19.874
is a presentation exercise,

7
00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:23.463
which is in the very next lecture.

8
00:00:23.463 --> 00:00:25.508
The second part is an exercise

9
00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:28.617
critiquing the presentation that you just gave

10
00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:31.200
and the third part is comparing

11
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.789
your second intermission presentation

12
00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.297
to this third intermission presentation,

13
00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:40.815
so I'll see you in the next lecture, thanks.
