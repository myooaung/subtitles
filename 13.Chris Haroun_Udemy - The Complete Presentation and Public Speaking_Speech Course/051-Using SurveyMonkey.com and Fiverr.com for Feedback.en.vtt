00:00:01.261 --> 00:00:03.652
You can also get online feedback on the content

2
00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:06.963
of your speech using surveymonkey.com,

3
00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:10.442
as we discussed earlier in this course.

4
00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:12.307
This can be expensive,

5
00:00:12.307 --> 00:00:14.760
but if it's a speech that could make your life,

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.115
or change your life, et cetera.

7
00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:16.974
Make your career,

8
00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:17.938
then it might be worth it.

9
00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:19.677
It's up to you, okay?

10
00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:22.547
It, one of the reasons that I'm actually making this course

11
00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:24.093
that you're watching right now,

12
00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:27.293
is that I sent out a surveymonkey.com survey

13
00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.288
to all my Udemy students.

14
00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:32.200
And many of my Udemy students, thank you,

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.892
told me that you're interested in a course like this one,

16
00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:38.099
on giving presentations.

17
00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:40.595
And the great thing about surveymonkey.com,

18
00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:42.899
is that you can choose the appropriate

19
00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.043
target market audience.

20
00:00:45.043 --> 00:00:47.412
And you can ask for feedback on the content

21
00:00:47.412 --> 00:00:51.187
or parts of a speech or anything, really.

22
00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:53.086
Okay? It's really, really cool.

23
00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.716
Alright, for example, if we wanted to,

24
00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:59.336
we could create a survey similar to what we did earlier

25
00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:03.984
in the course in order to solicit feedback on our speech.

26
00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:07.409
And we can ask what titles work best, if applicable,

27
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.987
or what quotes to start a speech with, et cetera.

28
00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:15.187
We can even ask the audience about their background,

29
00:01:15.187 --> 00:01:18.104
or we can even customize the survey

30
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:21.731
so that our target audience is polled.

31
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.187
For example, finance professionals in a certain region.

32
00:01:25.187 --> 00:01:26.020
Right?

33
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.078
And another cool feature is that you can,

34
00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:30.271
you can AB test the content. Right?

35
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:34.435
This means allowing the audience to choose A or B

36
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:35.685
per this image.

37
00:01:37.134 --> 00:01:41.301
Lastly, you could go to www.fiverr, that's five with two Rs.

38
00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:47.161
And ask for feedback on the article version of your speech.

39
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.042
Okay?

40
00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.732
And this one's a bit, little bit harder to do,

41
00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:52.565
but...

42
00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:58.141
If you find somebody on fiverr.com with great user reviews,

43
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:59.890
when it comes to giving feedback,

44
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.548
then it might be worth the shot asking for feedback

45
00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:05.480
if this is a very important presentation for you.
