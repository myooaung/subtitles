00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.744
Mark Twain once said that the right word

2
00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:06.859
may be effective,

3
00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.480
but no word was ever as effective

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.563
as a rightly timed pause.

5
00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:16.891
Okay, that pause was too long.

6
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:20.903
But pausing after you say something controversial

7
00:00:20.903 --> 00:00:21.780
or important

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.500
or the most important thing you say in a speech is crucial

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.583
as it allows people to digest what you just said.

10
00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:33.871
Okay, that was the right amount of time for a pause.

11
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:36.038
Pause also between topics.

12
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:41.082
It kinda creates contrast and lets people know

13
00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.921
that you're moving on to something else.

14
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.857
I guess the best way to think about a pause in a speech

15
00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:49.664
is when you're writing an essay

16
00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:53.065
and you put a period and then a space,

17
00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:57.311
which is just a small pause in between two sentences.

18
00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:00.615
And then, when you talk about a brand new topic,

19
00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:02.307
it's a much bigger space,

20
00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:03.792
which means you have a new paragraph,

21
00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.245
so it's kinda like that.

22
00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:06.137
Think of it that way.

23
00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:09.301
And so, if you give a very long presentation,

24
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.847
quite often, I like to teach three to four hour

25
00:01:11.847 --> 00:01:14.544
in class university sessions,

26
00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:17.240
I usually give a break every one and a half to two hours,

27
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.346
but pausing when you're talking in general,

28
00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.600
in between important points,

29
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.771
it ensures your audience

30
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:27.395
not only retains the content of your presentation,

31
00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:30.392
but it gives them time to process it.

32
00:01:30.392 --> 00:01:31.225
Thanks.
