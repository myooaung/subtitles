1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:03,171
If you're watching this,

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:06,147
I want you to take a few days, please,

3
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:09,805
and think about you winning a Nobel Prize,

4
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:12,887
or a Pulitzer Prize, or an Academy Award,

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,947
later in your life, okay?

6
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:15,960
Then I want you to prepare

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,893
a thank you speech for two reasons.

8
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,869
Number one, so you can think about

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,483
a gap analysis, meaning where you are

10
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,339
in your life right now,

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,120
and where you want to be later in life

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,669
when you accept and receive this award.

13
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:31,502
Right, and you're gonna have to give

14
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:33,587
a speech for it too, okay?

15
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,765
The second reason, is so you can practice

16
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:38,824
what you've learned in this course

17
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:41,171
by giving this speech now, okay?

18
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,251
And if you wanna be really ambitious,

19
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,216
record it now and show it to the media

20
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:49,064
the day after you win the award in the future.

21
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:50,600
I'm not joking.

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,801
Jim Carrey did this, right, sort of,

23
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:56,184
with a check that he wrote to himself

24
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:57,779
for 10 million dollars, right?

25
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,894
When he was dirt poor and cleaning urinals

26
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,251
at a high school while living in a trailer park

27
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:05,694
when he was a kid in Canada.

28
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:07,442
I mean this is a great motivational story,

29
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,273
so please check it out.
