1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,776
I was the commencement speaker at a University recently.

2
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:05,911
And I took this cool picture from a

3
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:08,942
different perspective that says so much

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:12,092
and can be interpreted in so many different ways.

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,776
I really think that images are so

6
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:17,369
underused in presentations.

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,704
I wanna share with you 30 images

8
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,228
that you can use and show

9
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:24,412
when starting a presentation.

10
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:27,246
I'm also going to provide the internet links for

11
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:30,753
all of the images that I'm gonna show you.

12
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:32,224
I'll include all of them.

13
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:35,024
And then, in Act 4, Scene 2,

14
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:38,713
I'm gonna show you how to manipulate images the easy way.

15
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:42,045
Even if you have no experience with software

16
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:44,353
for manipulating images.

17
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:47,673
So, please choose to use any of these images

18
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,569
for your presentations,

19
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:52,621
or maybe they will provide inspiration for you

20
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,821
for other image ideas that you might have

21
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,480
to start your presentation with.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,336
As many people believe that a picture is worth a 1000 words.

23
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:05,285
And this will help you stand out as well.

24
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:09,894
Now, I'm one of those guys that thinks that photoshop,

25
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:12,731
or any Adobe product, is just too hard to use,

26
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,871
for me personally.

27
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:15,982
Okay, just for me.

28
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:19,639
I'm gonna show you much easier and cheaper ways

29
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:22,803
to manipulate images in Act 4, Scene 2.

30
00:01:22,803 --> 00:01:26,746
I'm also gonna you later how to morph images,

31
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,098
using only PowerPoints,

32
00:01:29,098 --> 00:01:30,882
and Keynote as well.

33
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,463
Okay, and the goal here is to

34
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:35,166
just help you work smarter and not harder

35
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,302
when you're making your presentations.

36
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:39,598
Of course, I'm also gonna show you how to use

37
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:42,762
Google Slides and many other programs as well.

38
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:44,567
Again, that's in Scene number 4,

39
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:45,470
which is a lot of fun.

40
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,303
I digress.

41
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,915
Here are some images to consider using

42
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,805
for your presentations.

43
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:55,410
And you can just show them with a quote on top of them,

44
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,273
if you want and if it's relevant.

45
00:01:57,273 --> 00:02:00,135
Remember this will sub well with text.

46
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:03,226
This is a gorgeous and inspiring picture.

47
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:06,809
It's from the Benagil Sea Cave in Portugal.

48
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:10,989
And beside these images, or better yet, on them,

49
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,026
you can insert one or a few words.

50
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,462
For example, in this image you can place

51
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,462
passion and preparation.

52
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:23,946
On this one you can write discovery and perception.

53
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:26,669
Here, you can insert forward thinking,

54
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,615
or a different perspective.

55
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:34,341
On this one you can also use a different perspective.

56
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:36,674
This one is for preparation.

57
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:39,480
What do you see here?

58
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,647
Waste, opportunity, wasted opportunity, or a dragon?

59
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,612
Real or not real?

60
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:48,145
Avatar, from the movie?

61
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:48,979
Or real?

62
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,253
It's actually real, it's in China.

63
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:54,594
I think it's called the Tianzi Mountains.

64
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:55,701
Why?

65
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:56,618
Or why not?

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,667
Unexpected!

67
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:03,750
Accident, karma, or chamelion?

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,833
If you have an audience from the 80s.

69
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:11,239
The macro is the same as the micro.

70
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,572
Or, is perception a reality?

71
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,009
Location, location, location and

72
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,592
a tale of 2 cities.

73
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,078
Breaking barriers.

74
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:24,803
Lost and found.

75
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,516
Fearless.

76
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:31,750
Here's another one, fearless.

77
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,710
I love Muhammad Ali, that guy was awesome.

78
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,140
If you have a chance, watch some of his speeches

79
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,262
or when he was being interviewed on television

80
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,650
back in the 60s and 70s.

81
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,483
He was...

82
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:45,885
There was no filter, he said what was on his mind

83
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:48,135
and he was so confident and

84
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:52,153
just everybody loved him for being him,

85
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:54,849
for being unique and not caring what people thought.

86
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,389
He was a real icon, he was amazing.

87
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,573
Here's another one.

88
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,073
Wrong conclusions.

89
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,450
Victory.

90
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,032
Hustle.

91
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:05,868
That's Pete Rose.

92
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:08,905
People called him Charlie hustle.

93
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,238
Time to move on.

94
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:13,879
The sky is not the limit.

95
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,044
New way to win.

96
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,865
Note the contrast here,

97
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:23,032
as we say new way but the picture is in black and white.

98
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:29,504
In this one we start by asking a question.

99
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,536
Does anybody recognize this photo?

100
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:36,280
And, this photo has been seen by more than 1 billion

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,905
people since 2001.

102
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:40,160
Anybody know what it is?

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,329
That's right,

104
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:44,760
this is a famous Microsoft Windows desktop image.

105
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,056
And it was actually taken here in Napa Valley.

106
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:50,149
And remember to make it somewhat relevant.

107
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:51,261
This one here is,

108
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,011
anything is possible.

109
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:56,688
Another one for,

110
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:58,438
anything is possible.

111
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,013
Dream.

112
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:07,432
Gosh, driving to work today was a nightmare.

113
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,792
You can use humor as well if you want.

114
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:13,473
So, it's fun creating a presentation

115
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:16,440
pretending it's like a work of art.

116
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,088
Just take your time finding the perfect image to start

117
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:22,020
or end your presentations with.

118
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,756
This image here is so beautiful I had to include it twice.

119
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:29,593
And one day in my life I will go there.

120
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:33,450
Now, here's a really easy way for you to get images

121
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,533
and add text.

122
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:38,654
This website is called imagechef.com.

123
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:44,064
And here's a bunch of images I made using imagechef.com.

124
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,352
Pretty cool, huh?

125
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:46,840
It's free to use,

126
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,995
unless you want ridiculously high resolution images.

127
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:54,151
Then there's actually a fee for it.

128
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:58,668
And, if you want to make what are called, "memes,"

129
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,040
here's a great resource for you.

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,520
The website is called, imgflip.com,

131
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,431
it's written right here.

132
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:10,078
And here's an example of a meme for a presentation.

133
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,570
Here I'm making a meme for my current presentation,

134
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,844
okay, okay, done, alright,

135
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:16,677
fine.

136
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,960
First impression images are crucial.

137
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,687
And they have a really big impact on your audience's

138
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:28,172
ability to pay attention and feel inspired.

139
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,255
Images are...

140
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,868
Are more important than putting words up on the screen,

141
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:38,314
because we tend to judge books by their covers, right?

142
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,234
And it's so much fun creating a presentation

143
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,006
if it's creative and artistic.

144
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,778
It's like a work of art, right?

145
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,662
And I take a lot of time to find images to

146
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:51,726
include in my presentations that I give

147
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:53,798
in front of groups of people.

148
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,157
And you should do this too,

149
00:06:55,157 --> 00:06:58,074
and just have a good time doing it.
