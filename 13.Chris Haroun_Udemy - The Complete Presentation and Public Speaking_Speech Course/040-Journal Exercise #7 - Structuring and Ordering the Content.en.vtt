00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.307
Now that we understand

2
00:00:02.307 --> 00:00:04.949
the gold bucket speech structure concept,

3
00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:07.069
let's put it to work.

4
00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.069
In this example from exercise number seven in your journal,

5
00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.099
we can see that there are 14 things

6
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.499
I want to discuss in the speech.

7
00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.920
Please recall that we crossed out the third

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.899
in a previous exercise as that item wasn't relevant

9
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.680
or just didn't fit in with our speech.

10
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.709
Okay, so here is how we are gonna complete this exercise.

11
00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:32.800
Step number one.

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.497
Let's think about what buckets to put these items into

13
00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:40.720
so we can structure and order our speech.

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.857
I see six buckets as follows, okay,

15
00:00:43.857 --> 00:00:46.480
and then just put them in the right order

16
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.928
and number them as follows.

17
00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:51.800
One, the start of the presentation,

18
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.588
meaning the instruction part.

19
00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:57.755
Number two, topic number one, the weakness of competitor X.

20
00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:02.415
Number three, topic number two, buying X.

21
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.896
Four, topic three, merge with X.

22
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.800
Five, which is topic four, change your marketing strategy.

23
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.967
And six, ending the speech, which means the conclusion.

24
00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:19.629
Okay, once you're done with step one, right,

25
00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.578
and you can pause me if you want,

26
00:01:21.578 --> 00:01:23.424
but once you're done with step one,

27
00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:25.349
we'll go into step two.

28
00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:29.182
Now, let's paste each of the six bucket topics

29
00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:32.616
in the gold column as follows.

30
00:01:34.926 --> 00:01:39.009
Step three, sort the table using the gold column.

31
00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:43.966
You can sort the table by copying and pasting it

32
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.006
into a spreadsheet program.

33
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.776
I prefer to use it in Microsoft Word as follows, okay.

34
00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:54.678
Select the entire completed table per this image.

35
00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:56.946
Then select the layout option

36
00:01:56.946 --> 00:02:00.279
at the top of Microsoft Word as follows.

37
00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:04.451
Then click the sort option on the right.

38
00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.296
Then I want you to please

39
00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:10.358
select sort by selection

40
00:02:10.358 --> 00:02:14.070
in the dropdown menu per this image.

41
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.653
Now, your final table is sorted

42
00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:22.027
and you have your outline completed for your presentation.

43
00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:24.707
Please copy and paste the contents

44
00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.096
of your completed final table below this yellow box,

45
00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:32.163
similar to how the final table appears in my example

46
00:02:32.163 --> 00:02:34.427
before this yellow box, okay.

47
00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:37.030
Don't worry if the information isn't perfect

48
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.166
as we'll use the contents, okay,

49
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.307
to make the slides later, okay.

50
00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:47.267
This will all make sense or more sense to you in act four

51
00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.838
when we make our slides.

52
00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:49.671
Thank you.
