00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:01.411
I want to show you

2
00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:05.578
how you can get incredible fonts for your presentations.

3
00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:08.703
It takes a couple steps, though, okay.

4
00:00:08.703 --> 00:00:10.036
So Final Cut Pro

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.503
is the application you gotta download, okay.

6
00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:14.913
And you get a free trial, okay.

7
00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:16.783
And it's available in many different languages, right.

8
00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.818
So click here, you get a free 30 day trial.

9
00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:22.183
I will go through this pretty quickly.

10
00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:24.304
Let's create a new video.

11
00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:26.352
You don't need to look at this, but it's fine.

12
00:00:26.352 --> 00:00:30.352
And I'm going to insert a font here, okay.

13
00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:32.984
Actually we'll go to Custom 3D, okay?

14
00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:34.392
And I'm going to make it bigger,

15
00:00:34.392 --> 00:00:35.652
go back to the beginning.

16
00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:36.942
And I just want to show you what this looks like.

17
00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:38.452
It's pretty damn cool, right.

18
00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:42.293
So let's say that we have a title for your presentation.

19
00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:43.293
It's called,

20
00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:47.378
"My Promotion"

21
00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:49.614
(chuckles)

22
00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:52.964
and let's select different styles, here.

23
00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:56.328
Blue is the least insulting color

24
00:00:56.328 --> 00:00:58.183
you can use globally, apparently.

25
00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.016
Okay, and I click here

26
00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:02.652
and then what I do is I just pause it

27
00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.374
and I do a screen record,

28
00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:08.541
unfortunately you can only do this on a Mac, okay.

29
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:12.862
And then you go here, PowerPoint Keynote

30
00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:15.910
and you're going to insert that screen print you just took,

31
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.405
and for me it's on my desktop.

32
00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:20.685
Voila, "My Promotion".

33
00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:23.572
Let's get rid of the background.

34
00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:25.072
Remove background.

35
00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:31.797
Okay, and you could spend more time prettying it up

36
00:01:31.797 --> 00:01:33.498
if you wanted to, right.

37
00:01:33.498 --> 00:01:36.331
So that's how it looks.

38
00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:41.203
And you can even have it on a white background in here

39
00:01:41.203 --> 00:01:43.843
if you wanted to, or a black background here

40
00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:45.237
if you didn't want to have to remove

41
00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.413
all of the back parts, there.

42
00:01:47.413 --> 00:01:48.853
So let's try another one here.

43
00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:51.655
Let's go to 3D Styles,

44
00:01:51.655 --> 00:01:54.043
Car Paint, right.

45
00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:57.628
My Promotion, let's take a big look.

46
00:01:57.628 --> 00:01:59.485
There it is, there.

47
00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.985
Let's do a screen print again.

48
00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:06.264
This graphic's intensive.

49
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.981
And let me go back here, throw that guy aside,

50
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.148
and we're going to insert this guy here.

51
00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:19.454
We can even leave it like that if we wanted to, right.

52
00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:21.672
Have kind of a cool frame.

53
00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:23.533
PowerPoint's a lot of fun.

54
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.216
Like that, whatever it is.

55
00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:27.184
So there's many different things you can do here.

56
00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:30.474
And it gets really, really advanced, too

57
00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:32.634
in terms of the type of, you know,

58
00:02:32.634 --> 00:02:34.853
backgrounds you can do, or fonts.

59
00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:35.874
I really like this one.

60
00:02:35.874 --> 00:02:39.033
This is Ashwood,

61
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:39.866
and you can change it

62
00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:41.494
to tons of different types of wood, as well.

63
00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.724
Say, we want to do Redwood, I don't know.

64
00:02:43.724 --> 00:02:47.868
See if you want to make it a bit smaller, right.

65
00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:48.823
And this is actually how I did

66
00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:53.145
a lot of the backgrounds and fonts for my TEDx talk.

67
00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:56.645
And again, you'll take a screen print here

68
00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.181
and then you'll go Insert,

69
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.039
pictures from your desktop,

70
00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.305
badoom, there it is there.

71
00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.459
And again, if we wanted to remove the background

72
00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.952
we could by selecting Remove Background here, right.

73
00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:15.089
And even if you just want,

74
00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:18.672
say we just want the letter M and O, right.

75
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:25.524
There you go.

76
00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:26.990
Not perfect, but you could finesse it more

77
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.159
if you spend a lot more time on it.

78
00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.189
Or again, you can have just a black background in PowerPoint

79
00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.269
or put a white background in Final Cut,

80
00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.110
we'd import here

81
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.277
and then you'll have to worry about removing the back part.

82
00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:42.310
That's it.

83
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.716
It's pretty simplistic.

84
00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:48.715
It can get really complicated, though, in Final Cut.

85
00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:51.475
So if you have questions about fonts, please let me know.

86
00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:53.645
I'm more than happy to help you out.

87
00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:55.254
And it's a lot of fun, again.

88
00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:56.139
They make Hollywood movies

89
00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.509
with this software package, as well.

90
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:59.342
Thanks.
