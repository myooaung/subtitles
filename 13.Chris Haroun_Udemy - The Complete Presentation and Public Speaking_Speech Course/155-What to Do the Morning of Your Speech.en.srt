1
00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:02,636
On the morning of your speech please review

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,701
the items in Journal Exercise Number 21 in case you need

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,001
to bring those items with you to the speech, right?

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,112
And I don't want you to practice your speech

5
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:13,141
the morning of it all.

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,987
I want you to focus just on relaxing, okay?

7
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:19,650
If you want watch the second video of Act Number Nine

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,141
the morning of your presentation,

9
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,260
which is called "Getting in an ideal,

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,051
confident, relaxed, peak mental state,"

11
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:32,030
which is "the zone," okay, remember the zone.

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,341
I want you to show up obviously at least an hour early,

13
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:36,259
right, and make sure you get at least seven

14
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:39,378
to eight hours of sleep, okay?

15
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:41,791
And, make sure you had a meal before the presentation

16
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,297
that doesn't make you tired, obviously.

17
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:47,992
Don't drink too much coffee or you might be shaking.

18
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:50,130
Do what I say, don't do what I do, okay?

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,465
Just kidding (laughing).

20
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,737
Okay, and for a lot of us though

21
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:58,380
you can't quit coffee otherwise you get a headache,

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,163
right, so, anyway, smile the morning of your presentation,

23
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:03,980
as it puts you in that great state, right.

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,221
Just be happy, shoulders back.

25
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:08,333
And I want you to read the newspaper

26
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,363
or watch the news that morning, okay?

27
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,421
I also want you to do a Google search on the company

28
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,721
you're presenting to, and or the topic

29
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:19,893
you're gonna present about just in case important

30
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:22,363
news event was released that you might have

31
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:24,596
to answer in the Q & A session,

32
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:25,620
or somebody asks you about it,

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,392
or if you wanna kinda tie in something,

34
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:32,643
I don't know, local and cool into your presentation, right?

35
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:35,472
And if applicable, check the Twitter feed

36
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,773
or any other social media web sites on the topic

37
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,941
or company you're gonna present on.

38
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:41,979
And you know what, if Facebook or any other

39
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,965
social media stuff pisses you off or puts you

40
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,823
in a bad mood then don't check it that day.

41
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:48,240
Happy stuff only.
