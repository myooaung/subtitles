1
00:00:00,997 --> 00:00:01,830
If somebody didn't introduce you

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,496
(quiet music)1

3
00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:07,762
and/or they didn't talk about your bio or your background

4
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:10,575
then you can consider talking about yourself

5
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:12,577
when you start a speech.

6
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:15,885
And the best way to do it generally speaking

7
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,362
is to speak in chronological order

8
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:21,387
and make sure that there's some consistency please

9
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:22,220
(Music chords sounding)

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,033
or relevancy with respect to the topic of discussion, okay?

11
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:30,758
For example, and this is a unique approach, okay?

12
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:34,343
Let's pretend I'm the key note speaker for a finance

13
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:37,533
or an investment conference, okay?

14
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,879
You must make sure to keep it relevant while making it

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,462
interesting, personal, poetic or prophetic,

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,743
while being passionate and staying in character, okay?

17
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:51,657
It's easy to do because it's you, it's you, okay?

18
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:55,382
So here I go, along with a few images to keep it personal

19
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:56,965
and relevant, okay?

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,558
This piece of cardboard was sold on August fifth of 2016

21
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:06,453
for 465,000 dollars.

22
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:12,245
This is a Gretzky PSA10 perfect specimen,

23
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:15,091
okay it's Wayne Gretzky's rookie card, okay?

24
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,071
10/10 perfect, okay?

25
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,019
There's not many in the world.

26
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,956
I had many cards like this one growing up in Canada.

27
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:27,123
But unfortunately, I put these cards on my bicycle wheel

28
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:30,628
so that when I rode my BMX bike around,

29
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:33,283
it sounded like a real motorcycle.

30
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:36,771
Okay, clearly I wasn't the smartest kid in Canada.

31
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:40,000
Now, my first business when I was a kid,

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,027
was I would sell enlarged hockey

33
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:46,458
and baseball cards for 10 bucks, right?

34
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,292
So here's an example, I still have them, right,

35
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:51,037
I was cleaning out my parents' house.

36
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:53,343
See that, I used to stick them on the wall of my dorm room,

37
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:57,573
Right, so I would go to, I think it was like a Kinko's

38
00:01:57,573 --> 00:01:59,587
before Kinko's was around in Canada,

39
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,781
and I would pay five bucks to have them enlarged,

40
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:03,108
I would stick them on cardboard,

41
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:05,797
these are comic cardboard backings,

42
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:08,137
and I'd sell them for ten bucks at school.

43
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:10,690
So, anyway, that's Wayne Gretzky.

44
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,875
My first business, kinda fun, okay.

45
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:17,374
So, we all loved Wayne Gretzky growing up,

46
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:21,571
and one day all Canadians will never forget

47
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,321
is August ninth 1988.

48
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:29,232
This was the day that Wayne Gretzky was traded

49
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,816
from our Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Lakers.

50
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:37,726
Okay, in the United States, the combination of the day

51
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:42,355
Kennedy was shot, or O.J. Simpson chase was on television

52
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:46,522
or Bobby Thompson's shot was heard around the world,

53
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,173
that's kind of what it meant for us Canadians.

54
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:53,503
It was a really, really big deal, okay?

55
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:56,586
And I remember that press conference,

56
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:02,582
and you know our idol, the great one, Wayne Gretzky

57
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,999
was tearing up on television.

58
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:09,773
I mean, he was so real, and so awesome to us.

59
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,507
What could possibly make the Great One tear up?

60
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:17,975
So, what made him tear up was that he was leaving us.

61
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:21,573
We felt abandoned, it wasn't his fault though, right?

62
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:24,060
He was leaving our country,

63
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,187
which was an ill thought out business decision

64
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:30,428
by the owner of the Edmonton Oilers at the time, okay?

65
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:33,736
And I remember we all teared up, right, I did,

66
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:35,975
as did my little sisters, and my parents,

67
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:38,584
and many people in Canada.

68
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:42,026
You see, to us Wayne Gretzky meant the world,

69
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:46,168
as he was the combination of Magic Johnson

70
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:49,114
plus Mickey Mantle plus Pele plus Muhammad Ali,

71
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:51,398
plus Diego Maradona all in one.

72
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,526
That's how much hockey means to us, okay, and Gretzky.

73
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,182
And it really marked the end of my childhood,

74
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:00,872
and it was emblematic of, you know,

75
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:05,039
Simon and Garfunkel singing Where Have You Gone Joe Dimaggio

76
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:10,742
and Gretzky was really the most real thing we knew

77
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:15,969
in a pretentious, greed filled eighties decade, okay.

78
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,849
It was at that point that I realized

79
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:23,248
that sports was a short term focus business,

80
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:25,791
and no longer a field of dreams,

81
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,772
and that being short term focused in business

82
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:31,855
had negative long term repercussions.

83
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,590
It marked the end of an era for me,

84
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,786
in terms of athletes being loyal and long term focused.

85
00:04:38,786 --> 00:04:42,667
Gone were the days where a George Brett played

86
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,221
for the Kansas City Royals for his whole career,

87
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:47,797
or Michael Jordan stayed with Chicago

88
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:49,473
for what seemed like forever,

89
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:52,049
or Cal Ripken, Jr. play with Baltimore

90
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,164
for his entire career.

91
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:56,608
You know, field of dreams no more.

92
00:04:56,608 --> 00:05:00,775
This begs the question, what made Wayne Gretzky great?

93
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:04,999
Well, he had this epic quote of saying

94
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:07,969
that he was successful not because he skated

95
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:10,636
to where the puck is but rather,

96
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,260
he skated to where the puck is going to be, okay?

97
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,187
Years later, when I worked on Wall Street at Goldman Sachs,

98
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,001
and in the hedge fund industry at Citadel,

99
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:26,117
and then currently, at my own venture capital firm,

100
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,943
I attribute my minor successes in life to that quote

101
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:33,080
from Wayne Gretzky.

102
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,905
You see, we need to have the foresight of Wayne Gretzky

103
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:40,822
and anticipate what investors are going to like

104
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:43,713
in five to ten years.

105
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:46,839
Instead of skating to where the puck is right now,

106
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,830
meaning, instead of investing in companies

107
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,373
that people already like.

108
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:54,434
You see, if we buy stocks in companies

109
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,505
that many people already like,

110
00:05:57,505 --> 00:06:00,296
then there aren't that many incremental buyers,

111
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:04,751
and we are nothing more than tourists renting stocks.

112
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,100
We're not owners.

113
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,575
You get the idea, okay.

114
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:12,742
Make the introduction personal, please, and interesting,

115
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,989
and always unique, and of course relevant.

116
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:16,868
(music chords)

117
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,417
Remember the (mumbles) test, thanks.
