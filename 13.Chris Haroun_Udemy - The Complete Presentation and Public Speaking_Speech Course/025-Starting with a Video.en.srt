1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,667
(calming music)

2
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:06,141
I like to start a lot of the seminars that I teach and

3
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,587
the classes that I teach, and general keynote speeches with

4
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,483
very short motivational videos.

5
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,259
From movies or business events.

6
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,092
Right.

7
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:17,886
I even put on little funny clips every now and then as well.

8
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:19,439
It's a lot of fun that way.

9
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,272
Okay.

10
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:23,177
I kinda wanna give an experience, right.

11
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,032
Something that will be remembered.

12
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:26,950
It's fun for me to do it that way as well.

13
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,799
If it's not fun,

14
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:28,632
what's the point?

15
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:29,465
Okay.

16
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,872
I also show videos and images at least

17
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:33,662
every 10 to 15 minutes.

18
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:37,211
You know, nobody can pay attention for that long anymore.

19
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,044
Right.

20
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:42,211
That's why tedextalks are not much longer than 15 minutes.

21
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:47,713
So, on January 1, I sent this video to all of my

22
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,640
Udemy students saying how they really inspire me.

23
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,996
This video is actually created by one of my Udemy students

24
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:58,536
named Randy Tovar.

25
00:02:58,536 --> 00:02:59,369
Right.

26
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,292
This video is so powerful.

27
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,959
Please check it out.

28
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:11,837
Showing a video can be incredible unique and fun as well.

29
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:15,520
Bill Gate's brilliance wasn't just, you know,

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,055
product execution or good market strategy.

31
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:22,687
It was actually marketing and presentation genius.

32
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:23,520
Right.

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,494
Which his head of sales and marketing, at the time,

34
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:29,896
Steve Balmer, helped out a lot with.

35
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:33,462
Bill Gates used to give keynotes at massive annual

36
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:35,717
Comdex Tech conventions in Las Vegas.

37
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:38,240
I went to bunch of them.

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,072
I loved his presentations, right.

39
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:43,994
He always showed these really cool videos.

40
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:44,827
Right.

41
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:48,289
Bill Gates was to Steve Balmer when

42
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:51,001
Steve Wasneck was to Steve Jobs.

43
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:55,185
The result is an entertaining presentation with

44
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,790
superb introduction.

45
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,514
Here's and example from Bill Gates very last keynote at

46
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:01,347
Microsoft.

47
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,103
We're going to go into a lot more detail on this in

48
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:12,980
the wedding speeches examples in Act 11.

49
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,897
I started my wedding speech in 2000

50
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:20,412
when Christine and I got married,

51
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:23,495
by showing a cheap video that I made.

52
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:28,308
It was actually a lot of fun.

53
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:29,202
Right.

54
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:33,369
I just try and be very different as always when I present.

55
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,877
I have to be honest with you.

56
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,497
You know, things really didn't work out this morning for

57
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:41,330
the groomsmen and I.

58
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,232
In fact, things were pretty chaotic.

59
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:47,036
Things got so crazy that I decided to video tape

60
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,765
the entire event.

61
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,643
I kinda want to share it with you today.

62
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:55,310
So without further a do I present the video.

63
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:01,169
How did you guys sleep last night?

64
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:03,638
I couldn't get to sleep for awhile.

65
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,764
How about you?

66
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,102
I slept very well.

67
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:06,947
Really?

68
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:07,780
Yeah.

69
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,492
I went to bed around 9:30 - 10.

70
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:11,348
Oh my God.

71
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,219
How do you think the guys are doing?

72
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,624
Oh I'm sure they're doing okay.

73
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:16,116
Chris is pretty much.

74
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,057
He is pretty well organized and

75
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,557
probably waiting at the church as we speak right now.

76
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:20,464
Really?

77
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:21,751
Yeah.

78
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:24,418
(calming music)

79
00:05:36,138 --> 00:05:37,423
Ah!

80
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:38,572
I'm late.

81
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,155
(upbeat music)

82
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,394
Chris, I want to have a word with you.

83
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,904
Dad, I'm running late for the wedding.

84
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:55,737
Come in.

85
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:02,077
I hear that you getting married today.

86
00:06:02,077 --> 00:06:03,248
Yeah, to Christine.

87
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:05,195
She's fantastic.

88
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,474
Christine is a lovely girl.

89
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:09,494
We all met her and we all love her.

90
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,577
Sit down son.

91
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:18,963
(coughing)

92
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,630
I have a word of advice for you.

93
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:29,309
Keep your friends close but keep your wife closer.

94
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:38,585
(upbeat music)

95
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,128
Breakfast of champions.

96
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,711
(upbeat music)

97
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,015
Oh my God.

98
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:08,319
I am running late.

99
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,245
Oh, the ring.

100
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,078
Ring.

101
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:12,720
Ah, she's gonna love this.

102
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,553
Oh!

103
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,811
Fluffy!

104
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,811
Noooooooooo!

105
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:25,231
Jimmy.

106
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,064
Chris, come on.

107
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:26,897
Lets go.

108
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:27,730
We're late.

109
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,563
You don't understand.

110
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,022
The cat ate the ring.

111
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:31,274
What?

112
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:32,466
What do I do?

113
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:33,727
The cat ate the ring.

114
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:34,753
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:35,586
The cat ate the ring.

116
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:36,419
No, no, no, no.

117
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,252
It can't be.

118
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:38,085
Chris you come here.

119
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:38,918
You drive.

120
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:39,751
I got it.

121
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,584
Okay, you get to the wedding.

122
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:41,417
Alright.

123
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,250
Alright.

124
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,083
I'll get the ring and the cat.

125
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,706
Come on, lets go!

126
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:47,289
(upbeat music)

127
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,479
Actually, I've been having some abdominal pain.

128
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,456
It's that the physicians have actually requested

129
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,995
radio graphing you abdomen.

130
00:07:57,995 --> 00:07:59,178
Have any emotional problems?

131
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,130
Problems at home?

132
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,064
Depressions?

133
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,518
Symptoms of like poor eating?

134
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,851
Something wrong?

135
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,553
The radio graph is actually demonstrate.

136
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:09,386
Buttons.

137
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:10,388
Odd coins.

138
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:13,221
Other consumed items like jewelry.

139
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:15,978
We need to discuss this.

140
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:16,895
Talk to me.

141
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:20,925
Talk to me!

142
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:25,907
I mean, we clearly have issues to discuss.

143
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:26,740
I'm late!

144
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:31,598

(upbeat music)

150
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,989
Fluffy, please try some pepto-bismol.

151
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:05,822

The ring.

158
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:21,851
Oh my God.

159
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:25,063
