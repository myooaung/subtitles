If you don't already have an Amazon Web Services account,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,659
then the first thing that you'll need to do is to set one up.

3
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:15,403
Open any web browser and head along to the following, aws.amazon .com.

4
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:19,391
This will take you to the home page of AWS.

5
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:24,665
When on this page, you are looking for the Create an AWS Account button.

6
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:27,120
Once we have selected the Create an AWS Account button,

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,706
you'll be presented with a signup page.

8
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:33,744
Here is where you fill out all the information needed by

9
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:41,000
AWS in order to create your account. One of the great things about AWS is the Free Tier options.
