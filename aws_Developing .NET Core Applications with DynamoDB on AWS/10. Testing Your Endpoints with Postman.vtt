00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.717
Let's now test each of the endpoints that we have just added.

2
00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:08.744
I've started up our application and have Postman opened.

3
00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:11.430
When testing each of our endpoints in our previous module,

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.067
we saved each of the calls into a MovieRank collection.

5
00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:21.919
So we can go through each of these to ensure we get the expected results back.

6
00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.203
If we start at the top of our collection,

7
00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:27.157
we'll load up t GetAllItemsFromDatabase,

8
00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:28.112
and hit Send.

9
00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.021
That looks to be working correctly.

10
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:35.152
Let's try our GetMovie endpoint.

11
00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:39.683
Now our GetUsersRankedMoviesByMovieTitle,

12
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:45.139
let's see if we can add a movie, a movie with the name Complex Mind.

13
00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.229
Now we will update the movie that we have just added

14
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.789
to have a ranking of 3 down from 5.

15
00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.078
And finally we test our OverallRanking endpoint.

16
00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:58.139
Everything looks to be working as expected.

17
00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:04.000
We have successfully replaced the Object Persistence model code with the document model.
