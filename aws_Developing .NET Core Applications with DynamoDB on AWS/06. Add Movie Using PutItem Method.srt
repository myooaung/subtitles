1
00:00:01,849 --> 00:00:05,035
Let's add the ability for users to add a movie's ranking.

2
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:10,916
Inside our Controller class, we can see we already have the method inside here.

3
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:15,462
So we can head straight over to our MovieRankService class.

4
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:18,165
We'll call off to our MovieRankRepository class,

5
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:22,552
and pass in the userId and the MovieRankRequest.

6
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:25,529
Heading over to the MovieRankRepository class,

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,563
we want to create a method named AddMovie that takes in two parameters,

8
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:34,994
userId and MovieRankRequest.

9
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:39,473
We also need to add the MovieRank.Contracts using statement.

10
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:44,671
We will create a PutItemRequest that will build up the requests that

11
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:50,683
we'll be passing into the DynamoDB's PutItemAsync method.

12
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,071
We will say new PutItemRequest, and inside the request,

13
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:55,788
we will add our TableName,

14
00:00:55,788 --> 00:01:02,791
then we want to build up our items that we want to add to our DynamoDb table,

15
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,350
MovieRank.

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:09,523
We will add Item, and new up a Dictionary of type string and AttributeValue.

17
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:15,262
We will add each property inside our MovieRank DynamoDB table,

18
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:20,526
and map them to the parameter arguments that are being passed in to our method.

19
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:25,141
We want to make sure that we specify the type for each of these.

20
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:31,856
For example, N for number, S for string, and SS for list of strings.

21
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:37,117
When using DateTime, we need to add the System using statement.

22
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:38,557
Using the _dynamoDbClient,

23
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:44,088
we will use PutItemAsync and pass in the PutItemRequest.

24
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:52,000
We will add this method to our interface, and add the MovieRank.Contracts using statement.
