00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:04.955
Let's create our DynamoDB table.

2
00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:07.727
Here we are back in the AWS Management Console.

3
00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:11.043
We first want to navigate to DynamoDB.

4
00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:15.996
In the AWS services search box, type in and select DynamoDB.

5
00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:25.870
Once the DynamoDB page is loaded, we want to select the Create table button.

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.962
We will enter our Table name as MovieRank,

7
00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:33.125
and we'll set our Partition key as UserId.

8
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.694
We will also set the UserId to be a Number.

9
00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:43.748
We will check the Add sort key box and enter MovieName as our sort key.

10
00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:47.098
We will leave MovieName as a string.

11
00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:50.101
And we can hit the Create button to create our table.

12
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:56.100
Once our table has been created, we also want to create a secondary index.

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.044
Select the Indexes tab, and select Create index.

14
00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:03.254
Here we'll set the Partition key as MovieName,

15
00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:06.253
we also need to set an Index name,

16
00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:09.542
but you'll see that this was automatically done for

17
00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:11.859
us based on our partition key.

18
00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:18.260
To create our global secondary index, select Create index.

19
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.000
These indexes can take around 5 minutes to create depending on how much data you have in your table.
