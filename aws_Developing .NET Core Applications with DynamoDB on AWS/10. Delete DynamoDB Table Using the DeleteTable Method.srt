1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:08,104
Inside our SetupController class, we want to add the ability to delete our table.

2
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:13,032
If we add the HttpDelete attribute and a Route of deleteTable,

3
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:14,918
squiggly brackets, dynamoDbTableName,

4
00:00:14,918 --> 00:00:19,667
we'll create a method with a task IActionResult return

5
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:23,384
type and a method name of DeleteTable.

6
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:27,030
We'll pass in the dynamoDbTableName inside our methods parameters,

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,336
then we'll call off to our SetupService class,

8
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:36,406
to emit the name DeleteDynamoDbTable, and pass in the dynamoDbTableName.

9
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:43,444
Once the table has been deleted successfully, we can return a status of OK.

10
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:48,210
Inside our SetupService class, we will add a method named DeleteDynamoDbTable,

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,329
and add our string dynamoDbTableName parameter,

12
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,672
then call off to our MovieRankRepository class to

13
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:02,028
emit the name DeleteDynamoDbTable, and add our dynamoDbTableName.

14
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,359
As usual,

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,133
we add this method to our interface and head over to

16
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:11,004
our MovieRankRepository class.

17
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,171
Inside our MovieRankRepository class,

18
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:16,025
we create a method named DeleteDynamoDbTable,

19
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:20,881
with a string TableName parameter.

20
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,651
Inside our method, we want to create a DeleteTableRequest.

21
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:28,901
The only thing that we need to set in this request is our TableName.

22
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:32,384
Using our DynamoDbClient, we use the DeleteTableAsync method,

23
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:40,000
and pass in our DeleteTableRequest. We'll add this method to our interface.
