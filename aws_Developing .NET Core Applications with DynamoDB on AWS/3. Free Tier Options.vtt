00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:08.491
Let's discuss the Free Tier options that are available to us for DynamoDB.

2
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:13.788
DynamoDB charges per gigabyte of disk space that your table consumes.

3
00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:18.697
The first 25 GB consumed per month is free.

4
00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:22.711
You get 200 million requests per month through 25 write

5
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:25.106
capacity units and 25 read capacity units.

6
00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:27.912
I'll be explaining read and write capacity,

7
00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:30.820
and how you set them in the next module.

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.684
We have the ability to deploy our DynamoDB tables in multiple regions.

9
00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:39.407
Having tables in multiple regions can help when

10
00:00:39.407 --> 00:00:41.641
thinking about disaster recovery.

11
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:47.236
For example, if an AWS region went down due to network or hardware issues,

12
00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:51.636
we would still have our table or tables in another region.

13
00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:56.723
AWS regions are basically data centers that are located around the world.

14
00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.591
We'll be covering more about regions shortly,

15
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:03.227
and don't worry too much if any of this information or the

16
00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:06.872
terms don't make much sense at this stage.

17
00:01:06.872 --> 00:01:10.695
We'll be covering these in more detail as we go through the course.

18
00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.251
If you want to learn more about what Free Tier options are

19
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:17.577
available for both DynamoDB and other AWS products,

20
00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:25.376
then you can head along to aws.amazon .com /free.

21
00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:27.570
Here is where we can see a full list of products and

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.711
services that are offered by AWS for free.

23
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:35.608
By default, we are showing the FEATURED Free Tier options.

24
00:01:35.608 --> 00:01:37.452
To see all products and services,

25
00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:40.950
we can either select the 12 MONTHS FREE option where we are shown

26
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.563
a full list of Free Tier options that are available to us for the

27
00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:49.602
first 12 months of our subscription.

28
00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:51.764
Or we can select the ALWAYS FREE option.

29
00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:55.555
These will show us what products and services that are always free,

30
00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:58.995
even after the first 12 months of your subscription.

31
00:01:58.995 --> 00:02:05.000
And as you can see, DynamoDB is in the ALWAYS FREE list, which is good news for us.
