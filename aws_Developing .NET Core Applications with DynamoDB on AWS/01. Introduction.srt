Hi, and welcome to the creating a test framework for DynamoDB module from the

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,710
Developing .NET Core Applications with DynamoDB on AWS.

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,640
My name is Daniel, and I'll be taking you through this module.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,340
In this module, we'll be creating an integration test framework

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,040
using an in‑memory test server.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,720
This will allow us to spin up an in‑memory instance of our

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,240
application and make requests to our application.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,620
We will set up and ensure Docker is running on our computer so we can use

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,390
a DynamoDB Docker image that will allow us to spin up a local instance of

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,140
DynamoDB to test our application against.

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,000
We will then create a set of tests that will test the movie rank application that we have just built.
