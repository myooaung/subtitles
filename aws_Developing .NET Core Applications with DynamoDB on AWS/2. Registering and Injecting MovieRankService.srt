1
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:05,982
We will start off with implementing the Object Persistence model.

2
00:00:05,982 --> 00:00:09,103
We will add to our MovieRank template the code needed

3
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:12,757
to get all items from our database.

4
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:16,272
we add the ability to get a specific movie using only the

5
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,161
first letter or the first word of the movie.

6
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:22,049
We want to get the movies a user has ranked,

7
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:25,331
we will do this based on the movie name.

8
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:27,819
We need to give users the ability to rank movies,

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:32,581
and we also want to allow them to update an already-ranked movie.

10
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,012
This will allow them to change their mind and update

11
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:37,781
their ranking score on a specific movie.

12
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:42,508
We want to allow the users to get an overall movie ranking,

13
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:44,253
taking in all user's rankings,

14
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:50,004
and then providing us with the average of those rankings.

15
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:54,703
If we load up our .NET Core template that we created in the previous module,

16
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:59,131
we will now add the code to interact with DynamoDB.

17
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:02,717
We will start off in the Startup.cs class where we want to

18
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:04,503
register our IMovieRankService interface,

19
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:08,695
and bind that to our MovieRankService class.

20
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:12,485
A new feature with .NET Core is that it comes with its own

21
00:01:12,485 --> 00:01:14,204
simple dependency injection container,

22
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:17,826
which provides us with basic functionality for

23
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,557
registering and resolving dependencies,

24
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:23,132
making it easy for us to register our dependencies and use

25
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:26,281
dependency injection inside our application.

26
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,552
We've already used this to register our DynamoDB client.

27
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:36,295
Let's register our IMovieRankService, we'll register this as a Singleton.

28
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:40,372
We also need to add the MovieRank.Service using statement as well.

29
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:43,715
I'm going to delete the unnecessary using statements at the top of our

30
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:47,953
class because they can become a little distracting.

31
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:49,688
Heading into our MovieController class,

32
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:55,551
we can dependency inject our IMovieRankService interface into our controller.

33
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:58,755
I will add an IMovieRankService field at the top,

34
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:03,960
and make sure that we add the MovieRank.Services using statement.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,156
We then want to create a constructor.

36
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:11,763
Inside our constructor, we want to declare our IMovieRankService dependency.

37
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:15,782
We also want to add a route decorator to the top of our class.

38
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:23,000
We need to include this route name as part of our request. We'll add the Route movies.
