1
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:07,127
Our final method in our MovieController class is the GetMoviesRanking.

2
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:10,846
This gets us all user's rankings for a specific movie.

3
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:14,165
This uses our secondary index.

4
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:19,403
Inside our Controller class, we call off to the MovieRankService class.

5
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:20,597
In our method, GetMovieRank,

6
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:27,357
we call off to our Repository class to a method that we'll be creating shortly,

7
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:28,385
GetMovieRank.

8
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:33,095
This method will return us back all user's rankings for a specific movie.

9
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:34,944
Once we get the movie back with all the rankings,

10
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:39,535
we want to take all of these rankings and get an average in an

11
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:43,206
overall ranking to pass it back to the user.

12
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:44,487
Once we have our overall ranking,

13
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:48,655
we can pass back a MovieRankResponse that contains the

14
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:52,358
MovieName and the overall ranking.

15
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:54,722
Inside our MovieRankRepository class,

16
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:59,780
we want to create a method with a return type of Task QueryResponse and a

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,026
method name GetMovieRank with a parameter of movieName.

18
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:11,447
Inside our method, we create a new QueryRequest and set our TableName.

19
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:17,174
We want to set the IndexName property with our secondary index name,

20
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:18,167
MovieNameâ€‘index.

21
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,448
We want to set the KeyCondition. This is the condition

22
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,508
that we want to query our database with.

23
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:27,481
In our case, we want to query on the MovieRank MovieName property,

24
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:32,928
and say equal to the movieName argument that's being passed in to our method.

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,836
We now need to set the ExpressionAttributeValues.

26
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:39,512
Remember this is similar to the key that we set in our

27
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:41,641
GetItemRequest in our GetMovie method.

28
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:45,594
We say ExpressionAttributeValues equals new Dictionary

29
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,923
of type string and AttributeValue,

30
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:53,664
then set :movieName as the Dictionary key and new

31
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:58,067
AttributeValue set to our parameter arguments.

32
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:02,416
Using our _dynamoDbClient, we can use the DynamoDB QueryAsync method,

33
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:11,000
and pass in the QueryRequest that we have just built, and we'll add this method to our interface.
