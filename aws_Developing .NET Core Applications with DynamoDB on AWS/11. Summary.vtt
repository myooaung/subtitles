00:00:03.057 --> 00:00:09.027
In this module, we looked at and spoke about the DynamoDB document model.

2
00:00:09.027 --> 00:00:12.889
We implemented, inside our application, the following endpoints.

3
00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.842
We added the ability to get all items from our database.

4
00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:20.760
We allowed a user to get a specific movie.

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.854
We also added the ability to get users ranked movies based on the movie title.

6
00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:31.504
We allowed users to add a movie with a ranking and also

7
00:00:31.504 --> 00:00:35.376
allowed them to update a movie's ranking.

8
00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:40.035
We finally allowed a user to get back an overall movie ranking.

9
00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:48.000
In our next module, we'll swap out the document model code and implement the lowâ€‘level model.
