00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:10.303
Once we have our AWS account set up, head along to console.aws .amazon .com.

2
00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:12.797
Here you'll be able to log into your AWS account,

3
00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:15.943
allowing you access to the AWS Management Console.

4
00:00:15.943 --> 00:00:18.303
I've already logged into my account,

5
00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:23.510
so I'm taking directly to the homepage of the AWS Management Console.

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.795
The AWS Management Console is a web application that allows us

7
00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:32.336
to interact with AWS products and services.

8
00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:35.566
We'll be taking a brief look around the console to make sure you understand

9
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:39.458
the basics of the console and how to navigate around it.

10
00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:43.663
Our focus will be on Amazon's DynamoDB.

11
00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:46.117
If you are after a more in-depth look at the AWS Console,

12
00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:49.035
then there's a really good Pluralsight course called

13
00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:52.966
Navigating the AWS Management Console that will take you

14
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.311
through a more in-depth look of the console.

15
00:00:56.311 --> 00:01:00.788
Let's first have a look at where we can view and manage our account.

16
00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:03.078
If we select our name on the top-right hand corner,

17
00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:08.743
and select My Account, we are presented with the Account Settings page.

18
00:01:08.743 --> 00:01:10.727
This includes contact and other information,

19
00:01:10.727 --> 00:01:15.969
and at the bottom of this page is where you can close your account.

20
00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.740
If we now select the Dashboard tab,

21
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.843
we are presented with the Billing and Cost Management Dashboard.

22
00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:26.027
This page shows us a breakdown of what our previous month's spend was,

23
00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:29.249
what are current spenders, and based on their usage,

24
00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.856
what the forecasted spend is for this month.

25
00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:37.101
For further breakdown of what we're spending for each service,

26
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.535
we can head along to the Bills tab.

27
00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.764
This allows us to get a more in-depth look at what our spending is for

28
00:01:43.764 --> 00:01:48.656
each product or service that we have inside of AWS.

29
00:01:48.656 --> 00:01:50.867
If I click the drop-down arrow for DynamoDB,

30
00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:56.806
under the AWS Service Charges, and select US West Oregon,

31
00:01:56.806 --> 00:02:00.209
we get a more in-depth look at what our costs are.

32
00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.367
Our Dynamo table that we will be creating will be in the

33
00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.999
Free Tier range that is offered by AWS.

34
00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.601
Now, if we click the AWS logo on the top-left of the page,

35
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:16.526
we'll be taken back to the AWS Console homepage.

36
00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:18.664
When we open the My Account Settings page,

37
00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:23.901
a new tab was opened, so I'm just going to close the previous tab.

38
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:26.939
AWS is hosted in many different regions.

39
00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.733
If we select the current region that is selected for us,

40
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:35.150
Oregon, we are shown the different regions that are available to us.

41
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.530
AWS's products and services are hosted in separate

42
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.876
geographic areas called regions.

43
00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:46.263
We can create our services or host our applications in each of these regions.

44
00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:50.555
It's important to note that all regions have all

45
00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.231
services and features available.

46
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:55.778
So before creating or setting up any AWS product or service,

47
00:02:55.778 --> 00:03:01.239
first check what you are trying to create is available in that region.

48
00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.967
For our demo, we'll be creating our DynamoDB table in Oregon.

49
00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:11.605
On the main AWS Console page, we are able to search for AWS products or services.

50
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:15.795
So for example, if we put DynamoDB into the search bar,

51
00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.545
we are shown the link to DynamoDB.

52
00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:21.549
If we don't know the name of the product or service we are looking for,

53
00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.144
then we can select the Services drop-down menu that is on the top-left.

54
00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:31.345
This drop-down shows us all products and services that are offered by AWS.

55
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:34.661
These are ordered into categories, for instance,

56
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.864
if we look under Database, we have DynamoDB.

57
00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:44.394
This is the database that this course will be focusing on.

58
00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:49.465
And to make it easier to navigate to a product or service that you commonly use,

59
00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:53.028
we can add a shortcut to the AWS Management Console.

60
00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:55.603
On the navigation bar, choose the push-pin icon,

61
00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:59.335
and drag a service from the menu to the navigation bar.

62
00:03:59.335 --> 00:04:06.000
You can add more shortcuts and drop them into your navigation bar in any order that you want.
