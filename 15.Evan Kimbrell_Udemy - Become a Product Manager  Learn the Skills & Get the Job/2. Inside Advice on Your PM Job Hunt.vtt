Hey everyone. Before we move on to the
actual resume and interview process,
1

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.050
I wanted to give you a couple of sort of insider tips
on looking for a product management job.
2

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.700
These are kind of miscellaneous tips that I just thought
that I should tell you about, and pay attention,
3

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.350
because they will help you in the long run.
4

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.040
The first tip is, for any product management job opportunity,
5

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.790
you should make sure that the company that is looking
to hire has a good understanding of the product
6

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.060
management role and can clearly illustrate why they're hiring one.
7

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.540
I say this because, as an observer of the industry, I've seen
a lot of companies that don't see the difference
8

9
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.870
between product and project management.
9

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.350
Sometimes these companies will end up hiring
somebody merely to keep engineers on task,
10

11
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.580
and if you can, you want to avoid this to maximize
your experience for actual product management.
11

12
00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.480
The second tip I have for you is to do a lot of research
on the current product team or product management
12

13
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.000
leader at the company. Find them on Twitter, look at
their blogs, check out their job history on LinkedIn
13

14
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.430
and see what you think about the things that they say.
What you're looking for here is someone that you
14

15
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.210
think you can learn a lot from that has had
product management experience before.
15

16
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.970
Sometimes, someone will be named director of product
at small growing companies, but they'll have no product
16

17
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.890
management experience before that,
17

18
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.850
and this is something that, trust me, you really want to avoid.
18

19
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.420
On the other hand, if you're interested in working for a
particular industry or a company down the road,
19

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.510
then working for somebody that has worked in that
industry in the past is a great thing to know,
20

21
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.490
it's a great thing to be able to say, "Oh, I'd like them
to be my boss so I can learn from them."
21

22
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.040
So pay attention to that. Alright, so recap here.
22

23
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.840
Do extensive research on the people that you'll
be working with and use it to your advantage.
23

24
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.900
Also, make sure that the company that's hiring you
knows why they're hiring a product manager, so that
24

25
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.530
you get a good role at a good product team,
where you can learn a lot.
25

26
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.950
I'll see you all in the next lecture, we're going to
move into the actual resume and interview process.
26

27
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.530
I'll catch you there.
