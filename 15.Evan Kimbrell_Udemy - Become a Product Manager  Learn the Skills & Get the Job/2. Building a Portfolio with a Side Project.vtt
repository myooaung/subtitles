00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.050
So, as I mentioned, the key to getting a product management
job is having some sort of relevant experience
3

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.980
to talk about and point to on your resume.
4

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.270
If you have no experience at your current job and
just can't think of anything you've done related to
5

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.550
product management at all, then a side project is the best option.
6

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.480
So if you've been following along with this course,
especially to the sections that Evan has taught, then
7

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.720
you already have a really good idea of how to do a
side project on a small product or feature. What you
8

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.440
need to do is document your experience of coming up
with ideas to solve user problems through a product
9

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.340
or a feature, and put it together somewhere like
a blog post on your own web site, a slide deck, or you
10

11
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.050
can actually make your own prototypes
really easily and put that online.
11

12
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.150
These projects can be very detailed or really just high level.
12

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.950
You can even take a product you use daily and describe
in writing or graphics how you would change it
13

14
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.470
in order to solve user needs better.
14

15
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.300
This is a pretty common tactic in the world of design actually.
15

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.850
You've probably seen a lot of designers post their own, like,
redesigned versions of popular web sites, or apps, or products,

17

18
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.290
and a lot of designers get their jobs this way.
18

19
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.570
You can actually do the same, but for product management,
and with features, and that sort of thing.

20

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.830
But if you want to do a deep dive into the topic of doing
your own project, I recommend two great resources.

22

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.370
Firstly, check out the other courses that Evan
has taught on coming up with ideas,
23

24
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
creating an MVP, or getting started as an entrepreneur.
24

25
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.640
These will set you up with everything you need.
25

26
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.800
Another option, if you want to do a step by step project
while also learning about product management,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.370
I recommend you check out my friend Ellen Chisa's course
called "The Fundamentals of Product Management."

32
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.430
Ellen also writes some really good blog posts on her
experience as a product manager, and she's got a lot,

so also be sure to check those out.
34

35
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.480
So, to recap here, doing a side project is a huge benefit
if you don't have any sort of relevant experience
35

36
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.290
at all and can't think of anything in your current role that qualifies
as product management style experience in the least.
36

37
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.500
at all and can't think of anything in your current role that qualifies
as product management style experience in the least.
37

38
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.300
Then you should start thinking about doing a side project.
All right, in the next lecture,
38

39
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.580
we're going to talk about some other things you can
do to really prep and increase your chances of getting
39

40
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.200
a job as a product manager.
40

41
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.040
I'll see you there.
