00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.040
Hey there.
1

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.140
So now we understand how larger products and companies start, grow, and then eventually mature and decline.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.350
So now we understand how larger products and companies start, grow, and then eventually mature and decline.
3

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.550
Let's talk about products themselves on a smaller scale.
4

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.320
Every product that is being developed has a series of steps that they go through.
5

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.760
We call this the product development process.
6

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.830
Sometimes you'll hear it be called the product development process lifecycle or product development lifecycle
7

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.180
but it's the process that products go through when they're being developed.
8

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.230
So there are seven main phases to this product development process.
9

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.750
They are conceive, plan, develop, iterate, launch, then steady state, and then finally we either maintain or kill the product.
10

11
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.960
They are conceive, plan, develop, iterate, launch, then steady state, and then finally we either maintain or kill the product.
11

12
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.420
We're going to talk about the first four in this lecture and we'll talk about the rest in the next lecture.
12

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.590
So the first phase conceive this is the phase where we collect user problems we brainstorm solutions
13

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.940
So the first phase, conceive, this is the phase where we collect user problems, we brainstorm solutions,
14

15
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.230
we're saying "All right, we want to make a product, but we want to figure out what we should make."
15

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.390
we're saying "All right, we want to make a product, but we want to figure out what we should make."
16

17
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370
We identify the focus areas we want to work on.
17

18
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.100
The biggest source of ideas for this phase is usually inside of a company from the employees of that company themselves.
18

19
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.470
The biggest source of ideas for this phase is usually inside of a company from the employees of that company themselves.
19

20
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.770
Phase number two, plan. In this phase we do market research.
20

21
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.590
So we've already got our ideas and we do the research on those ideas.
21

22
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.060
We look at the business case.
22

23
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090
Is this something that's going to make us money?
23

24
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.530
We do customer interviews and see if people
find this to be a problem.
24

25
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.650
We also roadmap out what we think we could make, how long it might take, and at what point we should
25

26
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.240
have particular features if we're actually going to do this.
26

27
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.450
So we move on to the next phase. The third phase is develop, this is where we get our hands dirty.
27

28
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.110
So we want to make timelines and we want to write out features that we're going to have in this product.
28

29
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.390
We're going to make our user stories and our specs and we're going to talk to development about estimations
29

30
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.900
We're going to make our user stories and our specs and we're going to talk to development about estimations
30

31
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:15.030
on very specific details of how long will this particular thing need to take to be developed. By the time
31

32
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.760
we begin developing, the requirements should be set, and they really shouldn't change until
32

33
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.980
we get some sort of validation on the early parts of the completed product,
33

34
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.050
our MVP, which we'll talk about a little bit later.
34

35
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.180
Then we move on to the fourth phase, iterate.
35

36
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.520
So this is when we finished the MVP, our very early prototype or the early minimum viable product of
36

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.130
this new product we're developing.
37

38
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.410
We get early feedback from users.
38

39
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.570
We test the assumptions that we made with the original idea for the product.
39

40
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.860
We don't wait until we are all the way done because we want to get the testing in as early as possible
40

41
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.770
from the users.
41

42
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.660
So we use tools like having an Alpha and a Beta.
42

43
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.100
You've probably seen these sorts of things out there where you can join Beta programs for software.
43

44
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.060
This is because these things are not complete and they want to make sure they're heading in the right
44

45
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.280
direction before they do a full launch.
45

46
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:16.710
Again, those first four phases are: conceive, plan, develop, iterate, and we're going to talk about the next three
46

47
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.320
major phases of the product development process in the next lecture. I will see you there.
