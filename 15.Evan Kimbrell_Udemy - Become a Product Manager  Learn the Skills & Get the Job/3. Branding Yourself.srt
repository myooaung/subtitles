The other thing that's going to really help you out
immensely in getting a job as a product manager
3

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,490
is having a good personal brand online.
4

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,320
What you want here is basically an online record that
demonstrates your knowledge of product management
5

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,780
and the skills required. Building credibility before you walk through the door to your interviews is worth its weight in gold.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,580
and the skills required. Building credibility before you walk through the door to your interviews is worth its weight in gold.
7

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,640
The best way to demonstrate credibility is to have a
website or blog where you talk about things related
8

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,740
to product management, and have those projects
we talked about available to the public.
9

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,110
Recruiters will often look at your social media profiles and
web site to understand if you're qualified or not for the role.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,190
Recruiters will often look at your social media profiles and
web site to understand if you're qualified or not for the role.
11

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,290
Since there is not as much information out there on
product management as compared to other topics, it's
12

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,850
actually pretty easy to stand out.
13

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,660
Here's a couple example topics that you
can consider writing about to get started.
14

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,370
Number one, you could write about why a particular product
you use is poor and then how it can be improved.
15

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:00:59,730
Number one, you could write about why a particular product
you use is poor and then how it can be improved.
16

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,180
This is actually a pretty common interview question
that they'll ask you as a PM.
17

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,590
They'll say, you know, "What is a favorite product
of yours and how could it be improved?"
18

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,360
Number two, you could say the top five mistakes you've
made in your current role and what you've learned.
19

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,540
Number two, you could say the top five mistakes you've
made in your current role and what you've learned.
20

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,850
Number three, you could read some product management
books, which we will have in the resources, some
21

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,110
recommendations for those,
22

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,950
and then you could write some blog posts about your reviews
of those books and what you agree or disagree with.
23

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,400
and then you could write some blog posts about your reviews
of those books and what you agree or disagree with.
24

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,180
Number four, you could write a post on your thoughts
on recent technology trends, or industry events, and
25

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,150
how you see them developing further or changing the market.
26

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,680
So besides a blog, it's also very helpful to have a
public social media account, like Twitter, where you
27

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,230
participate in product discussions or talk about
relevant things to product management.
28

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,290
I also recommend you go on Quora,
29

30
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:03,510
Q-U-O-R-A.com, and ask or answer questions
related to products and product strategy.
30

31
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,960
Alright, so quick recap.
31

32
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,280
One of the best things you can do to make sure you have a great online brand is to write or just have a public presence.

33

34
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,220
If you don't have a website or blog, you should make one.
34

35
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,210
You should start one.
35

36
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,590
You should start writing, and you should include some topics related to product management and product strategy in there.
36

37
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,870
You should start writing, and you should include some topics related to product management and product strategy in there.
37

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,160
Also, make sure you have a publicly available social
media account, like Twitter, where you talk about
38

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,990
things that are also on topic with product management,
and UX design, and user experience.
39

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,840
All right, I'll see you in the next section, where we'll be
talking about looking for product management jobs
40

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,650
All right, I'll see you in the next section, where we'll be
talking about looking for product management jobs
41

42
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,260
once you feel that you're sufficiently prepared.
