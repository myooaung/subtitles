00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,040
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, in this lecture,
we're going to start talking about the actual
1

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,800
customer interviews. In this lecture, we're going to cover
four different types of interviews,
2

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,440
talk about why we will be engaging with customers,
3

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,210
what we're trying to get out of them, and how in general these interviews are conducted. Now, as a product manager,
4

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:21,660
what we're trying to get out of them, and how in general these interviews are conducted. Now, as a product manager,
5

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,080
there are numerous reasons why you will want to engage
with your customers in an interview setting.
6

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,780
Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, generally will
talk to their customers at the beginning,
7

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,820
at the outset, just to figure out whether or not they're onto something, and they'll then use that information
8

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,950
to figure out how to build an MVP.
9

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,740
But there are other reasons why you might engage with the customer, and it kind of just depends on what
10

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:54,090
you need as an organization, as a product owner,
and where you are in your product's progress.
11

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,390
Now, the first type of interview is the exploratory interview.
Now, an exploratory interview is the most
12

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,510
freeform interview there is. The idea here is
you're really just waiting out to see,
13

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,480
talking to your customers, trying to establish whether or not
they have certain pain points, whether or
14

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,710
not they're open to certain solutions, and, in general, what do they feel like, what do they look like, and how do they operate.
15

16
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,140
not they're open to certain solutions, and, in general, what do they feel like, what do they look like, and how do they operate.
16

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,170
The idea here is that you are exploring, you're fishing,
you're trying to find things your customers have
17

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,610
a problem with, are excited about, you're trying to find
things that they do differently than other people,
18

19
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,670
you're looking for any little clue or a hint that can give you
some type of insight about the product you
19

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,790
already have or the one that you're building.
20

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,140
This is often something you will do when you're trying to come up with ideas, ways of changing your product, ways of expanding it.
21

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,240
This is often something you will do when you're trying to come up with ideas, ways of changing your product, ways of expanding it.
22

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,050
You will have a back log but you do have to
come up with new ideas.
23

24
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,220
When you talk to an actual customer, talk to them about their day, the context in which they use your
24

25
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,430
product or could use your product, they'll give you a million different things that you can build a solution for.
25

26
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,890
product or could use your product, they'll give you a million different things that you can build a solution for.
26

27
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,700
And the best part about doing this in person is
you can visually see how badly they want this solution
27

28
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,240
and whether or not they would pay for it.
28

29
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,250
Here are some example exploratory questions that
you might ask a customer. Let's say we're using an app
29

30
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,120
that has to do with getting directions. I might ask,
"What's the worst part of your commute?"
30

31
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,720
It's an open ended question, fishing for some type of pain,
31

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,680
It's an open ended question, fishing for some type of pain,
32

33
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,780
and to understand the hierarchy of problems they have
within the context of a certain situation.
33

34
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,950
Another question I might ask is,
"When you get lost driving, what do you do?"
34

35
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,330
I'm fishing for substitutes for solving their problem, and, again,
35

36
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,290
they'll color in kind of my picture of what
normal consumers do when they're lost.
36

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,670
Now, the second type of interview is the validation interview,
and this is by far the most common one.
37

38
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:02,860
Now, the second type of interview is the validation interview,
and this is by far the most common one.
38

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,370
The purpose of a validation interview is that
you have a theory and you want to test it out.
39

40
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:18,300
Your theory might be that users will go bananas for feature X
or you might be pre-product and your theory
40

41
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,500
is that "My solution solves their problem."
41

42
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,710
That is always a theory until you launch, until you get validation, and until you reach product market fit.
42

43
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,430
That is always a theory until you launch, until you get validation, and until you reach product market fit.
43

44
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,660
Now, let's talk a little bit more about validation interviews,
because they are the biggest deal
44

45
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,960
of them all, you will do them as a product manager and
you will do them as an entrepreneur. Unavoidable.
45

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,140
of them all, you will do them as a product manager and
you will do them as an entrepreneur. Unavoidable.
46

47
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,650
Generally, validation interviews are run in a very specific way.
Because you have a theory and you want
47

48
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,320
it to be proven or disproven, you kind of
have to run it in a scientific way.
48

49
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,920
Now, do you think that in a validation interview you just
walk right in there and say, "This is my product,
49

50
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,030
or this is the feature I'm adding. What do you think? Do you like it?"
50

51
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,920
or this is the feature I'm adding. What do you think? Do you like it?"
51

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,860
or this is the feature I'm adding. What do you think? Do you like it?"
52

53
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,820
If I were standing right in front of your face like I am now,
coming through the screen, and I asked you,
53

54
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,760
"Do you like my web site? I spent six months working on it."
54

55
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,980
"Do you like my web site? I spent six months working on it."
55

56
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:18,450
Do you think you're more likely to say yes or say no?
You're probably more likely to say yes because
56

57
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,840
you're probably a decent person and you want to please me,
and that's generally how human nature works.
57

58
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:24,920
you're probably a decent person and you want to please me,
and that's generally how human nature works.
58

59
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:32,910
Validation interviews are hypersensitive to bias,
so much so that they're run in a way that you don't
59

60
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:39,990
even introduce your idea, your theory, your product,
your new feature till the very, very end.
60

61
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,700
You spend the majority of the interview talking around the problem your product solves. When you do introduce it,
61

62
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:47,870
You spend the majority of the interview talking around the problem your product solves. When you do introduce it,
62

63
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,580
you don't hype the idea, you don't defend it,
63

64
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,700
you don't hype the idea, you don't defend it,
64

65
00:04:51,810 --> 00:05:01,350
you don't exaggerate what it is. You simply present it and then collect honest feedback and try to chart
65

66
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,580
how they react and how they think after it.
66

67
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:14,250
The problem is that if you bias their answers in any way,
if you infringe on their ability to think freely,
67

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,250
even if it's very subtle, you have essentially ruined the interview.
68

69
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,190
Any data you got from that is junk. It's poison.
69

70
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,210
Any data you got from that is junk. It's poison.
70

71
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,170
So learn to zip it and let them do the talking.
71

72
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:35,400
Let them in their own words to describe the problem they have
and what they think of your proposed solution.
72

73
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,520
Let them in their own words to describe the problem they have
and what they think of your proposed solution.
73

74
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,930
You spend  the majority of these interviews not pushing your customer, but corralling them in the right
74

75
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:46,290
direction, trying your best to get them to talk about the problem you are trying to solve in their own
75

76
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,110
words and to see if they themselves find it on their own.
76

77
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,020
Let's give some examples of a validation type question.
I might ask you,
77

78
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:01,980
"Do you ever lose things in your house?"
followed up by, "Do you ever lose your keys?"
78

79
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:07,110
What I'm doing there is I'm asking them about things they
lose in their house, seeing if they say anything
79

80
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,260
about their keys, and if they don't, I try to
narrow the focus down to keys, so then I ask them if
80

81
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:18,660
they lose their keys often to see if
that is actually something they do.
81

82
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,230
Now, that's a good pre-product question,
but what about a post product question?
82

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,940
Well, a post product validation question could be like,
"When you're using our app and you want to collaborate
83

84
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,330
with your co-workers, what do you end up doing?"
84

85
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,720
with your co-workers, what do you end up doing?"
85

86
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:38,760
This might be on the heel of a feature that allows them to collaborate within your app and you're trying
86

87
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,760
to chart how they solve that problem, whether or not they have
that problem, or if it's even something they care about.
87

88
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,440
to chart how they solve that problem, whether or not they have
that problem, or if it's even something they care about.
88

89
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,880
The third type of interview is a satisfaction oriented interview,
and satisfaction interviews, they're exactly
89

90
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,760
what they sound like. You're trying to dig out what parts of your products are working for your customers
90

91
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,480
and what parts of your product are not.
91

92
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,830
You're also trying to gauge in general what they think about your product. As a product manager, you need
92

93
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:12,060
to know whether or not opinions of your product are going south,
or if they're jumping ship and going to your competitors.
93

94
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,360
to know whether or not opinions of your product are going south,
or if they're jumping ship and going to your competitors.
94

95
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,240
But more importantly than just knowing that, you need to understand why they are. So get at the root
95

96
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,850
of their dissatisfaction or figure out what exactly you are doing right.
96

97
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,640
Some example questions might be, "What should we stop doing?"
97

98
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,070
A great open ended question trying to get them
to tell us what exactly simply is not working.
98

99
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,580
If something's abrasive, if something is just
going against the grain for their experience,
99

100
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,570
they'll tell you. Another one I like to ask is "What's
one thing I could do to make this better for you?" If 
100

101
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,030
they have something that is lacking, they will bring it up.
101

102
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,400
they have something that is lacking, they will bring it up.
102

103
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,460
It's a great way of digging out the number one thing on the top of their mind and whatever is most important to them.
103

104
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,100
It's a great way of digging out the number one thing on the top of their mind and whatever is most important to them.
104

105
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,710
Now, the last type of interview is an efficiency interview.
In an efficiency interview, you're trying to
105

106
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:05,040
figure out how exactly your product ingrains into the life
of your customer and, as a function of that,
106

107
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,370
how can you improve it to better serve its purpose.
107

108
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,420
You're trying to get an idea for who uses your product, what do they do on it, when do they use it,
108

109
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,500
You're trying to get an idea for who uses your product, what do they do on it, when do they use it,
109

110
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,790
under what circumstances. And from that contextual learning,
you can figure out what parts are serving
110

111
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:28,680
them well, what parts are unnecessary or inefficient, and what parts are actually degrading from what they're trying to do.
111

112
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,790
them well, what parts are unnecessary or inefficient, and what parts are actually degrading from what they're trying to do.
112

113
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,530
You'll fish for things like, "Are they using X, Y, and Z feature?"
and "What are they using X, Y, and Z feature
113

114
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,670
for?" It's very common you'll find people not using
your features or your product exactly like you thought.
114

115
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,270
When you do find that, it's generally a sign that something
is broken in your process, either something is too
115

116
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,900
hard to understand, or the process is too inefficient,
or you're just targeting the wrong people.
116

117
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:04,950
Some example questions you might ask in an efficiency type interview is, "How easy is it for you to use
117

118
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,310
feature X?" You're just trying to figure out, in their own words,
is this something they enjoy using?
118

119
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,980
feature X?" You're just trying to figure out, in their own words,
is this something they enjoy using?

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,230
Is it easy for them to use? Is it easy to understand? All of it.

121
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,380
Is it easy for them to use? Is it easy to understand? All of it.
121

122
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,200
Another question might be something along the lines of,
"If you wanted to do [...], how would you do it in our product?
122

123
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,780
Another question might be something along the lines of,

123

124
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,700
It's always interesting to ask customers to show you
how they would do something and you can see at
124

125
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,330
what point in time they got confused, misdirected, did something wrong, or figured out something you never thought of.
125

126
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,060
what point in time they got confused, misdirected, did something wrong, or figured out something you never thought of.
126

127
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,180
Ok, so those are the four different types of interviews,
and I know you're asking the question.
127

128
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:48,750
"Well, aren't there interviews that do both or a combination of them?" And yes, absolutely, so don't necessarily
128

129
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,390
think of them as just types of interviews.
129

130
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:58,950
They're more the purposes that you would use an interview for
or whatever your focus is on an interview.
130

131
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:07,320
You can definitely do a validation interview and an efficiency interview in the same setting. Alright, in the next
131

132
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,860
lecture, we're going to talk about best practices
when you are talking to your customers,
132

133
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,510
how can you make good questions, how can you tell
when you're asking the wrong questions,
133

134
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,240
how can you make good questions, how can you tell
when you're asking the wrong questions,
134

135
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,480
and what in general do you want to shy away from.
Alright, see you in the next lecture.
