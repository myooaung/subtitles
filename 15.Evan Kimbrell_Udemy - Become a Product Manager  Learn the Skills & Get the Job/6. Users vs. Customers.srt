Welcome back, everyone.
1

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,700
So do you remember where I said that sometimes the people that pay for your product are not actually
2

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,180
the users of your product?
3

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,190
We're going to talk a little bit more about that right now.
4

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,160
So there's a difference between users and customers.
5

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,000
And if you work as a B2B or business to business product manager this might actually be pretty common.
6

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,510
And if you work as a B2B or business to business product manager this might actually be pretty common.
7

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,020
So one of my first product management jobs was at a company that sold social media monitoring software
8

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,910
to companies that were interested
in identifying trends on social media.
9

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,440
So the company was called Mass Relevance and this product we sold, the ability to log into a platform
10

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,630
and check out all these social media trends, was something that cost like $200,000 to $500,000.
11

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,270
and check out all these social media trends, was something that cost like $200,000 to $500,000.
12

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,400
So it was not cheap.
13

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,140
So the people that bought this were major companies and the people that signed the checks for this were
14

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,440
directors of marketing or social media.
15

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,230
And when they bought it, they were not the ones using it, but they would give the logins to their underlings,
16

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,810
like the social media managers or the marketing managers.
17

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,350
And you can see how these are two totally different people.
18

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,270
So when we were getting feedback,
we would get feedback from two different groups.
19

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,480
We'd get macro level feedback on
what our product should be able to do in general,
20

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,300
this was from the higher ups, like the directors of marketing
and that sort of thing.
21

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,280
And then we had really granular feedback
from the users themselves.
22

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,690
These are the people that were logged in every day and they'd have feedback like "Oh, where's the button for this?"
23

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,280
These are the people that were logged in every day and they'd have feedback like "Oh, where's the button for this?"
24

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,840
"I would like to do this inside the platform."
Two separate user groups and two separate sets of feedback.
25

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,010
All right.
26

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,520
All right.
27

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,350
To sum it up, the users and the clients are sometimes two completely different groups with different sets of feedback,
28

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,240
To sum it up, the users and the clients are sometimes two completely different groups with different sets of feedback,
29

30
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,720
but it's important to keep in mind.
30

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,410
Got it? Alright, moving on.
31

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,820
Got it? Alright, moving on.
32

33
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,310
Got it? Alright, moving on.
