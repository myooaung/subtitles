"The ambiguity of the product management role
is near to its essence."
1

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,110
Welcome back.
2

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,180
I hope you're excited about starting this course.
3

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,510
Let's go ahead and dive right in. 
In this lecture,
4

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,520
we're going to talk about what product management actually is.
5

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,050
And by the end of this lecture, you'll have a really solid understanding of the role and hopefully be
6

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,180
even more excited about the rest of the course.
7

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,310
Does that excite you?
8

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,930
If it doesn't, you can't be a product manager.
9

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,190
You should probably leave.
10

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,530
I'm kidding, but this Venn diagram pretty much sums up my entire existence.
11

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,330
I also love graphs.
12

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,590
So product management is actually a pretty difficult role to define, which is why you don't really find
13

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,760
the concrete, concise, good explanations just by Googling it.
14

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,510
Try Googling it right now and I challenge you to find a really good description
15

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:57,370
.
16

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,730
In fact, the role of the product manager and their exact responsibilities change across different industries 
17

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,230
and different companies.
18

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,320
If at one company, you're a product manager and you have one set of responsibilities, you might have a completely
19

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,630
different set of responsibilities at another company, depending on the company, the industry, and the size.
20

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:15,870
different set of responsibilities at another company, depending on the company, the industry, and the size.
21

22
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,240
What we'll focus on here are the core tenants that make up product management. The first and most important
22

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,390
thing to know about product management is that you're actually not a manager of anybody.
23

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,510
No one reports to you, you're nobody's boss, and you definitely can't fire anyone.
24

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,700
No one reports to you, you're nobody's boss, and you definitely can't fire anyone.
25

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,630
This is actually by design, because a product manager needs to continuously interact with a number of
26

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,060
different people, get maximum collaboration from their engineers and also the designers that they work with.
27

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,270
different people, get maximum collaboration from their engineers and also the designers that they work with.
28

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,380
Think about it for a second. If you wanted honest feedback from engineers and designers that you worked
29

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,770
with, but you're also their boss,
30

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,010
do you think they're going to tell you if they have any disagreements with what you have to say?
31

32
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,180
Probably not.
32

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,170
So you want them to tell you every single time that they disagree with you.
33

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,240
A product manager is someone that sits in between multiple areas of the company and acts as a communications
34

35
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,500
hub, organizer, and enabler for everyone else.
35

36
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,800
So here's kind of a funny story.
36

37
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,580
We once had a new engineer join our company and he asked "What do you do?"
37

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,730
He hadn't worked with a product manager before, and before I could answer, the other engineers said
38

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,780
"That's the person that stops sales and legal from emailing you."
39

40
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,770
As a product manager, you're kind of a blocker / enabler for engineers and designers. The communication
40

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,310
and enabling aspect of product management is a very important one.
41

42
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,020
Engineers are very good at engineering and designers are very good at designing, so it's best if these
42

43
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,130
people spend their time doing what they're best at.
43

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,940
While engineers focus on solving hard technical challenges, product managers are talking to various stakeholders,
44

45
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,670
users, receiving feedback and looking at metrics to decide what things can be built next and which of
45

46
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,640
those things is most important and the best use of time.
46

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,350
Have you ever used a product, either software or something physical,
47

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,780
where many things about that product
48

49
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,060
are really good, but then there's one small piece that's just really terrible?
49

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,530
If there's something wrong with any product, 
you can blame the product manager.
50

51
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,650
Basically, a product manager is someone who's responsible for that product being successful or not.
51

52
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,950
To recap, the product manager is many things: a communications hub, a prioritizer, a researcher, a presenter,
52

53
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,090
but most importantly, the responsible for the ultimate success of the product.
53

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,590
but most importantly, the responsible for the ultimate success of the product.
54

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,130
So your next question is probably
55

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,810
"All right, so what's a product?"
56

57
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,840
Well, I'm glad you asked because that's what we're going to talk about the next lecture.
