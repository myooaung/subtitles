Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.340
Now, I know after watching the lectures on all the different techniques you can use to MVP your feature
2

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.870
or product, you might have been repeatedly asking
the question to yourself "Can I do any of these in a
3

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.770
big, well-known organization?"
4

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.230
"What about our brand?"
5

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.020
Well, it's a great question.
6

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.400
And so, in this lecture, we're going to talk about the answer.
7

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.910
So how do big organizations run MVP tests?
8

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.540
Well, remember how we talked about the relationship
between risk and the size of your company?
9

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.000
Well, if you fell asleep let me just recap it for you,
10

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.690
this is the gist. The gist is larger organizations have
the resources to weather failed products.
11

12
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.200
It doesn't mean that they want their products to fail necessarily,
but if they do, it's not the end of the world.
12

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.130
It doesn't mean that they want their products to fail necessarily,
but if they do, it's not the end of the world.
13

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.000
So big organizations generally have a different risk to reward
calculus when it comes to launching new
14

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760
products or new features.
15

16
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.650
A startup's main risk with a new product launch
is that they use up all of their resources.
16

17
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.460
That's the biggest risk for them. But the risk big organizations
care about is comprised of a lot
17

18
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.740
of other things, one of which is the risk to their brand.
18

19
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.930
So when you run an MVP test, you're going to
have to decide how much risk you can tolerate.
19

20
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.440
A general rule of thumb is that the larger the organization,
the more concerned they will be with brand,
20

21
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.790
and the less concerned they will be with resources. Pre-product startups - remember? - care the least about brand
21

22
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.920
because what does it matter how strong your brand is
if you're dead and you don't exist anymore?
22

23
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.410
Now, remember, when you run an MVP test,
there are numerous ways of tackling this,
23

24
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.050
and they all exist on a spectrum.
24

25
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.440
An email MVP is probably the easiest on resources,
but the most reckless with your brand. A Wizard of
25

26
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.020
Oz MVP probably is the most resource intensive,
26

27
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.890
after all, you have to actually make the front end of your supposed product, but it's the most protective of your brand.
27

28
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.640
after all, you have to actually make the front end of your supposed product, but it's the most protective of your brand.
28

29
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.310
People don't even notice that it's not officially your version 1.
29

30
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.120
If done well, it won't look to the user like anything is different.
30

31
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.830
But, generally, companies are going to reach a certain size
where they're beyond these tactics. In those
31

32
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.420
cases, as a product manager,
32

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.380
you'll be expected to build an MVP that is really more like
what most people incorrectly assume an MVP is.
33

34
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.830
you'll be expected to build an MVP that is really more like
what most people incorrectly assume an MVP is.
34

35
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.070
It's a really, really basic version of your product,
and product managers in that type of situation are
35

36
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.040
calling it an MVP just because they're used to calling it that,
and everyone else knows what you're talking
36

37
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.230
about, even if it's the case that you make
37

38
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.500
Eric Ries cry. Your job in these roles is to think about
how exactly you can build out your features,
38

39
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.770
but in a way that doesn't expend any unnecessary resources.
You can't rely on parlor tricks anymore,
39

40
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.850
but in a way that doesn't expend any unnecessary resources.
You can't rely on parlor tricks anymore,
40

41
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.550
you really have to build at least something.
41

42
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.200
You can't really half step it.
42

43
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.410
The most common way that product managers
tackle this issue is through a type of MVP
43

44
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.200
we didn't actually cover. This type of MVP is called
"the one feature app." A one feature MVP is exactly
44

45
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.170
what it sounds like, when you build out literally
only one core function of your product or feature, and
45

46
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.210
then test its reception before slowly adding on more.
46

47
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.100
To do this well, you need to take every function in your feature or every feature in your product and list them out.
47

48
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.480
To do this well, you need to take every function in your feature or every feature in your product and list them out.
48

49
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.160
After that, you rank it based on the value to your user.
In 99% of the cases, one function or one
49

50
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.380
feature is going to stand out way more
than the others in terms of value,
50

51
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.430
so you just build that. Remember Foursquare?
51

52
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.920
It was this app where you could check into local businesses
or locations, you could win prizes, you could
52

53
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.070
network with other people, gather badges, you could do about
a million different things they were all location based.
53

54
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.770
network with other people, gather badges, you could do about
a million different things they were all location based.
54

55
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.500
The core of Foursquare's idea though was - can you guess it? -
to let people check in to their locations and
55

56
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.970
let their friends know this.
56

57
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.090
So when they built their MVP to see if anyone wanted
to use this, they just built literally that function.
57

58
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.820
You could connect your social networks, and then
you could check in. The check in would send out a text
58

59
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.230
to your social networks.
59

60
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.610
They didn't have photos, they didn't add hashtags,
they didn't add badges, because all of these things
60

61
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.120
are really secondary in value to the checking in process,
which was the number one thing they cared about.
61

62
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.970
As a product manager, you're going to be constantly making
hard decisions about what to build and what not.
62

63
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.170
As a product manager, you're going to be constantly making
hard decisions about what to build and what not.
63

64
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.940
It's really no exception in the land of MVPs.
64

65
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.890
You'll have to gauge your company's tolerance for risk.
65

66
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.320
Do they care more about resources or more about brand?
And then figure out the best way to optimize your
66

67
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.760
resource expenditure with the information that you need to gather.
67

68
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.830
It's exhausting, but I know you can do it.
68

69
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.240
So, cheer up! Alright guys, questions or concerns,
just post in the Q&A, we'll get to those.

Otherwise, see you in the next lecture.
