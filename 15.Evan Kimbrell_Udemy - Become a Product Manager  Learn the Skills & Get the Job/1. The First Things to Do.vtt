00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.110
What's up, everybody?
1

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.120
So this is all about how to excel at the role once you've
already got the product management job, and
2

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.250
because this is all about how to excel after
you've already got the job,
3

4
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.070
I'm assuming you've got the job.
4

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.550
And in that case, congratulations.
5

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.130
I'm so happy for you, it brings a tear to my eye.
6

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.880
I'm so happy for you, it brings a tear to my eye.
7

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.580
And if only there were a way that I could, through
the screen, congratulate you or make you happy.
8

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.880
How about this bear suit?
9

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.750
I will teach the rest of this lecture in this bear suit,
with these claws, because you make me so happy
10

11
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.940
to be a product management instructor - you've got the job!
11

12
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.000
to be a product management instructor - you've got the job!
12

13
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.680
So once you've got your first product management
job, it can be a little bit daunting trying to figure
13

14
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.620
out what the first thing is that you should do.
14

15
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:05.580
But bear with me here, product management is notorious
for having one of the longest ramp-up times for
15

16
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.140
a lot of jobs out there.
16

17
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.880
By that, I mean it's really, usually taking a lot of time
to get completely comfortable with the role.
17

18
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.150
By that, I mean it's really, usually taking a lot of time
to get completely comfortable with the role.
18

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.390
This is because the work you do involves so many different
teams, and you need to understand the history
19

20
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.730
and goals of each one to do the best work.
20

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.440
What I'm going to do here is give you some tips on
things to do as soon as you get the job and start work.
21

22
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.040
What I'm going to do here is give you some tips on
things to do as soon as you get the job and start work.
22

23
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.480
These tips will make you "beary" much more effective at your role.
23

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.320
All right, so tip number one: schedule
one-on-ones with everyone in the team.
24

25
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.570
If you're at a large company, you don't have to meet
with literally everybody, but be sure that you at least
25

26
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.650
meet with the leaders of each major team.
26

27
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.580
Ask them what their goals are and what challenges they have.
27

28
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.160
Take notes, so that you can refer back later.
28

29
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.490
All right.
29

30
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.120
Step two is arrange a meeting with the lead engineer
on your team and talk about the technical stuff.
30

31
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.270
Step two is arrange a meeting with the lead engineer
on your team and talk about the technical stuff.
31

32
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.260
Have them explain to you how the architecture looks
on the back-end in detail and what sorts of technologies
32

33
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.250
they use, like databases, and languages, and that sort of thing.
33

34
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.120
Also, ask them what the biggest technical challenges
are, and make sure you understand the basics of how
34

35
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.420
data is stored, and, again, what languages they use, and where
the sticking points are, what they're having trouble with.
35

36
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.310
data is stored, and, again, what languages they use, and where
the sticking points are, what they're having trouble with.
36

37
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.240
This will just help you build a great relationship with
the engineers, and it will make sure that you
37

38
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.070
know what you're getting yourself into, if you're going to try to change something major on the back-end with a feature.
38

39
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.060
know what you're getting yourself into, if you're going to try to change something major on the back-end with a feature.
39

40
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.460
All right, so the next tip is start talking to users.
40

41
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.480
When you join a lot of companies, it's going to appear
as if they know exactly what users want, and
41

42
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.610
even show you user feedback that they've received
in the past or over the last couple of years.
42

43
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.940
However, it's extremely important,
43

44
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.750
or should I say "beary" important, to talk to your users
and get the best idea of what is important to them.
44

45
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.820
or should I say "beary" important, to talk to your users
and get the best idea of what is important to them.
45

46
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.910
You want to see this yourself, because you may
draw some different conclusions.
46

47
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.520
After all, you're a brilliant product thinker.
47

48
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.640
Some things you can do here are ask to join in on
a sales call, go to sales meetings, spend some time
48

49
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.520
with the customer service team, helping them answer user
questions and tickets that people send in for support.
49

50
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.170
with the customer service team, helping them answer user
questions and tickets that people send in for support.
50

51
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.370
Things of this nature is what you're going for.
51

52
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.680
I also like to do a quick Google search for things that
people say about the company on the social web
52

53
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.970
sites, like the Twitter and the Reddit.
53

54
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.590
Number four.
54

55
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.700
My bear head is falling off, but read every internal
document you can get your hands on.
55

56
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.890
I recommend you ask or find documentation for the
epics and mobile releases that have been made in
56

57
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.900
the past, as well as things like sales decks
and internal presentations.
57

58
00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.260
All of these things are going to help you get a great historical
view of the product and what has happened over time.
58

59
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.400
All of these things are going to help you get a great historical
view of the product and what has happened over time.
59

60
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.790
Tip number five: look at the data. As soon as you have the chance,
60

61
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.270
you should take a look at the existing metrics for the product.
61

62
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.770
If there's a data science team or any data analysts,
ask to have a meeting with them where they describe
62

63
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.130
the types of data that are available in terms of metrics, and any plans they have around implementing more tracking.
63

64
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.560
the types of data that are available in terms of metrics, and any plans they have around implementing more tracking.
64

65
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.730
Sometimes, you might not think there's enough tracking
to make the best decisions, and you'll have to
65

66
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.930
make an effort with your team to track more.
66

67
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.820
Tip number six: meet with the boss.
67

68
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.990
You should make it a top priority to have a meeting
with either the head of product or the CEO to ask
68

69
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.730
them about expectations for your role,
but also to understand their goals.
69

70
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.690
Make sure what you talk about is related to what
metrics they're trying to optimize for and what they'd
70

71
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.120
really like for you to do in this role.
71

72
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.600
What are their biggest problems? Like, what are they
fearful of over the next year, in terms of stuff that's
72

73
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.480
going to be challenging or maybe what competitors are doing?
73

74
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.290
You can also ask them about things like process improvements
internally that need to be made, or improving marketing.
74

75
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.460
You can also ask them about things like process improvements
internally that need to be made, or improving marketing.
75

76
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.450
These are all things that you can
help out with as a product manager.
76

77
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.780
All right.
77

78
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.680
With those tips, you're going to be in a "beary" good position
to do the best work as soon as possible in your new role.
78

79
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.230
With those tips, you're going to be in a "beary" good position
to do the best work as soon as possible in your new role.
79

80
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.800
Like my claws are sharp - and I do mean
my claws because I am a bear -
80

81
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.460
your product management skillsets will be sharp,
your knowledge will be sharp
81

82
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.420
starting this job, it's super important that you do this,
82

83
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.740
and I've done this in all the companies I've worked for.
It's been really huge.
83

84
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.890
and I've done this in all the companies I've worked for.
It's been really huge.
84

85
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.770
All right, everybody.
85

86
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.630
Hope you enjoyed that one.
