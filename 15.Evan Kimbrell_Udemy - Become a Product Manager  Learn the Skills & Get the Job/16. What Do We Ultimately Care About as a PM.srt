Hey everyone. This section was all about competition and market analysis. What you learned from Evan's lectures
1

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,940
is stuff that's really vital to understand if you're developing a new product or company from scratch.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,940
However, if you're a product manager at a company or looking to get a job as one, this stuff will be extremely important to understand

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,050
However, if you're a product manager at a company or looking to get a job as one, this stuff will be extremely important to understand
5

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,300
from a theoretical level. Like we've mentioned before, if you're working as a product manager at a company
6

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,900
and they don't know who their competitors are,
then that's a red flag.
7

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,760
The people you work with and of course the executives will know exactly who the competitors currently
8

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,650
are or. if there are none yet. then they will know who is in a position to start competing with you soon.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:38,840
are or. if there are none yet. then they will know who is in a position to start competing with you soon.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,950
The biggest tip I can give you as a product manager when it comes to competition and market analysis
11

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,700
is to stay on top of industry news and pay very close attention to the features that competitors build.
12

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:50,850
is to stay on top of industry news and pay very close attention to the features that competitors build.
13

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,520
It's also great to look across industries at similar patterns even if the company does not directly compete with you.

00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,400
It's also great to look across industries at similar patterns even if the company does not directly compete with you.
15

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,610
Here's an example of that.
16

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,230
If I'm building social features for an app that lets people read books on their smartphone, I don't only
17

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,690
want to look at other smartphone book apps, I should also look at other apps that are social in general,
18

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,440
like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, to see what they have in common, how users are interacting with them,
19

20
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,430
and what I might learn from the lessons they've already learned, since they've already been doing social.
20

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:20,480
and what I might learn from the lessons they've already learned, since they've already been doing social.
21

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,590
Overall, if you're always up to date on what competitors are doing and have informed opinions about where
22

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,200
they will go next, you will gain respect from co-workers and go really far in the role of product management.
23

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,310
they will go next, you will gain respect from co-workers and go really far in the role of product management.
24

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,280
So that's it for this one. I'll see you all in the next lecture.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,640
So that's it for this one. I'll see you all in the next lecture.
