00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,920
Welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,590
So, by now, you should feel pretty confident about metrics,
about what they are, why they're important, and
2

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,870
a few ways you can go about choosing your own
metrics, and likely, if you're joining an established
3

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:24,570
company, on a team or something like this, you will
probably already have metrics to track, and they'll probably
4

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,440
already be actively tracked in the back-end.
5

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,650
So, in the case that you're working for one of these
companies and the metrics are already there, you'll
6

7
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,610
probably be working with an insights team, or analytics team,
or even a data science team to get the metrics
7

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,970
that you're looking for to report.
8

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,170
But let's imagine for a moment that you actually have
no metrics, and you've decided what you want to
9

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,860
track using the earlier lectures, but you have no idea.
10

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,960
Well, in this lecture, I wanted to talk about a couple of my favorite tools to track metrics, and they're really easy to use.
11

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,590
Well, in this lecture, I wanted to talk about a couple of my favorite tools to track metrics, and they're really easy to use.
12

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,840
So the first one is probably one of the most popular
analytics tools out there, it's Google Analytics, and
13

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,990
this is a really easy thing to install and will give you
all sorts of tracking information on your website,
14

15
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,870
this is a really easy thing to install and will give you
all sorts of tracking information on your website,
15

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,330
and they even have a component that delivers on mobile tracking.
16

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,560
So five stars for Google Analytics.
17

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,800
It is awesome.
18

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,060
I highly recommend it.
19

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,290
Secondly, there's a really cool tool for web sites
called CrazyEgg, and this gives you all sorts of click
20

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,450
data, where people are clicking and that sort of thing,
but it also gives you these really cool, like, heat
21

22
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:40,200
map things, where you can see with colors, like a heat map
of where people have been clicking and moving 
22

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,570
their mouse and scrolling.
23

24
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,340
It is pretty cool and gives you a ton of insight.
24

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,210
The next one is Kissmetrics, and it is an awesome
solution for both web and mobile, and it provides a
25

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,430
ton of data, and you can set up custom metrics, and do calculations on the fly, and look at all sorts of crazy graphs.
26

27
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,380
ton of data, and you can set up custom metrics, and do calculations on the fly, and look at all sorts of crazy graphs.
27

28
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,420
It's really good, but it's not cheap.
28

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,060
So the fourth one is similar to Kissmetrics,
and, in fact, it's a big competitor.
29

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,600
I think it's probably about 50/50 split between the
people who like Kissmetrics versus Mixpanel, but
30

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,460
it's also not cheap, but it's extremely good to use for
both web and mobile, and has some really cool
31

32
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:33,280
features, like a calculator, and you can look up
individual user behavior.
32

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,990
You can even hook it up to stuff like e-mail and push notifications
so you can send users messages to try to retain them.
33

34
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,880
You can even hook it up to stuff like e-mail and push notifications
so you can send users messages to try to retain them.
34

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,180
So the fifth one I'll recommend is Optimizely, and
Optimizely is actually more of an A/B testing tool,
35

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,420
but it also provides some really good click tracking
and that sort of thing that you can set up to
36

37
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,400
see how many people click where and where they're going.
37

38
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,680
It is really good and it is super easy to use compared
to a lot of other A/B testing tools out there.
38

39
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:04,950
It is really good and it is super easy to use compared
to a lot of other A/B testing tools out there.
39

40
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,150
I highly recommend it, and you can actually
just go demo it for free on their website.
40

41
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,800
So the last one I want to mention is one of my favorites, and that's because it's not a tool itself for metrics, but it's a metrics hub.
41

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,340
So the last one I want to mention is one of my favorites, and that's because it's not a tool itself for metrics, but it's a metrics hub.
42

43
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:27,450
So if you imagine, you have all these metrics tools
out there, and they all integrate with either your
43

44
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:34,740
mobile app or your web site through an API, which we'll
talk about later, but you usually have to put a piece
44

45
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,470
of code on your site or in your app in order to track stuff,
45

46
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:46,560
and the problem is, if you switch metrics tools, then you will usually have to switch out that code, and then, to make it even worse,
46

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,630
and the problem is, if you switch metrics tools, then you will usually have to switch out that code, and then, to make it even worse,
47

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,430
let's say you have one metrics tool, and you have
a year of using that, and you have all this data in
48

49
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,880
there, and then you switch to another one to try it out.
49

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,300
Well, now you've lost all the historical data
because you're switching to a new tool.
50

51
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,210
Well, Segment solves this problem, because it's like a hub.
51

52
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,490
Well, Segment solves this problem, because it's like a hub.
52

53
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:13,480
So you connect other services to it and then you
connect your app or your web site to Segment,
53

54
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,910
and this way, you can basically plug and unplug any
other solution, and it will just automatically send
54

55
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,520
the data to the tool that you would like.
55

56
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,290
So it's really good if you consider setting up with Segment first,
and then trying out a whole bunch of other tools.
56

57
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,310
So it's really good if you consider setting up with Segment first,
and then trying out a whole bunch of other tools.
57

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,390
It even keeps a backup of your data.
58

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,070
All right, so that's it for the metrics section.
59

60
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,460
And I hope you paid close attention, because this stuff
is super important as a product manager or an entrepreneur.
60

61
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,460
And I hope you paid close attention, because this stuff
is super important as a product manager or an entrepreneur.
61

62
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,190
Everyone needs to know this stuff.
62

63
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,080
So the next sections, we're going to get even deeper into the world of product management. It's time to get our hands dirty.
63

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,740
So the next sections, we're going to get even deeper into the world of product management. It's time to get our hands dirty.
64

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,940
I'll see you there.
