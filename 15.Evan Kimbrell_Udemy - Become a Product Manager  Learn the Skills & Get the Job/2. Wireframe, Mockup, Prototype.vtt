00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.630
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So, last lecture,
I introduced you to the concept of wireframing,
1

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.340
why we do it, what it is, and how often
are you going to use it as a product manager,
2

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.840
why we do it, what it is, and how often
are you going to use it as a product manager,
3

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.320
and under what circumstances. Now that you're comfortable
with wireframes, we can actually introduce
4

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.360
more concepts now that are related to wireframes.
5

6
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.470
Wireframes are kind of the entry point,
6

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.260
iIf you're wanting to conceptualize your product idea or communicate it, it's the most ubiquitous way of communicating,
7

8
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.410
iIf you're wanting to conceptualize your product idea or communicate it, it's the most ubiquitous way of communicating,
8

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.830
but wireframes can have more detail,
9

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.100
they can have more interaction,
and they can do all sorts of different things,
10

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.090
at which point we actually call them something else,
and that's the title of this lecture, which is "Wireframe,
11

12
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.610
mockup, and prototype." As a product manager,
you need to understand what makes them different,
12

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.060
what tools you'll use for each one, and, in general,
how do they relate to each other.
13

14
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.470
Let's first talk about wireframes, and I'm going to
explain this on a scale of fidelity.
14

15
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.150
Remember the concept of fidelity? Fidelity meaning accuracy.
Wireframes are at the far left and the first
15

16
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.310
thing we start with, because they're the simplest, they're
also called skeletons because they're very, very simple.
16

17
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.470
thing we start with, because they're the simplest, they're
also called skeletons because they're very, very simple.
17

18
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.610
The way I like to think of wireframes is that they're
like the blueprint of your design. You're almost
18

19
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.000
always going to make these first,
19

20
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.600
and the reason why you do it is because you want to
tackle some basic questions around structure, layout,
20

21
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.540
and organization before your team iterates on visual details.
21

22
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.260
Wireframes are on the low fidelity side.
22

23
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.010
We are going to worry about technical and visual detail later.
23

24
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.040
There's a time and place for it, and it is not now. Visuals, and specifications, and technical details are very important,
24

25
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.820
There's a time and place for it, and it is not now. Visuals, and specifications, and technical details are very important,
25

26
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.320
but you want to make sure that you have the structure
and the layout hammered down first.
26

27
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.180
Some of the tools we'll use in wireframing might be
Balsamiq, and we're going to use Balsamiq in
27

28
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.950
this course. Balsamiq is incredibly popular for low fidelity wireframes, because it allows you to make them very quickly,
28

29
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.700
this course. Balsamiq is incredibly popular for low fidelity wireframes, because it allows you to make them very quickly,
29

30
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.760
in a mock kind of sketch fashion that looks cool,
30

31
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.170
it's fun to play with, and people generally respond positively to it.
31

32
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.910
it's fun to play with, and people generally respond positively to it.
32

33
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.160
Another popular tool used for wireframing is Axure,
if I can remember how to draw the logo.
33

34
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.500
Sometimes it gets confused with the Windows Azure.
This is Axure with an X.
34

35
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.750
Axure is a big application, oftentimes you have it
at the enterprise level, because it allows teams to
35

36
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.650
collaborate and it has a lot of features baked into it.
36

37
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.970
It's by no means a lightweight solution.
37

38
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.270
Another one is Omni Graffle, that one is still used,
I'm not entirely sure why, it's kind of clunky, but
38

39
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.090
it has some interesting features. Just usually skip that one.
39

40
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.680
Hotgloo is another example of a popular wireframing tool.
I mention this one because this one is
40

41
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.390
actually browser based only, and you'll notice this
with a lot of tools for conceptualizing your product.
41

42
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.660
actually browser based only, and you'll notice this
with a lot of tools for conceptualizing your product.
42

43
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.100
A lot of them are browser based.
43

44
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.630
Why?
44

45
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.000
Well, it makes it more convenient for you to store your
information with them and not on your hard drive,
45

46
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.710
where something can go wrong, and also, you can
then access that information anywhere you are.
46

47
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.740
It's also much easier to share that way,
47

48
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.320
share your wireframes with your teammates without
having to send them an e-mail attachment, which are
48

49
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.870
notorious for just sucking. And the last one I want to mention is POP, which we're actually going to use in this course.
49

50
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.900
notorious for just sucking. And the last one I want to mention is POP, which we're actually going to use in this course.
50

51
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.340
It's really, really cool.
51

52
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.830
Check out that lecture.
52

53
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.280
POP allows you to take sketches that you've made and turn them into digital copies, and then you can manipulate them.
53

54
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.230
POP allows you to take sketches that you've made and turn them into digital copies, and then you can manipulate them.
54

55
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.190
All right, now, what generally happens after we have wireframes?
55

56
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.520
Well, that's the concept of a mockup.
56

57
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.360
Now, mockups get confused all the time
with wireframes, with prototypes,
57

58
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.390
a lot of people don't even know what a mockup necessarily is.
58

59
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.700
Mockups are actually static displays of what
the final product should visually look like.
59

60
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.830
The reason why we use mockups is because it gives you
the opportunity to make decisions about things like
60

61
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.890
colors, typography, and, in general, style. To give you a visual representation, we'll draw the same version of the
61

62
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.440
wireframe, but now I'm going to add in color, and I'm going to
add in some people that we can just imagine
62

63
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.960
are photos, I'm going to be able to fill in the buttons and
what they look like, and we already know the structure,
63

64
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.990
are photos, I'm going to be able to fill in the buttons and
what they look like, and we already know the structure,
64

65
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.530
now I'm just filling in kind of the pixel specific details.
65

66
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.330
Now, if you ever have trouble remembering what tools to use for mockups, well, remember who generally does a mockup.
66

67
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.360
Now, if you ever have trouble remembering what tools to use for mockups, well, remember who generally does a mockup.
67

68
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.870
Generally, the mockups are going to be done by the designers. Designers are the ones that are in charge
68

69
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.930
of visual detail, and so this portion of the process makes sense
for them to be the ones kind of at the
69

70
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.660
helm, and what do designers use? Typically,
they're going to use Photoshop.
70

71
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.040
Photoshop is incredibly powerful.
71

72
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:13.640
Kind of clunky when it comes to making mockups quickly,
but the vast majority of designers still use that.
72

73
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.890
Kind of clunky when it comes to making mockups quickly,
but the vast majority of designers still use that.
73

74
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.100
Another option is Sketch, something that's been
gaining a lot of popularity, kind of as a competitor to
74

75
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.180
Photoshop, it allows you to draw things faster,
75

76
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.440
that's kind of their focus.
76

77
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.810
It's the Final Cut Pro to the Adobe Premiere, if you guys are in video and that means anything to you. Also, not
77

78
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.460
to be left out, a lot of designers will do their mockups in Illustrator.
78

79
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.500
That is a legitimate way of doing it, kind of clunky because Illustrator forces you to make your designs
79

80
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:48.840
in vector, which basically means that you're going to be
drawing your designs, and the designs are only
80

81
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.590
going to be held in space relative to the other points of the design.
81

82
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.790
I know that's kind of confusing,
what vector means, but think of it like this.
82

83
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.930
Photoshop is pixel based, Illustrator is vector. Photoshop,
83

84
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.510
when you draw something, you draw something, and when you stretch an image, it stretches out, and sometimes
84

85
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.270
it gets blurry, but with Illustrator, because it's vector,
85

86
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.410
there are no hard defined dots in the image.
86

87
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.410
It redefines the image as you stretch it, because
the image is only concerned with the relationship
87

88
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.420
between where this point is and where that point is.
88

89
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.710
That was totally extra, guys. I'll put some stuff in the
resources if you want to read more about that.
89

90
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.160
That was totally extra, guys. I'll put some stuff in the
resources if you want to read more about that.
90

91
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.880
Another tool you can use, and back for round two, is Axure,
91

92
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.410
and another one called UXPin.
92

93
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.330
Now, I added these ones because they allow you
to wireframe, at least Axure does,
93

94
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.500
but Axure also has an image library and templates
that you can easily drag and drop into your wireframe
94

95
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.240
to convert them into mockups.
95

96
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.140
All right, and then, once you have the design hammered out,
what do you usually do then afterwards?
96

97
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.830
Well, now that you know the visual design looks like this,
97

98
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.650
the structure looks like this,
98

99
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.300
the layout is going to be exactly the way you have it on paper,
99

100
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.000
now you add interaction.
100

101
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.740
Now, if wireframes handle structure, and mockups handle visuals,
what do prototypes handle? They handle usability.
101

102
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.970
Now, if wireframes handle structure, and mockups handle visuals,
what do prototypes handle? They handle usability.
102

103
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.880
Prototyping is actually the first phase where
you can play with what you've created,
103

104
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.980
even if it's in a very limited regard.
104

105
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.800
Prototypes allow you to explore the
user interface that you've put together,
105

106
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:34.650
start looking for potential problems in the user flow, and get a decent idea of what you think is going to work best.
106

107
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.980
start looking for potential problems in the user flow, and get a decent idea of what you think is going to work best.
107

108
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:41.330
Now, for a product manager, prototypes are essential
if you want to do things like usability research.
108

109
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.370
Now, for a product manager, prototypes are essential
if you want to do things like usability research.
109

110
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.930
It's one thing to show a potential customer or someone
you're doing a user test with a mockup or a
110

111
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.410
wireframe, but it's an entirely different thing if you
show them a prototype. A prototype can show you
111

112
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.720
what they think of it and how they interact with it, whereas
112

113
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.770
the other two, you really, you just only get their first impressions.
113

114
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.530
The best part of prototypes is it allows teams do usability research.
114

115
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.750
If you're an entrepreneur,
115

116
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:12.090
prototypes are pretty cool, because a lot of times that's
all you need to recruit people and raise money.
116

117
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.270
prototypes are pretty cool, because a lot of times that's
all you need to recruit people and raise money.
117

118
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:18.740
But keep in mind, guys. Prototypes, and when I say prototype,
in the web and mobile world, I mean something
118

119
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.710
that I can interact with, but that interaction
is going to be very limited.
119

120
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:29.820
It's basically going to be hot spots where I press something
and it takes me to a new page, or maybe,
120

121
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.170
maybe I can do some basic gestures,
121

122
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.260
if it's a mobile prototype. Now, a very popular tool
for making prototypes, believe it or not, is Keynote.
122

123
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.020
if it's a mobile prototype. Now, a very popular tool
for making prototypes, believe it or not, is Keynote.
123

124
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.760
If you use Keynote, which is the Mac comparable to Powerpoint, and you can use templates and libraries
124

125
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:53.100
like Keynotopia, what you can do is you can make
a lot of images on the slides and then connect the
125

126
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:59.870
slides to other slides, so if I click a button on the
Keynote page, it links to another Keynote page, and
126

127
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.530
with Keynote, you can load that onto a mobile phone
or onto a web browser.
127

128
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.400
Pretty crafty, I might add.
128

129
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.660
But keep in mind that you're going to be very limited
by how much interaction you can add with Keynote.
129

130
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:12.700
.
130

131
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.300
Another one is POP. Now, look at POP, how it was
a wireframe tool and it's a prototyping tool. Well,
131

132
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:24.680
because it allows us to add interactions to our
wireframes, it skips the visual steps, so we're just
132

133
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.810
working with skeletons, literal wireframes, and moving
them around, and adding basic interactions. Other
133

134
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.020
ones to be aware of, again, our Axure. Axure is a massive product,
134

135
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.220
ones to be aware of, again, our Axure. Axure is a massive product,
135

136
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.270
it handles all three of these stages,
136

137
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:44.610
no wonder it's decently popular. Proto.io is one
that's quite popular, it's worth mentioning because it
137

138
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.210
focuses solely on mobile apps.
138

139
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.710
If you're doing mobile apps, look into Proto.io.
And the last one is InVision, and InVision is another
139

140
00:09:52.780 --> 00:10:00.740
massive product, very popular, that allows you to create
multiple layers of interactions into a page that
140

141
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:06.960
you can import mockups into. InVision gets my vote for
prototyping, because it's probably the best I've used.
141

142
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.490
you can import mockups into. InVision gets my vote for
prototyping, because it's probably the best I've used.
142

143
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.210
Alright, you now know what's a wireframe,
what's a mockup, and what's a prototype.
143

144
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.570
Alright, you now know what's a wireframe,
what's a mockup, and what's a prototype.
144

145
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.780
Alright, you now know what's a wireframe,
what's a mockup, and what's a prototype.
145

146
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:17.910
You know that they're related to each other in that
wireframes are the least accurate, the lowest fidelity,
146

147
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:24.500
mockups are in the middle, and prototypes have the most fidelity,
because they have interaction and they
147

148
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.870
look exactly what the finished product is probably going to be.
Wireframes are structure, mockups are for
148

149
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:36.150
visuals, and prototypes are for usability and interaction.
149

150
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:41.120
Keep this in mind, because I just saved you a whole lot of
hurt for your first meeting, when you walk in,
150

151
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.430
and you call a wireframe a mockup, and someone just slaps you.
151

152
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.480
A mock up on someone just slaps you.
152

153
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.030
All right guys, in the next section, we're actually
going to get started with sketching.
153

154
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.640
So we're going to jump right into it.
154

155
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.730
I'm going to talk to you about what sketching is,
155

156
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.390
how does it relate to wireframes
156

157
00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:01.440
(it is a wireframe), and how you can do it
now, easily, in five minutes.
157

158
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.100
All right, see you then.
