Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.160
All right. So we have a big, bad list of assumptions that
we've made about our proposed feature or product.
2

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.020
All right. So we have a big, bad list of assumptions that
we've made about our proposed feature or product.
3

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.200
And in that big, bad list we've identified the order and the priority
in which we should figure out, "Hey, is this true?"
4

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.520
And in that big, bad list we've identified the order and the priority
in which we should figure out, "Hey, is this true?"
5

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.940
Now, your goal at this point is to steadily and methodically
start testing these assumptions one by one
6

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.200
and ruling them out as potential issues
that could blow up down the road.
7

8
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.640
But we can't do that until we first solve a new problem
8

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.380
we have. An assumption list is just a raw list of things we roughly
think need to be true for the success of our product.
9

10
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.380
we have. An assumption list is just a raw list of things we roughly
think need to be true for the success of our product.
10

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.930
These assumptions are not precise
and they're not particularly actionable.
11

12
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.720
If I said, go build an MVP that tests the assumption of
"People are satisfied parking in a garage," you would
12

13
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.810
probably say, "I don't know what you're talking about."
13

14
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.920
We need something we can more easily work with.
14

15
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.320
We need to take our assumptions, flesh them out a little bit more, and roll them together into their much
15

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.550
more specific and easier to deal with sibling, the hypothesis.
16

17
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.750
So what is a hypothesis?
17

18
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.790
It's a single, written, testable statement of what you believe
to be true with regards to the assumption you've identified. Now,
18

19
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.350
It's a single, written, testable statement of what you believe
to be true with regards to the assumption you've identified. Now,
19

20
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.960
I know that's a mouthful, so let's break it down
and explain it a little bit more.
20

21
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.300
Let's say that we had identified that "People are not
satisfied with parking in a garage" as a particularly
21

22
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.870
hairy assumption we were making.
22

23
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.330
Remember, this is from that Zirx example
that we covered previously - check that one out
23

24
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.070
Remember, this is from that Zirx example
that we covered previously - check that one out
24

25
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.410
if you're lost. We would probably think of running
some sort of test to see if that assumption was true.
25

26
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.450
if you're lost. We would probably think of running
some sort of test to see if that assumption was true.
26

27
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.860
It can be as simple as doing street surveys of people
leaving garages on a Friday night or maybe it's an ad
27

28
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.100
we've run that says "Parking in garages sucks" and we see who responds to that ad, or maybe we plan to pitch an alternative,
28

29
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.260
we've run that says "Parking in garages sucks" and we see who responds to that ad, or maybe we plan to pitch an alternative,
29

30
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.820
and how many people will then vote with their feet
and start using the parking garages.
30

31
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.410
The point here though is that it doesn't matter yet
how we get our data and how we run our test.
31

32
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.390
The simple fact is that we cannot construct a test
around "People are not satisfied with parking."
32

33
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.090
We need to get more specific.
33

34
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.010
We need to identify who exactly we think are unsatisfied,
how unsatisfied they are, and potentially things
34

35
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.770
like why we think they're unsatisfied.
35

36
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.350
All of this information is crucial for you to understand.
36

37
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.060
Now, there's a reason why MVPs are more correctly called
MVP experiments - and yes, if you say, "Oh my god,
37

38
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.000
Evan, look at my MVP," I'm going to correct you, because, come on.
Now, because we don't want to waste any of
38

39
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.440
our resources pursuing our new product or feature,
we need to treat this entire process like a science experiment.
39

40
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.070
our resources pursuing our new product or feature,
we need to treat this entire process like a science experiment.
40

41
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.020
And the best way to focus our efforts is on one
singular hypothesis, something we can try to prove true.
41

42
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.740
A hypothesis brings clarity not only to you,
but the rest of your team.
42

43
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.140
If you skip this stage, you run the risk of, down the road,
forgetting what exactly you're trying to do in the first place.
43

44
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.500
If you skip this stage, you run the risk of, down the road,
forgetting what exactly you're trying to do in the first place.
44

45
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.680
So, in the next couple of lectures, we're going to try
to cover how to put these together. As a matter of
45

46
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.690
So, in the next couple of lectures, we're going to try
to cover how to put these together. As a matter of
46

47
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.890
it's going to be up to you whether or not you want to
build a hypothesis for every single assumption
47

48
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.700
you have, or you want to build a hypothesis that, if proven true,
could rule out several assumptions, killing
48

49
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.970
multiple assumption birds with one MVP stone.
We'll cover both, stay tuned.
