Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In this lecture,
1

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.260
we're going to talk about good questions and bad questions.
2

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.860
Now, any time you talk to a customer, you run the risk
of accidentally biasing the information they give
3

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.260
you, causing them to lie to you, or the information they give you
is hard to understand, or worse, misleading.
4

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.560
you, causing them to lie to you, or the information they give you
is hard to understand, or worse, misleading.
5

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.130
A good question can bring out so much out of a customer
and it can fill in so much of your understanding
6

7
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.820
of your product and how to improve it.
7

8
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.000
Bad questions, on the other hand, are very pernicious.
8

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.060
Sometimes you don't know if you're asking them, and worse,
9

10
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.080
sometimes you don't know if you're getting bad answers
and incorporating that into your product decisions.
10

11
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.200
sometimes you don't know if you're getting bad answers
and incorporating that into your product decisions.
11

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.120
Let's simplify it.
12

13
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.770
You ask good questions - you'll make good products, you ask bad questions - you're probably going to make a bad product.
13

14
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.490
You ask good questions - you'll make good products, you ask bad questions - you're probably going to make a bad product.
14

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.660
So how should we ask questions to our customers?
15

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.120
Well, there are some rules that are worth following to make sure that you're probably asking good questions and not the bad ones.
16

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.980
Well, there are some rules that are worth following to make sure that you're probably asking good questions and not the bad ones.
17

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.550
Number one rule is: always ask open ended questions.
An open ended question is a question that cannot
18

19
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.270
be answered with a simple yes or no,
19

20
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.970
or a specific piece of information. When you ask someone
an open ended question, it gives them the latitude
20

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.230
and the room to answer it and to give
the relevant information they see fit,
21

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.270
which is exactly what we want from them.
22

23
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.330
If I just ask someone, "Is it raining outside?"
all I get is a yes or no answer.
23

24
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.910
If I just ask someone, "Is it raining outside?"
all I get is a yes or no answer.
24

25
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.220
It's one tiny little data point. But if I ask someone,
"What do you do on rainy days?"
25

26
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.010
that could be answered in a million and one different ways.
26

27
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.750
Who knows? They could talk for an hour after that.
27

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.180
Who knows? They could talk for an hour after that.
28

29
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.800
And you remember from the last lecture, we talked
about the fact that we want people to go on tangents,
29

30
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.820
And you remember from the last lecture, we talked
about the fact that we want people to go on tangents,
30

31
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.310
we want them to explain. That's where we get the good stuff.
31

32
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.550
we want them to explain. That's where we get the good stuff.
32

33
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.870
So that one's pretty simple. That's what you
should do, ask open ended questions.
33

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.880
So that one's pretty simple. That's what you
should do, ask open ended questions.
34

35
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.820
So that one's pretty simple. That's what you
should do, ask open ended questions.
35

36
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.500
If you do that, you can't really fail.
36

37
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.330
So, rule number two is where we start with
the things that you should not do.
37

38
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.050
Rule number two: don't ask binary questions.
38

39
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.360
What do I mean by binary questions?
39

40
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.000
An example of a binary question might be, "Have you heard of Uber?" That question can only be answered with yes or no - binary.
40

41
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.080
An example of a binary question might be, "Have you heard of Uber?" That question can only be answered with yes or no - binary.
41

42
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.660
There are only two options. You don't do that because,
one, it doesn't draw them out, it doesn't entice them to
42

43
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.500
tell you more information or feel more comfortable with you.
43

44
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.060
And the second reason is that you're just robbing
yourself of information, they could have gone on, and
44

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.890
on, and on about a subject adjacent to that question,
45

46
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.010
but instead you ask them something
that just ends with a hard landing.
46

47
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.970
And rule number three is: don't ask hypothetical questions.
47

48
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.750
Now, I know a lot of people like to ask hypothetical questions,
they get ridiculous, and they're things
48

49
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.360
you just should not do in a customer interview. An example
of a hypothetical might be, "If you were a painter,
49

50
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.830
would you buy a subscription service for canvases,
if it was reasonably priced and the canvases were high quality?"
50

51
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.880
would you buy a subscription service for canvases,
if it was reasonably priced and the canvases were high quality?"
51

52
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.510
That question is absolutely ridiculous and I wouldn't be
surprised if I saw someone ask this in a customer
52

53
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.280
interview, and I would shake my head vigorously.
53

54
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.690
Hypotheticals fail for a number of different reasons,
54

55
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:32.100
but the biggest reason is that people operate and often
are illogical in fictitious environments, hypothetical
55

56
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.070
environments, and if you bring those questions
down to earth, they will actually give you information
56

57
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.300
that's easier to understand, easier for them to connect with,
and it's going to be more accurate.
57

58
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.880
Rule number four is: don't ask leading questions.
58

59
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.450
Anybody who's watched Law and Order, you know what
a leading question is. A leading question is a question
59

60
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.010
that biases or influences the person that's supposed to answer you.
60

61
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.830
Leading questions are often questions that sound
more like they're just telling you something.
61

62
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.500
An example of a leading question might be, "If you could
save 40% on your auto bill, would you be interested?"
62

63
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.300
An example of a leading question might be, "If you could
save 40% on your auto bill, would you be interested?"
63

64
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.600
Yes, I would, Geico. But let's be honest.
64

65
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.600
Yes, I would, Geico. But let's be honest.
65

66
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.490
Who is going to say no to that question?
66

67
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.210
It's almost rhetorical. If I just ask you plainly,
"Would you like to save money?" you probably say yes.
67

68
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.130
It's almost rhetorical. If I just ask you plainly,
"Would you like to save money?" you probably say yes.
68

69
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.390
So I know the answer to that before I asked it,
so why am I asking the question?
69

70
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.930
Leading questions get the answer that you want,
but the answer you want might not be the truth.
70

71
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.700
Rule number five is: don't ask questions
that might make the customer lie.
71

72
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.120
I mean, lie in the sense of questions that put them in an awkward position and will unduly influence them to give a certain answer.
72

73
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.330
I mean, lie in the sense of questions that put them in an awkward position and will unduly influence them to give a certain answer.
73

74
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.880
So, for instance, if I ask them, "Have you ever cheated on a test?" that might be something that they might
74

75
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.320
not want to tell me, or questions, let's say, of a personal nature.
75

76
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.110
Another example question would be,
"Do you think I did a good job with this design?"
76

77
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.830
It's very awkward sitting next to someone, especially one
you don't know, to tell them what they made is terrible.
77

78
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.960
It's very awkward sitting next to someone, especially one
you don't know, to tell them what they made is terrible.
78

79
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.170
It's the reason why you don't tell your kids
that their kid art is really quite bad.
79

80
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.680
If they lie, then the data is going to be junk, but, more importantly,
if you put them in a scenario where
80

81
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.070
they could lie, you'll never know if they did,
81

82
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.590
and so it doesn't even matter, because that ambiguity makes
your data and makes your information pretty much junk.
82

83
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.210
and so it doesn't even matter, because that ambiguity makes
your data and makes your information pretty much junk.
83

84
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.810
So that's it.
84

85
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.000
Focus on open ended questions that get the most information out as possible and make your customers
85

86
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.780
feel as comfortable as they can.
86

87
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.160
Don't ask binary questions, don't ask hypotheticals, don't put them in awkward situations where they might 
87

88
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.490
lie, and don't ask leading questions.
88

89
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.260
There's really no excuse for breaking some of these rules.
89

90
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.870
Bad questions can almost always
be transformed into good questions.
90

91
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.200
"Have you heard of Uber?"
91

92
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.380
You could easily just say, "If you need to get
across town, how do you do it?"
92

93
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.230
You could easily just say, "If you need to get
across town, how do you do it?"
93

94
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.720
That will give you way more information.
94

95
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.520
And if they do use Uber or have heard of it, they will mention it.
95

96
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.480
"If you could save 40% on your auto bill, would you be interested?" should be changed to
96

97
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.380
probably multiple questions, but you could ask a
question that's better by saying, "If you could save 40%
97

98
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.440
on your auto bill by..." and then explain the downside,
then ask them if they would do it, that's a better question.
98

99
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.750
on your auto bill by..." and then explain the downside,
then ask them if they would do it, that's a better question.
99

100
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.040
Maybe you save 40% because you have to carpool
with everyone every day, or maybe it's 40%
100

101
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.290
because you can't drive on Fridays or Saturdays.
101

102
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.160
I don't know, give them the whole picture.
102

103
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:46.650
The last thing I'm going to leave you with is my
favorite tip for asking good questions, or at least
103

104
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.760
if you ever get stuck in a situation where
you don't know what to ask.
104

105
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.650
Always use this one or have it stored
in the back of your head, ready to go.
105

106
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.320
It's "That's interesting. Tell me more!"
106

107
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.390
It's "That's interesting. Tell me more!"
107

108
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.430
It's "That's interesting. Tell me more!"
"I hate your product."
108

109
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.370
"That's interesting. Tell me more!"
109

110
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.370
"That's interesting. Tell me more!"
110

111
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.120
"I'm not sure if I would pay for this."
111

112
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.320
"That's interesting. Tell me more!"
112

113
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.500
"That's interesting. Tell me more!"
"Why are you blocking the exits?"
113

114
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.450
"That's interesting. Tell me more!"
114

115
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.650
All right, guys, see you in the next lecture.
