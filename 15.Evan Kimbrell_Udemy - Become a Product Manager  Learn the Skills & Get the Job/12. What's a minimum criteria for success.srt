00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,590
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. In this lecture,
1

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,550
we're moving on to the next part of the process of running an MVP.
2

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,910
Ok, so we know what a hypothesis is and we know
how to make one on our own. Great.
3

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,790
Ok, so we know what a hypothesis is and we know
how to make one on our own. Great.
4

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,840
We now have our sights set on what exactly
we're setting out to prove.
5

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,330
You may or may not have noticed this,
but did we ever define what exactly
6

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,660
"proof" or define what exactly "success" in this experiment means?
7

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,410
In one hypothesis we said "buy more." So is that it?
8

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,820
In one hypothesis we said "buy more." So is that it?
9

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,440
If they buy more, we win? And the other said "X metric improves."
10

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,100
There are three different outcomes to an MVP test
you need to be aware of.
11

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,650
There are three different outcomes to an MVP test
you need to be aware of.
12

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:55,540
One is you find out that your hypothesis is categorically
false and overwhelmingly not worth doing.
13

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,520
Great, you dump it. It's not really a hard call. Two, you find out
that within a wide margin, your hypothesis is true.
14

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,130
Great, you dump it. It's not really a hard call. Two, you find out
that within a wide margin, your hypothesis is true.
15

16
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,730
No question about it.
16

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,860
And three, you're somewhere in the middle.
17

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,850
Now, here's the rub.
18

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,300
90% of the MVP experiments you're going to run
as a product manager or as an entrepreneur
19

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,780
are going to end up in situation three: somewhere in the middle.
20

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,650
It's going to look like some people like it and some don't.
21

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,640
And the numbers are going to be all over the board,
it's probably going to be a mess.
22

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,470
So, in our pursuit to see if our users "buy more,"
23

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,450
what exactly do we mean? If 2% of our users buy more or, let's say, our users don't even buy more, but they buy twice as frequently,
24

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,430
what exactly do we mean? If 2% of our users buy more or, let's say, our users don't even buy more, but they buy twice as frequently,
25

26
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,410
is that worth it to, say, build something that takes three months
26

27
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,990
and four people to do it? Well, it depends on the size of
your company, and it depends on an internal calculation 
27

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,400
you have to make.
28

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,880
We need to establish a concept called
"minimum criteria for success."
29

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,790
We need to draw a line in the sand to definitively distinguish
between "Worth it, all systems are a go" and "Not worth it."
30

31
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,120
We need to draw a line in the sand to definitively distinguish
between "Worth it, all systems are a go" and "Not worth it."
31

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,850
Now, why is setting a minimum criteria for success important?
32

33
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,560
Well, because if you forget to set your MCS,
which is what I'm going to start calling it from now
33

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,940
on, your definition of success, you might end up conflating
a validated hypothesis with a clear signal to proceed.
34

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,380
on, your definition of success, you might end up conflating
a validated hypothesis with a clear signal to proceed.
35

36
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,240
They could be two different things.
36

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,150
You can validate your hypothesis, for example, in a way that wouldn't make it worth it to go out and start building everything.
37

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,860
You can validate your hypothesis, for example, in a way that wouldn't make it worth it to go out and start building everything.
38

39
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,800
Now, what if you just barely validate it?
39

40
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,430
Well you've got to proceed with caution,
my young product manager friend.
40

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,130
Well you've got to proceed with caution,
my young product manager friend.
41

42
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,510
Now, the last thing I'll say about why we use the MCS
is that it gives your experiments clarity and
42

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,570
meaning. We aren't just trying to "improve stuff,"
we're trying to "improve stuff by X amount."
43

44
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,500
So how do we figure out where our line in the sand should be?
44

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,700
Well, creating a minimum criteria for success is
relatively simple, and, like the hypothesis exercise, there
45

46
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,120
are roughly about a million different ways to do it.
46

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,340
We're going to take into consideration
and outline two sections in this process.
47

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,700
On the left, we're going to put the cost of building your
product, feature, or the cost of making the change
48

49
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,480
to your prior existing product, and on the right,
49

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,160
the second section, we're going to put the expected reward.
What do you expect to see in return?
50

51
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,340
Now, the next step is to fill both of these sections with criteria. Whatever criteria you choose,
51

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,220
it should probably be criteria that clearly signals not only success,
but that your idea is a viable option for your company.
52

53
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,420
it should probably be criteria that clearly signals not only success,
but that your idea is a viable option for your company.
53

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,710
Popular ideas that are monetarily unsustainable
are not generally great ideas.
54

55
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,180
I know, someone needs to tell that to Silicon Valley.
55

56
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,760
So, starting in reverse order, let's start on the right
with our expected reward section of this calculation.
56

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,160
So, starting in reverse order, let's start on the right
with our expected reward section of this calculation.
57

58
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,880
We're going to pick a metric that we hope will improve as a result of building our product, feature, or making our change.
58

59
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,840
We're going to pick a metric that we hope will improve as a result of building our product, feature, or making our change.
59

60
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,890
If we're, for instance, adding additional sharing features
to a social network, then we're probably targeting
60

61
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,010
engagement, right? Or some other aspect we've
identified as being crucial to our specific business.
61

62
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,330
So that could be time spent on page,
it could be actions per session,
62

63
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,790
So that could be time spent on page,
it could be actions per session,
63

64
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,190
it could be number of likes, or something
very literal like number of shares.
64

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,260
Every experiment you run as a product manager
is going to be pointed at something.
65

66
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,880
When we talk later in-depth about metrics, we have an entire section on it, you'll realize that all metrics
66

67
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,600
in some way or other are interconnected.
67

68
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:51,420
And you, as a product manager, you'll have to have
your eye on a couple or a handful that you associate
68

69
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:59,640
with product growth or product success. Whatever metric
we put here needs to either be directly or indirectly
69

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,530
related to one of those crucial metrics.
70

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,530
Otherwise, this is an entirely pointless endeavor and
you're trying to inflate what we call "false metrics."
71

72
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,710
Otherwise, this is an entirely pointless endeavor and
you're trying to inflate what we call "false metrics."
72

73
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,560
So put down the potential metrics you hope are going to
be moved by your experiment. If you're building
73

74
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,740
a new product, they will probably be things like percentage
of people signing up, conversion rate, open rate,
74

75
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:22,760
a new product, they will probably be things like percentage
of people signing up, conversion rate, open rate,
75

76
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:29,280
if you use e-mail as a distribution channel, percentage
of positive reactions even, things that indicate
76

77
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,610
interest from a potential customer, or it could be literally
like "How much money does each customer make us?"
77

78
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,360
interest from a potential customer, or it could be literally
like "How much money does each customer make us?"
78

79
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,690
We'll talk in one of the next lectures about pre-product
scenarios specifically and how to tweak this
79

80
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,690
for that type of situation. For now, we're going to focus more on adding features and or trying to improve user behavior.
80

81
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,580
for that type of situation. For now, we're going to focus more on adding features and or trying to improve user behavior.
81

82
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,430
Okay.
82

83
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,170
Once you're done writing out on the right side, let's go
to the left side. On the left side, we need to brainstorm
83

84
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,790
the costs of doing what we're proposing to do.
84

85
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,400
Every experiment is going to cost something and you need to have a decent understanding of what's at stake.
85

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,970
Every experiment is going to cost something and you need to have a decent understanding of what's at stake.
86

87
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:17,070
So let's say you're a company and you're going to add X feature.
What does X feature end up costing your company?
87

88
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,650
So let's say you're a company and you're going to add X feature.
What does X feature end up costing your company?
88

89
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,880
Well, in this hypothetical, it's probably going to take
developer's time, your time, other people's time,
89

90
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,450
it's probably going to take up some sweet hot cash.
90

91
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:34,640
Keep in mind also that time is money even outside of
what you buy or what you contract to get this done,
91

92
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,230
so we can reasonably assume, no matter what, that
there's always going to be some form of a dollar amount
92

93
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,030
to building what it is that we're proposing.
93

94
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:49,630
Well, let's try to brainstorm of what could we possibly
have to end up buying in order to do this.
94

95
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,220
Well, we probably need to promote the feature in some way,
and even if we don't pay money necessarily
95

96
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:04,650
for ads, there's also displacement of other ad inventory
you could have used, or lost opportunity because
96

97
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,300
you just took up an e-mail that
you could have spent on something else.
97

98
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,960
There are other things you need to take into consideration as well,
like opportunity cost, which is a
98

99
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:21,060
little abstract, but, yes, it is a thing. If you pursue X and
fail, then you could have pursued Y and succeeded.
99

100
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,490
little abstract, but, yes, it is a thing. If you pursue X and
fail, then you could have pursued Y and succeeded.
100

101
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,910
You are one successful feature shorter.
101

102
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,550
There are other things like pride, brand, morale,
102

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,980
but these things are really up to you to self identify
as important to you and your company, and put
103

104
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,740
them down, because it's not necessarily true
for every single company.
104

105
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,870
So think about what the effects of running the experiment are going to be. Take into consideration your organizational size as well.
105

106
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,970
So think about what the effects of running the experiment are going to be. Take into consideration your organizational size as well.
106

107
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,310
Large organizations, as we previously learned,
are not going to run scrappy experiments.
107

108
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,950
The calculus for them is just different.
108

109
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,840
They're probably going to go with something a little mediar
because they have to put their name on it.
109

110
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,560
So factor that brand aspect and that aspect that they're going to be around after this MVP experiment into your calculation.
110

111
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,050
So factor that brand aspect and that aspect that they're going to be around after this MVP experiment into your calculation.
111

112
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,580
Okay, now that we've talked about how there are basically
two sides to every calculation for a minimum
112

113
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,660
criteria for success, and we've discussed roughly what
are potential metrics you could put in each section,
113

114
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,590
in the next lecture, we're going to work on coming up with a minimum criteria of success that works for a theoretical position.
114

115
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,640
in the next lecture, we're going to work on coming up with a minimum criteria of success that works for a theoretical position.
115

116
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,140
See you then.
