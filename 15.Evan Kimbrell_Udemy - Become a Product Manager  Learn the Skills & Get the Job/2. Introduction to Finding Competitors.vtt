Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.350
So last lecture we learned about sizing up your market.
2

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.850
That's important because you really need to know about the opportunity that you are sizing up and the
3

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.060
relative importance of that opportunity
versus your other opportunities.
4

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.080
Project management is all about
making decisions between opportunities.
5

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.880
So that's how big it is.
6

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.850
But you want to know something that's even
more important than the size of your market?
7

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.130
The competitors in your market.
8

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.450
And that's what we're going to be talking about
in the rest of the section.
9

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.510
Now, there are a lot of different market circumstances that could happen with regards to competitors.
10

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.560
Now, there are a lot of different market circumstances that could happen with regards to competitors.
11

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.380
You could be going into a big market with your new product or new feature and that big market could have lots of competitors.
12

13
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.050
You could be going into a big market with your new product or new feature and that big market could have lots of competitors.
13

14
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.770
You could also be going into a small market and that could have very few competitors or it could be the other way around.
14

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.560
You could also be going into a small market and that could have very few competitors or it could be the other way around.
15

16
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.620
We need to know how to collect information on those competitors and make an objective judgment about
16

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.400
what that means for our new product or feature.
Being able to make this type of analysis and decision
17

18
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.030
is crucial to being a product manager
and crucial to being an entrepreneur.
18

19
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.410
Now, if you're going into a market or growing into a market that has a slew of different competitors that
19

20
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.670
all do things very similar to what you're proposing,
20

21
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.760
some of them do the exact same thing and
some of them do what you're trying to do but better,
21

22
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.530
that's something that you need to know long before you actually engage your development team and your
22

23
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.190
company resources in tackling that opportunity.
23

24
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.820
Similarly, if you have a market that appears to be wide open, no one seems to be doing what you are proposing to do,
24

25
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.070
Similarly, if you have a market that appears to be wide open, no one seems to be doing what you are proposing to do,
25

26
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.890
you also need to be able to make a critical decision.
26

27
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.990
Now, remember, that's a weird scenario.
27

28
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.550
There's two sides to that coin actually.
28

29
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.000
Is it the case that no one is doing what you're proposing
because you're such a genius,
29

30
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.480
you're the first one to come up with the idea
(you, Steve Jobs, you)
30

31
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.590
or is it the case that no one else is doing it
because there's no customer demand
31

32
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.960
and they all figured out that it was a bad idea on their own.
32

33
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.920
Now, as a product manager, you're going to have to be
in charge of feature triage. That basically just
33

34
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.300
means that you're going to need to know which potential opportunity, feature, or project is most likely
34

35
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.690
to, one, get you more users, two, make your users happier,
and three, enhance your brand.
35

36
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.310
And, as an entrepreneur who's managing
their own product, it's the exact same.
36

37
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.030
You need to know which opportunity is the most likely to get you the returns that you want so that you
37

38
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.150
don't waste a lot of time and resources. And you can't make that call unless you know what your competitors
38

39
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.010
look like, what they're doing, and what they currently offer.
39

40
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.930
So we're going to cover that throughout this entire section.
40

41
00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.240
First off, we're going to start with finding the competitors ,because we can't make a critical judgment
41

42
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.960
unless we know what we're making a judgment on.
42

43
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.630
So, see you in the next lecture.
