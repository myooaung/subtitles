00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.910
Hey guys, welcome to the course.
1

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.960
All right, so we're going to start down the MVP journey,
and we're going to start with identifying the assumptions
2

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.320
that we're making about our problem-solution set.
3

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.790
Now, in case you didn't catch me before when I said this,
at this stage of the game you probably have
4

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:28.830
an idea of what you are trying to build. We covered that
in the other sections, so you probably have a decent
5

6
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.060
idea of what type of user or potential customer
you're targeting, and what is the new feature or the
6

7
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.300
new solution you're going to be proposing.
7

8
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.110
Now, every single time you come up with a new idea,
whether or not it's a new business idea, or a new feature
8

9
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.700
idea, you are taking on board enormous amount of assumptions.
9

10
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.530
Like almost anything in life, we think we know things, and that is built up of a lot of small things that we assume to be true.
10

11
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.200
Like almost anything in life, we think we know things, and that is built up of a lot of small things that we assume to be true.
11

12
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.110
You get into a car and you think that it's going to be able to start.
12

13
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.400
You're assuming that the engine is actually working.
13

14
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.630
You're assuming that it has gas in the tank, you're assuming
it's not cold enough outside that the spark
14

15
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.330
plugs things get stuck together and it can't start.
15

16
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.490
There's a lot of assumptions into that even basic idea.
16

17
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.010
And since all these assumptions have the possibility
of not being true, in that creating a problem for
17

18
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.870
us, we need to write out as many of our assumptions that we can.
18

19
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.420
All right, so when you start identifying the assumptions
that you are making, it's kind of an abstract
19

20
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.980
process. There's not generally a step by step process
you'll go through. Really you just need to sit down
20

21
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:58.830
and think hard about what goes into you thinking that
your users are going to like whatever you're going to build.
21

22
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.510
and think hard about what goes into you thinking that
your users are going to like whatever you're going to build.
22

23
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.510
You need to recognize that almost every single time
you have one of these ideas, it's going to be based
23

24
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.940
off of some type of observation or some type of intuition. In either case, you just assume and take for granted many, many things.
24

25
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.660
off of some type of observation or some type of intuition. In either case, you just assume and take for granted many, many things.
25

26
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.630
Now, there are two different ways I like to try to get into kind of the mindset that will help me identify these tricky little things.
26

27
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.450
Now, there are two different ways I like to try to get into kind of the mindset that will help me identify these tricky little things.
27

28
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.670
The first one is to try to think about the lean mantra,
which is that we're running this like a
28

29
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.290
science experiment. In any science experiment,
29

30
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.600
we're challenging ourselves with regards to what we know is true.
30

31
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.500
And so, what we need to do to be successful is to get in
kind of a lean zen mode and keep saying to ourselves
31

32
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.670
"We don't know anything."
32

33
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.740
Anything you think you know is an assumption.
33

34
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.130
So what do you think you already know before you've
even gotten out there and tried to build something?
34

35
00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.150
So what do you think you already know before you've
even gotten out there and tried to build something?
35

36
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.100
Now, the second way, and I think this one is probably
more effective for most people, and I like to write
36

37
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.550
this one out is "In order for this problem-solution set
to be successful, the following must be true."
37

38
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.930
this one out is "In order for this problem-solution set
to be successful, the following must be true."
38

39
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.270
And then just try to fill in all of the factors you think
go into this potentially being successful.
39

40
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.390
And then just try to fill in all of the factors you think
go into this potentially being successful.
40

41
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.750
Google Glass - what do you think has to be true
for that to have been successful?
41

42
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.360
Well, you probably have to assume that
people will wear a camera on their face.
42

43
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.350
What has to be true in order for Udemy to be successful?
It has to be true that people are going to
43

44
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.600
be comfortable paying money for online courses.
Whether or not we're at this stage in our development
44

45
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.610
that we trust online courses enough to pay money,
that's a legitimate question.
45

46
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.020
If you're having natural regrets about
buying this course, I don't blame you.
46

47
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.370
If you're having natural regrets about
buying this course, I don't blame you.
47

48
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.960
I do blame Cole. Now, in most cases, there are an enormous amount of assumptions that you could write out
48

49
00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.480
for this. All we want to do is focus on the big ones, and I want to
give you some examples of common assumptions
49

50
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.700
that almost everybody makes,
50

51
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.540
and then hopefully this can be a template for you going forward, and it will help you find a whole batch of other assumptions.
51

52
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.780
and then hopefully this can be a template for you going forward, and it will help you find a whole batch of other assumptions.
52

53
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.060
Now, the first assumption that almost everyone
seems to make is "My user has X, Y, Z problem."
53

54
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.380
Remember, we had the problem-solution set.
54

55
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.690
You're probably trying to build something that targets
someone's problem, but how do you know if that
55

56
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.190
problem is real? How do you know if
the customer considers it a problem?
56

57
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.550
That is an assumption, and it's an assumption
in pretty much anything you ever build.
57

58
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.360
If you're building bluetooth headphones, you're assuming
that people really are fed up with cords.
58

59
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:51.750
If you're building the Snuggie, that big one piece wizard suit,
you're assuming that it is too inconvenient
59

60
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.030
to just put a blanket on you. Now, the number two most common assumption I see is "[...] matters to my customers."
60

61
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.760
to just put a blanket on you. Now, the number two most common assumption I see is "[...] matters to my customers."
61

62
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.000
Anytime you do a new feature, or a business idea, or product idea,
you are assuming it's going to be successful
62

63
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.540
because you're going to take some kind of angle with it and
that angle is something your customers care about.
63

64
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.050
because you're going to take some kind of angle with it and
that angle is something your customers care about.
64

65
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.680
If I'm building something that's specifically going to be
cheaper than the competition, I'm assuming
65

66
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.690
people care about it being cheaper. If I'm trying to
build something that is more convenient than the
66

67
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.440
competition, I'm assuming that convenience is a
big factor in what they care about with the service.
67

68
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.710
So don't assume what your customers care about,
but do write it out.
68

69
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.590
Number three is that "Users will pay
or sign up for this service or product."
69

70
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.580
Now, that's kind of an optional assumption. This is assuming you
have a product that charges or signs people up
70

71
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.820
in some way to eventually make money.
71

72
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.740
Eventually we all want to make money and all products
will eventually get to a point where it makes money,
72

73
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.920
Eventually we all want to make money and all products
will eventually get to a point where it makes money,
73

74
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.690
so you either have to go one of those avenues,
charging or signing them up.
74

75
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.060
So that's always an assumption.
Maybe the problem is a big problem,
75

76
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.070
So that's always an assumption.
Maybe the problem is a big problem,
76

77
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.350
but do we know if it's a big enough problem for them to,
say, pay money for it, or give you their contact details?
77

78
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.070
but do we know if it's a big enough problem for them to,
say, pay money for it, or give you their contact details?
78

79
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:21.060
If I'm the genius behind the Hot Pocket, I'm assuming
that people will enjoy a big bean burrito of lava
79

80
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.370
If I'm the genius behind the Hot Pocket, I'm assuming
that people will enjoy a big bean burrito of lava
80

81
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.210
so much so that they would pay money for it.
81

82
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.780
And number four is that "There are no satisfactory substitutes."
82

83
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.140
A lot of times we just assume that our solution
is better than what's available,
83

84
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.720
but it's often the case that customers have already figured out a way to solve that problem and there's really no reason to switch.
84

85
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.050
but it's often the case that customers have already figured out a way to solve that problem and there's really no reason to switch.
85

86
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.920
I'll give you an example.
86

87
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.900
Let's say we are making an app that told me
what the temperature is right now.
87

88
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.600
Now, are there satisfactory substitutions for that?
88

89
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.550
Absolutely.
89

90
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:58.170
Not only could I go to weather.com or any of the other
hundred weather services, I could just look
90

91
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.130
out the window or just walk outside  - what a concept.
91

92
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:09.600
So keep that one in mind and try to test whether or not there are alternatives out there that are already meeting their needs.
92

93
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.960
So keep that one in mind and try to test whether or not there are alternatives out there that are already meeting their needs.
93

94
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.770
All right guys, in the next section, we're going to talk
about risky assumptions, and then, after that, we'll
94

95
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.160
do some practice with this, so you guys can
see some real life examples. Alright, see you then.
95

96
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.330
do some practice with this, so you guys can
see some real life examples. Alright, see you then.
