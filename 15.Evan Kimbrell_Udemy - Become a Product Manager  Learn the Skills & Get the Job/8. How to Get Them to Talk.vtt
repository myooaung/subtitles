Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.860
So, now that we've identified who you want to interview,
we're going to talk about how do you get them to talk.
2

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.700
So, now that we've identified who you want to interview,
we're going to talk about how do you get them to talk.
3

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.830
A lot of people think "If I just message someone out of the blue,
why would they respond to me?"
4

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.200
"Why would they give me their time just because?"
5

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.060
So, in this lecture we're going to address that.
6

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.870
We're going to go over three principles to live by
when asking to interview a customer and some two
7

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.800
bonus tips that'll put you over the edge.
8

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.990
To those of you that nodded when I said "Why would they actually contact us?" well, you know, let's talk about it.
9

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.070
To those of you that nodded when I said "Why would they actually contact us?" well, you know, let's talk about it.
10

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.650
It's rather obvious that if you're cold emailing someone,
even if you use the techniques that we covered in
11

12
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.400
the last two lectures, it's still a relatively cold email.
12

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.910
They have no personal connection to you - and we all know
how we treat emails from people we don't know, right?
13

14
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.140
They have no personal connection to you - and we all know
how we treat emails from people we don't know, right?
14

15
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.870
They have no personal connection to you - and we all know
how we treat emails from people we don't know, right?
15

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.550
You probably don't remember them,
16

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.420
they go to spam, or you delete them faster than
you can even notice. The thing is, in general, with cold
17

18
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.460
emailing, you have to think of it kind of
from the perspective of investment.
18

19
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.900
If someone doesn't know you, they may be willing to
read your e-mail, but they are not going to be willing
19

20
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.490
to invest the time to read the entire thing.
20

21
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.680
If they're talking to a friend, and a friend, let's say, e-mails them,
they'll probably read a page - right? - before spacing out.
21

22
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.550
If they're talking to a friend, and a friend, let's say, e-mails them,
they'll probably read a page - right? - before spacing out.
22

23
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.630
But if someone e-mails them, they have no idea who you are,
and they're not referring to any previous
23

24
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.280
conversation, they might give you a couple of sentences.
24

25
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.660
This can be overcome and it's relatively easy.
25

26
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.780
So let's talk about three things to live by.
26

27
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.800
Three tenants of cold emailing. If you follow these three, you will have a dramatic increase in the number of people that respond.
27

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.710
Three tenants of cold emailing. If you follow these three, you will have a dramatic increase in the number of people that respond.
28

29
00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.060
Side note, though. To put this in perspective, we generally
have a ratio, 3:1, which we use to reference
29

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.620
how many people you contact and how many people respond.
30

31
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.620
Obviously, this is a generalization, but set your expectations
like that: if you message 10 people and 3 people respond,
31

32
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.990
Obviously, this is a generalization, but set your expectations
like that: if you message 10 people and 3 people respond,
32

33
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520
don't get mad at the other seven.
33

34
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.930
It's just the case that you generally have to message
three times as many people that you want to interview.
34

35
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.020
It's just the case that you generally have to message
three times as many people that you want to interview.
35

36
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.420
And also, keep in mind, let's say you want to interview 10 people, how many people should you message?
36

37
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.160
And also, keep in mind, let's say you want to interview 10 people, how many people should you message?
37

38
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.970
Probably 30, maybe more to be safe.
38

39
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.820
Anyway, enough of that. Let's back to the three main tenants.
39

40
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.800
Ok, so the number one tenant when contacting someone
in a cold connection type situation is: be short.
40

41
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.380
You probably figured this out, because I was just talking about how people aren't going to give you a lot of time investment,
41

42
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.590
You probably figured this out, because I was just talking about how people aren't going to give you a lot of time investment,
42

43
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.090
so being short is incredibly important.
43

44
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.270
It's one of the biggest mistakes I see people making.
They'll message someone that they want to contact and
44

45
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.540
they'll send pages and pages.
45

46
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.340
This happens to me all the time.
46

47
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.090
Somehow people get my e-mail address
and send me something, and it's three pages long.
47

48
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.220
It's ridiculous.
48

49
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.450
No one under any circumstance is going to read that.
49

50
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.520
So focus yourself on brevity.
50

51
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.770
Now, what do I mean specifically when I say "short"?
How short is short? Should it be like a tweet or is
51

52
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.630
short like four paragraphs? Short generally means
closer to the tweet than the five paragraphs.
52

53
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.150
short like four paragraphs? Short generally means
closer to the tweet than the five paragraphs.
53

54
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.260
I like to think of it in terms of 4-7 sentences.
If you can get it away in four, that's great,
54

55
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.370
I like to think of it in terms of 4-7 sentences.
If you can get it away in four, that's great,
55

56
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.680
but seven is the absolute maximum.
56

57
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.320
Anything over that and you'll see your response rates just plummet.
57

58
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.430
Number two: be personal. People do not want to be e-mailed
from a robot, we don't like talking to robots.
58

59
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.530
Number two: be personal. People do not want to be e-mailed
from a robot, we don't like talking to robots.
59

60
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.220
Number two: be personal. People do not want to be e-mailed
from a robot, we don't like talking to robots.
60

61
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:58.080
If I even sniff or have the tiniest little inkling that
this is an auto-generated email, that dramatically
61

62
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.800
lowers the chances of me responding to it.
62

63
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.510
Now, you're not going to be messaging millions of people,
or even thousands of people, so there's really
63

64
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.340
no excuse for not adding at least a tiny bit of personalization.
64

65
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.950
The most effective way of being personal
is by responding to how you found them.
65

66
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.840
Okay? If this is a person you found on Twitter, complaining
about something, you need to immediately make
66

67
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.760
a connection to that. Say that you saw that they had this problem,
67

68
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.920
you recognize that it's a problem, and then you
go into the ask, asking them to talk to you.
68

69
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.920
That email cannot possibly be auto-generated.
69

70
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.800
People are much more likely to respond if they actually think you typed it out - and you don't have to type every single one out,
70

71
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.240
People are much more likely to respond if they actually think you typed it out - and you don't have to type every single one out,
71

72
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.230
you can make a semi-template where you're only modifying
one or two sentences of the four to seven, but
72

73
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.450
you have to write those one to two. If you found someone
who wrote a blog piece and you're connecting
73

74
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.840
with them, then you need to say something
about their piece that you had a connection with,
74

75
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.030
you responded to. Point out some kind of connection between something they mentioned and something you've 
75

76
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.220
experienced yourself.
76

77
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.200
And the last tenant of cold emailing is: be valuable.
77

78
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.100
Yes, you are correct in saying that everyone out there,
for the most part, will consider their own self
78

79
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.520
interest when answering your e-mail and thinking about
whether or not they want to spend time talking to you.
79

80
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.040
interest when answering your e-mail and thinking about
whether or not they want to spend time talking to you.
80

81
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.310
No, I'm not saying that you have to bribe every single
person that you talk to, but you need to show that
81

82
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.770
having this conversation with you is valuable in some way to them.
82

83
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.620
You know, that could be abstract things as simple as "It would help our organization out" - a lot of people want to feel altruistic.
83

84
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.090
You know, that could be abstract things as simple as "It would help our organization out" - a lot of people want to feel altruistic.
84

85
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.280
They want to feel like they're helping.
That ultimately is valuable to them.
85

86
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.090
They want to feel like they're helping.
That ultimately is valuable to them.
86

87
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.700
Telling them that you value their input and there's a high likelihood that you'll act on it makes them feel like they actually have an effect
87

88
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.750
Telling them that you value their input and there's a high likelihood that you'll act on it makes them feel like they actually have an effect
88

89
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.310
on the organization. It's not like voting
for the president, this actually matters.
89

90
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.730
on the organization. It's not like voting
for the president, this actually matters.
90

91
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.910
on the organization. It's not like voting
for the president, this actually matters.
91

92
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.030
And yes, of course, you can offer to incentivize them, and that's something that you're almost always going to try at some point.
92

93
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.340
And yes, of course, you can offer to incentivize them, and that's something that you're almost always going to try at some point.
93

94
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:17.370
It is very effective and it is something you can use
to quickly get people to agree to talk to you, but
94

95
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.680
it's not the case that you have to grease the wheel for
every single person, you can appeal to their better self.
95

96
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.530
it's not the case that you have to grease the wheel for
every single person, you can appeal to their better self.
96

97
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.990
Okay, got it?
97

98
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.100
Okay, got it?
98

99
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.400
You open up that e-mail client, you'd better make sure
you are 4-7 sentence short - short, short, short -
99

100
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.300
You open up that e-mail client, you'd better make sure
you are 4-7 sentence short - short, short, short -
100

101
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:40.140
you've got to make sure that you sound personal and
not like a robot that just auto-generated this,
101

102
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.100
you need to connect it to something they did or something
you've experienced that is similar to them,
102

103
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.370
it needs to be customized, and it needs to be valuable.
103

104
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.780
Why should they spend time talking to you?
104

105
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.990
You can butter them up with money and gift cards if you want,
105

106
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.930
but you can also just appeal to the fact that they could
help you out, and a lot of people are ok with that.
106

107
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:04.080
but you can also just appeal to the fact that they could
help you out, and a lot of people are ok with that.
107

108
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.020
Now, before you run out there and just start willy-nilly
e-mailing people to see if they'll talk to you,
108

109
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.170
Now, before you run out there and just start willy-nilly
e-mailing people to see if they'll talk to you,
109

110
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.330
there's two other tips that I want to give you that
will really put you over the top as a product manager.
110

111
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.450
there's two other tips that I want to give you that
will really put you over the top as a product manager.
111

112
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:23.370
Two other things that I really insist on trying to fit into cold emails
is, one - make sure that you mention that you're not from sales.
112

113
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.260
Two other things that I really insist on trying to fit into cold emails
is, one - make sure that you mention that you're not from sales.
113

114
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.810
That is an amazing advantage to you.
114

115
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:33.930
I would say 60% of the people that don't respond
just think that it's because if they talk to you,
115

116
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.260
you're going try to sell them something.
116

117
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.770
So if you say you're not in sales, you're in
a different department, or a different role,
117

118
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.010
the title of product manager is very innocuous.
118

119
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:49.680
No one's going to think that at the end of this conversation
you're going to pitch them on a time share condo in Florida.
119

120
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.180
No one's going to think that at the end of this conversation
you're going to pitch them on a time share condo in Florida.
120

121
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:57.780
This is an advantage that is specific to you, and
even founders of companies can't do this.
121

122
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.820
They can't say "I'm not in sales" because if they're
the ones e-mailing people that's because they don't
122

123
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:09.680
have any sales people or have product managers, and founders
do a lot of selling, so it doesn't really work that way.
123

124
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.530
have any sales people or have product managers, and founders
do a lot of selling, so it doesn't really work that way.
124

125
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.980
The second thing that will really increase your chances
of connecting is: make them feel special.
125

126
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:23.430
You really need to emphasize that you want to understand
their specific problems and build products
126

127
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:31.860
that fix their problems and that they can help you get there.
That sort of "Neo, you are the only one" type
127

128
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.820
kind of conversation makes them feel like, "Well, I'm the only one who can actually help them. This is really a waste if I don't."
128

129
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.250
kind of conversation makes them feel like, "Well, I'm the only one who can actually help them. This is really a waste if I don't."

130
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.480
