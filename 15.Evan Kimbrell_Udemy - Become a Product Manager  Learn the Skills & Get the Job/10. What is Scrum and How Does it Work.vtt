00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.730
Welcome back, everyone. In this lecture we're going to talk about Scrum and Kanban, which are two Agile
1

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.300
development philosophies or frameworks.
2

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.550
So we know now that Agile is a philosophy for developing software in a lean and iterative way with plenty
3

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.860
of collaboration between the team members, but what are the guidelines for putting it in place?
4

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.630
How does it actually look?
5

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.820
There are two very popular Agile software development methodologies or structures.
6

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.530
One is called Scrum, which you've probably heard of before,
and the other is called Kanban.
7

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.010
Some people pronounce it "can ban" but whatever.
You can think of
8

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.910
both of these methods as merely guides to
developing software in an Agile way.
9

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.420
So let's start with Scrum.
10

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.320
It's probably the most common of the two.
11

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.570
Let's walk through how to implement it or
what it looks like in four easy steps.
12

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.040
Now, there are a lot of things about Scrum
but these are the four main ones.
13

14
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.400
Step one: the sprint planning meeting.
14

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.740
So you start off with a product backlog which is a big prioritized list of all the things you've either
15

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.520
decided to work on or may work on. Your team holds a sprint planning meeting which is where you take
16

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.340
the most important feature or several from the top of your product backlog and you move it to your sprint backlog.
17

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.370
the most important feature or several from the top of your product backlog and you move it to your sprint backlog.
18

19
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.470
Then you talk about all the work you're going to need to do in order to implement it. Together,
19

20
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.780
your team writes out what work needs to be done
in order to make that feature a reality.
20

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.140
You put the work into a project management software,
into things called tickets.
21

22
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.940
Step two: this is where you start developing. The core tenant of Scrum
22

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.730
Step two: this is where you start developing.
The core tenant of Scrum
23

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.760
is that the work your team does is boxed
into a timeframe called a sprint, usually two weeks.
24

25
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.260
is that the work your team does is boxed
into a timeframe called a sprint, usually two weeks.
25

26
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.460
Some companies do three week sprints and some do four, but two is the most common. Throughout the two weeks,
26

27
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.480
Some companies do three week sprints and some do four, but two is the most common. Throughout the two weeks,
27

28
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.750
Your team works on the things by taking them off the top of the sprint backlog and moving them to in progress
28

29
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.030
and then eventually to done.
29

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.910
These are the tickets that they're moving from column to column.
At the end of the two weeks you should
30

31
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.850
have completed everything in the sprint backlog.
If not, those things go to the next sprint.
31

32
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.420
So step three is standup meetings, and these are very common and very helpful. Standup meetings are these
32

33
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.290
small daily meetings you usually hold in the mornings.
33

34
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.890
Why are they called standup meetings?
34

35
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.830
Well, the theory here is that if you remain standing as a team and you're not sitting down, then the meeting
35

36
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.870
will be very brief and just concise in general,
and we find that to be pretty true.
36

37
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.390
So the goal of the standup meeting is for every team member to talk about what they worked on last,
37

38
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.720
what they're working on now, and then what they're going to work on next.
38

39
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.390
Most importantly, they should bring up any questions or requests for help during the standup meeting,
39

40
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.060
These daily meetings, usually every morning, again, keep everything moving really smoothly.
40

41
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.190
These daily meetings, usually every morning, again, keep everything moving really smoothly.
41

42
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.260
So step four and another big component of implementing Scrum is retrospective meetings.
42

43
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.080
A retrospective is kind of the opposite of a sprint planning meeting.
43

44
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.560
The retrospective is a meeting you have at the end of each sprint with your team. You get everyone in
44

45
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.350
a room, yourself, the developers, the designers, etc. and you talk about three main things: about the
45

46
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.290
last sprint, what went well, what did not go well, and what questions people have.
46

47
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.530
It's usually your job as the product manager
to lead the team through this.
47

48
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.780
These meetings ensure that everyone that has questions or concerns about the team, or the structure, or
48

49
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.760
your process is getting these things heard, and it keeps everything moving along very smoothly.
49

50
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.320
All right, so let's recap on Scrum
and the big four major components.
50

51
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.960
The first one is that we have a sprint planning meeting where we take everything from the product backlog,
51

52
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.690
we put it in the sprint backlog.
52

53
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.890
Secondly, we have the sprint itself, which is a time box period of time like two weeks, three weeks, or four,
53

54
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.500
Secondly, we have the sprint itself, which is a time box period of time like two weeks, three weeks, or four,
54

55
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.800
but the most common is two. Then we have the daily standup meetings during the sprint.
55

56
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.730
These are 10 or 15 minute meetings where we keep standing up so that people don't take too long and
56

57
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.880
we just talk about what you were doing yesterday, what you're doing today, and what you're doing tomorrow,
57

58
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.030
and clarify any issues or any collaboration needed.
58

59
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.250
Finally, we have the retrospective meeting where we talk about what went well during the sprint,
59

60
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.110
what did not go well, and any outstanding questions that people have. Alright everyone,
60

61
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.490
we'll see you in the next lecture.
