00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome back, everyone.
1

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,220
In this lecture, we're going to talk more about metrics.
2

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,350
We're going to talk about how to pick good metrics,
what makes a good metric in the first place, and then
3

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,660
we'll go into a couple of other details about how
metrics roll up into other top level metrics.
4

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,860
So firstly, let's talk about how metrics roll up into other metrics.
5

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,930
Let's say that you're working at Facebook, and Facebook's
overall metric is to get people on the site
6

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,410
and leave them there for a long time.
7

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,610
You want people to spend as much time on Facebook as possible.
8

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:44,670
Well, that doesn't mean that if you're working on, say,
the photos part of Facebook, or the news feed part,
9

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,570
that your metric is going to be the amount of time
spent on Facebook, or maybe even on that page.
10

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,680
It's likely that it would, but sometimes
it's not the most important metric.
11

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:04,920
Like I've mentioned before, there are sometimes things
that we know that we can track on our individual
12

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,540
team that makes the overall metric for the company increase.
13

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,690
The example that we've used is the comments on Facebook.
14

15
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:22,260
If we know that people that leave more comments on Facebook
are more likely to spend more time on Facebook
15

16
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,810
or one of its related apps, then we might be working
on a team that just tries to increase the number
16

17
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,700
of comments on average per person.
17

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,750
This is because we know that it will increase the overall metric, which is the metric that the company has a goal for as a whole.
18

19
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,730
This is because we know that it will increase the overall metric, which is the metric that the company has a goal for as a whole.
19

20
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,740
So that's it for that part.
20

21
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,530
I just want you to understand that, even though a
company might have an overall metric, that you as a
21

22
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,650
product manager might not always be tracking that exact metric,
you might be tracking something for your team.
22

23
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,190
product manager might not always be tracking that exact metric,
you might be tracking something for your team.
23

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,430
The second thing I want to mention is the difference
between exploratory metrics and reporting metrics.
24

25
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:07,830
Exploratory metrics are things that you're not always tracking,
or always really telling investors, or
25

26
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:15,240
your boss, or other people about how they're doing,
but they're there, it's tracking, and analysis is available
26

27
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:22,590
to us just to go poke around and see what user behavior is like.
This contrasts with reporting metrics,
27

28
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,400
because reporting metrics are the things that we are
tracking over long periods of time to ensure that
28

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,320
our product is doing well and heading in the right direction.
29

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:40,440
So an example of an exploratory metric would be something
where, let's say I'm working at Twitter, and
30

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,670
the overall goal is to increase the amount of time spent,
again, on the web site or in the app. An exploratory
31

32
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,180
metric might be the number of times someone clicks a
certain button somewhere, because we're not really
32

33
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,000
interested in keeping track of this over time,
33

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,630
but if we, as product managers, with our team, our engineers,
and our designers want to kind of try to figure
34

35
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,620
out a solution in order to keep people on the site longer,
we might go look at the buttons they're clicking,
35

36
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,960
the pages they're going to, so that we can tell
when they go to this particular page,
36

37
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,700
all of a sudden they drop off and they don't come back.
37

38
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
all of a sudden they drop off and they don't come back.
38

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,390
So maybe something about that page is bad.
39

40
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:30,870
And these sorts of things are just metrics and just data
we look at to help us inform us on other decisions.
40

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:38,880
These exploratory metrics are basically just data points
that we go in and look at kind of hunting for
41

42
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:47,580
a little bit of a clue so that we can know how to potentially build a feature to hit the reporting metric and make that increase.
42

43
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,020
a little bit of a clue so that we can know how to potentially build a feature to hit the reporting metric and make that increase.
43

44
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,540
So, for the purposes of this course, and for the rest
of this lecture, we're going to be talking about
44

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,220
reporting metrics, and these are the metrics that
you're tracking over time to make sure your product
45

46
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,040
is either getting better or getting worse.
46

47
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,330
All right.
47

48
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,890
So what makes a good metric?
48

49
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,810
Well, let me first say that if you're working at a company
or you join a larger company, I bet they're
49

50
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,740
probably already going to have a bunch of metrics per
team that they are tracking, and that you can already
50

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,930
begin to try to optimize with features,
and changes, and fixes and that sort of thing.
51

52
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:29,670
But let's say, just for the thought exercise, that you
don't have any metrics to track and this feature
52

53
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,920
that you've been brought in to work on with your team is
completely new, so you have to come up with some metrics.
53

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,740
that you've been brought in to work on with your team is
completely new, so you have to come up with some metrics.
54

55
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,980
Well, what makes the metrics good? If I pick some metrics,
how do I know if they're good?
55

56
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,450
The first thing a metric should be is understandable,
and that means you don't need to go and create
56

57
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,570
some crazy metric, like the number of times someone
clicked this button twice and then went back and clicked
57

58
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,580
this other thing and did this thing, and then call that
a particular metric that you're tracking.
58

59
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,590
It needs to be something that's relatively simple, that you can explain just by telling them the name of that metric.
59

60
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,420
It needs to be something that's relatively simple, that you can explain just by telling them the name of that metric.
60

61
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:09,310
It's usually like something divided by something else to
get a percentage, or the number of times this person
61

62
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,940
or this group of people did this thing, it's usually pretty simple.
62

63
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,300
So keep your metrics understandable.
63

64
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,310
That brings me to the second point, which is
metrics should usually be a rate or ratio.
64

65
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,030
And this goes back to what we were talking about in regards to monthly active users versus just total number of users.
65

66
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,280
And this goes back to what we were talking about in regards to monthly active users versus just total number of users.
66

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,900
You want to pick a metric that is not something that's
going to look like a hockey stick no matter what you do.
67

68
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,680
You want to pick a metric that is not something that's
going to look like a hockey stick no matter what you do.
68

69
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,850
Imagine if, say, Twitter, or Facebook, or something
just basically tracked the number of users on their
69

70
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,940
platform or the number of people that have ever signed up.
70

71
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,820
That's pretty silly, because maybe some spam accounts sign up,
maybe some people sign up and hate it and
71

72
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,850
leave. What really matters is total number of users,
72

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:04,360
and then, from there, you take the total number of users that have actually logged in the last 30 days or something like that.
73

74
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,490
and then, from there, you take the total number of users that have actually logged in the last 30 days or something like that.
74

75
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,110
We call that monthly active.
75

76
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,450
So it's a portion of a larger number,
76

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,870
and this is the sort of stuff that you want to be doing.
77

78
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,130
Let's give another example. Let's say we're working at AirBNB.
78

79
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,990
And for those of you that don't know, AirBNB is a
company that allows you to basically rent out
79

80
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:30,100
your house as a sort of independent hotel to people
around the world using their platform. Would you
80

81
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:37,570
want, if you're a product manager AirBNB, to be tracking
a metric like total number of nights booked?
81

82
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,750
Well, actually, you would want to know that number,
but that number is not going to be very effective in
82

83
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,180
knowing whether or not you and your team
are doing a very good job.
83

84
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:54,670
This is because that can be affected by a whole bunch of stuff.
It can be affected by publicity and marketing,
84

85
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:54,960
This is because that can be affected by a whole bunch of stuff.
It can be affected by publicity and marketing,
85

86
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,410
it could be affected by any number of
other things, maybe the economy, etc.
86

87
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:07,870
But what we could track is the average number of
nights booked per person in a month or, let's say, six
87

88
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,200
months, whatever might work for the data that you have.
88

89
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:18,070
This is basically measuring a ratio, which is super important,
because the numbers are much smaller and
89

90
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,840
they are more descriptive of whether or not your product is good.
90

91
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,250
The third thing I want to point out is correlation.
91

92
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:31,660
You don't want to look at two metrics that are correlated
and then assume something from those that isn't true.
92

93
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,680
You don't want to look at two metrics that are correlated
and then assume something from those that isn't true.
93

94
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,730
I'll give you an example.
94

95
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:40,480
So there's an old sort of metrics joke that basically says,
if you look at revenue for ice cream sales,
95

96
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:48,820
and then you look at a metric for the number of
people that drown in a pool and die,
96

97
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:56,020
those numbers, those metrics, if you looked at them
on a graph, they would track each other pretty closely.
97

98
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:56,280
those numbers, those metrics, if you looked at them
on a graph, they would track each other pretty closely.
98

99
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,590
And you know why that is? This is because people
eat ice cream in the summer, obviously, and they swim
99

100
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,830
also in the summer, because it's hot out.
100

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,260
But you might be led to believe, if you're not paying attention,
that when people eat more ice cream, more people drown,
101

102
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,990
But you might be led to believe, if you're not paying attention,
that when people eat more ice cream, more people drown,
102

103
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,590
which makes no sense at all.
103

104
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,680
So you have to be careful about these things.
104

105
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,760
So the next point I want to bring out is that you should
pick a metric that is actually able to be changed
105

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,600
and with relative ease, or you should position your metric
so that when you do make changes, the metric
106

107
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,610
is changing, either going up or down.
107

108
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,930
Here's an example of that.
108

109
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:41,590
Let's say that you have a particular type of user
that, let's just say, only has like one or two hours
109

110
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,320
available at all during the average day,
110

111
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,650
and there is no more time than just those two hours in a day.
111

112
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:58,210
In that case, you probably wouldn't want to try to maximize
the time spent in your product or in your app
112

113
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,170
In that case, you probably wouldn't want to try to maximize
the time spent in your product or in your app
113

114
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:06,520
beyond the two hour mark, or maybe not even measure it at all.
This is because there's some external force,
114

115
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,460
again, in our thought experiment, where the users
only have that amount of time per day.
115

116
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,680
In that case, you may want to measure something like
the number of times per week that they're using
116

117
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,850
your product, or maybe the number of times that they log in.
117

118
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,890
In that case, you might want to measure the number of times per week that the users are using your product.
118

119
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,020
In that case, you might want to measure the number of times per week that the users are using your product.
119

120
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,440
Are they coming back really frequently?
120

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,360
We're not going to care about how much time they're spending
per day, because we assume once we've got
121

122
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,110
them near the two-hour mark, they're not going to be
able to spend more time in there anyways, depending
122

123
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,750
on sort of the nature of the product.
123

124
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:46,030
One more quick example for that is, let's say you're running
an e-commerce business, and you sell something
124

125
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,820
that people only buy, like, they just only buy once per month,
125

126
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,840
like, 90% of people only buy once per month,
126

127
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,840
let's say some sort of fancy clothes. In that case,
127

128
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,500
if the users are coming in once per month, and it's very
unlikely that they're going to come in more
128

129
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,870
than once per month to use your product or buy something
from your e-commerce platform, then it's going to
129

130
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,580
be very difficult to get them to come in more than that.
130

131
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,620
And, of course, we would want to try, but it's going to
be something that involves a lot more than just
131

132
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,850
our product team, it's probably going to be
marketing and all sorts of other stuff.
132

133
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,970
So what might we track instead?
133

134
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,860
Well, in that case, we might just try to get them to spend more money for that one time that they do shop with us once per month.
134

135
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,850
Well, in that case, we might just try to get them to spend more money for that one time that they do shop with us once per month.
135

136
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,830
Let's do a really quick recap.
136

137
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,740
We know that metrics should be easily understandable,
137

138
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:45,520
we know that people should be able to know what they're
about as soon as they read the sort of description
138

139
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,390
of that metric, you shouldn't pick metrics based on an
erroneous correlation, like the ice cream and drowning
139

140
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:59,470
deaths example, you want to pick metrics that actually
do impact each other and are not just tracking 
140

141
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,290
each other due to circumstance.
141

142
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,170
You also want to have a ratio or rate rather than just
a number that might go up when marketing does
142

143
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:14,800
some sales, or when your company gets a lot of publicity,
and we want to make sure our metrics are with
143

144
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,990
relative ease able to be affected.
144

145
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:26,230
So we don't want to really try to change a number or metric that
our users are very unlikely to behave differently within.
145

146
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,520
So we don't want to really try to change a number or metric that
our users are very unlikely to behave differently within.
146

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,220
All right, so that's it for this one.
147

148
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,400
And next, we're going to talk about some metrics frameworks
to actually help you think through the process
148

149
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,650
of choosing metrics and brainstorm a little bit.
149

150
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,210
See you there.
