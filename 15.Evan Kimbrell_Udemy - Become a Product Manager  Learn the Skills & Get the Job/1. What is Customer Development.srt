Hey guys, welcome to the next section.
1

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,470
Super proud of you for making it this far.
2

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,220
Now, in this section, we're going to cover a very prominent concept in startups and large businesses today
3

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,340
called customer development. Customer development is one of the number one tools a product manager will
4

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,920
use to get any sense of whether or not
you're building the right thing,
5

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,300
what the market will accept, and what the market will
absolutely just reject. So it's something you have to know.
6

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,910
what the market will accept, and what the market will
absolutely just reject. So it's something you have to know.
7

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,220
Now, a lot has changed since this book The Lean Startup came out.
8

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,610
Companies, startups, even small businesses are looking at their markets and looking at their customers
9

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,410
as well as their business ideas in a radically new way.
10

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,670
If you're unfamiliar with The Lean Startup, we cover that
later in the course, so don't worry.
11

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,630
But the old way of thinking was that you would sit around,
come up with the best idea for what you think
12

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:00,270
your market will accept, then what you would do is
you would build that and push it out to the market.
13

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,300
your market will accept, then what you would do is
you would build that and push it out to the market.
14

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,540
The attitude in general was that some products and some
new features succeed and some fail. Such is life.
15

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,020
The attitude in general was that some products and some
new features succeed and some fail. Such is life.
16

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,790
You go from concept to production, to promotion,
and that's the entire lifecycle.
17

18
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,740
Now, if there's one thing we've learned from The Lean Startup is that you can't come up with product ideas in a vacuum.
18

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,900
Now, if there's one thing we've learned from The Lean Startup is that you can't come up with product ideas in a vacuum.
19

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,080
There's a lot more that goes into what makes a product successful and what makes a product unsuccessful,
20

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,380
and that information nugget that you wish you had
before you started building your product
21

22
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,260
and before you launched it is actually held by the customer.
22

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:46,380
So, customer development, in a nutshell, is the practice of establishing a continuous and iterative communication
23

24
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,510
line with your customers, so that you can come up with ideas, come up with hypotheses, try them out with
24

25
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:02,660
your customers, get feedback, and use that feedback to
inform your product decisions going forward.
25

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,750
The idea behind customer development is that by establishing a line of communication with your customers, you can on a constant
26

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,490
basis test and validate your product ideas with regards to
who's going to buy it and the market in general.
27

28
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:17,610
basis test and validate your product ideas with regards to
who's going to buy it and the market in general.
28

29
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,660
Now, I know a lot of you guys out there have heard of customer development and you probably are thinking, "Well,
29

30
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,810
that's part of it, right?"
30

31
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,190
that's part of it, right?"
31

32
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,130
Well, let's talk about customer development
really quickly from an academic sense. Now,
32

33
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,800
customer development is actually a framework and
was developed by a man named Steve Blank.
33

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,690
He is a professor at Stanford and a thought leader in startups and how small companies can disrupt large industries.
34

35
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,600
He is a professor at Stanford and a thought leader in startups and how small companies can disrupt large industries.
35

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,430
The concept, as he teaches it, was expounded in his book called The Four steps to epiphany, if that's any hint.
36

37
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,370
The concept, as he teaches it, was expounded in his book called The Four steps to epiphany, if that's any hint.
37

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,110
There are four steps to his customer development framework.
38

39
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,810
Step one is discovery, step two is validation,
step three is creation, and step four is building.
39

40
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,210
Step one is discovery, step two is validation,
step three is creation, and step four is building.
40

41
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,530
Now, he teaches the customer development mindset as something that permeates every single section of
41

42
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:11,310
your product lifecycle, from coming up with the idea all the way to growing your business, and this is
42

43
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:18,550
absolutely true, and product managers do use customer development in every single section of their business.
43

44
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,570
absolutely true, and product managers do use customer development in every single section of their business.
44

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,970
But, for our purposes in this course, we're going to focus on the parts of the customer development framework
45

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,330
that are actionable and are the most useful,
and that is the customer interview.
46

47
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,630
As you manage a growing product or even a budding brand new product, you're going to want to increase
47

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:42,540
your product I.Q. by understanding the real reasons why
your customers use or do not use your product.
48

49
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:42,720
your product I.Q. by understanding the real reasons why
your customers use or do not use your product.
49

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,940
And by doing customer interviews, we can hear it
in their own words, which is incredibly valuable.
50

51
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,630
So, for a product manager or a founding entrepreneur,
customer development is going to look like this.
51

52
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,400
So, for a product manager or a founding entrepreneur,
customer development is going to look like this.
52

53
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,950
Now, the first step in the process is that
you're going to come up with an idea.
53

54
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,070
This is the core nugget that you're going to build
your enterprise or your product on.
54

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,260
And that means that you're going to instantly go
into the process of validation, trying to figure out
55

56
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,540
whether or not this is a good idea to build. At this stage,
you're going to use customer interviews to
56

57
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,160
figure out whether or not your product is needed,
whether or not the problem you think you're solving
57

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,030
is a real problem, and whether or not customers actually
have that problem and are interested in your
58

59
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,070
solution for it. You're going to constantly reintroduce this feedback that you've received into your validation
59

60
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:38,850
process, eventually landing at the MVP stage, and then
onto the next stage, which is the actual development
60

61
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,300
of your first version one product.
61

62
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,660
Now, during the development phase, you're going to be using customer interviews and customer development as
62

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:53,400
a way of figuring out what features are the correct ones to build
and how should you prioritize what
63

64
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,270
goes into your version one, so that you can be efficient
and save resources. After your version one, you
64

65
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,370
go into a process whereby you're going to start iterating
on your product, you're going to start improving
65

66
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,490
it, adding features, changing things that don't work out.
66

67
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:14,730
At this stage, you're going to use customer development constantly to figure out things like: are customers enjoying the product?
67

68
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,780
At this stage, you're going to use customer development constantly to figure out things like: are customers enjoying the product?
68

69
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,060
Are they using it correctly? Who exactly is using
the product and getting the most out of it?
69

70
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,180
Are they using it correctly? Who exactly is using
the product and getting the most out of it?
70

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,250
Is it the group that we thought it was? You'll use this
as a tool for figuring out whether or not you're
71

72
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,580
targeting the right people, figure out if there's anything
that you are missing, and to give you clues
72

73
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,410
as to what new features or new avenues might be open to you.
73

74
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,010
Customer development is primarily a tool for two things.
74

75
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,040
One, risk mitigation, and two, opportunity recognition, and that is what you are going to use customer development 
75

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,840
for as a product manager.
76

77
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,810
So, in this section, we're going to focus on how do we do that iterative process, how do we do it correctly,
77

78
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,010
So, in this section, we're going to focus on how do we do that iterative process, how do we do it correctly,
78

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,880
how do we know if we're getting the right feedback,
79

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,880
who exactly do we talk to, and what insights
can we get from our interviews.
80

81
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,020
Ok, guys, hope you're excited.
81

82
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,230
This is an incredibly useful skill you will use regardless of
whether or not you become a product manager.
82

83
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,450
See you in the next lecture.
