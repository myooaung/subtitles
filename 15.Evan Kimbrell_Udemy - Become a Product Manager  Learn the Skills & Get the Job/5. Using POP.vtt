Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.830
Welcome to this bonus / optional lecture
2

3
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.490
where I'm going to talk about how you can take your sketches,
add interaction to them, get them on your phone,
3

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.200
and take them to the next level using a system called POP.
4

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.500
As always, if you're not interested, you're too busy for this stuff,
this is optional. Skip the lecture, I will see you later.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
As always, if you're not interested, you're too busy for this stuff,
this is optional. Skip the lecture, I will see you later.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.200
As always, if you're not interested, you're too busy for this stuff,
this is optional. Skip the lecture, I will see you later.

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.370
As always, if you're not interested, you're too busy for this stuff,
this is optional. Skip the lecture, I will see you later.
8

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.670
All right, so in the last two lectures we got into
sketching, showed you how to do it,
9

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.530
how to think through it, and then we practiced by
creating a wireframe set called InstaFood.
10

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
how to think through it, and then we practiced by
creating a wireframe set called InstaFood.
11

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.520
Now, the idea behind sketches are that they're rapid,
they're very easy to do, pen and paper, that's it,
12

13
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.180
Now, the idea behind sketches are that they're rapid,
they're very easy to do, pen and paper, that's it,
13

14
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.790
and you can do them really, really quickly.
14

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.250
So if you have an idea, you want to communicate it,
you can sketch it out and then show it to someone,
15

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.870
that instantly brings your communication
and your conversation to the next level.
16

17
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.020
It's also incredibly useful for things like validation
or user testing because, on the fly, if you want
17

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.530
to ask about something or get someone's feedback on it,
you can just whip it up and show it to them.
18

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.910
But one of the limits of being able to do that quickly is that you
have to hold the piece of paper and explain to them
19

20
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.840
But one of the limits of being able to do that quickly is that you
have to hold the piece of paper and explain to them
20

21
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.430
"Oh this button goes over here, and trust me, it's going
to have, like, a thing that does this, and ...it makes sense."
21

22
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.950
"Oh this button goes over here, and trust me, it's going
to have, like, a thing that does this, and ...it makes sense."
22

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.070
It's especially troublesome when you're trying to convince
someone of mobile apps, because you're holding
23

24
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.570
a piece of paper and, you know, if you draw an iPhone
like the way I draw an iPhone, people will think you're crazy.
24

25
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.860
a piece of paper and, you know, if you draw an iPhone
like the way I draw an iPhone, people will think you're crazy.
25

26
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.370
All right, so enter POP, one of my favorite apps
for sketching and collaborating.
26

27
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.490
All right, so you can check it out online if you want to,
it's popapp.in, I don't know what the .in suffix is.
27

28
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.570
but they'll talk you through it, show you how it works.
28

29
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.050
It's free to use, and you only pay if you start using it for tons
and tons of projects, at which point you should probably
29

30
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.450
It's free to use, and you only pay if you start using it for tons
and tons of projects, at which point you should probably
30

31
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.380
pay anyway.
31

32
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.350
It works for iOS, Android, and Windows phones,
so it pretty much covers
32

33
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.790
everybody - sorry if you have a BlackBerry, but let's be honest,
33

34
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.900
if you have a BlackBerry, you have bigger problems.
34

35
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.580
Now, the idea behind POP is that we're gonna use our
phones to take a photo of our sketches, then it's
35

36
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.510
going to import it into the POP system,
and we can add basic user flow and interactions.
36

37
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.870
One thing that does make this easier for you guys
though is to go to popapp.in/sketchpad/
37

38
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.680
and you can download these sketch pads
38

39
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.420
they have that are really clean, really to spec, and for
all the major phones - it'll make this process
39

40
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.650
a lot easier, at least it will look a lot better.
40

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.880
a lot easier, at least it will look a lot better.
41

42
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.140
All right. You ready?
42

43
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.110
All right. You ready?
43

44
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.890
Grab a piece of paper, draw out your
wireframes and your sketches,
44

45
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.230
grab your phone, and let's use some POP.
So you'll open POP, and then it's pretty simple.
45

46
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.720
You just want to create a project,
and I'll just talk you through this as we go.
46

47
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.400
Name it. Remember? Ours was InstaFood.
47

48
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.150
Name it. Remember? Ours was InstaFood.
48

49
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.070
Okay.
49

50
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.610
Now, what it wants me to do is say what device that
my designs are for, if I want to do landscape or
50

51
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.680
portrait, I want to do portrait with an iPhone 5,
I actually drew an iPhone 5, at least that's what was
51

52
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.210
in my head when I was using it.
52

53
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.150
Yes, this is an iPhone 5 and it is yellow. Create your project
and then just hit the plus button here,
53

54
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.540
because hitting the plus button will ask us to add screens.
54

55
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.960
So, the way we do this is we take photos of them. If you've taken photos before, you can throw them into Dropbox,
55

56
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.760
in your creative cloud, or it's already stored on
your phone, or you can just take them right now.
56

57
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.760
All right, so then all I have to do is take the photo
of the app that we just drew before. I actually drew
57

58
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.340
out a couple more screens so that you guys
can see the interaction a little bit better.
58

59
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.150
And then what you want to do is just place it on the image,
and light up the boxes, and take the photo. Alright,
59

60
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.490
and then all you have to do is just keep taking photos, you don't have to hit next, and save, and move on, or anything like that.
60

61
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.640
and then all you have to do is just keep taking photos, you don't have to hit next, and save, and move on, or anything like that.
61

62
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.840
And so we can just keep moving on.
62

63
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.880
Then, the third screen that we drew right there.
63

64
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.600
All right, cool.
64

65
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.540
Now I have a couple other screens that I'm going to add.
I'm going to call in some extra light, because
65

66
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.270
we're in the learning den, also known as a cave.
66

67
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.230
Let's add some more screens. I made a screen for
what happens when you hit e-mail log in.
67

68
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.040
Obviously, it didn't just automatically send you to the store front.
68

69
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.180
Facebook log in would do that though.
69

70
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.690
So we need to take a photo of that, and then
I made another screen for checking out.
70

71
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.040
So after you hit "Buy", it should add it to a screen
so you can see your subtotal and whatever, whatever.
71

72
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.320
So after you hit "Buy", it should add it to a screen
so you can see your subtotal and whatever, whatever.
72

73
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.170
I made a very basic screen for that.
73

74
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.590
There.
74

75
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.310
Okay.
75

76
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.630
When you're done, hit next.
76

77
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.650
You can view what you've done.
77

78
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.890
Great, looks great, looks great.
78

79
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.540
You have the option to crop if you shot it off
a little bit wrong, like, see how it's,
79

80
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.880
it's misaligned, so I can put it right back on where it should be.
80

81
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.820
And I could also just, you know, I could cut it
so it's like this, if I want it to be shorter, or taller, or whatever.
81

82
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.320
And I could also just, you know, I could cut it
so it's like this, if I want it to be shorter, or taller, or whatever.
82

83
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.710
Done, okay.
83

84
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.070
I can add brightness too as well,
84

85
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.870
if you guys are also in a cave and you might
want to add some brightness.
85

86
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.630
Okay, now I see my five screens, now I just need to add in
relationships between the screens. We established
86

87
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.790
this before, right? You have a log in screen and you
click Facebook login, it takes you to the storefront,
87

88
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.500
you click on one of the items you want to buy, takes you
to the detail page, and then if you click "Buy",
88

89
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.120
it's going to take you to the shopping cart.
89

90
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.040
So I'm going to reflect that in the app. I want to go to
the first one and just click it, and all you want to do
90

91
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.780
is click on the button or the area that you want to be tappable.
91

92
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.770
So I just click on the Facebook login, and then I'll draw this little box so it has a wider area that I can touch with my finger.
92

93
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.130
So I just click on the Facebook login, and then I'll draw this little box so it has a wider area that I can touch with my finger.
93

94
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.450
Great.
94

95
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.820
Now I link it to, link it to the storefront.
95

96
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.410
Great.
96

97
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.850
I'll add one more.
97

98
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.130
This e-mail login will go to the e-mail login
screen I made. There we go.
98

99
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.060
This e-mail login will go to the e-mail login
screen I made. There we go.
99

100
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.430
I realize now that I didn't put a login button for
the login button, so we'll make that a dead end,
100

101
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.750
but we'll move on to the next screen. So this one,
I would label this the main screen up here just by
101

102
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.890
tapping the title, I could call it the main screen.
102

103
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.900
And then I can add in the buttons that we know should work.
103

104
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.860
So I'll just do the apple for our sake,
104

105
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.780
link to the detail page.
105

106
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.870
Great.
106

107
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.410
Moving over to the detail page.
107

108
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.350
See how fast this is? It's really, really simple.
108

109
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.800
See how fast this is? It's really, really simple.
109

110
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.240
Double tap the "Buy" button, make it a little bit larger.
110

111
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.750
That's going to link to the cart page.
111

112
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.230
Great.
112

113
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.980
Okay.
113

114
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:47.420
Now I have a project that's set up, it's ready to go.
Now, what I can do is when I'm talking to someone,
114

115
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.580
say, "Hey, I have this idea for InstaFood, or at least
this is the way I envision a grocery delivery app,"
115

116
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.170
maybe I work at a startup that is making
something like that - like InstaCart.
116

117
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.120
And then what I would do is I would
show this to them, but not like this,
117

118
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:09.390
I'd show it to them by hitting "Play". And now,
"Play" basically makes a fake version of our app.
118

119
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.840
Now the sketches look like something on your phone.
119

120
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.450
So if I wanted to log in, I would hit "Log in," oh and it takes me
to the storefront, and I would be talking them through
120

121
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:24.170
it, right? I'd explain what the top button does, and I'd
explain what these images are, not everyone's going
121

122
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.050
to be doing this with a chisel tip sharpie,
so there's going to be a lot more detail to this.
122

123
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.900
to be doing this with a chisel tip sharpie,
so there's going to be a lot more detail to this.
123

124
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.120
I do it with those sharpies because I like to, they're fun.
124

125
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.390
I click on the apple, explain to them how that works.
125

126
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.940
I click on the apple, explain to them how that works.
126

127
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.430
Oh, I click "Buy" and buy, and I go to the cart page.
127

128
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.580
Oh, I click "Buy" and buy, and I go to the cart page.
128

129
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.140
Great.
129

130
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:45.480
That is the gist of POP. What you can also do is you can add in comments, so what can do is you can share it with people.
130

131
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.190
That is the gist of POP. What you can also do is you can add in comments, so what can do is you can share it with people.
131

132
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.980
And then, if you want to add in commenting,
you just double tap in one area, leave a comment.
132

133
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.550
"This is great."
133

134
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:59.870
And then someone can read that, and then when I
want to share it I just go back up here, hit "Share", and
134

135
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.510
I can send out a link, so I will text it to myself
135

136
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.250
and we can see it on our browser.
136

137
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.690
There you go, it works the same.
137

138
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.940
I can read an introduction that describes what it is or I can just
play right through it, it works the same exact way.
138

139
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.110
I can read an introduction that describes what it is or I can just
play right through it, it works the same exact way.
139

140
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:16.920
Check it out. Cool.
140

141
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.500
Check it out. Cool.
141

142
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.070
Then I give descriptions, yada yada yada.
142

143
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.840
Then I give descriptions, yada yada yada.
143

144
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.700
Anyway, so that's one way you can take your
sketches to the next level.
144

145
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.090
Awesome, awesome tool for rapidly, on the go,
145

146
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.150
taking two dimensional sketches and then putting them
on your phone, and putting them in a way that you
146

147
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:41.160
can explain them, share them, collaborate on them,
and instantly connect in a better, more meaningful way
147

148
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
with whoever you are trying to explain this to.
148

149
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:43.380
All right. Hope you enjoyed that one,
149

150
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.570
All right. Hope you enjoyed that one,
150

151
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.910
we have plenty of other tools in this course.
151

152
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.400
At the end of this course, you'll be a master
of so many different things.
152

153
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.760
I'm kind of envious.
153

154
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.570
Even though I guess I'm teaching the course,
so it doesn't really make sense.
154

155
00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:55.140
Whatever. Don't think about it.
155

156
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.740
Whatever. Don't think about it.
156

157
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.760
See you in the next lecture.
