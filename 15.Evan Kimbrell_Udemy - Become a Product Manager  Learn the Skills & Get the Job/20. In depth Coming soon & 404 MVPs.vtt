Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.740
Let's talk about the best practices of using the 404 page
or the coming soon page type MVP to test out
2

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.840
your new feature or product idea.
3

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100
Chances are, you've seen these before,
but you probably don't remember them.
4

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.790
Why?
5

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.200
Well, because it generally just feels like nothing out of the ordinary.
6

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.310
As for the 404 MVP,
7

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.280
these are some of the hardest MVPs to spot, because
how do you even know if it was a test or not?
8

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.820
It could just be that the page was broken,
and coming soon pages are nowadays everywhere,
9

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.780
half of which never materialized and did anything at all.
10

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.200
Now, how do you choose between running a 404 or
a coming soon page? Well, just ask yourself this question.
11

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.410
Now, how do you choose between running a 404 or
a coming soon page? Well, just ask yourself this question.
12

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.360
If I'm a user, would I rather think the page is broken
or that the page was misleading?
13

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.810
Which of these two options is the least evil for you?
14

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Whatever you say, that's probably the way you should go.
15

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.380
The companies that can get away with 404s are
the ones that generally have tons and tons of pages.
16

17
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.390
The companies that can get away with 404s are
the ones that generally have tons and tons of pages.
17

18
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.880
Why?
18

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.070
Because, if you see a 404, you can still jump
to another product and keep browsing.
19

20
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.930
Not a lot of damage done.
20

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.000
Amazon does this all the time, because they have
10 bajillion roughly other pages you can look at.
21

22
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.480
Clothing companies run variations of this all the time.
22

23
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.260
They'll add new items, but make them
out of stock, and that's totally normal.
23

24
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.990
No one notices this.
24

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.250
The companies that generally get away with coming soon
page MVPs are often companies that are smaller
25

26
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.120
and where the audience is aware that they are in fact new.
26

27
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.120
Those companies are already working with their early adopters,
and those of you guys that completed my
27

28
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.870
MVP course know that early adopters generally have
very tough skin when it comes to this stuff.
28

29
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.540
They generally revel in the fact that they are
cutting edge, so in a weird way,
29

30
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.990
coming soon pages actually don't faze them at all,
they feel better about them. Now,
30

31
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.910
if Walmart.com did this, it would be considered
universally tacky on the other hand.
31

32
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.710
So think about your user expectations and which of these
result in the least negative outcome. Can they
32

33
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.760
get over the broken page and will this
coming soon page peak their interest or deflate it?
33

34
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.840
If you decide to go this route, let's talk about
some tips and best practices.
34

35
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.290
Number one is design it.
35

36
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.980
What do I mean? Well, there is a world of difference
between a bland colorless page that really does look
36

37
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.920
like your site is broken and a clever well-designed
404 page that actually might enhance your brand.
37

38
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.250
like your site is broken and a clever well-designed
404 page that actually might enhance your brand.
38

39
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.420
Check out the resources.
39

40
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.990
There are actually lists of 404 sites that have done this really well.
40

41
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.920
Some of these 404s are actually really funny and it
endears you to the company and allows the company
41

42
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.360
to continue a conversation with you that
they otherwise wouldn't be able to.
42

43
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.210
The same goes for coming soon pages.
43

44
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.010
Put some effort into them.
44

45
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.640
Don't just use generic templates and
don't forget to proofread whatever you put up.
45

46
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.770
My best suggestion here is to use a tool that
is designed specifically for coming soon pages,
46

47
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.980
the two main ones being Launchrock and KickoffLabs.
Those two sites will help you pull one together
47

48
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.460
very quickly and even let you import your own design assets
and make it look like a seamless continuation
48

49
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.350
of your product - sometimes you can't even tell
that you used a platform for it.
49

50
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.560
Number two is shorten the horizon on these as much as possible.
50

51
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.150
You don't want to see the same users
seeing the same 404 or coming soon in a page.
51

52
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.180
"That's annoying" turns Into "I'm angry." So try to limit the length of these tests. Alright guys, see you in the next lecture.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.540
