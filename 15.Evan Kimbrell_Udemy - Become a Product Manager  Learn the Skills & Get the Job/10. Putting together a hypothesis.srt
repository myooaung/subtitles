Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:10,470
Let's dive into creating some hypotheses based off of
the assumptions we previously listed out.
2

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,730
You remember what goes into one of these, right?
3

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,430
You remember what goes into one of these, right?
4

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,210
No? You don't actually remember?
5

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,720
Well, let me tell you, because I only alluded to it before,
in the previous lecture, and you probably only heard
6

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,210
it if you were paying really close attention.
Pat yourself on the back if
7

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,310
it if you were paying really close attention.
Pat yourself on the back if
8

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,720
you know what I'm about to say. The biggest difference
between an assumption and a hypothesis is that
9

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,970
a hypothesis is actionable. How exactly is it actionable?
10

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,810
a hypothesis is actionable. How exactly is it actionable?
11

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:40,560
Well, because it has specifics. We define a target group,
we're going to define an expected outcome
12

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,440
of our test, and we might even dabble with details
like why we expect our subjects to do something, or
13

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,530
how we plan to get them to do it.
14

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,310
So, target group, potential problem, an action,
and potentially even an expected outcome.
15

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,330
So we'll try writing out some of these formulas,
starting with the most basic and then building up to
16

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,710
more and more sophisticated versions. As a product manager,
17

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,210
you're probably going to run tests for a variety of scenarios.
You're thinking of launching a new product,
18

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,210
you're thinking of adding or removing a new feature
on your existing product, or you're looking to make
19

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,550
a significant change to the product features you already have.
20

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,260
We'll cover three different ways and you can choose
whichever one fits your needs for your exact situation.
21

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,530
We'll cover three different ways and you can choose
whichever one fits your needs for your exact situation.
22

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,640
Let's start with the most basic hypothesis.
It goes a little something like this: "We believe [...] will
23

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,710
[...] because [...]." The first blank is the subject.
24

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:45,990
We believe some group of people, some target group
of customers out there, the second blank, "will," is the
25

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,360
expected action we think they are going to do, maybe
they'll buy something from you, maybe they'll flock
26

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,720
to some new service, maybe they'll sign up for something, and then the "because" is the reason why we're predicting they'd do it.
27

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,990
to some new service, maybe they'll sign up for something, and then the "because" is the reason why we're predicting they'd do it.
28

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,380
Maybe it's because they want to save money, maybe
they don't like the competition - whatever it is we think,
29

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,370
that's what we're going to put there.
30

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:05,750
There you go. That's a hypothesis.
31

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,950
There you go. That's a hypothesis.
32

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,950
This one works great if you're building
a new product or you're an entrepreneur.
33

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:21,870
You want to establish, let's say, women ages 40-45
will sign up for weekly events newsletters because
34

35
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,460
they would like to stay informed about their city.
35

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:32,670
Yeah, I know it's nonsense, but if one the riskiest assumptions
was "Older women are interested in being 
36

37
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,880
informed about news in their city," this would
pretty much nail it for you as a hypothesis.
37

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,290
informed about news in their city," this would
pretty much nail it for you as a hypothesis.
38

39
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,540
Now, let's address some concerns.
39

40
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,390
Do we have to include or address a problem in our hypothesis?
40

41
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,630
Well, this is a bit complicated. At its core,
41

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,560
all products and all features stem from problems.
You're going to hear me saying this throughout the course.
42

43
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:01,590
Whatever it is, if you think long enough about it, you can
probably pinpoint some problem that it solves.
43

44
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,550
The problem with Google Glass, yes, is that you have to reach for your phone, right? As opposed to reaching for my phone,
44

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,020
The problem with Google Glass, yes, is that you have to reach for your phone, right? As opposed to reaching for my phone,
45

46
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,880
The problem with Google Glass, yes, is that you have to reach for your phone, right? As opposed to reaching for my phone,
46

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,960
I can have it up here.
47

48
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,420
I know, very trying times we live in, but it is still a problem,
regardless of the severity or the degree of the problem.
48

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
I know, very trying times we live in, but it is still a problem,
regardless of the severity or the degree of the problem.
49

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,740
I know, very trying times we live in, but it is still a problem,
regardless of the severity or the degree of the problem.
50

51
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:25,140
Whatever you think your users are going to do,
it's probably because you're going to solve or alleviate
51

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,170
some problem they have in some degree.
52

53
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:35,580
So if you want to be more accurate in your hypothesis
and do a better job, add a problem. And if you can't 
53

54
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,070
think of a problem, it's okay. Instead, you can describe a benefit: [...] group would benefit by [...].
54

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,890
think of a problem, it's okay. Instead, you can describe a benefit: [...] group would benefit by [...].
55

56
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,730
That doesn't necessarily get at the core reason why they
would benefit, because it's solving a problem at its core,
56

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,730
That doesn't necessarily get at the core reason why they
would benefit, because it's solving a problem at its core,
57

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,120
but sometimes that's something you really don't care about.
That extra bit of learning is really helpful,
58

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,140
but sometimes that's something you really don't care about.
That extra bit of learning is really helpful,
59

60
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,610
but is it crucial? At this stage, not necessarily.
60

61
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,710
but is it crucial? At this stage, not necessarily.
61

62
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,030
Ok, now that you have a hypothesis,
you would then go out and test that.
62

63
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,810
Ok, now that you have a hypothesis,
you would then go out and test that.
63

64
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,610
And this form is fine for this stage, because at this stage
you're just establishing that people are even interested at all.
64

65
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,550
And this form is fine for this stage, because at this stage
you're just establishing that people are even interested at all. 
65

66
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,310
You are completely waiting out from shore on this one
and you're just looking for a heartbeat of a demand.
66

67
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,060
You are completely waiting out from shore on this one
and you're just looking for a heartbeat of a demand.
67

68
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,910
This is what you might do if you were doing exploratory tests
that entrepreneurs are so familiar with.
68

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,550
But product managers might be managing an already
established customer base that has already established
69

70
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,400
that they want your product.
70

71
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,770
So we need to get more specific. Product managers are
often going to use MVP tests and hypotheses to make
71

72
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,480
changes to their existing product
in order to create a desired outcome.
72

73
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:52,140
In this use case, we're not just tacking on more product
to our product or creating a new product,
73

74
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,840
we're tinkering with what we already have built. Let's try
adding some criteria to accommodate for this type of scenario.
74

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,750
we're tinkering with what we already have built. Let's try
adding some criteria to accommodate for this type of scenario.
75

76
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,100
All right, new style of hypothesis:
"If we [...] we believe [...] will [...] because [...]."
76

77
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:08,530
All right, new style of hypothesis:
"If we [...] we believe [...] will [...] because [...]."
77

78
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,570
Now we have an action.
78

79
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:19,860
If we change the color of the buy button, we believe
all users will buy more because they are busy and
79

80
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,280
often get distracted, like I do.
80

81
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,620
Now, that is something we can test.
81

82
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,950
But what about that word we used in there, "more"?
82

83
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:36,650
Well, you could actually use that word, and it's unideal,
but it can actually work, technically. Technically,
83

84
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,550
more means more, a larger number in some regard,
so it either goes up or it goes down,
84

85
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,540
more means more, a larger number in some regard,
so it either goes up or it goes down,
85

86
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,340
which right now is fine. In the next lectures we're going
to talk about how you define what more means,
86

87
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,590
and it's called the minimum criteria for success.
87

88
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,970
I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's in the next couple of lectures.
88

89
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,010
But if we wanted to make it more specific at this point,
89

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:07,590
well, let's do that, and let's actually try to define
what "buy more" means, and let's just reorganize our
90

91
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:13,650
hypothesis to avoid making a nasty run off sentence.
Now, "buy more" could mean a lot of different things.
91

92
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,890
It could mean increased cart size for an e-commerce store.
92

93
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,120
It could mean they buy more often,
they return to purchase more often.
93

94
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,280
It could also mean that they buy the same amount of items,
but they are more expensive.
94

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,970
So, in this hypothesis, let's actually try to address that.
95

96
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,950
So let's say: "We believe [...] has a [...] because [...].
If we do [...] this [...] metric will be affected."
96

97
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,050
So let's say: "We believe [...] has a [...] because [...].
If we do [...] this [...] metric will be affected."
97

98
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,980
I know, this is kind of crazy, but all you have to do is
just fill in the blanks with what should go there, and
98

99
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,040
I know, this is kind of crazy, but all you have to do is
just fill in the blanks with what should go there, and
99

100
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,280
now you have a very easy template to use to make
a very specific and very actionable hypothesis.
100

101
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,770
Okay, now, in this scenario, we now have an action
we can take to solve a user problem that happens to a
101

102
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:06,960
specific group because of a reason we think. If we do this,
we assume this metric will then be affected.
102

103
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,060
specific group because of a reason we think. If we do this,
we assume this metric will then be affected.
103

104
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,730
And keep in mind that this is the product management
way of thinking: more specificity equals more focus.
104

105
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,950
Also, product managers love metrics, as you'll find out more later.
105

106
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,990
So, there you have it. Three different ways of writing
a hypothesis with varying degrees of complexity.
106

107
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,120
So, there you have it. Three different ways of writing
a hypothesis with varying degrees of complexity.
107

108
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,860
If you have to establish basic demand and basic validation,
i.e. new products or entrepreneurs, stick with the
108

109
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,330
short version of the hypothesis and just keep it simple.
109

110
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,280
If you're merely speculating on a way to change user behavior
and you're exploring this, then try the second type.
110

111
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,120
If you're merely speculating on a way to change user behavior
and you're exploring this, then try the second type.
111

112
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,850
But if you want to manage a product, you've got to get used to
using the most specific one, which was the third type.
112

113
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,780
But if you want to manage a product, you've got to get used to
using the most specific one, which was the third type.
113

114
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,010
All right guys, you now know how to make a hypothesis.
114

115
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,700
Next lecture, we're going to do it for our example business, Zirx. See you then.
