Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.880
Let's talk about concierge MVPs. As a refresher,
concierge style MVPs are where you manually
2

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
help your users accomplish their goals as a means of
validating whether or not they have a need for
3

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.130
what you're doing in the first place.
4

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.420
This is different than the Wizard of Oz MVP in that
you don't actually build out anything, just some
5

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.120
way of connecting your users to you to get their participation,
6

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.570
and then, secondly, you are upfront in this scenario
about the fact that you don't yet have this feature.
7

8
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.680
and then, secondly, you are upfront in this scenario
about the fact that you don't yet have this feature.
8

9
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.200
Those are two key distinctions between the two.
Concierge MVPs
9

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.080
are very common ways to test the needs
of your users, even in big companies.
10

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.200
The advantages are that you can run them almost in secret.
11

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.580
All you have to do is email a batch of users
and manage those relationships directly.
12

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.720
You don't even have to add any fake buttons
to your website or build any fake pages.
13

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.180
Another advantage is that a concierge service is kind of like a hybrid between customer development and MVP testing.
14

15
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.800
Another advantage is that a concierge service is kind of like a hybrid between customer development and MVP testing.
15

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.050
You do get to see how they react and whether or not
they're going to use your service in a meaningful way,
16

17
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.440
You do get to see how they react and whether or not
they're going to use your service in a meaningful way,
17

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.580
but you also get the opportunity to ask why
and see what their internal reasoning is.
18

19
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.680
The cons of this type of experiment are that they're really management intensive and they can be really time absorbing.
19

20
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.130
The cons of this type of experiment are that they're really management intensive and they can be really time absorbing.
20

21
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.290
In most cases, you yourself will want to run the task because,
you know, you're the one who knows what
21

22
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.430
questions to ask, which then can add some serious logistical issues for everyone, because you have other responsibilities.
22

23
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.600
questions to ask, which then can add some serious logistical issues for everyone, because you have other responsibilities.
23

24
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.940
You're also going to burn a lot of resources on one user.
24

25
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.610
You are just going to have to swallow the extra cost,
because concierge services and concierge MVPs
25

26
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.580
are just very rarely profitable in and of themselves.
26

27
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.200
The only cases where a concierge might actually
make you money is if you're selling luxury items, in
27

28
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.300
which case you can justify spending a lot of time on one person.
28

29
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.070
So how exactly do you run these experiments?
29

30
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.230
Let's try an example to help conceptualize this.
Let's say you're a product manager for Uber.
30

31
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.420
You know what Uber is, right?
31

32
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.590
And I probably don't have to tell you what it is. You want to know
if adding, let's say, a wheelchair accessible
32

33
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.780
car option to your app is worth pursuing.
33

34
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.800
You're not sure how many people exactly need it and whether the drivers will get enough money to stay on the system,
34

35
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.260
You're not sure how many people exactly need it and whether the drivers will get enough money to stay on the system,
35

36
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.550
if they're solely focused on serving that one type.
36

37
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.900
So what you could do is pick a city,
take a handful of users, and email them,
37

38
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.310
talking about a beta program for handicap accessible cars.
You could also tell your regional managers
38

39
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.400
to ask around and forward any accounts they can find
that might benefit from the service. The users that
39

40
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.470
sign up then get a phone number to text
whenever they need pickup.
40

41
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.550
It's really that simple.
41

42
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.500
You could drive the car or have one person drive the car
and you operate the text message, you didn't
42

43
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.630
actually have to develop anything to do this.
43

44
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.670
Then it's up to you to just track how often people
end up using the car, whether or not they decide the
44

45
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.840
wait is even worth it, and whether or not they
just end up switching and using regular cars.
45

46
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.130
Also, the plus side is you get to talk to them during the ride and hear what the pros and cons of the setup are.
46

47
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.940
Also, the plus side is you get to talk to them during the ride and hear what the pros and cons of the setup are.
47

48
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.770
That's a realistic scenario in which you could pull this off.
If you want to assess whether or not this
48

49
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.470
is going to work for your organization,
49

50
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.120
you need to think about the value of time.
50

51
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.590
If you're too in demand, and you simply can't be 100%
committed to a concierge test, then it
51

52
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.390
might be the case that you try some different way of MVP testing.
52

53
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.820
Similarly, if you need bigger data sets to justify your decision,
you're just not going to get that with
53

54
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.540
this technique, unless you're planning a giant expensive operation.
54

55
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.210
So that is a concierge service.
55

56
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.750
It's cheap to run but it takes a ton of your time.
56

57
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.610
Think deeply about whether or not
this is something that is going to fit for you.
57

58
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.920
Generally, earlier in your company's history,
if you're a smaller group, that's generally where that's
58

59
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.900
the sweet spot for concierge tests,
59

60
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.780
but big organizations use them all the time.
60

61
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.070
All right guys, see you in the next lecture.
