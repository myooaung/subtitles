Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.470
So, last lecture we talked about where can you find and
drill down on potential customers that you can
2

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.950
interview if you're in a scenario where you are
pre-product or pre-launch.
3

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.650
So, the other side of the coin to this is
what do you do when you are post product?
4

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.280
Let's say you have some ideas for things to add
to a product you already have.
5

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.780
You have a feature list, you have a roadmap,
6

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.560
You have a feature list, you have a roadmap,
7

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.440
you have a backlog. The customer development framework
tells us that we need to get out of the building
8

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.660
and start talking to our customers,
but where do we find the customers?
9

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.050
and start talking to our customers,
but where do we find the customers?
10

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.130
Now, a lot of you at home are probably thinking
"Well, isn't this a little more obvious?"
11

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.870
And you're right, it is more obvious.
12

13
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.960
Presumably, if you're post product, you have a list of
customers, a list of free users, and potentially a
13

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.650
list of people that have demonstrated interest in your product.
Even if you're relatively new, you only
14

15
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.430
launched not that long ago, you'll still have what are called
"early evangelists," which are people that
15

16
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.000
use it as if it were a version for a polished product
and they just love it. Regardless of where you are
16

17
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.800
in this product development process,
17

18
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.040
there are customers you can interview. Now, the most
obvious thing is that, why don't you just go and look
18

19
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
at the list of customers and just go that route?
19

20
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.240
Now, you can do that.
20

21
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.620
You can just tap someone on the shoulder and say,
"Hey, I need the list of all the e-mails of all of our
21

22
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.810
users and let me contact them."
22

23
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.030
Well, there's two downsides to doing that.
23

24
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.590
One is that it comes off very spammy and it actually
can break your terms and agreements, so you need to
24

25
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.950
make sure that that's within the bounds of spam and
what's just not going to annoy the crap out of people.
25

26
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.100
make sure that that's within the bounds of spam and
what's just not going to annoy the crap out of people.
26

27
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.490
The other thing is that you're going to have a harder
time getting people to talk to you just because
27

28
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.050
this is a cold email, this is as cold as it would get if
you're just e-mailing them because you saw their e-mail
28

29
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.450
on a list, it would be hard even to customize it for them.
29

30
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.960
So you can, by all means, just send out an e-mail blast
to your user base and you will get interviews that way.
30

31
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.530
So you can, by all means, just send out an e-mail blast
to your user base and you will get interviews that way.
31

32
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.690
But, in this lecture, we're going to focus on four ways
to get warm leads that will save you some time
32

33
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.760
with regards to finding them and getting them to talk to you,
and is probably going to get you better
33

34
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.090
customers to talk to. In general, some of the best
customers to talk to are ones that have already
34

35
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.400
pointed themselves out as people that are enthusiastic,
or interested, or have a problem with something
35

36
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.100
in your product. People that have opinions and people
that are invested in your product enough to have
36

37
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.880
one of those two emotions are going to give you a much
bigger bounty of information. Then, the first way
37

38
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.890
of going about this is by using your company's live chat feature.
38

39
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:11.120
Now, a lot of companies, startups, even large businesses use live chat systems. Live chat systems are exactly what they
39

40
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.020
sound like - you can chat with someone in the company live by clicking on a box, usually in the bottom right of your screen.
40

41
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.050
sound like - you can chat with someone in the company live by clicking on a box, usually in the bottom right of your screen.
41

42
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.970
Whether it's Olark, or Tawk.to, or one of the
more complicated ones, like Intercom.io,
42

43
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.180
if you have them, then you have a wealth of information from which you can choose ideal customers to reach out to.
43

44
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.950
if you have them, then you have a wealth of information from which you can choose ideal customers to reach out to.
44

45
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.000
So, if you have a live chat system, great. Continue on.
45

46
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.870
So, if you have a live chat system, great. Continue on.
46

47
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.050
Now, there's two ways of going about this - one is the passive
and one is the active. In the passive approach,
47

48
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.670
Now, there's two ways of going about this - one is the passive
and one is the active. In the passive approach,
48

49
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.030
what you want to do is essentially go and ask to see
the chat logs from your customers, and what they're
49

50
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.160
saying, and what questions they're asking.
It's really interesting stuff on its own.
50

51
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.350
saying, and what questions they're asking.
It's really interesting stuff on its own.
51

52
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.920
But what you can do is you can look at what people are saying and try to find individual people that meet your target demo.
52

53
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.780
But what you can do is you can look at what people are saying and try to find individual people that meet your target demo.
53

54
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.860
Then, when you message them, you can
pull information from their chat log,
54

55
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.590
make it sound like a continuation of the conversation.
55

56
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.680
People are much more likely to respond to that
and you get plus points for customer service.
56

57
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.590
Now, the other approach is the more active version.
57

58
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:23.130
A lot of live chat systems - the vast majority of them -
have the functionality that allows them to force
58

59
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.560
themselves on your screen. So, you might have seen this before,
if you're ever on a web site and you have
59

60
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.790
something pop up as you go to another subpage,
60

61
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.570
and it usually says something like "Do you need help
finding something?" You say yes or no.
61

62
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.900
If you say yes, it automatically connects you.
If you have that functionality,
62

63
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:47.040
you can definitely find people that appear to be doing
things that you think would fit into your target
63

64
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.790
demo, or you can look for specific users when they
get online, or you can just do it at random.
64

65
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.860
When you force a conversation, then you can pop up,
you can talk to them, and go that route.
65

66
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.300
Alternatively, if you don't have that capability, that's fine.
66

67
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.490
A much simpler version of this active approach is
either to set in on the customer service live chat,
67

68
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.510
so if you're in a small organization, this is very easy,
68

69
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.630
or ask someone who is in customer service to, at the
very end of their chats, once they've solved the
69

70
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.770
problem, just simply ask them if they would be willing to talk to someone in a product management role for 10 minutes.
70

71
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.810
problem, just simply ask them if they would be willing to talk to someone in a product management role for 10 minutes.
71

72
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.220
It's very similar to when you call the bank and they say "After your phone call, would you like to take a 5-minute survey?" Yes or no.
72

73
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.150
It's very similar to when you call the bank and they say "After your phone call, would you like to take a 5-minute survey?" Yes or no.
73

74
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.900
A lot of people say no but a lot of people say yes.
74

75
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.420
So don't ignore the live chat.
75

76
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.540
This is some potent stuff - these people have self-identified themselves as being engaged with your product.
76

77
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.740
This is some potent stuff - these people have self-identified themselves as being engaged with your product.
77

78
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.200
The second treasure trove where you can go
to get people to interview is your blog.
78

79
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:59.370
Now, most companies have blogs. If you don't have a blog nowadays it's kind of the exception - it's kind of standard practice,
79

80
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.690
Now, most companies have blogs. If you don't have a blog nowadays it's kind of the exception - it's kind of standard practice,
80

81
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.880
it seems like. So if you have a blog, a lot of blogs
allow commenting, so it's rather simple.
81

82
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.390
it seems like. So if you have a blog, a lot of blogs
allow commenting, so it's rather simple.
82

83
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.050
Look at the people who are commenting on your blog.
83

84
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.660
If you don't have a blog, look for people who are
commenting on your outside, external press.
84

85
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.210
Those people have something to say about your product.
85

86
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:24.140
They're probably users and also you have this
advantage: they want to be heard. Okay?
86

87
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.820
They're probably users and also you have this
advantage: they want to be heard. Okay?
87

88
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.470
They're probably users and also you have this
advantage: they want to be heard. Okay?
88

89
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.120
That's the reason why they're posting on your blog
to begin with. They have something to say.
89

90
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.350
That's the reason why they're posting on your blog
to begin with. They have something to say.
90

91
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.950
No one post a comment that is entirely passive,
that says nothing. They always want to be heard.
91

92
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.980
No one post a comment that is entirely passive,
that says nothing. They always want to be heard.
92

93
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.090
No one post a comment that is entirely passive,
that says nothing. They always want to be heard.
93

94
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.900
And if you message those people, e-mail them and say,
"Would you like to talk for 10 minutes about the
94

95
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.550
product?" they will feel special and it will convert.
95

96
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.340
Now, a third area to consider are power users.
96

97
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.790
So, we previously established that you probably have
a list of all of your customers, and if your organization
97

98
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:03.300
even slightly knows what they're doing, they're probably
collecting information on each user, so all you
98

99
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.620
have to do is look specifically for power users.
99

100
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:14.550
Now, you can segment power users by a number of different things. You can look for them based off of frequency.
100

101
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.820
Now, you can segment power users by a number of different things. You can look for them based off of frequency.
101

102
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.040
How often do they use your application?
And that's generally a very good metric.
102

103
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.600
People who are only casual about your product probably don't log in very often and they probably don't
103

104
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.440
use the features very often - these are very easy things to track,
I'd be very surprised if your organization was not tracking them.
104

105
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.100
use the features very often - these are very easy things to track,
I'd be very surprised if your organization was not tracking them.
105

106
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:37.410
You can also look for things like high engagement, and every organization has a different definition of engagement.
106

107
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.640
You can also look for things like high engagement, and every organization has a different definition of engagement.
107

108
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.310
It could be buying things often, it could be sending messages
108

109
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.740
It could be buying things often, it could be sending messages
109

110
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:51.530
often, it could just be people that use it frequently
and message your own company often.
110

111
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.530
So don't neglect power users.
111

112
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:59.400
They are in general more informed about your product,
they spend more time using it, and here's the catch -
112

113
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.520
they're more invested in your product.
113

114
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.100
So if you say to them "Let's have a conversation about improving it," there's a very good chance they'll be interested in that.
114

115
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.320
So if you say to them "Let's have a conversation about improving it," there's a very good chance they'll be interested in that.
115

116
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.100
And the last one is Twitter.
116

117
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.620
I love using Twitter for talking to customers
because it's fantastic for that.
117

118
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.330
It's just an online machine for conversations.
118

119
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.260
Twitter is a goldmine for reaching out
to these people, and it's really simple.
119

120
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.720
You guys probably have a Twitter account.
120

121
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:30.740
Just look at who is tweeting at you, who is replying,
who is liking, and who is sharing your posts.
121

122
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.730
Chances are they already follow you,
which means you can direct message them.
122

123
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.060
Those messages get answered almost all of the time.
123

124
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.470
Those messages get answered almost all of the time.
124

125
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.370
So they've essentially self-identified themselves as saying,
"Hey, we like your product enough to spend
125

126
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.770
time talking about it or engaging with you."
126

127
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.400
They have their foot in the door,
they're probably going to talk to you.
127

128
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:56.490
Ok, guys, so those were four different ways that you,
within an organization, and with a pre-existing product,
128

129
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:05.190
can pick out customers who are most likely to respond to you and give you better information than if you picked someone at random.
129

130
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.650
can pick out customers who are most likely to respond to you and give you better information than if you picked someone at random.
130

131
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:13.800
So use those four tricks yourself: live chat, commenters,
Twitter, and look for power users. In the next lecture,
