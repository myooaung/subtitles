Hey everyone, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,790
I want to give you a really quick taste of what the day to day activities are for a product manager.
2

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:11,900
I want to give you a really quick taste of what the day to day activities are for a product manager.
3

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,090
So we're going to go hour by hour through my typical day at the office. So I get to the office at about
4

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,600

6
9:00 AM and the first thing you do is check e-mails and technology news. Keeping up with the industry
5

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,510
is really important as a product manager.
6

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,680
Some places that I go to keep up with the latest tech news are places like TechMeme.com, Hacker News,
7

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,270
Launch Ticker, Product Hunt, and I'll even type my company name into Twitter and just see what people
8

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,270
are saying about our latest features.
9

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,520
About an hour later, at 10:00 AM I go look at our team's metrics dashboard and I really look for any
10

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,180
weird behavior against our release logs.
11

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,220
So if something's going weird in the metrics in a direction we don't think is optimal, then what we
12

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,250
do is we just look at what happened with the releases lately and try to track down the reason that that
13

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,050
metric is being affected. At this point,
14

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:13,910
I'll also go and check out customer feedback from emails to support our community operations team.
15

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,890
I'll look at our App Store reviews to see what people are saying about a recent release we've made and
16

18
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,500
I'll even go hang out in our beta forum for a bit to see what sort of issues people are having or if
17

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,510
they have any feedback for us. About an hour later, at 11:00 AM, we have our team stand up meeting.
18

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,630
So our team gets together and we look at our sprint board and our backlog.
19

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,390
And then each of us says what we're working on at the time, what we recently completed, and if there's
20

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,830
any blockers or if we need help with anything.
21

23
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,340
I also try to make it a point to tell our team - the engineers and designers that work with me - what metrics
22

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,020
look like lately, you know, that morning, if they're looking good or bad, and if there's any interesting
23

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,910
things people are saying in terms of the product feedback. This is especially if we've had a recent release
24

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,460
from our team and everyone's excited to see, you know, how the users are liking it. So the stand up goes until about
25

27
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,090

28
11:15 AM because it's only a 10-15 minute meeting.
26

29
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,770
After that, I talk with the team designer about our user problems and the latest feedback.
27

30
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,210
We may even go to the whiteboard to sketch out some solutions that we might be thinking about or just
28

31
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,960
work on things we've already been brainstorming over the last week or a few days.
29

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,830
So at about noon, 12:00, if we're planning any upcoming features, I'll take some time to write specs,
30

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,560
tickets, and user stories, and insert requirements or wire frames from the designer into those tickets.
31

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
At 1:00 PM, depending on the day,
32

35
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,370
I usually take a little bit of time to test the latest mobile release for our feature.
33

36
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,260
This is known as the alpha release.
34

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,080
This comes before beta and we'll talk more about this a little bit later in the course. So I test
35

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
this on Android and iOS on these two test devices I have.
36

39
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,890
And then our designer helps with this as well,
37

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,330
and both he and I report our bugs and issues that we found during testing into a new ticket inside of
38

41
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,460
Jira, our product management tool.
39

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,230
So from 2:00 PM and onwards, the stuff I do changes drastically from day to day.
40

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,440
So here's a few things I may do depending on the day and what's going on in the rest of the company.
41

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,620
So here's a few things I may do depending on the day and what's going on in the rest of the company.
42

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,430
If it's a Monday, then I meet with the team to do sprint planning, or sprint grooming, or a retrospective on the last sprint. On most days,
43

46
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,380
If it's a Monday, then I meet with the team to do sprint planning, or sprint grooming, or a retrospective on the last sprint. On most days,
44

47
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,360
it's likely that I hold 10 meetings with other product managers or stakeholders to work on cross team planning
45

48
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,680
or get a feature cleared from other stakeholders.
46

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,980
An example of this would be to meet with the sales team and tell them that something is changing.
47

50
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,780
Some other random frequent happenings that are sprinkled throughout the week are things like meeting
48

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,750
with our data science team to discuss the recent test that we ran and look at exploratory data from user
49

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,360
behavior to help my designer and myself come up with the right solutions for the next iteration.
50

53
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:58,620
I also might attend some user tests of our new features or present metrics milestones to executives, investors,
51

54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,240
or other product managers.
52

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,390
Sometimes we work with a team to present recent accomplishments of the company. We do this on Fridays
53

56
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,900
so the company, everyone gets to demo kind of what they've done.
54

57
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,940
Our team will also hold open houses to ensure that everyone in the company has the ability to talk to
55

58
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,220
our team and align around any questions or feedback that they have for us.
56

59
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,710
I also meet a lot with new employees on product vision and direction to orient them.
57

60
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,500
This is really important to make sure that all the new employees coming in understand what each component
58

61
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,800
of the product does and which teams are responsible for what.
59

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,840
So as you can see there's really not a typical day as a product manager and it's never dull.
60

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,210
The days are always dynamic but some things like checking industry news and your metrics and meeting
61

64
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,370
with your own team never change.
62

65
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,920
I'll see you all in the next video.
