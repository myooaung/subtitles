00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,050
Alright everyone, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:10,650
In the last lecture we talked about some real world examples
of metrics from companies you've probably
2

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,740
heard of. It was YouTube, and Twitter, and Facebook,
and you might have noticed that, when I was talking
3

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,090
about some of these metrics, I said that
here are some growth metrics.
4

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,090
You know, the new users, and the monthly actives,
and that sort of thing, and then here's the engagement
5

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,650
metrics, which are things that were
a little bit more specific to each company.
6

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,660
A lot of times, the growth ones were the same, because
they were, you know, the more generic metrics, and
7

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,300
then the engagement ones were very specific to the platform.
In the Facebook example, we had the news
8

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:56,220
feed position engagement number, and on YouTube we had
the, you know, number of views that were over 30
9

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,400
seconds on average per person. In this section,
10

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,290
we're going to be talking about these different types,
these categories of metrics, and there are a number
11

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,860
of categories of metrics out there, and they are not,
there's no official definition for any of these,
12

13
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:13,990
of categories of metrics out there, and they are not,
there's no official definition for any of these,
13

14
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,850
but this is, in my experience, how they're usually sectioned off.
14

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,300
So, in practice, there's a whole bunch of these
different categories of metrics, and these are not,
15

16
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,730
there's no dictionary definition for this, and you're
never going to have the same ones across companies,
16

17
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:29,780
there's no dictionary definition for this, and you're
never going to have the same ones across companies,
17

18
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:35,790
but there's sort of general categories that, in my experience,
I've seen at the companies I've either
18

19
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,400
worked with or worked for. Some of the most common,
the ones we're going to talk about here are growth
19

20
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:50,850
and activation as one category, engagement, retention,
then user happiness, and then revenue.
20

21
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,160
And those are really the big buckets.
21

22
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,610
So we'll talk a little bit about each one of these, give some real life examples, and define a little bit further what they mean.
22

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,010
So we'll talk a little bit about each one of these, give some real life examples, and define a little bit further what they mean.
23

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,020
The first category is growth and activation.
24

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,450
This is pretty self-explanatory.
25

26
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:13,110
This is a bucket of metrics that basically tracks, and measures,
and informs you how your company or product is growing.
26

27
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,110
This is a bucket of metrics that basically tracks, and measures,
and informs you how your company or product is growing.
27

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,970
So, some examples of some growth and acquisition metrics
are going to be total new users per month or
28

29
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,910
per week, then you're going to have new users by source,
29

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,250
we'll talk a little bit about that, and then activated users.
30

31
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,020
So if you're working as a product manager either on a growth team inside a company or you're a product manager
31

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,540
at a smaller company that's also responsible for growth,
then you want to know obviously how many new
32

33
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:47,700
users you have, but you really want to know where
these users are coming from. Are they coming from the SEO
33

34
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:55,230
optimizations you did, which is search engine optimizations,
so that people can find you via Google and
34

35
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,860
search engines, and stuff like that?
35

36
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,660
Or is it that they're finding you on an app store,
or is it that they're finding you on maybe a blog
36

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,570
somewhere, or perhaps they're finding you because
one of your users shared some content from your
37

38
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,120
platform or your app out to another platform, like
Twitter, and they click the link and say "Hey, what is this?"
38

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,800
platform or your app out to another platform, like
Twitter, and they click the link and say "Hey, what is this?"
39

40
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,370
These are all very important to track,
and that would be new users by source.
40

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,300
So we're tracking where they're coming from.
41

42
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:31,380
So activation is a big one because there's a really big
difference between a person that has been considered
42

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,470
someone who's found and maybe installed your app
and an activated user.
43

44
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,670
So what usually happens is a company or product manager
will say that an activated user is someone that
44

45
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,850
has not only downloaded the app or gone to the web site,
but they've actually signed up and they've performed
45

46
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,580
a particular type of action, like, maybe, you know, making
their first tweet in Twitter's example, or something like that.
46

47
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,310
a particular type of action, like, maybe, you know, making
their first tweet in Twitter's example, or something like that.
47

48
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,360
This is hugely important because if you get a million people
to download your app, but only 500 of them
48

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,260
actually get logged in and activated,
49

50
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:15,390
well, that's not so useful, now, is it? The second one
is retention, and retention is tied very closely to
50

51
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,460
the growth and activation metrics.
51

52
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,370
It's simply a way to find out who's coming back.
52

53
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,140
It's just how many people were here last month using
your product that are now here this month using it.
53

54
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:34,380
again. Some examples of retention metrics are
things like a metric called actually retained users,
54

55
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,970
and one other one is called resurrected users.
55

56
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,200
Again, returning users is the number of users
that are returning, that are here again.
56

57
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,410
They are continually, either week over week,
or day over day, or month over month
57

58
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:58,830
using your service, or your app, or your product.
And then, resurrected users is basically something
58

59
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:07,280
that we use to describe people that we've gotten back.
So let's say that there was a user that was using
59

60
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
our product last month and they're not here this month.
60

61
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,700
They haven't been using our product this month, but next
month they do come back because we sent them
61

62
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,830
either a push notification on their mobile phone or we
sent them an e-mail and said "Hey, did you know we
62

63
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,770
have these features?" or something like that.
63

64
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,880
Then, if they do come back, we can say
"Hey, that's a resurrected user."
64

65
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,300
The implication there is that they were, you know,
"dead" or they were just gone,
65

66
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,140
so we are now resurrecting them and
bringing them back into our product.
66

67
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:43,160
So, in terms of how those might actually be measured in
a number sense, let's say that 100 users downloaded
67

68
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:52,880
our app last month and got activated, then we see this month that 60 of them are actually here again this month using the app,
68

69
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,940
our app last month and got activated, then we see this month that 60 of them are actually here again this month using the app,
69

70
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,160
we would say that our user retention rate is 60%.
70

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,270
We know that there's something wrong,
that 40% of people did not come back.
71

72
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,750
Those people did not find it a good enough product
and that's how we measure it.
72

73
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,570
Then, for the resurrected users, let's say that those 40
we're now considering gone, like we've sort of
73

74
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:20,000
lost them because they're not here this month, but next
month we send them an email or a push notification,
74

75
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:20,200
lost them because they're not here this month, but next
month we send them an email or a push notification,
75

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,340
let's say all 40 of those people come back into our app,
76

77
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:31,460
we would say that our resurrected user rate was 100%,
because, remember, we have 40 people that
77

78
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,350
are considered dead or gone,
78

79
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:39,620
and now we are resurrecting all 40 of them,
means our resurrection rate is 100%.
79

80
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,830
Hey, by the way, you might be wondering about these time periods,
the one month, or two months, or that sort of thing.
80

81
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,290
Hey, by the way, you might be wondering about these time periods,
the one month, or two months, or that sort of thing.
81

82
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:54,680
All of these time periods and actual definitions are really up to each company and/or product team to decide the definitions on.
82

83
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,010
All of these time periods and actual definitions are really up to each company and/or product team to decide the definitions on.
83

84
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,940
Basically, the only thing that really matters about
your metrics is that you're keeping them consistent,
84

85
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,110
Basically, the only thing that really matters about
your metrics is that you're keeping them consistent,
85

86
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,430
so if you're measuring something one way in one
period of time, you have to keep measuring it that way
86

87
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,580
in the future in order to be able to compare to the past, and you want to keep these things the same for as long as possible.
87

88
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,340
in the future in order to be able to compare to the past, and you want to keep these things the same for as long as possible.
88

89
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:23,150
All right, so the next bucket of metrics is engagement.
Engagement is going to be one of the most common
89

90
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:30,160
things for product managers to be tracking that work at
consumer product companies. Engagement metrics,
90

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,200
things for product managers to be tracking that work at
consumer product companies. Engagement metrics,
91

92
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,530
we've already talked about a little bit,
92

93
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,050
it's things like Twitter.
93

94
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,070
How many times did a user tweet on average per day?
94

95
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,290
How many times did they like something? Etc.
95

96
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,910
Engagement metrics are usually tailored per company
to encourage a specific type of behavior, depending
96

97
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,520
on the goals of the company or your industry, basically.
I'll give you a real world example really quick.
97

98
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,370
on the goals of the company or your industry, basically.
I'll give you a real world example really quick.
98

99
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,810
I know that YouTube tracks views, they count someone
as viewed if they've watched 30 seconds of video,
99

100
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,330
30 seconds of a YouTube video. Facebook,
on the other hand, tracks their video views
100

101
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,890
I think based off of three seconds, so if someone's
watched for at least three seconds.
101

102
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,890
These are different.
102

103
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,990
Of course, Facebook is going to report way more views
that way, because it's pretty hard to shut off a
103

104
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,270
video in three seconds if you're just scrolling past it.
104

105
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,770
But these metrics, as you can see, are tailored to the
types of metrics that each company wants to report
105

106
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:36,410
both externally and internally for reasons of quality
and accuracy, and also being able to be easily
106

107
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,380
compared to stuff they've tracked in the past.
107

108
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,480
The next bucket is user happiness.
108

109
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,590
This is pretty self-explanatory.
109

110
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,680
It's just a way for us to quantitatively say how happy are our users.
110

111
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:58,490
So examples of that would be something called NPS
scores, or number of customers that have written a
111

112
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,880
complaint to the customer service department.
112

113
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:08,480
And then, even something like the AppStore rating for
your particular app in like, the Android or iOS
113

114
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,040
AppStore. NPS means net promoter score, by the way,
114

115
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,700
and it's something that was developed a long time ago
that's pretty ubiquitous from company to company.
115

116
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,000
and it's something that was developed a long time ago
that's pretty ubiquitous from company to company.
116

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,990
It's basically a survey that goes out to users that tracks how likely they are to recommend that service or product to other people.
117

118
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,620
It's basically a survey that goes out to users that tracks how likely they are to recommend that service or product to other people.
118

119
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,800
You might have actually seen these before if you've
ever gotten a survey that says "Will you rate us
119

120
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,770
on a scale of 1 to 10 of how likely you
are to recommend our product?"
120

121
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:42,810
The secret behind this though, by the way, is that I think
anything under a 7 is basically counted as a zero.
121

122
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,610
The secret behind this though, by the way, is that I think
anything under a 7 is basically counted as a zero.
122

123
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:51,050
So if you can't get a user to at least say I'm at least
like a 7, 8, or 9, or 10 in terms of a scale of
123

124
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,710
likelihood to recommend this to other people, then you're basically, you know, losing out and it's going to throw off the average.
124

125
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,210
likelihood to recommend this to other people, then you're basically, you know, losing out and it's going to throw off the average.
125

126
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:06,050
This is because companies want to kind of set a high bar
for customer happiness. Overall, happiness metrics
126

127
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,240
are some of the most difficult to get because it's not
as easy as just looking in a database for, you
127

128
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:19,190
know, number of times someone clicks something, but they are
very important, and they are even more relevant
128

129
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:28,700
in industries or companies where there's little competition,
or where people don't have other options, or it's a total necessity.
129

130
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,460
in industries or companies where there's little competition,
or where people don't have other options, or it's a total necessity.
130

131
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:36,710
Some examples for that would be a cable provider or an airline.
131

132
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:42,590
I know most people out there hate their cable internet
service or their internet service at home, but
132

133
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,240
they don't really have a choice because
there's not very many choices available,
133

134
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,060
so the cable companies, they see a lot of use, obviously,
but it doesn't mean the customer is happy.
134

135
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,940
And when they say "How happy are you?" to their customers,
they're going to say "Not very. You guys suck."
135

136
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,130
And when they say "How happy are you?" to their customers,
they're going to say "Not very. You guys suck."
136

137
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:03,020
So the last category of metrics we're going to talk
about is revenue metrics. Revenue metrics, pretty
137

138
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,510
self-explanatory, how much revenue are we making.
138

139
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,510
But there's a lot of different ways we can look at this,
and these are very important for product managers
139

140
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:19,700
that are working at companies where revenue from
customers is a really big deal, or product managers
140

141
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:26,030
that are working inside of consumer companies where
the consumers are not paying anything, but maybe
141

142
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,580
they're being advertised to, and that's how you generate revenue.
142

143
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,570
they're being advertised to, and that's how you generate revenue.
143

144
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:38,690
An example of a revenue metric is LTV, which stands
for lifetime value, and that basically means we pick
144

145
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,910
a period, let's say, a long period of time, like one year,
and we say that's a customer lifetime, then we
145

146
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:52,960
say over one year on average how much revenue
does each customer generate us?
146

147
00:11:53,060 --> 00:12:01,100
So within that space of one year we're getting, let's say,
$300 from each user on average - that would be our LTV.
147

148
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,820
So within that space of one year we're getting, let's say,
$300 from each user on average - that would be our LTV.
148

149
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:11,020
Another example would be a metric called CAC,
which is cost of acquisition of customer.
149

150
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,460
Sometimes it's CCA, which is cost of customer acquisition.
150

151
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,930
It's all the same thing.
151

152
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:27,410
It's basically how much money do we have to spend in marketing,
or advertising, or even salaries for salespeople
152

153
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,790
to on average acquire a customer.
153

154
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,140
This is very important to track because we want
to keep this number as low as possible.
154

155
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:43,910
One other example that a lot of business to business
companies put a lot of value into is a metric called
155

156
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,110
MRR, which is monthly recurring revenue, and its counterpart, which is ARR, annual recurring revenue.
156

157
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,590
MRR, which is monthly recurring revenue, and its counterpart, which is ARR, annual recurring revenue.
157

158
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:57,660
This is basically how much revenue are we
making per month or per year,
158

159
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,700
and this is of all of our customers combined,
all of our users combined.
159

160
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:09,380
So this is, for a subscription service, let's say, Dropbox,
for example, they have 100 users, and each one
160

161
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,610
of those users is paying $10 a month.
161

162
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,580
Well then, their monthly recurring revenue is going to be $1,000.
162

163
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,180
So you can see how that works.
163

164
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,710
This is, of course, a huge indicator of value
for subscription businesses like Dropbox.
164

165
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,540
All right, so let's recap really quick.
165

166
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,150
There's a ton of metrics out there and some of them
are going to be the same across companies,
166

167
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,080
a lot of them are going to be different,
167

168
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,080
but the important thing to know here is that there are
different categories of metrics, and the purpose
168

169
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,320
of these categories is to ensure that we're covering what's called the customer lifecycle journey or the customer lifecycle.
169

170
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,730
of these categories is to ensure that we're covering what's called the customer lifecycle journey or the customer lifecycle.
170

171
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:53,720
So I have metrics to know how many people are finding us,
and then signing up, and then using us, and then
171

172
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,510
I have a metric to measure how happy they are,
172

173
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,780
and then I have a metric to measure how much
money are they making us,
173

174
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:08,390
and finally, sometimes people even add how much
are they referring us to others to account for sort 
174

175
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,610
of a growth, like a viral growth.
175

176
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,190
But yeah, we want to cover basically the
entire lifecycle for each individual user.
176

177
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,430
Now, if you're at a larger company, you might work on
a team that is only focused on really one of these
177

178
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,830
categories or one of the metrics inside of that category,
178

179
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,850
but if you're at a much smaller company, you might be
a product manager that's responsible for a growth
179

180
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:42,140
metric, and a retention metric, and an engagement metric,
and so on and so forth.
180

181
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,410
All right.
181

182
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,340
So in the next lecture we're going to get even
further into metrics. We'll see you there.
