1
1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:04,260
All right, so we have both sides of the equation outlined,
2

2

00:00:04,260  -->  00:00:07,760
and we've identified both the things we are trying to affect.
3

3

00:00:07,760  -->  00:00:12,350
We've also identified the things that it will cost if we actually decide to go
4

4

00:00:12,350  -->  00:00:17,780
full steam ahead and build out whatever our wildest dreams have in store.
5

5

00:00:17,780  -->  00:00:20,900
Now, you at home that are bright probably already know that
6

6

00:00:20,900  -->  00:00:26,460
whatever experiment we run, we need the 
potential upside probably to outweigh the cost,
7

7

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:32,300
and since we're setting our line in the sand of success in one specific spot,
8

8

00:00:32,300  -->  00:00:37,270
we need to identify at what point does the benefit outweigh the cost,
9

9

00:00:37,270  -->  00:00:39,140
and that's how we figure out that line.
10

10

00:00:39,140  -->  00:00:41,030
So let's just do that.
11

11

00:00:41,030  -->  00:00:44,770
I suggest starting on the left hand side first,
12

12

00:00:44,770  -->  00:00:48,590
so we know exactly what we're spending to make this happen.
13

13

00:00:48,590  -->  00:00:51,650
The left side also is in general easier to calculate,
14

14

00:00:51,650  -->  00:00:53,930
because it's based off of cold hard facts,
15

15

00:00:53,930  -->  00:00:57,130
whereas the right side is a little more speculative.
16

16

00:00:57,130  -->  00:00:59,350
Now, for demonstration purposes, let's say we work
17

17

00:00:59,350  -->  00:01:02,800
at our favorite big, bloated, blue bird, the Twitter bird.
18

18

00:01:02,800  -->  00:01:05,270
Let's say, for some reason, we wanted to add a feature
19

19

00:01:05,270  -->  00:01:10,210
that allowed us to hover over any link that someone shared or tweeted,
20

20

00:01:10,210  -->  00:01:14,450
and see a pop-up of whatever that link was referencing.
21

21

00:01:14,450  -->  00:01:18,180
It's clunky, it's unnecessary, but hey, it's Twitter,
22

22

00:01:18,180  -->  00:01:21,000
it's not like they ever said no to a feature request.
23

23

00:01:21,000  -->  00:01:26,290
Ok, let's try to figure out a rough cost associated if we pursued this new feature.
24

24

00:01:26,290  -->  00:01:30,490
Let's start with development time, because there will have to be
25

25

00:01:30,490  -->  00:01:34,560
people programming this to make it actually happen.
26

26

00:01:34,560  -->  00:01:38,300
If you work in tech, this is frequently going to be one of the most
27

27

00:01:38,300  -->  00:01:40,940
relevant things you have to take into consideration.
28

28

00:01:40,940  -->  00:01:43,870
Now, you don't need to be a developer to calculate this,
29

29

00:01:43,870  -->  00:01:47,010
but you will have to do a little bit of outside research.
30

30

00:01:47,010  -->  00:01:51,100
You might have to talk to your developers, and if you're using a contractor,
31

31

00:01:51,100  -->  00:01:55,190
well, they're generally required to give you this information upfront anyway.
32

32

00:01:55,190  -->  00:01:57,250
Let's make up some fake details.
33

33

00:01:57,250  -->  00:02:02,190
Let's say our feature addition, which is massively scaled back in its first iteration,
34

34

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:05,760
will take two developers, two weeks to develop.
35

35

00:02:05,760  -->  00:02:09,900
Ok, so now we've established what the loss of time is going to be.
36

36

00:02:09,900  -->  00:02:13,100
These developers, let's say they make $100,000 a year,
37

37

00:02:13,100  -->  00:02:17,380
they probably make more, to be honest, but we'll say $100,000, make it simple.
38

38

00:02:17,380  -->  00:02:22,180
So that means roughly, rounded down to $8,000 a month,
39

39

00:02:22,180  -->  00:02:25,480
two weeks inside of a month, $4,000 for each of them.
40

40

00:02:25,480  -->  00:02:30,230
You're spending $8,000 to try this just in labor cost.
41

41

00:02:30,230  -->  00:02:33,620
It's also going to take your time and other people's time.
42

42

00:02:33,620  -->  00:02:40,230
So let's just, for giggles, assume it takes part time effort from you for two weeks as well.
43

43

00:02:40,230  -->  00:02:43,400
So let's add in another $2,000.
44

44

00:02:43,400  -->  00:02:47,010
You generally will get paid roughly the same as developers.
45

45

00:02:47,010  -->  00:02:55,210
That makes the grand total of labor time at $10,000 just to try out our pop-up.
46

46

00:02:55,210  -->  00:03:00,580
Now, let's say that you're going to buy some ads to announce the launch of this feature,
47

47

00:03:00,580  -->  00:03:07,860
and also to drag traffic to test it in its first version, so maybe add in an extra $3,000.
48

48

00:03:07,860  -->  00:03:11,760
That means our total cost could theoretically be $13,000,
49

49

00:03:11,760  -->  00:03:15,500
that is a finite number that we can now work with.
50

50

00:03:15,500  -->  00:03:20,170
Fantastic. Now we have a cost baseline, really helpful.
51

51

00:03:20,170  -->  00:03:22,670
Now, does this number have to be exact?
52

52

00:03:22,670  -->  00:03:26,410
Well, no, not necessarily, but you should be in a position
53

53

00:03:26,410  -->  00:03:31,100
to gather the information you need to make a decent estimate.
54

54

00:03:31,100  -->  00:03:34,760
If you're using too fuzzy of a math, that probably just means that you were lazy.
55

55

00:03:34,760  -->  00:03:39,780
At the same time, don't try to spend your entire 
life trying to calculate this down to the penny,
56

56

00:03:39,780  -->  00:03:43,790
because if it's worth it, it's going to obviously be worth it,
57

57

00:03:43,790  -->  00:03:47,230
it's not going to be something where you only make it worth it
58

58

00:03:47,230  -->  00:03:50,440
by $10 or $5, or some thin margin.
59

59

00:03:50,440  -->  00:03:56,250
Now that we know the theoretical cost, let's think what else could be built in that time,
60

60

00:03:56,250  -->  00:04:01,010
and that brings us to the other thing that it's going to cost us: opportunity cost.
61

61

00:04:01,010  -->  00:04:04,020
Opportunity cost, specifically in this case, is probably small,
62

62

00:04:04,020  -->  00:04:08,940
because, hey, it's not a huge feature, but that still is time
63

63

00:04:08,940  -->  00:04:14,790
those developers could have spent fixing bugs, or building something else,
64

64

00:04:14,790  -->  00:04:19,560
or even time spent collaborating on a newer, much larger feature.
65

65

00:04:19,560  -->  00:04:23,470
Regardless, we now have a cost baseline, and we've satisfied
66

66

00:04:23,470  -->  00:04:27,310
the requirements for the left side of our calculation.
67

67

00:04:27,310  -->  00:04:30,470
From the looks of it, depending on how large your organization is,
68

68

00:04:30,470  -->  00:04:36,600
this is probably not a huge risk, so we probably have some flexibility on the right side,
69

69

00:04:36,600  -->  00:04:39,050
when we start talking about what we need in return.
70

70

00:04:39,050  -->  00:04:42,850
Let's now try to think critically about what metric has to move
71

71

00:04:42,850  -->  00:04:46,660
what amount to justify the cost we've just established.
72

72

00:04:46,660  -->  00:04:52,700
Now, big risks need big rewards, and small risks are ok with small rewards,
73

73

00:04:52,700  -->  00:04:54,300
that's just generally how this works.
74

74

00:04:54,300  -->  00:04:59,670
So, if we're pulling two guys off the development team, and taking 50% of our time,
75

75

00:04:59,670  -->  00:05:03,410
plus some ad money, and the fact that we could be building something else,
76

76

00:05:03,410  -->  00:05:05,770
what's it going to take to make this worth it?
77

77

00:05:05,770  -->  00:05:09,150
This is generally just up to you and your team.
78

78

00:05:09,150  -->  00:05:12,980
You will know what's a big deal and what's not.
79

79

00:05:12,980  -->  00:05:15,990
Now, outside of that internal decision you guys make,
80

80

00:05:15,990  -->  00:05:23,360
the best way and the best practice for 
going about this is to settle on one specific metric.
81

81

00:05:23,360  -->  00:05:29,660
Two metrics becomes too confusing, and it makes 
it hard to really verify success, so just pick one.
82

82

00:05:29,660  -->  00:05:34,510
Second, try to think past these metrics and what exactly they mean.
83

83

00:05:34,510  -->  00:05:38,680
If you have an app that makes money off ads, let's say, well, then,
84

84

00:05:38,680  -->  00:05:44,470
increasing the time the user stays on your site will increase revenue, that's important.
85

85

00:05:44,470  -->  00:05:48,680
If you're a startup and you increase user growth by 15%,
86

86

00:05:48,680  -->  00:05:52,720
could that then affect your ability to raise money?
87

87

00:05:52,720  -->  00:05:56,890
Think through what your organization needs as a whole,
88

88

00:05:56,890  -->  00:06:01,020
and if you can't think of anything with regards to business requirements,
89

89

00:06:01,020  -->  00:06:03,530
well, that's a great sign that you're out of touch
90

90

00:06:03,530  -->  00:06:06,870
and you probably need a refresher on your company's vision.
91

91

00:06:06,870  -->  00:06:10,780
Let's try some scenarios for the reward side of our calculation.
92

92

00:06:10,780  -->  00:06:15,750
Maybe we calculate a money effect, a direct effect on revenue.
93

93

00:06:15,750  -->  00:06:19,380
Let's say we're thinking that the addition of this feature, although limited,
94

94

00:06:19,380  -->  00:06:23,650
will, in our test group, raise conversion to a paid program,
95

95

00:06:23,650  -->  00:06:27,560
let's say it's from free program to paid, by some amount.
96

96

00:06:27,560  -->  00:06:32,160
That's easy, because then we just have to figure out what is more worth it,
97

97

00:06:32,160  -->  00:06:37,680
$13,000 or that increase which then gives us more money?
98

98

00:06:37,680  -->  00:06:38,670
Which number is larger?
99

99

00:06:38,670  -->  00:06:42,560
Or maybe you can say, well, we have a year-long goal of
100

100

00:06:42,560  -->  00:06:46,340
raising our average minutes consumed by 40%.
101

101

00:06:46,340  -->  00:06:50,300
To keep us on that 40% path, we need to see an improvement
102

102

00:06:50,300  -->  00:06:55,580
in at least 4% since that's roughly the equivalent of a month,
103

103

00:06:55,580  -->  00:07:00,940
and it's going to take us a month worth of time labor-wise to develop this.
104

104

00:07:00,940  -->  00:07:05,650
Now, I said a month because opportunity cost, 
right, it's two weeks working on this feature,
105

105

00:07:05,650  -->  00:07:09,490
but if it doesn't work out, you could have spent two weeks on a different one,
106

106

00:07:09,490  -->  00:07:12,370
so it's kind of a double jeopardy situation.
107

107

00:07:12,370  -->  00:07:16,110
The point is, try to align this to some bigger goal if you can.
108

108

00:07:16,110  -->  00:07:19,730
Now, guys, be aware, this is napkin math.
109

109

00:07:19,730  -->  00:07:23,110
When you're a product manager, you're not always going to have
110

110

00:07:23,110  -->  00:07:27,200
the actual numbers available most times when you do this.
111

111

00:07:27,200  -->  00:07:30,920
Sometimes you're going to be adding numbers to potatoes,
112

112

00:07:30,920  -->  00:07:35,400
and then squaring them by smiles, and then dividing them by green.
113

113

00:07:35,400  -->  00:07:39,000
It can often times be more abstraction than accounting.
114

114

00:07:39,000  -->  00:07:42,600
At the end of this calculation, you should know what metric you want to improve,
115

115

00:07:42,600  -->  00:07:46,710
how big of a cost is it going to take, and then, in your head,
116

116

00:07:46,710  -->  00:07:52,140
make a basic tit for tat statement that says, "If it's going to cost X,
117

117

00:07:52,140  -->  00:07:57,760
we need to see Y improvement, or Y metrics to justify
118

118

00:07:57,760  -->  00:08:00,320
giving the thumbs up and going ahead with this."
119

119

00:08:00,320  -->  00:08:06,290
All right, so you now know how to think about 
and put together a minimum criteria for success.
120

120

00:08:06,290  -->  00:08:12,250
The next lecture, we're going to talk specifically 
about pre-product scenarios and startups,
121

121

00:08:12,250  -->  00:08:17,400
how do you do it if you don't already have internal established metrics.
122

122

00:08:17,400  -->  00:08:18,340
See you then!
