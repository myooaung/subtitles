Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,590
I hope you didn't run out of gas in this section,
because knowing how to design and put together an
2

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,380
effective MVP experiment is going to be crucial to being
a successful product manager. As a product manager,
3

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,410
effective MVP experiment is going to be crucial to being
a successful product manager. As a product manager,
4

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,660
you're going to hear the term MVP, and you're going to
be expected to follow roughly the same process
5

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,750
that we followed in the section. Coming up with an idea,
designing an experiment, setting up your expectations,
6

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:37,170
and then running a test is how product managers
decide what to add and what to go forward with.
7

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,270
It's your flashlight in the dark, so to speak.
When you run your experiment and gather your data,
8

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,600
you're going to then take what you have and
compare it to your minimum criteria for success.
9

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,930
If it passes your bar, woo! Congratulations.
10

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,470
If it passes your bar, woo! Congratulations.
11

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,760
If it doesn't, then you need to see
if you can figure out why it didn't work.
12

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,270
Regardless of whether it worked or didn't work,
13

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,390
this is the time to sit down and evaluate what you need to do next.
14

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,850
One thing that has to be understood by any entrepreneur
or product manager is that MVP experiments will
15

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,710
primarily return quantitative data. Quantitative data,
16

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,510
if you're not familiar with the term, is kind of the opposite of
what we were doing when we were interviewing
17

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:25,590
customers and doing customer development. Quantitative data is going to be data that has numbers, numbers that indicate behavior.
18

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,040
customers and doing customer development. Quantitative data is going to be data that has numbers, numbers that indicate behavior.
19

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,570
Maybe percentages of users that did this,
20

21
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,410
how much time someone spent on your page, total sign ups, etc.
21

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,430
When we were interviewing customers, we were getting
what's called qualitative information. Qualitative
22

23
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,230
information and qualitative data cannot be
expressed in numbers, because it's verbal.
23

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,910
It's not a scale from 1 to 10.
24

25
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,230
It's a measurement of feeling strongly
about something or "Who is this user?"
25

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,940
And here is a crucial lesson you have to learn.
If you want to make the right call,
26

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,580
you need to make sure you're collecting both types of data.
27

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,440
Numbers will tell you what happened and will give you
unbiased records of what your users did or did not do,
28

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,210
Numbers will tell you what happened and will give you
unbiased records of what your users did or did not do,
29

30
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:18,120
but you can't and will not know why they did what they did
without also speaking to them. The "what" without
30

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,470
the "why" can be incredibly misleading.
31

32
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,370
Let's say, in a hypothetical, we created a landing page
experiment that targeted hardcore marathon runners
32

33
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,470
that displayed a brand new shoe that
was designed for running long distances.
33

34
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,310
When you put it out there into the world and
drove traffic to it, you see that, you know, 14% of users
34

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,130
signed up to be notified of when it gets released.
35

36
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,630
In fact, some of them, on a separate page,
actually paid for pre-orders.
36

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,920
Both those cases, you decide those are great numbers,
and you give the project a green light.
37

38
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,550
You build out the shoe and you build out an
advertising campaign to market it for the first time.
38

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,640
Let's say that you advertise in a marathon running forum,
and of all the people that clicked your page,
39

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:02:59,990
Let's say that you advertise in a marathon running forum,
and of all the people that clicked your page,
40

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,310
only 1% ended up buying the shoe. What exactly happened?
41

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,650
Now, you might think this is an exaggerated case,
but it actually happens all the time. Because you've
42

43
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,630
never collected qualitative data on those
14% of users that signed up,
43

44
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,870
you never found out that the users that signed up
weren't actually marathon runners at all.
44

45
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,870
They were casual runners and they bought it because,
hey, they liked the design of the shoe.
45

46
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,740
So, as a product manager, if you want your MVP experiment
to bear fruitful results you can make sense of,
46

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,290
So, as a product manager, if you want your MVP experiment
to bear fruitful results you can make sense of,
47

48
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,990
make sure you incorporate regular conversations
with your users that are involved in your test.
48

49
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,030
Incentivize them to talk on the phone,
49

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,780
install live chat boxes - you know now how to get this done,
50

51
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,920
because we have a section on customer development.
51

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,250
This is primarily a discovery process, and throughout your experiments, you're going to find out things that will surprise you.

53

54
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,900
Maybe your feature ended up being popular, but not at all
by the people you thought would originally like it.
54

55
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,050
Maybe your feature ended up being popular, but not at all
by the people you thought would originally like it.
55

56
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:08,070
Or maybe your user behavior didn't change the ideal metric,
but it did change an entirely different metric.
56

57
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,140
Or maybe your user behavior didn't change the ideal metric,
but it did change an entirely different metric.
57

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,290
All of this is gold to you, because you're finding out the truth about your customer's needs and your customer's preferences.
58

59
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,060

59

60
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,670
At the end of this process, though, you need to make a call.
Do you make the feature and give it the green light?
60

61
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,110

Do you make the feature and give it the green light?
61

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,390
Do you scrap the whole idea and forget
that you ever thought about it?
62

63
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,950
Or do you think you should re-run the test,
but on a slightly different hypothesis?
63

64
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,560
These are the decisions you have to make as a product manager.
64

65
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:40,080
But now you know how to run MVP tests, which are the
primary way you're going to get the information you
65

66
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,590
need to guide you in making those decisions.
66

67
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,880
All right guys, congratulations on finishing the MVP section.
If you guys want to get more on
67

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,370
MVPs, we have my MVP course that's attached to this.
68

69
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,660
There's a coupon in, like, lecture 4, I think.
69

70
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,210
Go back, check that out.
70

71
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,640
Go back, check that out.
71

72
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:08,220
The MVP course that I teach is a lot longer and it's a lot
more in depth. It's focused more on entrepreneurs,
72

73
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,250

73

74
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,960
but you can still learn a lot about things that
can apply to basic product management.
74

75
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,910
Like always, guys, questions, concerns, post in the Q&A.
75

76
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,440
Otherwise, see you in the next section.
