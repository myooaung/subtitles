Hey there, good to see you again.
1

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,050
Let's get into the details and how to communicate
with different types of people,
2

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,430
and we'll start first with engineers.
3

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,030
So, engineers are lovers of detail. When talking to them,
emailing them, or anything else,
4

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,550
be very detailed about that thing you're describing.
5

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,630
This is because engineers are always thinking about software
and how what you're saying may or may not
6

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,670
work in a technical sense.
7

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,760
The clearer you are here, the better.
8

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,510
I can't tell you how many times early in my career
I was not detailed enough in my talks with engineers
9

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,610
or while sending them feature specifications.
In order to develop efficiently,
10

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,080
they need to know things that other people don't.
11

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,320
Things like, what happens when the screen
is displayed in other language?
12

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,420
What does the error state read when
something goes wrong on this page?
13

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,310
What happens when there is no data to see on this page?
14

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,490
This is often referred to as an empty state.
15

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,630
As time goes on, you'll get better at predicting what
types of information the engineers need from you.
16

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:54,760
As time goes on, you'll get better at predicting what
types of information the engineers need from you.
17

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,700
So, now I'm going to list off some miscellaneous tips
for working with engineers as a product manager.
18

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:00:59,840
So, now I'm going to list off some miscellaneous tips
for working with engineers as a product manager.
19

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,510
Number one: if something goes wrong, it's your fault.
20

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,720
This is not just being nice, this is the truth.
21

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,020
This is not just being nice, this is the truth.
22

23
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,760
You're responsible for the success of the product.
23

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,940
If something goes wrong, or an engineer develops something
incorrectly, because you gave them the wrong
24

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,300
specs, that is your fault, not theirs.
25

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,660
Number two: when you're pitching a feature, be prepared
and have a really good idea of where the feature's
26

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,040
going to go in the future.
27

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,220
When we do Agile development, we think of a feature,
and we think about how it's going to look down the
28

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,830
road in an ideal state, but also what the minimum
viable product will be. Telling developers where you
29

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,180
think something's going to go down the road is going
to help them plan out how we're going to do this
30

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,130
technically in the future, and that matters a lot.
31

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,560
technically in the future, and that matters a lot.
32

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,770
Number three: when possible, you should do the work upfront
on things like checking commit logs, or looking
33

34
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,590
up data before you ask engineers to do it.
34

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,080
Trying yourself before you ask for someone else's time
is a big sign of respect,
35

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,750
and developers like to know that they aren't
the only ones doing the work.
36

37
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,800
This will also score you major points.
37

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,850
Number four: watch out for tech debt.
38

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,280
So what is tech debt?
39

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,800
It's a term we use to describe something in the code
or technology which is going to have to be dealt
40

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,570
with later as the result of not doing
something correctly the first time.
41

42
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,900
Let me give you an example here.
42

43
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,750
If we're building a new feature that requires a database,
maybe we learned that one way to save time
43

44
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,570
is to utilize a database that already exists.
44

45
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,060
However, if the feature becomes very popular and it needs
more space, then eventually it needs its own database.
45

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,440
However, if the feature becomes very popular and it needs
more space, then eventually it needs its own database.
46

47
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,260
This impending work is what we call tech debt.
47

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,160
We're going to have to do it at some point.
48

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,280
Engineers hate tech debt, because
they're the ones that have to deal with it.
49

50
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,110
Be cognizant of this and trust their judgment
on the right way to do things first.
50

51
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,220
You'll maybe find that a lot of them want to do something
scaled out the first time to make sure we
51

52
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,020
don't have to come back and deal with it later, which
will stop us from developing features at that point.
52

53
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,140
don't have to come back and deal with it later, which
will stop us from developing features at that point.
53

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,250
Lastly, this is a big one.
54

55
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,080
Do not treat engineers like an agency.
55

56
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,210
What I mean by this is don't design and come up with
all of the concepts yourself, or with your designer,
56

57
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,470
and then just hand the completed requirements
to the engineers to code.
57

58
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,920
Always give engineers an opportunity to provide you
with feedback and product ideas. Just because they
58

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,930
spend their days coding, doesn't mean that they don't have
any good ideas or opinions of their own on the product.
59

60
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,710
spend their days coding, doesn't mean that they don't have
any good ideas or opinions of their own on the product.
60

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,230
The way I give them the opportunity to provide feedback
is actively involving them with day to day discussion,
61

62
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,420
but also, during our planning meetings,
62

63
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,240
I make it a point to have a part where we tell the engineers
what we think is coming up next and we
63

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,860
give them the opportunity to tell us what they think
about that from the product perspective, not even
64

65
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,870
the engineering perspective, but
"Is this a good idea? Would users use this?"
65

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,460
the engineering perspective, but
"Is this a good idea? Would users use this?"
66

67
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,790
the engineering perspective, but
"Is this a good idea? Would users use this?"
67

68
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,840
It's very important that you bring them in on these discussions.
68

69
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,890
That is one of the best tips I can give you
for working with engineers,
69

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,940
very important, and engineers will respect you a lot more.
70

71
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,370
very important, and engineers will respect you a lot more.
71

72
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,240
All right, so now you've got a good handle on how to
interact and communicate with engineers.
72

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,240
Let's go into the next lecture and talk a little bit about designers. See you there.
