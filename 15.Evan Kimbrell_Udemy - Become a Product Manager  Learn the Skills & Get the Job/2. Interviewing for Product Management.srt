2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,540
Alright, so you've got your resume optimized,
2

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,050
you've got your online brand perfected, and
you're going to interview with a company.
3

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,500
Congrats on getting that first interview! In this lecture,
4

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,740
we're going to talk about some tips to help you
get through the product management interview.
5

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,250
These interviews are tough and that's
because it's not all cut and dry.
6

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,860
You've got to demonstrate some skills, usually
on a whiteboard, or talking through problems.
7

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,350
You've got to demonstrate some skills, usually
on a whiteboard, or talking through problems.
8

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,300
So what I'm going to do is give you three big tips
on how to nail these interviews.
9

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,860
The first two, we're going to talk about here,
10

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,480
and then the most important one has
its own lecture coming up next.
11

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,700
and then the most important one has
its own lecture coming up next.
12

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,430
All right.
13

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,530
Tip number one: use every interview
to make the next one even better.
14

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,990
Each interview you do is going to help you
a lot in making the next interview even better.
15

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,710
Whether it's another interview at the same company
or an interview at a different company, you should
16

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,480
pay very close attention to the questions they
ask you for that product management role,
17

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,590
then think about whether or not you were able
to get a good answer to them or not.
18

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,890
For every question,
19

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,230
take mental notes, or even physical notes, if they let you.
20

21
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,540
When you go home, start researching those things immediately.
If you didn't understand something, you didn't 
21

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,470
have a good answer, go look it up.
22

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,530
have a good answer, go look it up.
23

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,740
So if you make it to the next round of interviews for that company,
then you have more relevant knowledge to discuss.
24

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,240
So if you make it to the next round of interviews for that company,
then you have more relevant knowledge to discuss.
25

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,960
Even if you don't get that job and you are going to
an interview at another company, this is going to
26

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,070
be super helpful for prepping you for these
types of questions in the future.
27

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,710
You've got to be optimistic here.
28

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,530
These are tough interviews, but each failure is
an increased chance at the next opportunities.
29

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,850
That's how you should look at it.
30

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,940
Tip number two: ask good questions.
31

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,670
The more research you do before the interview about the
company, and the industry, and the product, the better.
32

33
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,600
The more research you do before the interview about the
company, and the industry, and the product, the better.
33

34
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,310
You can't do enough, to be honest.
34

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,380
Most interviewers will give you a chance to ask
them questions at the end of the interview.
35

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,070
Most interviewers will give you a chance to ask
them questions at the end of the interview.
36

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,230
So you should have some really good questions in mind.
Before you go into your first interview,
37

38
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,930
do that research on those latest initiatives, and industry
trends, and even what their competitors are doing,
38

39
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,740
do that research on those latest initiatives, and industry
trends, and even what their competitors are doing,
39

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,150
what rounds of funding other people have
raised that are in the same industry,
40

41
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,040
what rounds of funding other people have
raised that are in the same industry,
41

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,740
use this information to ask them thoughtful questions.
I'll give you an example here.
42

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,020
Let's say I'm interviewing for a product management
position at a messaging app, and they compete with
43

44
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,430
WhatsApp, which is a really popular
messaging app owned by Facebook.
44

45
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,790
I'd probably ask them questions about how they try
to differentiate themselves in the market and then
45

46
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,360
what they think the biggest obstacles for them are in the next year.
46

47
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,930
If WhatsApp releases a feature in, you know, a month
before you do that interview or anytime in the
47

48
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,760
last six months, you need to say "Hey, what are your
thoughts on that latest feature? Are you guys going
48

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,040
to try to compete with that or what?"
49

50
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,610
And this really just shows that you're interested in their product,
50

51
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,430
you understand what's going on in this industry,
and I guarantee that if you ask good questions like
51

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,100
this, you're going to stand out from the rest of the candidates.
52

53
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,860
All right, let's recap here. Use every interview as
an opportunity to make the next one better.
53

54
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,120
Don't cheap out on this. You've got to do it.
54

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,040
Don't cheap out on this. You've got to do it.
55

56
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,650
And then two, ask insightful questions at the end of your
interview that are relevant to the product management
56

57
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,020
role, the industry, and the product.
57

58
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,940
If you use these tips, your interview is going to be really
good, and you will be way ahead of the competition.
58

59
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,070
If you use these tips, your interview is going to be really
good, and you will be way ahead of the competition.
59

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,830
You're going to be even better off if you watch
the next lecture, because it's a really good tip.
