Hey everyone.
1

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.480
So, just so you can see a true, real life example,
2

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.850
here is an actual user persona that we use at SoundCloud.
3

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.430
Her name is Becky and she's a mainstream music listener.
So you can see that we have her name,
4

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.930
we have a little bit about her, like what type of phone
she uses and what type of music listening habits she has,
5

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.920
we have a little bit about her, like what type of phone
she uses and what type of music listening habits she has,
6

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.520
and then we have some preferences on how much she likes technology, or what type of listening she really likes to do.
7

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.310
and then we have some preferences on how much she likes technology, or what type of listening she really likes to do.
8

9
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.980
So if we were doing this with our eBay example,
we would do something like this, but we would focus it
9

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.390
on selling things on eBay rather than listening to music.
10

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.750
For instance, we may want to make a persona for
users that find cool stuff at local garage sales and
11

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.200
sell those items on eBay for a living.
12

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.180
We could call this user persona Jessica, maybe,
and say that Jessica is typically between the ages of
13

14
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.990
20 and 50, loves antique shopping and garage sales,
and relies on eBay to make a living.
14

15
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.100
The most important thing to her could be that she is
able to quickly list multiple items that she found
15

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.820
at antique shows on eBay, and then manage all of those
multiple listings at once easily from her computer.
16

17
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.860
at antique shows on eBay, and then manage all of those
multiple listings at once easily from her computer.
17

18
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820
So that's an overview of user personas.
18

19
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.770
And, like I mentioned, UX designers are going to be the people that are making these most of the time in your company,
19

20
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.500
And, like I mentioned, UX designers are going to be the people that are making these most of the time in your company,
20

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.800
but you need to be very aware of these people
as a product manager.
21

22
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.060
When you make your user personas, make sure they have
a name, a sketch or a photo, and a description about
22

23
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.480
what is most important to them about your product, what they want to be able to do easily, and anything else you think is useful.
23

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.740
what is most important to them about your product, what they want to be able to do easily, and anything else you think is useful.
24

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.050
So, if you want, take a moment and make a few simple user personas yourself and share the personas with
25

26
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.990
the rest of the students in the course form below.
26

27
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.190
All right, that's it for this one.
27

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.920
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
