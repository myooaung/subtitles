Hey there.
1

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,420
So we learned already about how to communicate
with engineers and designers.
2

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,210
But how about the rest of the groups, like, let's say,
executives, sales, legal, and marketing?
3

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,460
Well, let's talk about executives first, and then we'll do a few tips on communicating with the other types of stakeholders.

Well, let's talk about executives first, and then we'll do a few tips on communicating with the other types of stakeholders.
5

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,300
In my early days of being a product manager,
I always struggled communicating with executives.
6

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,320
It was really tough.
7

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,090
I would send them really big emails with tons of detail,
and they would almost never get back to me.
8

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,210
Later, I found out that the secret to communicating
with executives is being brief.
9

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,910
Executives are the busiest people at the company, so sending them compact but meaningful messages shows
10

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,770
that you value their time.
11

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,740
So, instead of writing two paragraphs, write two bullet points.
"But, Cole," you'll say, "I won't be able to
12

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,270
give them enough information in two bullet points."
13

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,340
That's right.
14

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,990
And they don't need all the information in one e-mail.
If they want more data or information from you,
15

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,100
And they don't need all the information in one e-mail.
If they want more data or information from you,
16

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,930
they know who to ask: you.
17

18
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,510
Secondly, when talking to executives and other roles,
like sales, always speak in terms of business effect.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:06,740
Secondly, when talking to executives and other roles,
like sales, always speak in terms of business effect.
19

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,550
By this I mean don't tell them that the user will be able
to do a certain thing in your product more
20

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,820
frequently, but tell them about what it means.
21

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,140
Does it mean more or less revenue?
22

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,030
Does it mean a change in a specific company metric?
23

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,590
If so, tell them that.
24

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,910
Thirdly, communicate in a style that they like best.
25

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:33,000
Some executives don't like email as it consumes so much time for them and maybe even their assistant reads it for them.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,180
Some executives don't like email as it consumes so much time for them and maybe even their assistant reads it for them.
27

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,600
In this case, a better approach might be to give them
a really quick update in the hallway, or at lunch,
28

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,690
or at your next meeting.
29

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,740
Okay, so here's another couple of tips for not only executives,
but all sorts of stakeholders in general.

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:46,920
Okay, so here's another couple of tips for not only executives,
but all sorts of stakeholders in general.
31

32
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,900
Number one: it pays off to talk to people on each team
as much as possible. Whenever you get a chance,
32

33
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,370
Number one: it pays off to talk to people on each team
as much as possible. Whenever you get a chance,
33

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,150
hold a meeting, take them to lunch, or just find an
excuse to talk to people from different teams,
34

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:07,890
like marketing or sales. Number two: ensure that other
teams and people understand that you know the user
35

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,220
base, the technology, and the business very well.
36

37
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,620
This makes them much more confident about
the decisions you're making in the product.
37

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,370
Number three: update them on the latest developments
as frequently as possible,
38

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,920
Number three: update them on the latest developments
as frequently as possible,
39

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,280
but make it clear whether or not they should be
replying or if you just meant to send them an update.
40

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,650
but make it clear whether or not they should be
replying or if you just meant to send them an update.
41

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,190
One really good way to do this is, if you have an
internal company blog or wiki, you can just post things
42

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,120
there and they can read it if they want to.
43

44
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,560
But the important thing here is to be communicating frequently.
44

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,870
Number four: whenever you're updating outside stakeholders
on progress or the completion of a feature,
45

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,080
Number four: whenever you're updating outside stakeholders
on progress or the completion of a feature,
46

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,350
be sure to tell them about the reason the solution is the way it is.
47

48
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,680
be sure to tell them about the reason the solution is the way it is.
48

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,000
Tell them a story about the other options you considered
and why maybe those ones did not turn out to be ideal.
49

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,890
Tell them a story about the other options you considered
and why maybe those ones did not turn out to be ideal.
50

51
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,230
So tell them that story about how you got to the product
or solution that ended up being the one that
51

52
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,330
you built. Alright everyone, with those tips,
52

53
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,070
you are really well armed to communicate
effectively with a broad range of stakeholders.
53

54
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,120
This puts you way ahead in the game.
54

55
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,680
So be sure to keep this section in mind and
frequently come back if you need to.
55

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,450
It's going to take a little bit of time to get this, like,
really ingrained in your head, but you'll learn over time.
56

57
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,100
It's going to take a little bit of time to get this, like,
really ingrained in your head, but you'll learn over time.
57

58
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,020
I will see you all in the next lecture.
