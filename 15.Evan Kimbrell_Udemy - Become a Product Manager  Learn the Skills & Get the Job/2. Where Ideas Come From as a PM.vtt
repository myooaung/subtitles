00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.900
What's up, everybody? In this lecture we're going to talk about where ideas come from as a product manager
1

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.010
So as a Product Manager your entire job revolves around deciding what you need to do next.
2

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.410
So as a Product Manager your entire job revolves around deciding what you need to do next.
3

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.100
This requires a list of possible features to build and also a method of deciding which of those is the
4

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.080
most important.
5

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.280
Now, later on in the course we're going to talk about prioritization features and epics, which you'll learn about,
6

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.660
Now, later on in the course we're going to talk about prioritization features and epics, which you'll learn about,
7

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.820
but for now we're just going to need to focus on getting that list of features in the first place.
8

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.520
So where do ideas come from?
9

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.240
Where is the top of the funnel for the product manager in terms of what you might build in the future?
10

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.320
Well, I want to start by saying that any company you work for as a product manager is going to have a
11

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.830
Well, I want to start by saying that any company you work for as a product manager is going to have a
12

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.590
long list of requests and feature ideas that need to be developed.
13

14
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.200
If this is not the case then you should feel really lucky.
14

15
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
Even if you do have a really big list of stuff that needs to be built, there's always going to be instances
15

16
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.830
where new ideas come in and take precedence over existing ones based on things like user feedback volume,
16

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.300
what the competition is doing, etc.
17

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.620
All right.
18

19
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.480
So let's go ahead and assume you're a product manager at a new company and there's already a few things
19

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.640
your company says you need to build with your team,
but you also want to make sure there's plenty of
20

21
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.590
other ideas in the backlog to think about and develop after that.
21

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.860
Where do you get these ideas?
22

23
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.190
Despite popular belief, the product management job is not about being the idea guy or idea girl.
23

24
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.580
Ideas and requests come from everywhere and you need to collect and organize them as a Product Manager.
24

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.540
Feature ideas and requests usually come from four main places that we can easily remember using an acronym
25

26
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.550
that is EMUC.
26

27
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.550
So let's go through each one of those.
27

28
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.660
Let's start with E - employees.
28

29
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.770
This is just ideas coming in from your coworkers,
management, and you yourself.
29

30
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.900
The second one is M and it stands for metrics.
30

31
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.180
This is just problems and inefficiencies you find when you're looking into how users use your product.
31

32
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.330
This is just problems and inefficiencies you find when you're looking into how users use your product.
32

33
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.830
For example, I may be looking at some data on how users navigate through an app and I might notice that
33

34
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.300
a lot of people just spend one second on a particular area and immediately go somewhere else.
34

35
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.880
Well, that might give me the idea that this is an unclear section of the app and we need to do some
35

36
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.170
sort of redesign or at least go figure out
what's going on and then try to fix it.
36

37
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.520
All right, so now let's move on to U which is users.
37

38
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.800
This is user feedback from forums or emails to your company or yourself and social media. It's just everyone
38

39
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.830
out there that uses your product.
39

40
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.430
So last one is C - clients, and this is a special case that applies primarily to product managers that
40

41
00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.750
are business to business, because it's not always the case that a user is the same as a client, a client
41

42
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.180
meaning the person that paid for the product.
42

43
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.490
So depending on what type of product manager you are,
43

44
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.530
the importance and volume of requests may change.
44

45
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.760
Do you remember the three types of product management roles?
45

46
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.140
Consumer product manager, internal tools product manager, and business to business product manager.
46

47
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.760
Consumer product manager, internal tools product manager, and business to business product manager.
47

48
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.410
Let's do three examples really quickly of the PM types and where the ideas might come from.
48

49
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.230
So if you're an internal product manager, most of the ideas are probably going to be coming from your
49

50
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.520
primary stakeholders, which are your coworkers
and employees that you work with.
50

51
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.760
If you're a business to consumer product manager, most requests are probably going to come from users but
51

52
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.380
you should also look for problems and metrics and listen to new ideas from fellow coworkers, especially management.
52

53
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.120
you should also look for problems and metrics and listen to new ideas from fellow coworkers, especially management.
53

54
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.380
Now, if you're a business to business product manager, it means you're working on a product that is being sold to other companies.
54

55
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.320
Now, if you're a business to business product manager, it means you're working on a product that is being sold to other companies.
55

56
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.110
In this case, requests and ideas for features are going to come primarily from employees and clients.
56

57
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.250
In this case, requests and ideas for features are going to come primarily from employees and clients.
57

58
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.250
Like I said, a user is not always the same as a customer or a client
58

59
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.760
if you're a business to business product manager,
but we will talk a little bit more about that later.
59

60
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.970
if you're a business to business product manager,
but we will talk a little bit more about that later.
60

61
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.690
All right, let's sum it up really quick.
61

62
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.360
You're going to have ideas and feedback coming in from all sorts of places, depending on the type of product manager you are.
62

63
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.700
You're going to have ideas and feedback coming in from all sorts of places, depending on the type of product manager you are.
63

64
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.230
Some of the volume of feedback is going to be different from those different groups, but you can remember
64

65
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:30.600
these groups by the acronym EMUC (employees, metrics, users, and clients or customers). Alright everyone, I will see
65

66
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.680
you in the next lecture.
