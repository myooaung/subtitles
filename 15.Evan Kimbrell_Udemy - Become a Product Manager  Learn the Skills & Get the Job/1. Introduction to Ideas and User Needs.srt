What's up, everybody?
1

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,530
Everything in life has to start somewhere.
2

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,180
No, I'm not going to lecture you on philosophy or something like that, but when you're a product manager,
3

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,570
products also start somewhere, and that means that features and new functionality, it all comes from someplace,
4

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:16,670
products also start somewhere, and that means that features and new functionality, it all comes from someplace,
5

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,850
Everything that you see or use in your life, any product, at one point it was either an idea in someone's
6

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,330
head or it was a need, like a requirement. Someone said,
"Hey, I need this team to build this for me."
7

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,000
And then they built it.
8

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,700
So there's this theory out there that product managers and executives, they all get in a room and they're
9

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,720
the idea people they just sit there and come up with these fantastic ideas, and then the developers and
10

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,950
designers, you know, make it look pretty,
and build it, and then the executives get rich.
11

12
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,220
Now, that's actually so far from the truth,
I don't even want to go there.
12

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,920
Now, that's actually so far from the truth,
I don't even want to go there.
13

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,830
Your job as a product manager is not to be the idea person.
14

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,330
We're going to talk about that a little bit, but it's really just about getting this huge influx of ideas
15

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,390
and requirements from all over the place.
16

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,560
Requirements are other people coming up to you and saying,
"Hey, I need you to build this."
17

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,660
Maybe a sales team or a marketing team,
"Hey, we need this functionality," that sort of thing.
18

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:18,900
So you have all of this stuff,
19

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,190
So you have all of this stuff,
20

21
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,630
and your job is really just to say, of all of these things,
21

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,890
which ones are good ideas, which ones are bad,
22

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:37,020
why are they good ideas, and when is the best time to do them, given all of the other stuff that's going
23

24
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,780
on at the time in the company with technology and in the industry.
24

25
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,750
Anyways, that's what this section is all about.
25

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:53,460
So get ready to take a dive into the land of ideas, and user needs, and false user needs, and users thinking
26

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,200
they need this thing when they actually need this thing.
27

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,280
Anyways, I'm getting ahead of myself but this is all coming up,
28

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,730
so I will see you in there.
