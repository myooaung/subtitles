00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.600
So, welcome back,
1

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.760
and last lecture we talked about just a basic intro to metrics,
so what metrics are, they're just a way to measure stuff.
2

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.310
and last lecture we talked about just a basic intro to metrics,
so what metrics are, they're just a way to measure stuff.
3

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.570
It's a number that is a measurement that tells you something
about your product, and it's a huge integral
4

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.990
part of product management, because it's the way that we are basically knowing if we're doing things right or not.
5

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.520
part of product management, because it's the way that we are basically knowing if we're doing things right or not.
6

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.780
So, in this lecture, we're going to chat a little bit
about some real world examples,
7

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.120
and it's basically just going to be me talking about a couple
of companies and some of the metrics that
8

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.880
they track, and then afterwards we'll talk about
a couple of similarities between these companies.
9

10
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.120
So, the first example is Twitter, and they have some
growth metrics that a few other companies do as well,
10

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.410
which are total new users per month, or per week,
or however, they can slice it up however they want,
11

12
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.770
which are total new users per month, or per week,
or however, they can slice it up however they want,
12

13
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.470
then you have monthly active users, probably also daily active users, and then probably activated users as well per month.
13

14
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.300
then you have monthly active users, probably also daily active users, and then probably activated users as well per month.
14

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.640
And we'll talk a little bit more about that
a little bit later in this section.
15

16
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.730
So then they have some engagement metrics as well,
things like the multiple log ins per day, probably
16

17
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.700
time spent looking at Twitter, either the app or the web site,
then they have things like number of tweets
17

18
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.470
sent, and then, per user, you know, on average, and then
they have probably the average number of likes and
18

19
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.810
the average number of retweets, and then
probably also the average number of follows,
19

20
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.500
so they have a good idea of the social activity going on,
and then they would also have probably the
20

21
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.410
number of messages sent, the private messages in their
direct messaging portion of the site and the app.
21

22
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.560
number of messages sent, the private messages in their
direct messaging portion of the site and the app.
22

23
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.700
So, the second example would be YouTube, and YouTube,
in many other companies you're going to have the same
23

24
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.010
type of growth metrics that we already talked about with Twitter.
24

25
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.380
So you have your monthly active users,
25

26
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.210
you've got your new users, your activated users, your daily active users, but where a lot of tech companies
26

27
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.810
end up differing is their engagement metrics.
27

28
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.960
And, again, we're going to talk about the difference
between growth and engagement in another lecture.
28

29
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.210
But, for now, just understand that most companies will
have similar metrics and then they'll have some that
29

30
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.820
are completely different from any other company.
30

31
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.950
So, on the YouTube example, they probably
have stuff that Twitter doesn't, like video views,
31

32
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.090
first of all, per user, like how many videos did each user watch on average, and then they would have some criteria inside of that,
32

33
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.590
first of all, per user, like how many videos did each user watch on average, and then they would have some criteria inside of that,
33

34
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.190
like, "Okay, they must have watched at least 30
seconds of a video in order to call it a view."
34

35
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.310
And that's an indicator of quality or a conservative
indicator for them, basically letting them know
35

36
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.730
that this person is actually watching this video.
36

37
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:03.130
Secondly, for YouTube, they will probably have
an average viewing time overall per user.
37

38
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.870
So, you could have someone that watched 20 videos,
but if each one of those videos was one and a half
38

39
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.160
minutes long, that's not as valuable as having someone
that watched one video which was three hours long,
39

40
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.870
like a documentary or something.
40

41
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.450
And notice that these are specific to YouTube.
41

42
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.880
Okay, so then we have our third example, which is the favorite example, Facebook, and Facebook's got some really
42

43
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.520
Okay, so then we have our third example, which is the favorite example, Facebook, and Facebook's got some really
43

44
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.860
interesting engagement metrics. Again, on the other metrics,
the growth ones, they're going to have the
44

45
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.960
same sort of stuff that most people do,
45

46
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.710
most companies, like, you know, new users, and monthly actives, and so on, but engagement-wise, they have some 
46

47
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.080
pretty interesting ones.
47

48
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.370
I've seen some stuff online that talks about them
having metrics like position clicks on the news
48

49
00:03:50.370 --> 00:04:00.030
feed, and that basically means they are tracking which position on average did a person engage with in their news feed.
49

50
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.750
feed, and that basically means they are tracking which position on average did a person engage with in their news feed.
50

51
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.520
So let's say you have, you open the Facebook app and
you have, like, something at the top of your news
51

52
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.680
feed from one of your friends, and you have, you know,
10 other things under that, and you engage, or you
52

53
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.010
click on, or you like, or you comment on
the one that's like the fifth position down.
53

54
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.110
Well, they actually think that's bad.
54

55
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.740
They want you to engage with the one that's the first.
55

56
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.650
And the reason they do that is because it's
a measurement for them of relevancy.
56

57
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.430
So they, basically, in their mind, they want you
to see the very most relevant thing,
57

58
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.720
the thing you want to engage with, or comment on,
or like, at the very top of your news feed.
58

59
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.260
So of course they track where you're clicking, or where
you're engaging, or where you're watching the videos
59

60
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.070
at, because if it's too far down the page, then
they're not doing a good enough job of ranking your 
60

61
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.940
news feed based on your interests.
61

62
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.930
So, other than that, they're going to have some metrics like, obviously, the messages sent, and then time spent on site.
62

63
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.530
So, other than that, they're going to have some metrics like, obviously, the messages sent, and then time spent on site.
63

64
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.690
And the interesting thing about Facebook is that they
also own WhatsApp and Instagram, things like that,
64

65
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.950
And the interesting thing about Facebook is that they
also own WhatsApp and Instagram, things like that,
65

66
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.960
so if you leave Facebook and go to WhatsApp, or leave
Facebook and go to Instagram, that's okay with them,
66

67
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.080
because they own those properties as well,
67

68
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.580
and you're still basically inside of their universe of companies.
68

69
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:31.680
So then they're also going to have the number of likes
that you make on some, on average per day on other
69

70
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.480
people's items in the news feed or wherever.
70

71
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:44.190
And then, of course, they are also going to be tracking things like the average number of likes that you as a user get per post.
71

72
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.440
And then, of course, they are also going to be tracking things like the average number of likes that you as a user get per post.
72

73
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:55.260
So, on average, some people have a higher
average like count per post.
73

74
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:02.460
Obviously, if they're more popular or whatever, more famous,
or celebrities, that sort of thing, and then
74

75
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.960
the interesting thing about that is, from what I've read,
they actually try to keep these numbers relatively
75

76
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:18.270
stable, and they also don't want anyone to not have
any likes at all, or any comments at all, because if
76

77
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.640
you post something, and you're sharing it with your network,
and then no one likes it or comments on it,
77

78
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.410
then you're less likely to come back and post again.
78

79
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.210
And, of course, they want you to do that.
79

80
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:37.890
So what they'll do is apparently sort of hold your
item in the news feed in front of people longer so
80

81
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:44.160
that, you know, people will see it and maybe actually
interact with it, until you get to some minimum threshold,
81

82
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.490
that, you know, people will see it and maybe actually
interact with it, until you get to some minimum threshold,
82

83
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.710
and at that point, you know, then it will start moving
down the news feed as a normal item.
83

84
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.600
But that way, you're like "Oh, hey, I got some likes,
I'll come and do this again."
84

85
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.030
So that's pretty interesting.
85

86
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.540
Okay.
86

87
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.490
So, just to recap real quick.
87

88
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:04.080
Each company is going to have a lot of the same metrics as others on things like new users, and active users, and all of that.
88

89
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.220
Each company is going to have a lot of the same metrics as others on things like new users, and active users, and all of that.
89

90
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.590
But when it comes to engagement, they're probably
going to have some metrics that are specific to
90

91
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.250
their company, or their industry,
or what they're trying to get you to do,
91

92
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.580
and they're really tracking those things closely.
92

93
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.990
So I know I've been talking a lot about
growth versus engagement metrics.
93

94
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.810
and those are different categories,
94

95
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.380
and in the next lecture we're going to talk about these categories.
95

96
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.360
So I will see you there, and pay attention
because it's an important one.
