Hey everyone.
1

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,530
So now we have a really good idea of how to
work and communicate with engineers.
2

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,400
Let's talk about designers. Designers, just like developers, often have certain ways of working that you should be aware of.

Let's talk about designers. Designers, just like developers, often have certain ways of working that you should be aware of.
4

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,720
Here are some tips on working with them.
5

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,950
Number one: designers are very creative, and you want them to take a lot of creative freedom in the work that they do.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,620
Number one: designers are very creative, and you want them to take a lot of creative freedom in the work that they do.
7

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,350
You want them to feel free to really stretch
the limits of their imagination. Because of this,
8

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,590
it's really important that you're clear about any limitations.
9

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,430
Let's say, for instance, that we're designing a new
profile page for users, and the designer wants to put
10

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,990
in some data that we don't have accessible at the moment from
the database, and it would take a lot of work to get.
11

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,000
in some data that we don't have accessible at the moment from
the database, and it would take a lot of work to get.
12

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,070
It's important that we tell them about this early, because
one slight change could change their entire design.
13

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,940
It's important that we tell them about this early, because
one slight change could change their entire design.
14

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,900
Keep this in mind.
15

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,260
Number two: like developers, you should not be treating designers as an agency or someone who just makes things pretty.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,370

17

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,480
This is a big mistake I see tons of product managers make.
90% of the time,

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,480
This is a big mistake I see tons of product managers make.
90% of the time,
19

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,130
designers are going to know much more about user interactions than you.
20

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,820
Not only that, but it's their entire job to make sure
that what they are making fits well within the other
21

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,730
areas of the product, and the other designers,
and the stuff that they're doing as well. Always provide
22

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,520
designers an ample opportunity to give you feedback on
the core of the idea or the product that you're working on.
23

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,770
designers an ample opportunity to give you feedback on
the core of the idea or the product that you're working on.
24

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,600
And I mean from the very product and idea perspective,
not just the wireframing and design part. Number
25

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,260
three: you and your designer should function as a team.
26

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,740
Again, this means that you should be giving them the opportunity
to tell you their opinion on the product and the feature,
27

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,580
Again, this means that you should be giving them the opportunity
to tell you their opinion on the product and the feature,
28

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,130
but it also means that you should be giving them data
showing them user feedback, and not just saying
29

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,760
that this is the thing we're developing or building
"because I said so." That's really bad.
30

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,460
that this is the thing we're developing or building
"because I said so." That's really bad.
31

32
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,380
You need to basically be showing them the reasons
that you came up with this being the thing that we're
32

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,190
doing next. Number four: don't ever tell the designer what to do.
33

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,590
Remember, as a PM, you're responsible for the "what"
and the "why", but not the "how."
34

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,970
If you dislike something in particular about their work,
feel free to highlight it in broad terms, but don't
35

36
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,850
tell them what needs to be changed.
36

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,020
For instance, if you think that something is confusing
about their design, remind them that it's important
37

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,920
that the interface is as clear as possible, maybe user
research shows that the least technologically
38

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,440
adept people are a big part of your user base,
39

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,050
for instance. At the end of the day, you have the final say
on the product you release, but you should never
40

41
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,340
ever have to exercise that power.
41

42
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:33,980
Okay. Number five, and the last one here.
42

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,260
Okay. Number five, and the last one here.
43

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,510
This is one of the best tips I can offer for working
with designers, and it's to always talk about user
44

45
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,910
problems first and solutions second.
45

46
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,060
In other words, don't say to them that a user should
be able to send photos in a message to another user,
46

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,960
because then you're just describing the solution.
47

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,160
Instead, talk about the fact that the problem that
users can't express themselves to one another with
48

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,790
photos or media in a message is the real issue.
49

50
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,250
You would be really surprised at how helpful this
technique is in finding the best solutions to actual
50

51
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,280
user problems, and designers really appreciate this approach.
51

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,120
Okay, so now that we've got a good idea of engineers
and designers, let's talk in the next lecture about
52

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,960
communicating with executives and other stakeholders.
