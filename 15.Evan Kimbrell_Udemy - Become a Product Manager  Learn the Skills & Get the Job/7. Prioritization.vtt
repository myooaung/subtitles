00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.130
Hey everybody, what is up?
1

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.470
So we know already about epic and epic spec sheets,
and we know about user stories.
2

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.590
So how does all this stuff get prioritized? As a product manager,
3

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.250
like we've already talked about, prioritizing things
is a major part of your role.
4

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.110
But here's the thing - you don't just prioritize user
stories, like a lot of people would have you believe,
5

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.280
you're in charge of prioritizing things all the way
from user stories up to bigger things like epics,
6

7
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:39.180
all the way to even you can help marketing prioritize,
you know, marketing and branding campaigns based
7

8
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.980
on product launches,
8

9
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.670
there's a whole bunch of stuff you've got to consider,
and it's more than just the value of that particular
9

10
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.540
thing that helps you prioritize it, because sometimes
you are working in companies with other teams and
10

11
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.360
different technologies, and other times
the competitors will do something,
11

12
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.640
all of these things have a big effect on how you prioritize.
12

13
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.200
That being said, I want to talk about three quick methods,
13

14
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.860
they're very basic academic methods that a lot of people know
about in the product management world, to prioritize
14

15
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.360
either user stories or epics, or just initiatives that you're doing.
15

16
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.350
So the first thing I want to mention is there is something
called assumption testing, prioritizing by the assumptions.
16

17
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.440
So the first thing I want to mention is there is something
called assumption testing, prioritizing by the assumptions.
17

18
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.440
The goal here is to pretty much de-risk what
you're doing by saying "Okay, this epic, or this story,
18

19
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.380
this user story, we're assuming a few things here.
19

20
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.360
We've tried to remove the risky assumptions through user studies, and tests, and data, and that sort of thing,
20

21
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.930
We've tried to remove the risky assumptions through user studies, and tests, and data, and that sort of thing,
21

22
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.420
but you can't remove them all."
22

23
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.140
So what are the remaining assumptions for any given
epic or story, and how big is the assumption that
23

24
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.350
you're making, or if you're making a few assumptions,
let's see what the biggest assumption is. What you
24

25
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.460
do here is you just take that biggest, riskiest assumption
and you assign it a value from like, 1 to 5 or
25

26
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.930
1 to 10, and you say that, you know, 10 is really,
really assuming something, and it's quite risky.
26

27
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.740
Then you take a score called an importance score and
you also score it on the importance of doing that
27

28
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.870
thing, or the impact you think it's going to make. You just add these two values together, and then you sort based on that.
28

29
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.490
thing, or the impact you think it's going to make. You just add these two values together, and then you sort based on that.
29

30
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.580
So you do that for everything and you just sort based on that.
This works particularly well on smaller
30

31
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.370
stories inside of a bigger epic you're doing, because
what you're doing basically is saying "All right, if
31

32
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.670
we're completely wrong about this one thing, we want to try it first.
32

33
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.680
We can't get any more data, we can't
figure out how wrong we are until we do it,
33

34
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.170
We can't get any more data, we can't
figure out how wrong we are until we do it,
34

35
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.910
so we're going to try it first to know if we're right or wrong,
and it might give us some more information on the
35

36
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.030
next things we're thinking about doing."
36

37
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.500
The second method is called the BUC method.
37

38
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.190
This is the business benefits, the user benefits, and then the cost.
38

39
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.650
Basically, you want to come up with a value from 1 to 5
or 1 to 10 for each of these, score them
39

40
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.480
appropriately, add up these scores, and then
you basically take the benefits part,
40

41
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.500
the business benefits and user benefits,
41

42
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.790
subtract the cost score from the sum of those, and
you get a final score, and then you prioritize all
42

43
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.790
of your stuff based on those final scores,
with the highest being up at the top.
43

44
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.800
There is a problem with this though, and that is that
it's pretty challenging to accurately score things
44

45
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.530
based on these sometimes.
45

46
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.640
Sometimes there's just not enough data available
to make an accurate number out of it.
46

47
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.070
All right, so there's one last method I want to talk about,
and this one is quite common, called the Moscow method.
47

48
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.700
All right, so there's one last method I want to talk about,
and this one is quite common, called the Moscow method.
48

49
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.770
It's the M-O-S-C-O-W. You might've seen it spelled like that.
49

50
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.160
It's the M-O-S-C-O-W. You might've seen it spelled like that.
50

51
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.470
This stands for Must, Could, Should, and Would. Basically,
you take everything you've got, everything you intend to do,
51

52
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.150
This stands for Must, Could, Should, and Would. Basically,
you take everything you've got, everything you intend to do,
52

53
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.610
all these stories or epics, and you just say, "Okay, we're
going to imagine we're not going to do any of these,
53

54
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.020
all these stories or epics, and you just say, "Okay, we're
going to imagine we're not going to do any of these,
54

55
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.230
what is the worst thing that happens?
55

56
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.630
Like, what's going to happen if we do none of this?"
56

57
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.560
Like, what's going to happen if we do none of this?"
57

58
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.060
So, from there, you find out things that, "Okay, we absolutely
cannot live without building this for a number
58

59
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.660
of reasons," and you can call those things the musts.
59

60
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.410
Then you go over all the other ones and you just say,
"Is this something that we should have, or is it
60

61
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.070
a must, or is it something we could do, or something
that we would do if we got the opportunity?"
61

62
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.450
This is really not science.
62

63
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.420
It's just going through things, and then thinking very
deeply about each one, and saying "Is this something
63

64
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:47.100
we absolutely must have, or things are going to get really
bad, either with the business in terms of revenue,
64

65
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.770
or survival, and that kind of thing."
65

66
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.900
Last thing to mention about that Moscow method is
that if you have something that is a must have, you
66

67
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.570
can obviously not have that depend on you doing
something else that you haven't done yet.
67

68
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.590
So if there's one feature that depends on another
feature being there, and that first feature is a must,
68

69
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.720
So if there's one feature that depends on another
feature being there, and that first feature is a must,
69

70
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.100
well, then it makes sense that the other feature
also must be a must have.
70

71
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.640
All right, so that's it for those three methods. We've got BUC, we've got assumption testing, and we've got the Moscow method.
71

72
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.320
All right, so that's it for those three methods. We've got BUC, we've got assumption testing, and we've got the Moscow method.
72

73
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.910
Those are useful, but they're not going to be applicable to
73

74
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.310
everything you're prioritizing as a product manager, because, like I said, there's all sorts of crazy things
74

75
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.050
happening out there in the market,
75

76
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.480
there's companies that go bankrupt, and companies
that get acquired, and then you've got, you know, other
76

77
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:46.820
teams that are working on things that you didn't know about,
or maybe there's a new technology available
77

78
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.660
all of a sudden that allows you to do something.
78

79
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.230
All of these things affect priorities everywhere in
the business, not just on small user stories or epics,
79

80
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:03.330
but on the direction, and the vision, and the direction
that the entire product team and the entire product
80

81
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.590
team all over the company heads towards.
Keep these methods in mind,
81

82
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.110
but just remember, they're not the only thing
you can use to prioritize things.
82

83
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.670
You can also think for yourself and go by
your instinct with the data you've got.
83

84
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.870
I'll make one last note, by the way, and say that some
of the biggest successes out there in terms of
84

85
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:36.330
products were not decided on some sort of fancy, logical,
quantitative decision, but they come from companies
85

86
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:44.280
that engender a risk taking attitude or have structures
in place to let the employees take some risk.
86

87
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.430
that engender a risk taking attitude or have structures
in place to let the employees take some risk.
87

88
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.860
If you work at a company that is not going to go
bankrupt if you screw up a little bit, work with your
88

89
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.230
manager, and your bosses, and the CEO, and the executives,
and just think about ways that you could be a
89

90
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:05.220
little bit more creative with your team, or even with
some of the other teams, to come up with ideas for
90

91
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.530
products that have never been created before, go a step further.
91

92
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:17.550
It's okay to do that, but the main goal is not to bankrupt your company by screwing up on a really important feature.
92

93
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.220
It's okay to do that, but the main goal is not to bankrupt your company by screwing up on a really important feature.
93

94
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.800
All right everybody, see you in the next lecture.
