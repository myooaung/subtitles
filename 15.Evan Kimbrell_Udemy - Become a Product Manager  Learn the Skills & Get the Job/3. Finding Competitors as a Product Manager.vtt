Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.890
Let's get our market intelligence on
and start finding some competitors.
2

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.660
We cannot carve our beautiful Greek statue of a woman with no arms (always no arms) unless we have a large stone.
3

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.860
We cannot carve our beautiful Greek statue of a woman with no arms (always no arms) unless we have a large stone.
4

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.940
Terrible metaphor?
5

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.580
Yeah, probably, but I think you know what I mean. We first need to channel all of our energy into building a
6

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.760
Yeah, probably, but I think you know what I mean. We first need to channel all of our energy into building a
7

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.040
list of potential competitors,
8

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.280
and once we have that list, then we can start chipping, and carving, and making the critical decisions
9

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.830
that we need to make as a product manager.
10

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.090
Ok, let's get started.
11

12
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.560
And step one - you probably can't guess it -
actually step one for this is capture.
12

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.120
And step one - you probably can't guess it -
actually step one for this is capture.
13

14
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.460
Now, what do I mean by capture?
14

15
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.910
Well, we need to set up some way of recording the competitors we find. Do that before you even start looking
15

16
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.360
for your first competitor. Whatever you use -
Evernote, Google Docs, a piece of paper,
16

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.300
you can even talk into Siri and have it record something for you -
17

18
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.370
you just need something set up. For those of you who want to follow along and do everything I do, open up a Google sheet.
18

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.110
you just need something set up. For those of you who want to follow along and do everything I do, open up a Google sheet.
19

20
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.490
That's what I'm going to use (or an Excel if you want to), I'm just going to fill column A with the competitors
20

21
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.440
we find. Why do I put them there? You'll find out later.
21

22
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.420
we find. Why do I put them there? You'll find out later.
22

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.110
The first thing I'm going to do to this list is I'm going to divide it into two categories, known and unknown.
23

24
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.960
The first thing I'm going to do to this list is I'm going to divide it into two categories, known and unknown.
24

25
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.910
So first one is "known" and then I'm going to leave five spaces.
25

26
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.320
I will explain.
26

27
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.250
"Unknown."
27

28
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.300
Now, for the top category, you can put as many as you want, to be honest, and if you need more than five
28

29
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.600
spots, by all means, you can shift everything else down.
29

30
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.760
But do you know what I mean
30

31
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.150
for "known"? Well, if you're a product manager, presumably you work within a company, and the company is probably 
31

32
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.370
prior established.
32

33
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.440
In that scenario, you're probably going to know who your biggest competitors are.
33

34
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.400
These are the people that you probably grumble about in your sleep and theoretically talk trash about
34

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.080
to your other employees.
35

36
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.770
These are the people that, when you're driving your car, you end up swerving because you get so angry
36

37
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.260
when you hear their commercial on the radio.
37

38
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.260
You should know these, so put these down.
38

39
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.740
This gives you a leg up.
39

40
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.200
Now, people out there who are doing this as an entrepreneur, you're not going to know this, so you're probably
40

41
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.870
not going to have a "known" category.
41

42
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.330
Now, if you are in a company and you don't know who your known competitors are,
42

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.750
number one, don't let your boss know,
43

44
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.610
and number two, try to figure this out as quickly as possible and don't let anyone know that you don't know this.
44

45
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.540
and number two, try to figure this out as quickly as possible and don't let anyone know that you don't know this.
45

46
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.910
I'll give you a quick tip for finding this in roughly four seconds.
46

47
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.820
Second one and second two, go to Google.com.
47

48
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.390
Second three and second four, all I want you to do is type the name of your company and then the word "versus."
48

49
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.080
Second three and second four, all I want you to do is type the name of your company and then the word "versus."
49

50
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.840
So, if I were using the company GoPro,
I would say "GoPro versus."
50

51
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.310
There you go.
51

52
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.700
Sony has essentially answered the question for me
or at least given me a head start. Right in the search
52

53
00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.280
suggestions, Google tells me that GoPro competes with Sony and Canon, and if I were to search, I could find even more,
53

54
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.080
suggestions, Google tells me that GoPro competes with Sony and Canon, and if I were to search, I could find even more,
54

55
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.100
things like Xiaomi, and Contour, and etc. etc.
Great, you got it?
55

56
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.540
things like Xiaomi, and Contour, and etc. etc.
Great, you got it?
56

57
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.190
Now, put your known right there, however many there are,
57

58
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.850
and then the next section, that's where we're going to go out and start digging for the ones we might not be aware of.
58

59
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.360
and then the next section, that's where we're going to go out and start digging for the ones we might not be aware of.
59

60
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.660
These are the ones that are kind of hiding in the bushes.
And as we collect these, we're just going to 
60

61
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.390
be typing these down and - like your therapist -
passing no judgment on them whatsoever.
61

62
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.200
We are just collecting them, known and unknown.
62

63
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.690
So how exactly do we search for unknown competitors?
63

64
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.330
Well, the way you do that is you focus on problems. Not your problems, crybaby, I'm talking about the problems
64

65
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.570
of your customers.
65

66
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.740
Now, you probably have figured this out already
66

67
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.110
up until the point in this course, because we've said this over and over and over again, all ideas, products, and
67

68
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.820
features, all stem from solving a problem for someone.
68

69
00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.290
Even the most frivolous things out there still solve a problem
69

70
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.310
if you sit and think about them long enough.
70

71
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.370
So what you need to do is just stop, take the product or the feature that you are evaluating, and answer
71

72
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.100
the question "What problem does this solve?"
72

73
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.880
And then, when you figure that out,
answer the question "For whom?"
73

74
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.800
Now, a pro tip.
74

75
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.410
Don't put "my users" in the second section because that is how you get tunnel vision and you just end up making mistakes.
75

76
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.520
Don't put "my users" in the second section because that is how you get tunnel vision and you just end up making mistakes.
76

77
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.190
We need to get a lot more specific than that.
77

78
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.910
So let's do it with an example, and we'll use GoPro since they're one of my favorite punching bags.
78

79
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.600
What problem does a GoPro Hero Black 4 solve?
79

80
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.730
Well, the problem it solves is probably that people want to film action sequences, or film shots that
80

81
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.460
involve moving objects, cars, paragliders, parachuting, whatnot, and the traditional applications are just not suited for it.
81

82
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.660
involve moving objects, cars, paragliders, parachuting, whatnot, and the traditional applications are just not suited for it.
82

83
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.840
You're not going to be carrying a large camcorder or a DSLR in these situations, you need something
83

84
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.430
with a different form factor. So, to put simply, it is hard to film action sequences with traditional cameras.
84

85
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.830
And "For whom?"
85

86
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.580
Well, mostly thrill seekers, specifically the ones that want to film it.
86

87
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.600
So I'd probably say thrill seekers and/or videographers.
87

88
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.750
Now, once you've identified the problem that it solves and for whom, you're basically halfway there.
88

89
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.200
Ok, now that we have a distilled version of what our product or feature does, we know who it's for and what problem it solves,
89

90
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.870
Ok, now that we have a distilled version of what our product or feature does, we know who it's for and what problem it solves,
90

91
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.960
let's use three different techniques
with this information to find competitors.
91

92
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.540
Now, there are obviously tons and tons of ways that you can find competitors, but these are three easy
92

93
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.050
ways that will get you a very large amount of coverage.
93

94
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.310
Be very surprised if you had to use anything else.
94

95
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.060
Fortunately for you, it's easy. Just go to Google.com.
95

96
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.100
Google's the best search engine, they're the best at finding things online,
96

97
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.680
that's why we use them.
Now, strategy
97

98
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.780
number one - I want you to channel the type of user
you're building your feature or your product for.
98

99
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:16.250
This is a user that has the problem you've identified.
Now, that user probably complains about the problem.
99

100
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.030
How would they complain about the problem?
100

101
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:27.310
What specific wordings, or phrases, or context would they use when complaining about it online?
101

102
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:34.020
Try to channel your annoying sister for just a second and think about what have they been saying before
102

103
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.320
that you've seen, you've recorded, you've observed,
103

104
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.990
and is there any other way that they could articulate this or verbalize the problem that you can think of?
104

105
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.370
and is there any other way that they could articulate this or verbalize the problem that you can think of?
105

106
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.240
Take those and write them down.
106

107
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.120
If I was a thrill seeker that really needed a camera to stick to my head, I'd probably be complaining
107

108
00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:01.080
along the lines of "DSLR too big for action shots" or something along the lines of "Keep breaking my
108

109
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:09.180
camera for" - insert the activity - you know, parachuting, or BMX biking, or skateboarding, or all the different
109

110
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.270
things that GoPro people use these for.
Try to write down as many as you can.
110

111
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.000
Once you have the variations down, take those variations
and start Googling them. What you'll find are
111

112
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.780
three different things.
112

113
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:26.490
One, companies that are using that verbiage.
Companies often do that, they take their customers or their
113

114
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.130
potential customers, see what they're complaining about, and they'll use the exact same language in their marketing message.
114

115
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.320
potential customers, see what they're complaining about, and they'll use the exact same language in their marketing message.
115

116
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.130
So, when you search for that exact wording,
you might find companies that are targeting them.
116

117
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.190
The second thing you'll find are individual people
complaining about it online. Now,
117

118
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.610
that itself is not particularly helpful, but when they're complaining about it, chances are there is a
118

119
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.050
conversation around it or resulting from it,
119

120
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.210
and then you can see how other people reacted to it.
120

121
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.960
And in most cases you'll find how other people solved the problem.
121

122
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.140
You can find potential competitors that way. "Can't find cameras small enough for my skateboarding videos."
122

123
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.500
"Oh man, that sucks, have you tried the Sony CyberShot?"
123

124
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.050
"Oh man, that sucks, have you tried the Sony CyberShot?"
124

125
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.770
I'm not really into the cameras.
125

126
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.250
Number three is that you'll find what Google
seems to be related to that problem.
126

127
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.480
Google is very good at connecting the dots between what people search for and what they typically are
127

128
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.450
looking for or what web sites they're going to.
128

129
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:28.410
So you might serendipitously find competitors because Google made the connections for you. Now, as a pro tip,
129

130
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:36.840
I suggest using this tag in Google. It goes "site:" and then insert the name of a web site you want to search.
130

131
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.290
I suggest using this tag in Google. It goes "site:" and then insert the name of a web site you want to search.
131

132
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.380
Now, what this does is it tells Google
to only search a specific web site.
132

133
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:48.440
Now, why would we use this in this technique? Well,
we're trying to channel customers saying something.
133

134
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.790
So we probably want to find individual people actually complaining about it and we want to find places
134

135
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.290
where they're probably discussing it.
135

136
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.050
So if you say "site:" then what you can do is you can insert some well-known sites in communities
136

137
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.780
where people often talk about this stuff.
137

138
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:09.180
So I'll just give you some of the hot ones, like Reddit.com is a fantastic way of finding consumer
138

139
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.530
conversations. Quora.com is another one.
139

140
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:18.010
Believe it or not, Yahoo Answers
is a decent resource for finding this stuff.
140

141
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.220
Look through the results, prune what you can find
out of it, and add it to your list.
141

142
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:29.040
Now, strategy number two. Strategy number two is to literally describe exactly what your product or feature
142

143
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.050
does - be like a robot and just literally describe it.
143

144
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:40.890
"Tiny camera fits to your head shoots video," "tiny camera designed for action," "compact camera you can attach
144

145
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.430
to your head that films" - things like that.
145

146
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.910
Now, what you'll get, again, are three different things.
146

147
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.570
One, you'll find companies that use
those literal descriptions of their features.
147

148
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:57.360
Now, they might not use the marketing verbiage or the complaint verbiage that we had in the last strategy
148

149
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:03.990
but they might use some of the feature descriptions, very literal, "it does this," and that's a great way
149

150
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.630
of picking up competitors you otherwise wouldn't find.
150

151
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.500
Now, the second thing you're going to find is at the top of your search list there's going to be ads
151

152
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:17.040
and those ads are essentially companies who have self-selected themselves to pitch to you because they
152

153
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.000
think that that function you're searching for
is related to their product.
153

154
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.640
Those people are paying to be there,
154

155
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.640
therefore, probably a good chance they could compete with you. And then, number three, what Google, again, thinks about it.
155

156
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.990
therefore, probably a good chance they could compete with you. And then, number three, what Google, again, thinks about it.
156

157
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.220
Very, very helpful.
157

158
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.530
Now, pro tip for this strategy.
158

159
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.700
One thing I would suggest doing is
play around with quotation marks.
159

160
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.630
Now, when you put quotation marks around
what you're searching, that is a hard search.
160

161
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:48.010
So when you do a hard search, Google only looks for
exact matches of whatever is in the quotations.
161

162
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:53.340
The reason why you might want to do that is because if I said "camera that mounts on your head," I don't
162

163
00:10:53.340 --> 00:11:00.210
want that to match up with something that says, you know, "mount a camera on your head" like a suggestion
163

164
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.460
or "mount a horse and use a camera."
164

165
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.670
Things like that.
165

166
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.980
Those are a little bit too off the mark.
166

167
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:13.290
And then the last one is try to search for how you in your head would pitch this product or feature.
167

168
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.690
If I was pitching the GoPro, maybe I might call it
World's Smallest 4K camera.
168

169
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.760
If I was pitching the GoPro, maybe I might call it
World's Smallest 4K camera.
169

170
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.900
That's a one sentence pitch.
170

171
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:26.040
Try to think of some one sentence pitches that describe what it is that you're working on and try entering that.
171

172
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.540
Try as much as you can to be specific when you use this strategy.
172

173
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:37.060
Don't just say "this app saves you time" -
a lot of things out there save you time.
173

174
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.940
This isn't going to help you if you're that vague.
174

175
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:48.390
If your app saves you time by saving your voice notes to Evernote, well, then search for it like a pitch
175

176
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:57.780
on that, like "save time by recording your voice," "save time on the go by using your voice," "write to do lists
176

177
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.330
with your voice," "save time on the go by just speaking."
Things like that.
177

178
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.260
with your voice," "save time on the go by just speaking."
Things like that.
178

179
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:04.830
Ok, got it? Those are three different techniques.
179

180
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.010
Ok, got it? Those are three different techniques.
180

181
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.760
Figure out the problem you solve, who you solve it for,
181

182
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.210
Figure out the problem you solve, who you solve it for,
182

183
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:15.540
and then use those three different strategies to drum up
a list of competitors that you think might be worth analyzing.
183

184
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.660
and then use those three different strategies to drum up
a list of competitors that you think might be worth analyzing.
184

185
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.870
Throw those in the list, and I'll see you in the next lecture.
