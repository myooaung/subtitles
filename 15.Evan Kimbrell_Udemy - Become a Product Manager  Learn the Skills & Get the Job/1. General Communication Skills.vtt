Hey, what's up? This section is an important one.
1

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.140
This is all about working with people and stakeholders.
2

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.800
It's communication skills and that sort of thing.
3

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.090
So let's get started.
4

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.270
By far, one of the most important skills to master as a
product manager is communication and you already know why,

By far, one of the most important skills to master as a
product manager is communication and you already know why,
6

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.980
because being a communication hub is
one of the biggest parts of our job.
7

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.410
Communication happens in a lot of different channels.
8

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.330
So let's talk about a few here.
9

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.060
So first, we've got meetings this is among the most important
areas a product manager needs to be a great
10

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.020
communicator in, just these company and one-to-one meetings.
11

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.060
So much of what affects our product occurs in meetings,
and knowing just how to take advantage of the
12

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.350
face to face and internet meetings is a
key portion of the product management job.
13

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.830
We also have to learn how to make sure that activities
that come from meetings are followed up on.
14

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.930
If you send a recap e-mail or notes after a meeting
and you ensure everything gets followed up on from
15

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.500
all the people in the meeting, you're going
to score major points as a product manager.
16

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.670
Number two, conference calls,
and this includes video meetings as well.
17

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.740
If you've got offices all around the world, these are going
to be very frequent. Communicating here very
18

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.140
well is dependent on the intonation
and the clarity of your verbal message.
19

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.550
Ensure that people are following along with you,
20

21
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.480
and if you have any resources, or you're sharing some
slide decks, or stats, make sure there's links to
21

22
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.460
all of that in the meeting invite or in
an e-mail that's associated with the meeting.
22

23
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.770
All right.
23

24
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.270
Number three, e-mails.
24

25
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.410
This is going to be the bulk of communication
as a product manager,
25

26
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.150
your primary method. Ensure that what you're writing
is clear, it's concise, and you have links to all of
26

27
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.410
the data and resources that you refer to in the email.
27

28
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.850
Number five, informal meetings, like lunch meetings.
28

29
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.090
These are casual environments that can be great for connecting,
29

30
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.960
getting feedback, ideas, and working to build support.
30

31
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.530
Don't underestimate the power of having lunch with a coworker and to tell them about what you're working on and get their input.
31

32
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.300
Don't underestimate the power of having lunch with a coworker and to tell them about what you're working on and get their input.
32

33
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.560
So, in general, there's a lot of ways we
communicate as a product manager,
33

34
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.670
but to become a truly stellar product manager, you must learn the art of communicating differently with different types of people.
34

35
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.200
but to become a truly stellar product manager, you must learn the art of communicating differently with different types of people.
35

36
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.960
There's an old saying that goes
"Six different audiences, six different slide decks."
36

37
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.800
We're going to talk more about that next.
37

38
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.090
I'll see you in the next lecture.
