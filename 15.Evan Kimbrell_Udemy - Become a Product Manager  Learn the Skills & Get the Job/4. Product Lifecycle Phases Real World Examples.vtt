Hey everyone.
1

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.790
So I wanted to give you a couple quick real life examples of products that are in the product lifecycle
2

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.210
in a couple of the different stages.
3

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.510
So, remember, we have introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.
4

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
So let's go ahead and take a look at my web browser here and we'll look at a couple of these products.
5

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.440
So let's go ahead and take a look at my web browser here and we'll look at a couple of these products.
6

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.930
So this would be a product that is in the introduction phase and that is because it is really, really early in the market.
7

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.980
So this would be a product that is in the introduction phase and that is because it is really, really early in the market.
8

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.330
It's something I found the other day called the Dream by Rhythm.
9

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600
It's this web site rhythm.co.
10

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
It's basically some kind of sleep wearable that helps you get better sleep.
11

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.870
But the real telltale here is that it's not quite launched to the absolute public, but it is available
12

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.260
to be bought by early adopters, so if you click Apply Now they've got this first version coming out here very soon.
13

14
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.460
to be bought by early adopters, so if you click Apply Now they've got this first version coming out here very soon.
14

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.560
So this is something that is in the introductory phase and there's really no doubt about it.
15

16
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.970
There's a lot of ways to find companies like this.
16

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.120
You can go on places like Tech Crunch or Product Hunt and check out companies or products that are just now starting.
17

18
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.920
You can go on places like Tech Crunch or Product Hunt and check out companies or products that are just now starting.
18

19
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.580
So now let's check out a product that is in the growth phase.
19

20
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.110
Alright, so my example for a growth product is Snapchat, and most people know what Snapchat is,
20

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.040
but if you don't, it's a little bit of like a picture based social network that's been growing pretty quickly.
21

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.690
but if you don't, it's a little bit of like a picture based social network that's been growing pretty quickly.
22

23
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.340
It's only a couple of years old but it's still in growth and this is their web site which doesn't show
23

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.300
you much, but... you can see the app there. But the real telltale here is if you go to Google Trends,
24

25
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.640
so let's type in Snapchat into Google Trends and we can see over time the interest is just skyrocketing
25

26
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.580
and it's really showing no signs of slowing down, and they're beginning to make money,
26

27
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.520
so they're really, really in this growth phase,
27

28
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.120
and there's a lot of people that are starting to look to compete with them at this point.
28

29
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.310
All right.
29

30
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.460
So let's take a look at a product that is in the maturity phase.
30

31
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.770
How about Twitter?
31

32
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.440
This is something we've talked about a little bit in terms of the company but Twitter's having some
32

33
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.930
struggles with their growth.
33

34
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.440
A lot of people think it's in the mature phase because their product is becoming a little bit more difficult
34

35
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.450
to use for the mainstream audience.
35

36
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.910
And if we just Google some stats on them we can get articles like this saying that their growth over time is really stagnating.
36

37
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.040
And if we just Google some stats on them we can get articles like this saying that their growth over time is really stagnating.
37

38
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.290
This graph right here shows that we're getting a little bit of a plateau here 16, 16, 18, 18, and 19,
38

39
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.160
it's not really growing like it did back in the day from 8 to 12 and 10 to 13.
39

40
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.800
So Twitter is definitely a company that is in the maturity phase. Unless they can do something really amazing to their product,
40

41
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.830
So Twitter is definitely a company that is in the maturity phase. Unless they can do something really amazing to their product,
41

42
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.200
It's probably going to stay that way and maybe even go into decline.
42

43
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.660
So let's take a look at an example for something that's in the decline phase.
43

44
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.700
How about Yahoo?
44

45
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.370
Yahoo is a really old company actually and they've been in decline for a while but it's getting really bad lately.
45

46
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.020
Yahoo is a really old company actually and they've been in decline for a while but it's getting really bad lately.
46

47
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.590
Yahoo is a really old company actually and they've been in decline for a while but it's getting really bad lately.
47

48
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.700
If you've looked at some of the articles about them lately, you can see ones like this, you know, hedge funds are dumping their stock.
48

49
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.980
If you've looked at some of the articles about them lately, you can see ones like this, you know, hedge funds are dumping their stock.
49

50
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.320
You just, with just a simple Google search or go to Google Finance and you get stuff like this
50

51
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.800
where we can back off the last five years and check out their revenues that are stock price.
51

52
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.740
And it's definitely on the way down.
52

53
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.770
There's even talks of them selling a piece of their business
at this point.
53

54
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.220
So just using Google and looking up products or companies is a really great way to kind of feel out
54

55
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.000
where they are in the product lifecycle.
55

56
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.880
Like I said before, there's really no definitive guide to where a company is in particular right in the
56

57
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.990
cycle, but you need to understand really how companies go through these cycles and they try to stop from declining.
57

58
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.080
cycle, but you need to understand really how companies go through these cycles and they try to stop from declining.
58

59
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.050
All right, makes sense? So we've got those four major phases of the cycle and you can just do some internet
59

60
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.600
research and get a really good idea of
where companies are at that point.
60

61
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.790
I'll see you in the next lecture.
