00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,020
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:12,000
All right, so at this stage in the game we know
what we want to build ideally, whether it's a product,
2

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,140
feature, or a large change of the product we already have.
3

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,470
We also know what types of assumptions we need to test
to get to the truth and we also know roughly
4

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,960
what outcome we want to see out of this MVP test.
5

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,230
Let's now take a slight turn and start talking about
the ways and the tools that are available to us
6

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,840
to get this testing job done.
7

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,660
First off, when you run MVP experiments, you're always
going to present in some way, shape, or form something
8

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,900
that implies your new feature or product
is already real and/or coming very soon.
9

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,110
The reason why we do this, if you remember, is because
we need validated learning - we need our potential
10

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:03,180
customers or users to be in real life situations where they don't know they're being tested to see how they actually behave.
11

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,190
customers or users to be in real life situations where they don't know they're being tested to see how they actually behave.
12

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,100
That is the data we crave and that is
the data that we have to rely on.
13

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,760
Now, it's obviously not the case that you have built
what you are saying you have, because internally
14

15
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,210
we haven't yet decided that. Now, the extent to which
you need to "fake it" in order to get the information
15

16
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,760
you need is what's going to determine what type of MVP you need.
16

17
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,430
So let's list them out and briefly discuss them.
In the following lectures, we'll cover each one a little
17

18
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,730
bit more in-depth, talk about pros and cons,
and when to use them. And in the spirit of faking it,
18

19
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:45,210
let's start, and let's start with the ones that are the most fake
and we'll get towards the end where we
19

20
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,540
talk about the ones that require less fakery.
20

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,250
All right, so the first MVP technique is what we call the email MVP.
21

22
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,290
It's the simplest one out there.
22

23
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,720
All you need to run an email MVP is an e-mail client,
23

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,350
some of your email list user base, and maybe some
basic wordsmithing skills. As an established company,
24

25
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,650
some of your email list user base, and maybe some
basic wordsmithing skills. As an established company,
25

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:15,030
you already have a list of users, and most likely
you communicate with them on a frequent basis.
26

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:22,100
I can't really think of any company that doesn't use
e-mail marketing in at least some way.
27

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,200
So your users are already used to buying things,
or signing up for things, or engaging with the content
28

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,190
in the emails you send them.
29

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:37,200
They're already ready to have a test run on them.
By taking a small segment of your user population and
30

31
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,250
emailing them a pitch for a new feature or a new product,
31

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,550
you can see exactly how they'll react in a simulated
"this is real" scenario. Whether or
32

33
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,760
not this is a good idea as a PM is a different question, and we'll cover that in the lectures where we go more into depth,
33

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,800
not this is a good idea as a PM is a different question, and we'll cover that in the lectures where we go more into depth,
34

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,440
but right now we're just covering what they are.
Product managers that are pre-product, also known as
35

36
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,790
early founders, can use this one quite effectively.
36

37
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,520
Even if you don't have an email list already, you can
gather a list of emails from potential customers
37

38
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:18,450
i.e. people that fit your target demographics, or your target customer segmentation and send this out
38

39
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,300
in much of the same way.
39

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:29,520
You'll probably take a much more personal tone
to avoid getting flagged as spam, but it's a very viable
40

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,760
way of testing and it is literally the simplest way of doing this.
41

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,780
If anyone is familiar with AppSumo, they sell
new products all the time in this way.
42

43
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,070
In fact, they're kind of like a daily deals website,
but for marketing and entrepreneurial tools. They
43

44
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:54,590
routinely test their new products by sending out
email MVPs before they acquire or build them.
44

45
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,540
They generally just say, "Hey, this is real.
45

46
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,350
Come sign up." And if they're even more brazen,
and I've seen this, they'll put an order button in the e-mail
46

47
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,130
and see if people actually buy right out of the e-mail.
47

48
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,080
All right, so that's an e-mail MVP.
48

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,420
The next one we're going to talk about it's called the shadow button MVP, and this is one that's very specific to product managers.
49

50
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,670
The next one we're going to talk about it's called the shadow button MVP, and this is one that's very specific to product managers.
50

51
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:25,540
Shadow button MVP generally requires more resources to do
than an email MVP, but it's still, on the whole, very easy to pull off.
51

52
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:25,560
Shadow button MVP generally requires more resources to do
than an email MVP, but it's still, on the whole, very easy to pull off.
52

53
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,580
Shadow button MVP generally requires more resources to do
than an email MVP, but it's still, on the whole, very easy to pull off.
53

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,390
Now, what companies will do instead of building out
a new feature is they'll put a button within their
54

55
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:40,470
already made product that supposedly links the person
to this new feature. When the person clicks that
55

56
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,900
button, it registers that they did it,
56

57
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,700
and either, one, does nothing and just looks broken, or two,
shows text saying "Sorry, this is coming soon."
57

58
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:50,880
and either, one, does nothing and just looks broken, or two,
shows text saying "Sorry, this is coming soon."
58

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,540
That is in essence a shadow button.
Again, people don't know if it's real,
59

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,970
That is in essence a shadow button.
Again, people don't know if it's real,
60

61
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,870
so when we observe their behavior in this scenario,
we can generally consider it valid.
61

62
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:06,000
People act entirely differently when they think something is real versus if they don't have any reason
62

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,370
to think it's not real - you'll hear this over and over again.
63

64
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,910
Oftentimes you'll see shadow buttons be used
in mid-sized startups that are really trying to triage
64

65
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:14,980
Oftentimes you'll see shadow buttons be used
in mid-sized startups that are really trying to triage
65

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,690
their "nice to have features." Which login would you offer at first? Let's say you're a startup deciding
66

67
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,290
between email login, Facebook login, Twitter,
Google, and, let's say, LinkedIn log in.
67

68
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,580
between email login, Facebook login, Twitter,
Google, and, let's say, LinkedIn log in.
68

69
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Well, instead of implementing all of those, which is a
decently large task, you just put fake buttons for
69

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,940
them and record if people actually try to use them.
If they don't use them, then you know it's
70

71
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,330
not worth putting in just yet.
71

72
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,920
Now, is the shadow MVP a good idea?
72

73
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,170
Every time I say this, Cole just cringes.
73

74
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,610
Again, we'll talk about that in another lecture.
74

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,640
All MVPs depend on your organization, your size, and
some other factors we'll discuss. The next two types of MVPs
75

76
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,760
All MVPs depend on your organization, your size, and
some other factors we'll discuss. The next two types of MVPs
76

77
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,180
I've actually lumped together.
77

78
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,810
There's one that's called the 404 page.
78

79
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,540
And the two, which is called the "coming soon" page.
79

80
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,060
They're really similar to each other, but there's just slight variations, that's why we'll discuss them together. In this MVP tactic,
80

81
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,280
They're really similar to each other, but there's just slight variations, that's why we'll discuss them together. In this MVP tactic,
81

82
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,640
what you do is, again, act like you're adding a new feature
or a product, and when the user navigates to
82

83
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:27,300
the page that is designated as the new feature, or product,
or section of your site, it either displays
83

84
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,510
a 404 message - 404 meaning "server cannot find
this page," you'll find this anytime a server is
84

85
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:40,410
not working or you click to a page that's old and
it's no longer there - or a page that says "Thank you
85

86
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,860
for your interest, the product is coming soon." And then often
it'll ask them to sign up or display interest in some way.
86

87
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,580
for your interest, the product is coming soon." And then often
it'll ask them to sign up or display interest in some way.
87

88
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,310
Now, you might be thinking to yourself "Hey, this is way too scrappy. My big company, and our beautiful
88

89
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,440
brand, and bla-bla-bla, we can't use this possibly."
89

90
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,400
brand, and bla-bla-bla, we can't use this possibly."
90

91
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,890
Well, guess what?
91

92
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:04,400
Guess who uses this technique every single day
to test demand for new products?
92

93
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:14,580
Amazon. Amazon.com is the king of using the 404 page or the coming soon sign up page. Amazon uses this extensively
93

94
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,150
to see if their existing user base is interested in a new side project or even a new category of goods
94

95
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,350
to see if their existing user base is interested in a new side project or even a new category of goods
95

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,470
They track the interest against their criteria
of success and there you go.
96

97
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,070
That's how they know where to put their resources
and where to expand the Amazon empire.
97

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,510
It also works great for them because they have so many
random things attached to their brand that have
98

99
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,830
nothing to do with the core value proposition,
so it kind of makes sense.
99

100
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,190
Oculus Rift, if you guys are seeing that virtual reality
goggle system - we have an activity on it,
100

101
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,630
actually - is another great example of a company
that launched in a very similar way.
101

102
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,820
They just put up a pre-order page, and I'm sure you've seen
companies that have launched with Kickstarter pages.
102

103
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,980
They just put up a pre-order page, and I'm sure you've seen
companies that have launched with Kickstarter pages.
103

104
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,050
They did the same thing. It's the same thing as a coming
soon page. "We're coming soon, sign up, or pre-order,
104

105
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,660
or get your foot in the door by paying us money."
105

106
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:13,710
The difference with Oculus Rift is that when they did that,
all they had was a very rough prototype, and
106

107
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,740
I don't honestly know if it even worked.
107

108
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,050
And the only other thing was a way to pay in advance,
so that pretty much is an MVP.
108

109
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,410
All right guys, let's take a break. Now that we've
learned three of them, try to digest that one.
109

110
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,480
Don't worry if you feel like you're a little bit lost on some of these, we're going to cover them in more depth later.
110

111
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,470
Don't worry if you feel like you're a little bit lost on some of these, we're going to cover them in more depth later.
111

112
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,140
Feel free to pick which ones you want to dive into.
112

113
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
Take a break.
113

114
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,390
We'll start with the next batch in the next lecture.
114

115
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:42,770
See you then.
