Hey everyone, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.490
This section of the course is about metrics, and
this is one of the most important topics that we will
2

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
be covering in the course for a product manager.
As a product manager,
3

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.870
basically your entire day, your entire role actually
revolves around metrics in some way or another.
4

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.600
So, we will cover metrics in general, like, what are they,
why are they important, then how do you pick them,
5

6
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.090
So, we will cover metrics in general, like, what are they,
why are they important, then how do you pick them,
6

7
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.910
we're going to go over some real life examples of
metrics at real tech companies, and then we're going
7

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.040
to talk about some metrics frameworks that will
help you pick and understand your metrics.
8

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.900
So pay close attention because this is a big section.
9

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:52.230
So there's a very famous saying that goes "What gets measured gets managed" and that is by Peter Drucker,
10

11
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.750
who is a very famous old school business consultant,
management consultant, that sort of thing.
11

12
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.470
And he was actually most active in the earlier parts of the 1900s. That is so true and metrics are really all about that.
12

13
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.550
And he was actually most active in the earlier parts of the 1900s. That is so true and metrics are really all about that.
13

14
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.280
So have you ever been driving down the road and
seen one of these radar automated speed limit signs,
14

15
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080
the ones where it says the speed limit,
15

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.430
but then it also uses radar to show you exactly
how fast you are currently going?
16

17
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.010
These signs have been proven to reduce speed for people
even more effectively than under threat of getting
17

18
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.960
a ticket from a police officer.
18

19
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.320
The reason is because the feedback is instantaneous.
So when you get tickets from the police, you're probably
19

20
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.840
only getting one every few times that you actually speed and the police officer catches you and then decides to give you a ticket.
20

21
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.210
only getting one every few times that you actually speed and the police officer catches you and then decides to give you a ticket.
21

22
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.400
So, you know, depending on how much you speed,
22

23
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.600
however many times you speed and
getting a ticket in that period of time.
23

24
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.150
But with these signs, every single time you go past
a speed limit sign, you're getting direct feedback 
24

25
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.940
on "Here's how fast you're going"
25

26
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.200
and this has been proven, again, to be way more effective
than just being ticketed for reducing speed.
26

27
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.680
and this has been proven, again, to be way more effective
than just being ticketed for reducing speed.
27

28
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.330
The reason that this happens is because of a human nature
of science called feedback loops, which means
28

29
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.390
that the more frequently you are getting accurate feedback
about something, the more effectively you're
29

30
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.310
going to manage that. This same exact principle is
behind the success of the fitness tracker industry.
30

31
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.670
going to manage that. This same exact principle is
behind the success of the fitness tracker industry.
31

32
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.900
So, people that wear, you know, fitness tracking armbands,
or watches, or heart rate monitors, or whatever,
32

33
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.030
they're getting instantaneous feedback all the time about their calories, or the way they slept, or what they've been eating,
33

34
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.200
they're getting instantaneous feedback all the time about their calories, or the way they slept, or what they've been eating,
34

35
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.750
and this helps people lose weight or become healthier,
35

36
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.000
and this is the exact same reason, because they're
getting really quick feedback every single day,
36

37
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.310
or even every hour if they're looking at their device pretty frequently,
37

38
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:07.020
and this is that science at work. As a product manager,
we can use this same science to really help
38

39
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.750
our products be successful.
39

40
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.280
And this whole feedback loop process through metrics is really the core of Agile development and your role as a product manager.
40

41
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.590
And this whole feedback loop process through metrics is really the core of Agile development and your role as a product manager.
41

42
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.930
So what are metrics?
42

43
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.440
Well, metrics is just a fancy term for a number that
describes what's going on with your product, it's
43

44
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.470
a measurement of something.
44

45
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.710
And sometimes you'll hear the word KPIs,
which stands for key performance indicator,
45

46
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.280
and this is, whatever, you can use these two terms
interchangeably, to be honest,
46

47
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.390
you'll hear both of them depending on
the company you're working at.
47

48
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.900
I think KPIs sounds a little bit corporate
so I just use the word metrics.
48

49
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.510
No big deal.
49

50
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.170
Some common examples of metrics are things like
monthly active users, returning users, churned users,
50

51
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.590
things like even AppStore reviews,
51

52
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.560
maybe things that people do on certain platforms
like Facebook or Twitter,
52

53
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.750
it's how many posts have they made.
53

54
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.240
These are all metrics, it's just a number saying how many times someone has done something, or even in
54

55
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.590
terms of, let's say, a Netflix or a streaming music company,
they have metrics for how fast between the
55

56
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.510
time that the user hits the play button to when the video starts.
56

57
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.750
And, in this case, that measurement they're trying to decrease to be as small as possible to have the fastest service basically.
57

58
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.190
And, in this case, that measurement they're trying to decrease to be as small as possible to have the fastest service basically.
58

59
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.440
So, metrics are different depending on the type of the
product manager you are, the industry you're working
59

60
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.190
in, the company you're working at,
60

61
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.100
and we're going to talk a little bit more about that.
As I keep saying, metrics are a huge part of your
61

62
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.060
life as a product manager and, as you know, product managers do a lot of different things that we've already covered,
62

63
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.400
life as a product manager and, as you know, product managers do a lot of different things that we've already covered,
63

64
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.020
but one of the most important things is that you must
accomplish a goal, and in order to basically accomplish
64

65
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.500
that goal, you have to first say what are you accomplishing.
65

66
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.220
You have to do what we call defining success
and you do that through metrics.
66

67
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.790
So you basically say "Hey, these are the numbers we're
going to try to hit in this metric by building this thing,
67

68
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.630
So you basically say "Hey, these are the numbers we're
going to try to hit in this metric by building this thing,
68

69
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.210
and if we do it, we're successful, and if we don't,
then something's wrong."
69

70
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.390
If we're getting close, then we know
we're moving in the right direction,
70

71
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.330
but this is our feedback loop as a product manager.
71

72
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.610
So back to the real world example on the fitness tracker.
72

73
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.500
If a person is trying to lose weight, then they're going to
have a goal of eating under a certain amount
73

74
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.400
of calories, or burning a certain amount of calories per day.
74

75
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.780
Exact same thing for us.
75

76
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.180
We have to say "Here's what we want to hit, and
when we get there, that means we're successful."
76

77
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.820
Again, this is called defining success and this is something
you've got to do before every single endeavor
77

78
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.420
you or your team does, or even your company does,
78

79
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.270
you have to know what are you actually trying
to do here before you start doing it.
79

80
00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.480
So, here's a real world quick example from, like, let's say,
Facebook, as an example. Let's say that Facebook
80

81
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.670
is trying to increase the amount of time
that people spend on Facebook, okay?
81

82
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.310
is trying to increase the amount of time
that people spend on Facebook, okay?
82

83
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.490
Well, that's like a company level goal.
83

84
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:16.530
And now let's also say that, you know, from this we know
we want to build a feature that's going to basically
84

85
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.260
encourage people to stay longer.
85

86
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:27.210
But if, let's say, we are a product manager on a smaller team and we know that people who comment more
86

87
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.580
on Facebook, where they make comments on,
you know, post and stuff,
87

88
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.950
they tend to stay longer than the average person.
88

89
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.770
So they've looked in the data and we know that.
What we want to do in that case is look at building a
89

90
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:47.100
product that, or building a feature rather, or improving
that product to basically encourage people to
90

91
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:54.300
comment more, and we would say "Ok, we're going
to go for a 5% increase in comments per person on
91

92
00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:02.790
average," which will in turn affect the average amount
of time that everyone is spending on Facebook in
92

93
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.760
general on that top company level metric.
93

94
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.850
So, next, we're going to take a look at some real life examples
of metrics at some companies you may have
94

95
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.040
heard of before. I'll see you in the next lecture.
