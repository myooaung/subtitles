00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,640
Hey guys, welcome back to the course. So let's round out
the rest of the five criteria that we need to
1

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,560
focus on as product managers.
2

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,890
Now, the third criteria is design.
3

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,280
Now, be aware of your competitor's ability or inability to make products that are aesthetically pleasing
4

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,750
or beautiful. It sounds shallow, but in general people are more inclined to use products that are well thought 
5

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320
out and well designed.
6

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,630
How many things do you use simply because it's easy to use and maybe it's pretty? And I'm sure you guys
7

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,700
in your head have figured out the next example.
8

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,440
Again, it's going to be Apple.
9

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,500
Apple's a great example, because they are so focused on design and usability that they are a threat to 
10

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,110
virtually any market they enter.
11

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,160
Now, they are especially threatening to markets that use design and usability as a key differentiator.
12

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,330
Now, they are especially threatening to markets that use design and usability as a key differentiator.
13

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,170
Is Apple going to enter in the toaster market? Probably not.
14

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,190
Is Apple going to enter in the toaster market? Probably not.
15

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,490
But you just saw what they did to the watch market.
16

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Another real life example is a company called Path.
Path was making a social network to compete with
17

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,350
Facebook and at a certain point I believe
they had something like 30 million users.
18

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,430
They stuck around for quite a long time solely based on
their ability to make a more beautiful product,
19

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,870
and their product was very nice.
20

21
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,690
If I were in a similar space, I would be weary about treading into a space controlled by a firm that has top notch design.
21

22
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,980
If I were in a similar space, I would be weary about treading into a space controlled by a firm that has top notch design.
22

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
The number four is brand, and brand is kind of a funny thing.
23

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,730
We often think of it as something that's really abstract,
but when it comes to managing products and
24

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,500
your competitive advantage, it actually can be huge.
25

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,970
The perceptions that people have of you and the products you sell can determine what you can do in the future.
26

27
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,560
The perceptions that people have of you and the products you sell can determine what you can do in the future.
27

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,620
A brand can be a blessing and a curse.
28

29
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,060
It can allow you to be more effective in certain areas
and restricted in others.
29

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,930
In general, strong brands demand a much higher level of customer loyalty when they launch into a new market or a new initiative.
30

31
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,520
In general, strong brands demand a much higher level of customer loyalty when they launch into a new market or a new initiative.
31

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,530
They're more likely to bring a large group of people to that.
32

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,160
They also have the advantage of
being able to charge higher prices.
33

34
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,270
A comparison of GoPro, we've probably thought, "GoPro, why are you charging $500 when other people are charging
34

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,160
$300 for the same thing?"
35

36
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,110
Well, because GoPro can do it. They have
the strongest brand in the space.
36

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,660
Well, because GoPro can do it. They have
the strongest brand in the space.
37

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,810
If you look at the market share, they are doing very well.
38

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,480
So be aware of the relative positioning between your brand
and the brand of your competitor, especially
39

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,950
as it specifically pertains to new products or new features.
40

41
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,120
If your competitor has the stronger brand, it can be
hard for you to catch up with any new initiative
41

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,940
or product that they built.
42

43
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,440
They're inevitably going to get more press, more funding,
and since they're a stronger brand, they're
43

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,680
going to get a better benefit of the doubt.
44

45
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,850
People in general are more flexible when they're trying on
a brand they already have an affinity for.
45

46
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:53,960
People in general are more flexible when they're trying on
a brand they already have an affinity for.
46

47
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,360
Now, on the flip side, what about in the case where your competitor has a weaker brand, maybe it's diminished,
47

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,370
or maybe it's actually conflicting?
48

49
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:10,440
It's really hard for a brand that's pigeonholed in one area to branch out into areas that people would perceive as unrelated.
49

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,320
It's really hard for a brand that's pigeonholed in one area to branch out into areas that people would perceive as unrelated.
50

51
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,650
Sony can make a TV, a camera, a toaster,
and a car if they wanted to.
51

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,640
Now, Lexus cannot make a toaster, they cannot make a TV, they can't make a camera, they can really just make cars.
52

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,780
Now, Lexus cannot make a toaster, they cannot make a TV, they can't make a camera, they can really just make cars.
53

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,150
So be aware, how highly regarded is the brand of your competitor
54

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,150
and what's the gap between the perception of your brand
and the perception of theirs?
55

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,440
Does that relative difference allow them certain advantages or certain avenues that you wouldn't be
56

57
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,760
able to take advantage of? And again,
be aware of any weaknesses to exploit.
57

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,200
Are there certain things your brand can do that theirs couldn't?
58

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,810
And the last thing we're going to discuss is speed. When your competitor sits down and starts working on a new
59

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,920
product or feature, how quickly can they build it,
turn it around, and "ship it," so to speak?
60

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,840
product or feature, how quickly can they build it,
turn it around, and "ship it," so to speak?
61

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,570
product or feature, how quickly can they build it,
turn it around, and "ship it," so to speak?
62

63
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,130
Try to get a sense of this because it's very relevant
in a lot of different situations.
63

64
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:12,480
Now, when is it most relevant? Well, this is most relevant in situations where your company or your competitor's
64

65
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,940
company is significantly larger.
65

66
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,430
In general, it's a natural consequence that as a company gets larger, and larger, and larger, they will
66

67
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,940
have more communication structures, more hierarchies, and more bureaucracies that will typically slow them down
67

68
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,120
have more communication structures, more hierarchies, and more bureaucracies that will typically slow them down
68

69
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,020
in regards to what they're trying to execute on.
69

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,020
So be aware.
70

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:39,930
Are you getting so big and so slow that a small team that's more focused and more agile can beat you
71

72
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,960
to any new market feature or user base you're going after?
72

73
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,040
If that's the case, then you probably need to shy away from situations where the product success is directly
73

74
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,580
tied to the product launch date.
74

75
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,840
One of the reasons why MySpace is not the number one social network anymore is because Facebook started off
75

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,760
as a smaller group.
76

77
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,310
They were able to build features faster and they basically
just ran circles around MySpace while they
77

78
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,160
tried to catch up, and it took them forever, and it didn't work.
78

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:17,910
All right, so those are the five: product core, user base, size, speed, design, and brand. Get a decent understanding
79

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,170
of your competitors in each of these five different criteria.
80

81
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,160
That's what's going to allow you to make the right call.
In the next lecture, we are going to talk
81

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,240
about where do we go to get this information and what techniques can we use to constantly monitor it in case it changes.
82

83
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,860
about where do we go to get this information and what techniques can we use to constantly monitor it in case it changes.
83

84
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,850
All right, see you in the next lecture.
