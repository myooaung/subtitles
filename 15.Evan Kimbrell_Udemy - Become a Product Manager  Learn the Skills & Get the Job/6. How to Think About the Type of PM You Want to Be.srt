Hey everyone! So we know now that there's a few different types of product management roles and each one
1

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,110
of these sometimes differs in the types of work that they do.
2

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:17,010
And so, it makes sense that different personality types might gravitate towards these different product management roles.

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:17,970
And so, it makes sense that different personality types might gravitate towards these different product management roles.
4

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,070
Let's talk a little bit about that right now.
5

6
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,680
First, the internal product manager. Due to the fact that you're building tools and products for people
6

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,890
within your own company, and your stakeholders are all internal, this type of role is great for people that
7

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,560
might be starting out in the role of product management.
8

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,560
This role also allows you to learn a lot about technology, because usually you'll be making tools that
9

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,000
integrate with other internal systems or third party tools, like marketing software, CRMs, that sort of thing.
10

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,420
integrate with other internal systems or third party tools, like marketing software, CRMs, that sort of thing.
11

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,430
In the internal product management role you'll be doing a lot of project management and you'll have
12

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,730
a lot less risk of losing the company big money if you make a mistake or a feature is buggy.
13

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,170
This is because you're not building for millions, you're building only for the people that you work with,
14

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,190
people in marketing, and sales, and these types of departments.
15

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,710
Now, how about the business to business or software as a service product manager? Just like the internal product manager,
16

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,490
Now, how about the business to business or software as a service product manager? Just like the internal product manager,
17

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,190
this is also a good introduction role to the role of product management.
18

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,020
Part of this is because you usually have a much, much smaller number of users to build for, not as
19

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,830
few as the internal tools role, but much less than the consumer product manager role.
20

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,010
This is because business to business companies are usually selling pretty expensive software to only
21

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,770
several hundreds or thousands of companies and not millions or tens of millions of users around the world.
22

23
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,340
several hundreds or thousands of companies and not millions or tens of millions of users around the world.
23

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,270
This type of product role lets you be a little bit more flexible and creative in how you build things
24

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,120
but not necessarily as flexible on what you're building, because oftentimes priorities are weighted heavily
25

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,240
by the sales team and how much money
a certain feature will bring in.
26

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,620
You'll also probably be building on tighter deadlines, because sales deals often have deadlines associated with them.
27

28
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,240
You'll also probably be building on tighter deadlines, because sales deals often have deadlines associated with them.
28

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,590
Both this role and the internal product manager role have a higher likelihood of you being responsible
29

30
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,150
for a product or a feature on one or very few platforms, which is unlike the next role.
30

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,580
So our third one, the B2C or business to consumer product management role,
31

32
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,140
this is a role that is good for people who don't mind uncertainty and a lot of pressure.
32

33
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,060
It is one of the most challenging product roles in the product management world, because you are often
33

34
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:40,530
building for millions of users and usually have the product on multiple platforms, like web, iOS, and Android.
34

35
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:40,720
building for millions of users and usually have the product on multiple platforms, like web, iOS, and Android.
35

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,320
You can also lose the company 
36

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:50,100
a lot of money if something breaks, so if you and your team release a feature that is full of bugs and it causes
37

38
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:57,090
tens of thousands of users to lose time on the app or not be able to use it until you update it in
38

39
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,060
the next release cycle, that has some big problems. 
On top of these pressures,
39

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,890
you have to do extensive user testing.
40

41
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,650
You have to continually look over feedback from users and it's never quite certain what you should build next.
41

42
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,600
You have to continually look over feedback from users and it's never quite certain what you should build next.
42

43
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,810
You have to iterate and test in a very Agile way to get the features that you need to build.
43

44
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,930
Like I said, the business to consumer product role is not an easy one,
44

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,690
but then again, it is one where you will learn a lot, and because you are building on multiple platforms
45

46
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,120
like I mentioned, you're going to learn about all sorts of stuff, from web development all the way to mobile development.
46

47
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,240
like I mentioned, you're going to learn about all sorts of stuff, from web development all the way to mobile development.
47

48
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:40,050
So what I want you to do is go ahead, take a moment, and write to your fellow classmates in the area below
48

49
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:47,430
about what type of product manager you think fits your working style best, or what type of product manager
49

50
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,250
you think you would like to be in the future.
50

51
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,800
And if you're already a product manager,
then write about the type of role that you have.
51

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,330
Alright, everyone.
52

53
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,340
I'm looking forward to seeing your comments down below,
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
