00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.610
What is up, everybody?
1

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.680
So what's Kanban and how does it compare to Scrum?
2

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.840
By the way, is it "can ban" or "kahn bahn"?
3

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm almost positive it's "kahn bahn," but if I'm wrong, Tweet at me or something. So like Scrum, Kanban
4

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.570
is just a framework for implementing Agile software development,
5

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.150
except it's not as strict as Scrum in terms of meetings and times.
6

7
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.140
So you may have actually seen what's referred to as a Kanban board before. It's just a bunch of columns with
7

8
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.630
cards on it that you can move from one column to the other one
to reflect a state of that item, like
8

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.280
to do, in progress, and then done.
9

10
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.780
However, just because something has a Kanban style board does not mean that that is the Kanban process.
10

11
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.870
However, just because something has a Kanban style board does not mean that that is the Kanban process.
11

12
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.960
Instead, the key concepts with Kanban are that it does not use sprints.
12

13
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.920
So you don't time box the work of your team into these two or four week periods.
13

14
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.710
Also, since there's no sprints, there's no sprint backlog, which we'll learn about, but only the product backlog itself.
14

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.880
Also, since there's no sprints, there's no sprint backlog, which we'll learn about, but only the product backlog itself.
15

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.040
So what happens is the team just works on their tickets,
they do the work,
16

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.230
So what happens is the team just works on their tickets,
they do the work,
17

18
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.950
they move it to done and then they take the next task
off the top of the product backlog.
18

19
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.090
And that backlog just goes on forever, it's just endless.
19

20
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.800
Kanban is also different from Scrum in that it does not prescribe any particular meeting types like Scrum
20

21
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.320
does with standup meetings, and sprint planning meetings, and retrospective meetings. And there's one more big difference.
21

22
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.550
does with standup meetings, and sprint planning meetings, and retrospective meetings. And there's one more big difference.
22

23
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.180
Kanban operates off of the theory that only a certain amount of items can be in progress or in any
23

24
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.180
given state at one time. How many items can be in each particular state is up for you and your team to decide.
24

25
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.790
given state at one time. How many items can be in each particular state is up for you and your team to decide.
25

26
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.560
Some software teams use Kanban, but it tends to work best with teams that are not very concerned with
26

27
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.280
things like estimation and are continuously moving tasks through the same number of steps pretty quickly until they're complete.
27

28
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.330
things like estimation and are continuously moving tasks through the same number of steps pretty quickly until they're complete.
28

29
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.970
For instance, customer service teams often use
a Kanban style of working.
29

30
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.240
All right.
30

31
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.960
So we are familiar with Scrum and Kanban, and then the big question is, which one is best?
31

32
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.270
Sorry to disappoint you, but there's no definitive answer here as it depends on what your team prefers to use.
32

33
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.940
Sorry to disappoint you, but there's no definitive answer here as it depends on what your team prefers to use.
33

34
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.780
The best process is the one that you like using. As you can tell, Kanban is a more relaxed way of doing
34

35
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.350
Agile development but it has a big disadvantage
since it doesn't use sprints.
35

36
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.560
It's going to be more difficult to project the amount of time it's going to take to complete work.
36

37
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.060
Don't worry too much about that right now because we're going to talk about things like estimations
37

38
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.910
and velocity in a later lecture.
38

39
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.860
So let's recap. Kanban is just another way to implement an Agile type of software development workflow.

So let's recap. Kanban is just another way to implement an Agile type of software development workflow.
40

41
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.980
It's a little less prescriptive than Scrum and it does not use sprints.
41

42
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.500
Alright, everybody.
42

43
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.190
I will see you in the next lecture.
