Hey everyone, what is up?
1

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.190
This is one of the most universally useful sections of the course.
2

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.640
We're going to learn about the common technologies and terms used in most software companies today, but
3

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.120
that you're going to hear a lot in your
day to day life as a product manager.
4

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.630
A large number of product managers start out as engineers first, or have some sort of technical background, like computer science.
5

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.920
A large number of product managers start out as engineers first, or have some sort of technical background, like computer science.
6

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.100
However, you don't absolutely need to be
an ex-engineer to become a product manager.
7

8
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.960
You can come from all sorts of backgrounds.
8

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.120
You don't even need to know how to code, but you do need to
understand how the most common technologies work.
9

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.950
You don't even need to know how to code, but you do need to
understand how the most common technologies work.
10

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.000
In other words, you don't need to be an engineer,
but you need to know how to speak like one.
11

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.240
All right. So why should you learn about technology?
12

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.440
All right. So why should you learn about technology?
13

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.190
Well, having a foundational understanding of technology
behind the products that you're building helps
14

15
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.740
you out in three really big ways.
15

16
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.420
Number one: it gives you an understanding of
what can be realistically built.
16

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.210
You won't have to ask engineers what is possible
17

18
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.990
every time you talk about solutions or features for users,
or whenever other departments ask you technical
18

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.090
questions, you don't have to go bother engineers and say,
"Oh yeah, I'll check with the engineers on that one."
19

20
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.510
questions, you don't have to go bother engineers and say,
"Oh yeah, I'll check with the engineers on that one."
20

21
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.000
Number two: it helps to build a great relationship with engineers.
21

22
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.010
If you're leading a product team with a group of smart engineers,
they want to know that the person making
22

23
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.050
the product decisions has both a respect for the
work they do and knowledge of how it works.
23

24
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.100
Being technically incompetent and unwilling to learn
is a really easy and fast way to losing respect
24

25
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.930
from your engineers and your team.
25

26
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.570
Alright, so number three:
26

27
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.670
knowing about technology helps you understand the impact
of the decisions that you're making. Every decision
27

28
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.510
you make about the product has a long lasting technical implication.
28

29
00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.710
If you build a product that needs a new database, or a
feature that needs a new database, then that means
29

30
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.020
that some engineer has to maintain that database,
and they have to build it in the first place.
30

31
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.740
If you later decide, as a product team, with everyone else,
to get rid of that feature, then guess
31

32
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.810
who's going to have to get rid of that database and
figure out all the stuff around what happens when
32

33
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.600
you remove it from the system - does it affect anything else?
33

34
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.810
Obviously, the engineers have to do that.
34

35
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.980
So this creates a lot of work for the engineers.
35

36
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.880
That's why it's important to ahead of time understand
technology, so that when you're thinking about
36

37
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.570
features and product decisions, you know, in the back of your head,
"Ok, what type of work is this going to make the engineers do,
37

38
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.130
features and product decisions, you know, in the back of your head,
"Ok, what type of work is this going to make the engineers do,
38

39
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.710
and then, what is the risk here if we
remove this in the future?" Anyways,
39

40
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.620
I'm really excited to talk about this section,
this is one of my most favorite sections of the course,
40

41
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.540
and this, being technically adapt and familiar with technology,
has been, I would say, by far, one of the
41

42
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.240
biggest benefits to my career as a product manager.
42

43
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.510
All right, let's get started.
43

44
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.290
I'll see you all in the next lecture.
