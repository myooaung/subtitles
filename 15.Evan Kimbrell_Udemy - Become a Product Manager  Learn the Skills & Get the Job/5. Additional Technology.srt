Hey everybody, what is up?
1

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:09,300
I wanted to take a moment to let you know what I would
recommend for you to look into further for technology
2

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,150
to really get the most you can out of a product management
role and really impress the people you're working
3

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,190
with with your technology knowledge and just
the breadth of stuff you're able to understand.
4

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,550
So here's my recommendations.
5

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,640
You should really look into some different programming languages,
6

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,820
and then the types of frameworks that are available around those.
7

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:46,380
I already mentioned before how Ruby is different from
Ruby on Rails, because Ruby on Rails is a framework for Ruby.
8

9
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,610
I already mentioned before how Ruby is different from
Ruby on Rails, because Ruby on Rails is a framework for Ruby.
9

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:55,640
Really briefly on that, a framework is, well, you can
think of it like speed dial for programmers.
10

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:04,020
So instead of me having to remember which numbers
to type for calling a friend, I could just hit a button
11

12
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,370
and speed dial them with one key press. In a way,
12

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,250
this is what frameworks do for programmers. So,
13

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,590
imagine that you are going to use a language like Ruby
to make a web site where people can log in and
14

15
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,330
you're going to store the login information, and
the passwords, and all of that stuff in a database.
15

16
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:24,530
you're going to store the login information, and
the passwords, and all of that stuff in a database.
16

17
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,510
This kind of thing has been done so many times and
there are so many good practices to do that that
17

18
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,930
it's pretty safe to say that if someone just did it really
well one time and just provided an easy way
18

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,200
to kind of replicate it that it would be a benefit.
19

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,510
This is exactly what frameworks do.
20

21
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,760
And in this case, if I wanted to do that, I could use Ruby
on Rails, and use a few simple commands basically
21

22
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,120
and it's just going to auto generate a database for me
hosted somewhere, and it's going to generate all
22

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,300
I need to basically have users be able to log in, and,
you know, put in a password, and all that sort of thing.
23

24
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,800
I need to basically have users be able to log in, and,
you know, put in a password, and all that sort of thing.
24

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,980
So frameworks are things that are structured around
programming languages, it's like commonly done things
25

26
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,490
in programming that allow developers to work faster.
26

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:19,560
The more knowledgeable you are about these different
languages, like PHP, or Ruby, or Scala, or Java, it's
27

28
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,600
just going to help you, you don't have to learn them,
28

29
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,040
you should look up about them and
see what they are best used for.
29

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,200
It's going to help you out a ton, and then if you understand
the frameworks on top of that, it's going
30

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,610
to be really helpful.
31

32
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,770
Secondly, I already mentioned MySQL or SQL,
where MySQL is the database technology
32

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,650
and SQL is the query language for querying those databases.
33

34
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,350
If I was going to recommend you one thing that you
should really, really look into as a product manager,
34

35
00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:00,640
it's going to be to learn how to query SQL databases
using SQL pretty proficiently.
35

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,140
Most companies are going to have SQL databases,
or MySQL databases, and it's going to be huge on your
36

37
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:14,010
resume to be able to make a query and get some data by yourself,
without having to bother engineers or data science people.
37

38
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,550
resume to be able to make a query and get some data by yourself,
without having to bother engineers or data science people.
38

39
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,390
So I highly recommend looking into that.
39

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,710
Check out codecademy.com, because they have
a SQL course that is really good and will get you
40

41
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,660
to understand the fundamentals, this can be super helpful.
41

42
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,690
The third thing I want to say is that if you're really
serious about getting into data and looking at
42

43
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,290
and analyzing data, which you should be if you're a
product manager, then I recommend you check out some
43

44
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,240
data parsing and analysis languages.
44

45
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,210
Some examples would be things like Python, and Python
is both a language that has been adapted to actually
45

46
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:01,680
run programs on different clients like the web, or
on your computer, but it's also what is called a
46

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,940
scripting language, which means that you can basically
take a set of data and use Python to script or
47

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,060
basically write out what you want to do with that data,
and parse it out, or pull pieces of it out and
48

49
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,570
analyze it, and then send it to something like Excel or
some other type of visualization software for data.
49

50
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,470
analyze it, and then send it to something like Excel or
some other type of visualization software for data.
50

51
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,900
This is going to be super helpful.
51

52
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,570
It's definitely an advanced thing as a product manager,
52

53
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,400
but if you really want to get into it, I recommend checking out some scripting languages, and I would probably start with Python.
53

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,990
but if you really want to get into it, I recommend checking out some scripting languages, and I would probably start with Python.
54

55
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,910
Alright, so the forth thing I'm going to mention here
is that if you want to go even further, and you want
55

56
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:44,400
to get more technical, then you should look at the different
types of databases out there or how databases work.
56

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,190
to get more technical, then you should look at the different
types of databases out there or how databases work.
57

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,470
So there are some things besides MySQL, and there's
different really categories of databases that
58

59
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:02,010
are things like relational databases versus non-relational
databases, and all that means is basically,
59

60
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:08,670
it's just the way that the databases store information,
and some of these databases are newer than others,
60

61
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:08,760
it's just the way that the databases store information,
and some of these databases are newer than others,
61

62
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,720
some of them are older but more proven,
62

63
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,470
some of them are faster, but, you know,
have some things you're not so good at.
63

64
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,820
So if you want some extra learning, go check out, you know, the differences between relational and non-relational databases,
64

65
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,360
So if you want some extra learning, go check out, you know, the differences between relational and non-relational databases,
65

66
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:30,380
things like MongoDB, for instance, versus MySQL,
and just get a good amount of information and
66

67
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,880
knowledge around that. It's going to help you out a ton
when you're talking to engineers and data scientists.
67

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,000
knowledge around that. It's going to help you out a ton
when you're talking to engineers and data scientists.
68

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,530
All right, so that's it for that part.
69

70
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,660
I just wanted to let you know what you could look into
if you're really interested in, and really, really
70

71
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,510
getting to be a really great technical product
manager, it's going to help you a lot
71

72
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,040
when you're talking to technical people in your company.
Got it? Good. I will see you in the next lecture.
