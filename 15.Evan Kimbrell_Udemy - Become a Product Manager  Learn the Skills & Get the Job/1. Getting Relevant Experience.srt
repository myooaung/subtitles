Hey everyone.
1

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:12,450
So this is a section all about preparing for a job in
product management, in order to maximize your
2

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,150
chances at getting a job.
3

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,050
There's one big problem that's also kind of
a benefit about being a product manager.
4

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,820
The problem is that it's pretty hard to get the job
at first because it requires prior experience.
5

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,780
But on the positive side, once you have that sort of
experience or you've done it at least once, you have
6

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,400
a lot of career security, because everyone else
has trouble getting that experience.
7

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,540
So it's really easy to switch jobs,
and get promoted, and that sort of thing.
8

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,940
There's also just a low number of really qualified product
managers out there, and the demand for them
9

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,760
is really increasing lately.
10

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,740
Unlike programming and computer science, there's no
way to major in product management in college and
11

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,150
say that you have prior experience from that.
12

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,150
So how can you best position yourself to get the first associate product manager job, or junior product manager job?
13

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,090
So how can you best position yourself to get the first associate product manager job, or junior product manager job?
14

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,360
What you really need to do is demonstrate that you understand
the concept and role of a product manager thoroughly.
15

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,250
What you really need to do is demonstrate that you understand
the concept and role of a product manager thoroughly.
16

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,410
But just talking about product management
is not enough to get a job.
17

18
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,390
You need to have the experiences to point to and
discuss with people that are interviewing you.
18

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:19,740
All right.
19

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,380
So where can we get these experiences? Well, we can
find them in two major places, either in your current
20

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,480
job, or with a side project.
21

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,050
In this lecture, we're going to talk about finding
relevant experience in your current job,
22

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,190
and then we'll talk about a side project. Since what you do as a product manager is so broad and we just do so many things,
23

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,710
and then we'll talk about a side project. Since what you do as a product manager is so broad and we just do so many things,
24

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:47,580
I guarantee you that some sort of stuff you're doing at
your current job is related to product management.
25

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:47,660
I guarantee you that some sort of stuff you're doing at
your current job is related to product management.
26

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,040
In other words, you're probably already
doing it, you just don't know.
27

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,270
In other words, you're probably already
doing it, you just don't know.
28

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,100
Think about all of the stuff we've learned in this course
so far, and then think about the things that you do
29

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,700
in your current job that involve these concepts.
30

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,260
I'll give you some examples here.
31

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,370
So write down any experience that you have with the following.
32

33
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:11,580
Number one - think about any time you've had multiple
things to do either by yourself or with a team and
33

34
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,700
you have to prioritize what you do first.
34

35
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,640
You made the priority decision based on information,
and that's what we do all the time as PMs.
35

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,960
Number two - think about all the times you've talked to
any users of a product or a tool internally or externally.
36

37
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,850
Number two - think about all the times you've talked to
any users of a product or a tool internally or externally.
37

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,180
If you work in marketing, for example, then talking to
the people you are marketing to, and focus groups,
38

39
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,280
or that sort of thing is very similar
to talking to the users of a product.
39

40
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,430
If you work in customer service, then you're definitely
talking to users of a product on a regular basis.
40

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:44,610
If you work in customer service, then you're definitely
talking to users of a product on a regular basis.
41

42
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,340
Number three - think about any times you've given feedback
or reported bugs on the product of your company 
42

43
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,780
or even another one.
43

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,380
Number four - if the company you're with now has a
product team, then recall all of the interactions you've
44

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,500
had with them, and how you may have helped them acquire data to make decisions, or gave them feedback on the product.
45

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,340
had with them, and how you may have helped them acquire data to make decisions, or gave them feedback on the product.
46

47
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,550
All right.
47

48
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,730
Number five - think about any times you have worked on something at your job with multiple other teams or groups of people.
48

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,690
Number five - think about any times you have worked on something at your job with multiple other teams or groups of people.
49

50
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:20,210
Have you ever worked with the legal team, the engineering
team, sales, marketing, or customer service? If
50

51
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,670
you've helped teams communicate something between them,
51

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,090
this is very relevant to being a product manager.
52

53
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,160
The last thing I want you to consider is any work
you've done to improve the efficiency of a process.
53

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,620
Product managers work a lot with different processes,
so any efficiency you have made better at your
54

55
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,640
job by finding more efficient ways to do things, or
improving the way things are done, from either stuff
55

56
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,050
you do every day, or stuff you and your teammates do,
is going to be very relevant to talk about.
56

57
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,470
So after you've written all of these things down, think
very deeply about each one and then detail each
57

58
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,670
one of them even more.
58

59
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,890
These experiences can be put on your resume, and then they
can be talked about during product management interviews.
59

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,700
These experiences can be put on your resume, and then they
can be talked about during product management interviews.
60

61
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,340
One other thing you can do is email product managers that you
find online and ask if you can ask them a few questions.
61

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,590
One other thing you can do is email product managers that you
find online and ask if you can ask them a few questions.
62

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,010
Use what you learn from them to inform
your job applications and interviews.
63

64
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,950
I recommend browsing for product managers in
industries you're interested in, in places like, let's say,
64

65
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,050
Product Hunt, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
65

66
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,310
But if you can't think of anything related in your current
job to product management, then doing a side
66

67
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,350
project is going to be the most helpful.
67

68
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,050
We're going to talk about that in the next lecture.
68

69
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,150
All right, I'll see you there.
