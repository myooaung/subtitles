1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,670
[Autogenerated] spring.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,680
Bootstrap actuator is a spring Bootstrap module that you

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,100
can add to your application that enables you to monitor

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,440
and manage your application.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,140
Let's take a closer look and added to the demo.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,080
When you add Springwood actuated to your application,

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,140
it will enable you to monitor the application via HTTP endpoints or via J M X.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,450
You will be able to see many different types of

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,400
information in the running application.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,540
For example, health information,

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,740
which tells you of the application and it's subsystems are all working normally.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,410
Configuration information,

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,610
which tells you exactly what configuration settings The

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,950
application is using metrics such as how much memory and CPU the

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,890
application is using and security audit events.

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,840
For example, if there are authentication failures,

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,460
this will, for example,

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,060
help you to reject if someone is attacking the

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,140
system by trying to guess passwords.

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,010
Besides what I just mentioned,

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,580
there are many more things you can monitor with Springwood actuator,

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,150
and it's also very customizable and extensible,

23
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,950
so you can also add your own application specific

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,340
information towards already provided.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,770
This will be easier for me to explain,

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,850
and for you to understand if I show you how it works in practice.

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,940
So let's add Springwood actuator to live demo application.

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,690
Before we go to the demo,

29
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,050
I want to mention that there's a course named Spring Framework Spring Boot.

30
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,160
A actuator by Dustin Schultz.

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,840
Off course here on Pluralsight.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,000
That's a good course to follow if you want to know more about Springwood actuator.
