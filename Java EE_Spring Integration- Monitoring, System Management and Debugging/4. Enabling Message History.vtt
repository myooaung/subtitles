00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.090
[Autogenerated] Let's look at another debugging tool

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.800
that spring integration provides,

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.140
which is Thea Bility to follow the history of messages.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.140
The integration flow in our demo application is not very complicated,

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.500
but you can imagine that in more elaborate applications,

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.340
messages will be passed between components in more complex ways.

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.680
Sometimes errors may occur at some point in the flow,

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.630
and you need to know what has happened to the message before it

9
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.340
got to the point where the error occurred.

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.370
For that purpose,

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.740
you can switch on spring integrations message history component.

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.020
You can do this either in XML configuration by adding an int

13
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.550
message history element at the top level off the configuration

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.540
file or by using the enable message,

15
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.990
history and notation in the configuration class,

16
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.940
such as our Globomantics Service application class.

17
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.150
What this will do is at a history had er to all messages containing a trail

18
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.640
off the components that the message has passed through.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.690
For example,

20
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.580
in this history had a value that have copied and pasted from the debug logging.

21
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.680
You can see that this message went from the registration

22
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.520
request channel adaptor to the Registration Request channel

23
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.040
and then to the registration service, activator registration event channel,

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.040
the Confirmation Mail Channel and finally to the outgoing mail channel.

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.100
When you start working with spring integration in your own applications,

26
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.000
you'll find that having the possibility to trace the path off messages can be really useful.
