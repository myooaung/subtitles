00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,740
[Autogenerated] you've learned a lot in this module.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,140
Let's do a quick summary.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,700
First we looked at Springwood Actuator,

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,220
which provides us with a way to look at what's going on in the

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,950
running application through the actuator and points we've added

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,630
Springwood actuated to the demo application,

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,740
and you've learned about a different endpoint.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,800
Then we focused on micro meter and the metrics.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,740
Endpoint Micro meter is the I'll for J for metrics.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,940
It enables you to record metrics using different kinds of meters,

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,440
such as counters, timers, engages.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,200
My Chrome media provides dimensional metrics,

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,210
which means that you can define tax on your metrics so that you can

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,140
drill down on the metrics in different dimensions.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,760
We took a look at how you can customize the media

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,590
registry with the meter registry,

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,540
customize her and how you can use a meter binder to ad metrics.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,040
Then we have looked into the metrics that spring integration provides.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,630
The most interesting of these is the spring got to integration not sent metric,

20
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,200
which provides a lot of information on the messages that are being

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,540
sent to message channels and message Chandor's.

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,750
Finally, we used influx DB and Grafana,

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,460
and you've gotten an idea of how you would use this to create a monitoring

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,500
dashboard for production application in this module.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,030
You've learned how to monitor what's happening in the spring

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,360
integration application in the next module.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:42,000
We're going to focus on managing and remotely controlling the application. Let's learn how to do that in the next module.
