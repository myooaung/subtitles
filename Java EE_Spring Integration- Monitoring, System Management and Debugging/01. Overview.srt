00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,670
[Autogenerated] If you have an application running in production,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,720
that's important for your business,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,100
then you want to be able to see how it's doing so that you can

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,940
respond quickly to fix problems if they occur.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,220
The spring Framework and Spring Boot, in particular,

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,790
provides very useful features for monitoring applications and for gathering.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,080
Metrics in this module will take a look at these features

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,040
and add them to the demo application.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,970
You will first learn about Spring Bootstrap curator,

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,000
which is spring boots main mechanism for monitoring

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,840
and managing running applications.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,340
Then we'll focus specifically on gathering metrics,

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,540
which is useful for monitoring how an application is doing overtime,

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,560
spring boot and spring integration.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,660
Use a library name to micro Media.

16
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,040
For this,

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,840
we'll take a look at how we can use micro meter in the demo application.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,560
Most of what you'll be learning in this module isn't

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,240
specific to spring integration.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,940
You can use Springwood actuator and micro meter in any Springwood application,

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,390
but spring integration does provide some specific metrics about message

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,570
channels and other spring integration components.

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,920
So we'll take a look at what these are to see.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,270
It'll work and make it more realistic.

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,670
We'll finish with the demo where we build a monitoring dashboard with

26
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,140
influx TB and Grafana so that you get a clear idea of how you would

27
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:36,000
use this in a production application. Let's start with spring boot actuator.
