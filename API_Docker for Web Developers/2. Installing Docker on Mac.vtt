00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.240
Let's take a look at how we can get started installing Docker on a Mac.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.980
So the first thing I'm going to do is come over to docker.com, and

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.630
then we can come to Developers, Getting started.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.490
That gets me to this page.

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.280
That menu certainly may change,

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.140
but otherwise, just do a little search for Docker Desktop.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.290
Now scrolling on down,

8
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.830
you'll notice that I have Docker Desktop, it

9
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.430
mentions something called Docker Hub,

10
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.510
which we'll talk about later, and then you also have an online

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.460
tool you can get too called Play with Docker. It's kind of a

12
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.540
browser‑based way to interact with Docker and a command line

13
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.440
right through your browser.

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.340
Now, with Docker Desktop, though, you'll notice that if I hover over it,

15
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.950
I can download for Mac, Windows, or if you're on Linux,

16
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.760
you can download Docker Engine,

17
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.300
and by clicking there it would take you to the different flavors of Linux,

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.590
and you can pick the appropriate engine. Now, for this particular

19
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.750
example though, I'll of course choose Download for Mac. And now that

20
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.170
this is done, we can simply double‑click it, this will extract it

21
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.580
and get it ready to run through, and then setup's pretty straight

22
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.740
forward you'll see.

23
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.240
Alright, so I can go ahead and drag that over to my Applications.

24
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.640
That will take a moment as it copies it.

25
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.560
And then from here,

26
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.010
I can go ahead and go into my apps, and we can

27
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.940
actually click on it to fire it up.

28
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.000
So I'm going to come on in, and I'll just search for Docker. There

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.200
it is. Click it. All right, now this will say,

30
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.410
hey,

31
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.730
I've downloaded it off the internet. Pretty standard. We'll hit Open, and

32
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.240
now you'll notice up in the corner here it's firing up.

33
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.540
Now, I've already had Docker on this machine,

34
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.460
so this will be slightly different than what you might see, but

35
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.580
once this whale is kind of done spinning up here,

36
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.140
you should see that Docker Engine has started.

37
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.340
There we go.

38
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.040
And now if I click on it,

39
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.580
you'll notice that Docker Desktop is running and that I

40
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.540
have some different menu items here.

41
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.740
Now,

42
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.240
one of the more important menu items you're going to see is Preferences on Mac.

43
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.540
So let me go to that real quick.

44
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.290
Now you'll see right off the bat that we can start Docker

45
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.740
when we log in, we can automatically check for updates,

46
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.570
include backups, send usage statistics,

47
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.690
all that fun stuff that you kind of see with a lot of applications. Down

48
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.930
here in the corner you'll notice that Docker is running. Now, I also,

49
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.750
because I've already had this running on this machine, have something

50
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.050
called Kubernetes that's running.

51
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.680
This is a way to run containers and orchestrate them in more robust

52
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.920
production‑type scenarios. Check out my Kubernetes for Developers course if

53
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.460
you're interested in more on that. Now coming back up,

54
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.210
we can go to Resources, and from here I can say, hey,

55
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.470
how many CPUs does Docker get? How much memory? What about the swap disk? And I

56
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.470
can adjust these things so that I don't eat up too much hard drive space and too

57
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.220
much memory because you can really max it out, and it will really push your

58
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.360
system to the max. Or you can really minimize it, and maybe Docker won't be

59
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.710
quite as fast or high performance,

60
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.880
but it would at least work if you have less memory on your machine. Now

61
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.250
we can also come on in, and you'll notice I have FILE SHARING. This is

62
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.820
going to be for something called volumes.

63
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.660
We're going to have a whole module on that coming up a little bit later in

64
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.650
the course, but this is basically a way for a running Docker container to

65
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.540
actually point back to a folder that's going to be on your local machine.

66
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.060
If we have to deal with proxies,

67
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.450
we could set up proxies here and even some network configuration,

68
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.940
which you normally don't need to mess around with at all.

69
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.680
Now coming on down. we have Docker Engine. This is one you

70
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.540
normally don't mess with at all.

71
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.440
We have Command Line features for experimental up‑and‑coming

72
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.400
features. We're not going to turn that on.

73
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.710
And then if you wanted,

74
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.560
you could turn on this other option called Kubernetes by

75
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.240
checking this Enable Kubernetes check box.

76
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.940
We're not going to worry about that one here,

77
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.040
but feel free to play with that if you'd like.

78
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.880
So that's what you're going to get out of the box, and what

79
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.640
we can also do is every now and then,

80
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.990
you might want to visually see what's going on with your containers.

81
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.380
So notice as I exited that screen,

82
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.040
I get to another dashboard screen, and currently I

83
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.040
don't have any containers running,

84
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.890
but it says I could run this command right here.

85
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.210
In fact,

86
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.180
we can just copy it, and then we could go to a command line, so

87
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.800
let me go ahead and do that. Let me go ahead and paste that in

88
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.840
now, and we'll go ahead and run it.

89
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.460
Now this just pulled an image that wasn't available on my

90
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.520
machine from something called Docker Hub down to my machine,

91
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.610
and it made this image available.

92
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.330
And we'll talk more about what that is and how you build custom

93
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.150
images as well throughout this course. Now from here,

94
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.900
let me close this, we'll come on back to our dashboard app now, and

95
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.790
notice that we have this condescending_ aryabhata, I'm not sure how

96
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.240
you say that, running on port 80 here. And we can click on it, we

97
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.230
can get log information, right now we don't have much, we can

98
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.340
inspect the container, get information about it,

99
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.420
get statistics about it, and this is all being done

100
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.640
visually through the dashboard.

101
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.040
Now I can also come up and stop the container, restart it,

102
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.720
go ahead and stop it again, and then we can delete it if we

103
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.830
wanted, and I wouldn't even have to worry about any of these

104
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.210
commands that we're going to learn later.

105
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.120
Now, I'm going to offer you want to know about these commands, because

106
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.460
we're going to be using them a lot, but this is a really nice feature of

107
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.840
Docker Desktop. It gives you this visual dashboard.

108
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.000
So that's an example of how to get it up and running on Mac. Now let's switch our focus to Windows.
