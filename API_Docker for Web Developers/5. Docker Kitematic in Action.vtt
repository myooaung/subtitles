00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.690
So let's see what we can do with Docker Kitematic and take a look at how we

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.380
can install it and then from there use it to search images,

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.940
pull those images down to our machine, and even run containers.

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.190
So the first thing we'll want to do is go to this GitHub URL,

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.780
github.com/docker/kitematic/releases It's important to note that

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.740
you can get Kitematic through Docker Toolbox,

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.540
but if you want the latest version of Kitematic,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.010
you would want to go to here.

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.090
Now once I've done that, I can download for Mac, Ubuntu.

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.990
I can download for Windows as you can see. We'll do Windows in this case.

11
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.140
And once this is done, we can open it,

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.640
and you'll notice I have a bunch of files in here.

13
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.550
So from here,

14
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.290
it's really just a matter of extract these to a folder of your choosing.

15
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.340
So I'm just going to select all these.

16
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.400
We'll go ahead and copy these. And I'm going to go to my

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.340
desktop for this case and just put a folder here.

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.690
We'll call it Kitematic.

19
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.560
But you, of course,

20
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.140
can put this wherever you like, and then we'll paste these in.

21
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.010
All right, now from here, we just need to find the exe,

22
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.040
and you'll see that right here, Kitematic.exe.

23
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.840
So we'll go ahead and click this.

24
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.770
You may be prompted with a message.

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.440
Just click on More info if you're on Windows. I'm going to hit Run anyway.

26
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.240
It just doesn't know what this program is.

27
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.540
And here we go.

28
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.470
So from here, I could log in to Docker Hub if I had a Docker Hub account,

29
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.030
which I do, but you may not.

30
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.840
So we're not going to worry about that.

31
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.030
You could sign up though if you'd like and get an account, and this would

32
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.880
allow you to store your images, your Docker images, up in Docker Hub. Now

33
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.860
I'm going to hit Skip For Now. Once Kitematic is up, now it's on us to find

34
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.280
the image that we'd actually like to run. So we could choose a Hello World

35
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.570
Nginx, Ghost for blogging,

36
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.480
Jenkins, Redis. You can even do a Minecraft server if you'd like

37
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.230
if you have the client and on and on and on.

38
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.330
So you'll see there's a lot of different options. Now I'm

39
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.540
going to go ahead and just type Nginx here.

40
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.940
And there's the Hello World.

41
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.520
But I'm going to go get the official Nginx right here. And notice

42
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.340
if I hit ..., I can get a little bit of info.

43
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.140
So I can get what the selected tag I want to do is. We could filter.

44
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.170
I'm going to go ahead and just leave the latest here,

45
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.440
but notice I can pick different versions of it.

46
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.240
That's kind of nice.

47
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.040
And then to actually download the image and run it, we can just hit Create here.

48
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.000
Now this is going to go off to Docker Hub and download the Nginx image.

49
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.540
This will be the latest version.

50
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.850
Now that that's downloaded,

51
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.410
it's going to go ahead and actually start up the container

52
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.250
now. And then once this is all ready to go,

53
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.060
then we can actually use this to call it.

54
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.740
Now notice up top, it says it's running.

55
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.210
I could stop it, restart it, exec into it, we'll learn

56
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.020
about what that is later in the course,

57
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.740
even view documentation about. If we click on this, it will take us up to

58
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.340
Docker Hub. And you can see that we can get information about Nginx.

59
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.540
Here's some of the different versions we have.

60
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.640
If we scroll on down, we'll even see how to use it from the command line.

61
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.170
Now what's nice about this though is that with Kitematic we can do

62
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.320
all this without actually typing the command.

63
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.940
So let's go back to Kitematic now.

64
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.840
And if I come on over to Settings,

65
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.690
notice I can get some general information. So we can get some environment

66
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.530
variables it's using in the container, the host name and ports. So it looks

67
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.840
like there's a port 80 running in the container,

68
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.240
but we can call 32769 to actually call it from outside through the browser,

69
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.950
for example. We'll learn later about something called volumes, this

70
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.330
one doesn't have any. Networking, we'll talk about what bridge

71
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.340
networks are, and even some advanced features.

72
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.980
Let's come on back to the ports though,

73
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.620
and I'm going to copy this. And then let's run to the browser here, and

74
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.640
we'll go to this localhost 32769. And there we go.

75
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.540
And now we have Nginx up and running.

76
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.060
What's great about this is number 1, we really didn't

77
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.490
have to know anything about Docker.

78
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.540
We could just use Kitematic to help get us started.

79
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.800
But number 2, it makes it really easy to start these containers, restart them,

80
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.110
stop them, delete them, and I'll show you some of that right now.

81
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.740
So let's go back to Kitematic, and let's just go back to home here.

82
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.340
So first off, we can see that the browser hit it.

83
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.540
Notice we have some logs here.

84
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.940
And then from here, I could stop it.

85
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.040
We could start it back up.

86
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.380
Notice it's running again.

87
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.360
We could restart it. We can shell into it or exec into it.

88
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.030
That opens a command prompt here, and now I could do things

89
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.920
like show me all the files and folders. And then you

90
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.640
already saw we can view the docs.

91
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.340
Let me go ahead and stop it though.

92
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.050
Here it is.

93
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.700
And then notice, we have a little X here.

94
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.540
If I hit that, we can now remove it. And there we go, it's gone.

95
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.940
So that's an example of some of the fundamentals of

96
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.840
getting started with Kitematic.

97
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.680
Now I mentioned earlier, we're not going to be using

98
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.910
this throughout the rest of the course.

99
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.780
We're going to learn how to do the actual commands. But it's a great

100
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:35.000
way to get started and play with Docker images and containers and see how you can get started using them.
