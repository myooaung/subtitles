00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.500
Once we have Docker Toolbox or Docker Desktop installed and running,

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.750
we can start to use something called the Docker Client.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.190
Now Docker Client is a way to interact with the actual

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.420
engine behind the scenes or Docker daemon,

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.690
you may hear,

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.240
and this will allow us to run commands that can then interact with images,

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.660
Docker images or take those images and make running

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.930
containers using other types of commands,

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.190
and this is all done through the Docker Client,

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.640
and again, this works with Docker Toolbox and with Docker Desktop.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.790
As mentioned, this tool, Docker Client,

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.090
is going to allow us to interact with the Docker Engine,

13
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.680
the Docker daemon that's running behind the scenes. Through using

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.710
this tool, we can build and manage images. We can then take those

15
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.780
images and run and manage containers.

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.140
So let's look at some of the commands that you could use as

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.640
you start to work with the Docker Client.

18
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.010
Now, some of the key commands are going to be shown here,

19
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.490
and this is a small subset of the commands.

20
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.240
There are quite a few that you can run.

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.940
One of the big ones you'll use, though, is called docker pull.

22
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.560
You might find a Node.js image or a ASP.NET or PHP or whatever it may be,

23
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.650
you might have an image up in Docker Hub and you want to pull that

24
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.080
from Docker Hub down to your development environment.

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.740
Well we can use the Docker pull command to do that. Once we have an image we

26
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.690
can run it. We can use docker run to do that. We simply say docker run and

27
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.220
then give it the name of the image that we want to run. We can also list all

28
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.330
of our images by simply running docker images. And then when it comes to

29
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.710
containers, we can run docker ps,

30
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.340
and this will list all of the different containers that we might have available.

31
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.040
Now, once you have the containers and the images and everything available,

32
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.300
we can then start containers, we can stop containers, and do all kinds of

33
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.940
things that we're going to look at throughout the course.

34
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.540
And so before we go too far, though,

35
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.870
let's take a look at using the Docker Client with these commands and see how

36
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:16.000
they can interact with our different images and containers that we may have or that we might want to grab from Docker Hub.
