00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.340
Let's take a look at another tool in the Docker toolbox called Docker Machine.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.540
Now Docker Machine can be used to create and manage your local

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.360
machines that you're going to be working,

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.540
for instance, on your development environment machine.

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.450
It can also be used to create and manage different cloud machines,

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.640
such as ones on AWS or Azure or other cloud‑based providers.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.240
But we're going to mainly be using it to manage our local machines.

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.400
Now, as mentioned, if you're on Mac or Windows,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.150
you are going to have VirtualBox because Docker out of the box is either

10
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.570
going to be running when the Docker containers run,

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.140
I should say, on either Linux or on a Windows server.

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.540
Now we're going to mainly leverage the Linux features here.

13
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.730
And so for us to interact with that, we need a way to host it.

14
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.040
And that, of course, is what VirtualBox does.

15
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.340
And so Docker Machine will let us start and stop and

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.540
create different virtual machine images.

17
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.000
Now it can also configure the environment so that when you pull up a

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.170
command line bash type shell in Windows or on Mac,

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.230
that you can use the Docker commands to manage your images,

20
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.640
start and stop your containers, and perform those types of operations.

21
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.500
Now there are a few commands that we need to know to get started.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
And I'm just going to show you a quick list of a few of the key commands.

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.560
These are not things you need to memorize because I'm going

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440
to be using these throughout the course.

25
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.640
But they are good to know.

26
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.290
So one of the commands is called docker‑machine ls.

27
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.940
Now Docker Machine is the actual command line tool,

28
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.340
and then ls is the command we're going to run.

29
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.870
So this would list all the different machines that we

30
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.780
can issue Docker commands against.

31
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.640
Now what do I mean by machine?

32
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.520
Well, out of the box,

33
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.110
you're going to see in a moment that when you install Docker,

34
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.040
you're going to get one VirtualBox machine set up called default.

35
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.320
Now you can certainly set up others, but when you first get started,

36
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.560
one is good enough.

37
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.920
And so we'll have default,

38
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.210
and we can use Docker Machine to list that and any others that you might create.

39
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.320
That's what the ls command does.

40
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.310
Now we can also start and stop our virtual machines,

41
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.810
and so dockermachine start, and then machine name would be whatever it is.

42
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.140
As mentioned, default is the default name of the machine,

43
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.940
so we can use the start command or we could use the stop command.

44
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.780
That's how you can easily start and stop one of the VirtualBox images

45
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.850
on Mac or Windows if you'd like. We can also configure the environment

46
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.380
for a machine. This is really important,

47
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.540
and I'll be showing this in just a moment.

48
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.140
But when you first pull up a command line terminal window,

49
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.410
you're going to want to issue some Docker commands to manage your

50
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.450
images, your containers, and things like that,

51
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.860
and you first need to make sure that Docker knows what machine it's going to be

52
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.070
interacting with during that terminal session. So you'll see in a moment I'm

53
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.340
going to use docker‑machine env command to do that.

54
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.390
Now we can also get the IP address of a given machine, and that's useful as we

55
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.940
start to test our containers that are running. For instance,

56
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.910
we might pull up a browser and want to call into the

57
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.640
machine and call a specific container,

58
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.120
and we'll be demonstrating that as we move along as well

59
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.810
throughout the course. So these are some of the key commands

60
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.590
that you can use for Docker Machine.

61
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.810
There are certainly others,

62
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.000
but these are the ones you need to know to get started. So let's take a look at an example of some of these commands in action.
