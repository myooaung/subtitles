00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.830
Once we have Docker Toolbox installed,

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.220
we can get directly to the Kitematic tool that showed earlier,

3
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.500
but we can also get to the Docker quickstart terminal.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.920
And this is a terminal window, a command line window,

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.640
that you can get to to interact with Docker tools such as docker‑machine.

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.130
Now what I normally do is drag and drop this down to my doc,

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.520
and you'll see already have it here.

8
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.440
So I'm going to close this one.

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.140
We'll come on down and open it up.

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.930
And the first time this fires up,

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.050
if your virtual machine is not running, your VirtualBox

12
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.370
machine that Docker Toolbox and stalls,

13
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.020
then it's going to go ahead and run a machine,

14
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110
and it's going to give it a name of default.

15
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.300
You'll see that right here.

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.440
And it's going to take a moment to start this machine up.

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.080
Now from here,

18
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.910
it's going to copy over some certificates and do some other configuration.

19
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.440
And once you get to the nice little whale image,

20
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.200
you'll know that Docker is now configured as it says

21
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.400
to use this machine called default,

22
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.160
and it even gives you the IP address of the machine

23
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.480
that VirtualBox is actually hosting.

24
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.920
So what is default?

25
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.270
Well,

26
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.070
default is our VirtualBox Linux machine that we're actually

27
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940
going to be issuing Docker commands against.

28
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.670
But before we do that,

29
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.650
the first thing you want to do is make sure that your terminal

30
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.040
window is linked up to the proper machine.

31
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.060
Now ours obviously is because I have my default

32
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.440
machine is all wired up here it says.

33
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.640
And once that's done, we can start working with these machines and using them.

34
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.290
So one of the key things you'll want to know about

35
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.770
is things like the IP address.

36
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310
And you'll see that, yeah, you can see it here.

37
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.760
But as you start issuing commands or maybe you type clear and clear it all out,

38
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.740
you might forget what that is.

39
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.870
So there's a couple ways we can get the IP address of the running

40
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.870
machine that is hosting our Linux server in this case.

41
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.890
And one of those is we can say docker‑machine ls.

42
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.290
And the ls command will automatically let us know all the machines that are

43
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.520
running on this particular box on my development machine.

44
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.190
Looks like I have one called default.

45
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.970
It's running through VirtualBox.

46
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.810
It's up and running, and there's the IP you can see.

47
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.820
If I just wanted to get the IP address though,

48
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.160
I could say docker‑machine ip for the name of the machine.

49
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.830
Now you would have to know the name by default.

50
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.300
It's called default.

51
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.360
But you can create other machines as well.

52
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.490
Now we're not going to do that.

53
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.800
We'll just use the default machine in this course,

54
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.810
but it is possible to create others.

55
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.830
So I'm going to hit Enter, and you'll notice I can get the IP address.

56
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.810
Now, likewise, if I just want to get the status,

57
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.540
you'll see the state which is running.

58
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.570
And if I want to get it for a particular machine,

59
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.440
we could say docker‑machine, give me the status for default,

60
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.540
and it's up and running.

61
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.240
Now from here, I can also start and stop machines.

62
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.000
Now this one is obviously already started,

63
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.540
but we could say docker‑machine stop default.

64
00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.840
And this will take a moment to run,

65
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.400
but this will actually shut down the running virtual machine.

66
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.620
And typically, if I'm not using Docker on a particular day, I will shut it down.

67
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.860
You'll see it was pretty quick to do this because that'll free up some

68
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.840
memory on your machine if you happen to need it.

69
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.110
But a lot of the time I'll just leave it up because I'm

70
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.760
jumping in and out of Docker throughout the day when I'm on

71
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.240
a particular development project.

72
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.050
Now we can also say docker‑machine start default,

73
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.410
and this will now start the machine back up.

74
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.300
Now, once again, when you run the quickstart terminal,

75
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.450
if it's not already started up, it'll start it up for us.

76
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.080
So you kind of don't have to use the start as much.

77
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.340
But every now and then you might shut it down yourself

78
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.240
and then want to manually restart it.

79
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.650
Now while this is running,

80
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.940
I'm going to go ahead and open up just a regular command terminal window here.

81
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.760
All right, so I already have my running Docker Machine one,

82
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.540
but I'm going to do just a new window.

83
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.090
Now because I didn't use the quickstart terminal,

84
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.580
it didn't run any of the early shell scripts that

85
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.360
kick us into the world of Docker.

86
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.230
I'm just in normal terminal mode.

87
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.470
In fact,

88
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.700
let me just make this a little bigger so we don't get

89
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.340
confused by the one in the background.

90
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.350
And now let's go ahead and try to do something like

91
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.150
docker‑machine ip of default.

92
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.110
And you'll notice I can get to that, but if I start to run commands,

93
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.860
and we'll learn about some of these Docker client

94
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.680
commands a little later in this module, but I'm going to do one called docker ps,

95
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.970
and you'll notice I get an error. Cannot connect to the Docker daemon.

96
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.940
Is the docker daemon running on this host?

97
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.410
And might, the first time you see this, do what I did and go well,

98
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.760
wait a sec, I know the virtual machine is running,

99
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.840
so what's the problem here?

100
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.380
Well, if you go through the quickstart terminal,

101
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.160
you probably won't have to do this.

102
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.610
But if you want to either A, configure a different terminal to use the

103
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.960
default machine so that you can issue Docker commands against it such as

104
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.780
this ps, ps would list all of our containers,

105
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.260
by the way,

106
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.680
but we'll learn about that coming up, or B, we might want to hook this

107
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.740
terminal up to a different machine other than default.

108
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.560
What we can do is wire up this terminal to the machine that we want to

109
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.200
issue Docker commands against. And the way we can do that is through

110
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.780
another command called docker‑machine env.

111
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.140
And then if I just do this, we'll get an error.

112
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.090
But we have to tell it the machine name.

113
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.040
So we'll say default.

114
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.420
And what this will do is add some‑‑‑ You'll see kind of

115
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.320
variables here, into our environment variables.

116
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.390
And then it's going to say run this command to configure your

117
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.030
shell. Now when we ran the quickstart terminal,

118
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.880
it's already doing this behind the scenes to hook us up to the

119
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.240
default because that's the one you get out of the box.

120
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.150
But if I wanted to either hook up to a different machine,

121
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.560
then I could have said docker‑machine environment whatever

122
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.140
that other machine is, my machine maybe.

123
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.350
And then what you have to do is run this eval command.

124
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.420
So you literally just copy this, paste it down, and then run that.

125
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.500
And now when I run docker show me all the containers, which is the ps

126
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.340
command, you'll notice that at least it works. Now I don't have any.

127
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.820
We'll be doing that shortly. So that's a really,

128
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.900
really nice tip that I know I struggled with initially when I got into Docker

129
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.240
because I didn't realize that you had to hook up the terminal window if you

130
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.090
didn't use the Docker quickstart terminal anyway to the actual machine that

131
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.540
you want to issue the commands against.

132
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.340
So that's a quick look at the docker env command as well.

133
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.960
All right, so now we've seen several of the commands.

134
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.840
You can actually list all of them by saying docker‑machine and just hit Enter,

135
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.750
and this will list all of the different commands that we have available.

136
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.040
You'll see there's quite a list here.

137
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.340
A lot of stuff you can do,

138
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.150
but we're now kind of going over the key ones, the environment command,

139
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.500
the ip, the status, the ls, the start and the stop.

140
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.550
You can even restart a machine. Very similar, just

141
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.240
docker‑machine restart default.

142
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.340
And there's even ways you can create new machines.

143
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.850
If you wanted to have different versions of Linux

144
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.060
or something like that running,

145
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.440
then potentially you could create a different machine if you'd like.

146
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.480
So that's a look at some of the key Docker commands that you can run that

147
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.790
are specific to Docker Machine. And again, Docker Machine is part of the

148
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.910
Docker Toolbox that we've already installed,

149
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:31.000
and now we have that up and running. And we can now interact with that machine, and that's what it looks like from a Mac standpoint.
