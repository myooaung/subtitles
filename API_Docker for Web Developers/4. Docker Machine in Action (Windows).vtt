00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.560
Whether you're working on a Mac or on Windows,

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.300
you can run the same exact Docker machine commands.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.830
In fact,

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.240
you'll run a Bash shell even if you're on Windows as you'll see in a moment.

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.430
Now we've already installed the Docker toolbox so it

6
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.060
adds some icons on my desktop area.

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.460
What I like to do is drag down the Docker

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.550
Quickstart terminal down to my toolbar,

9
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640
so I'm going to go ahead and open that up,

10
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.710
and you can see that it automatically fires up the

11
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.940
virtual machine called default.

12
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.350
This is running as a Linux virtual machine in

13
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.190
VirtualBox and gives me the IP address.

14
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.510
Now, one of the things that's a little bit different,

15
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.640
though,

16
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.600
on the Windows side is that you'll note that I'm not in a normal DOS mode here.

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.470
I'm in a type of Bash shell, and so I can run commands,

18
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.660
for instance, like ls,

19
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.400
which would be very similar to dir that you're used to in

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.920
Windows and that'll list where I'm at all,

21
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.150
the files and folders and things.

22
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.570
I can type clear kind of like cls in windows and notice that clears

23
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.170
off the screen and there is a lot of other things we could do that

24
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.040
are related to more of a Bash environment.

25
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.240
So what this does is it installs this Bash environment for

26
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.310
Windows and that's a good thing actually because these same

27
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.830
commands that we can run on Mac and Linux,

28
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.840
you can run here on Windows.

29
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.940
So let's get started by jumping into the Docker machine command itself.

30
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.420
Earlier, when I pulled this up,

31
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.280
you saw that we had a Docker machine called default,

32
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.340
and again, it listed the IP.

33
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.760
And so,

34
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.350
I can list all the machines on my Windows environment by

35
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.030
saying docker‑machine ls and this will now list that I

36
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.670
have a machine called default, it's running on virtualbox,

37
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.600
the status is it's up and running,

38
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.440
and there is the IP address you can see for that machine.

39
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.900
Now, if I wanted to get to the IP on windows for that particular machine,

40
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.970
we could say docker‑machine ip for the name of the machine.

41
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.810
So you simply take that name there, hit Enter,

42
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.190
and there we go,

43
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.270
and I could also get the status by doing docker‑machine status for default,

44
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.820
and you can see it's up and running, so ls will get you all the machines,

45
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.400
but if you just want to get a particular property of that

46
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.740
machines such as the IP or the status, then you can run those commands as well.

47
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.240
Now, when we ran the quickstart terminal,

48
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.970
this actually ran some behind the scene scripts that made it possible to run

49
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.570
other Docker commands against this machine called default and one of the

50
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.430
commands we're going to learn about later is docker ps.

51
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.000
Now, if you watched all of this for the Mac side of it,

52
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.160
this is going to look exactly the same and that's kind of the point of it,

53
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.390
but if you are just jumping right to this Windows information,

54
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.700
Docker PS will list the running containers that we have and we'll

55
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.080
talk more about this coming up later in the module,

56
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.680
but you'll notice that it works, alright,

57
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.650
and the reason this works is because when I did the quickstart terminal,

58
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.540
it already made sure that my default virtual machine was running,

59
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.400
if it wasn't, it starts it up,

60
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.510
and it hooks this terminal window here to that running

61
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.880
machine so that when I issue commands,

62
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.140
many of which we'll learn about a little bit later here in this module,

63
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.410
such as docker ps, those commands work.

64
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.740
If we weren't linked to the machine,

65
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.660
then we'd have some problems and we couldn't run the commands.

66
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.940
Now,

67
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.750
one way you can switch machines or link it up yourself is you can run

68
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.860
docker‑machine env for the name of the machine that you want to hook

69
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.880
to and what this will do is it'll set up some environment variables

70
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.910
for us, you'll see those there, and then it tells me go ahead and run

71
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.040
this eval statement.

72
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.620
Now you'll notice there is a space here, and so, unfortunately,

73
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.560
if you run it as they sort of show you,

74
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.480
let me just copy that down, we'll paste that, we're going

75
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.640
to get an error because of the space.

76
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.440
It didn't know what to do.

77
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.210
Now we could just kind of abbreviate this and run docker‑machine directly

78
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.880
because it is a known command, you've already seen that up here, but if we

79
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.740
want to leave what they give us and just fix it up,

80
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.460
I'm going to hit home to go to the beginning and I'm just going to add a

81
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.550
single apostrophe and we're going to wrap this path,

82
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.040
let me do and and we'll kind of back it in here.

83
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.120
Alright, now it'll know that we have some spaces in our path, in this case,

84
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.300
in our folders, and now it's going to work appropriately.

85
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.220
Now we were already hooked into default so that was a very redundant

86
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.560
thing to do, but it's good to know because if you ever for whatever

87
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.570
reason want to switch to a different machine,

88
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.320
you'll have to set the Docker environment to something other than

89
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.640
default, maybe my machine if that's what it was called.

90
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.150
Alright,

91
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.250
so the last thing is if you want to see all the commands Docker machine has,

92
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.700
you can say Docker machine and this'll list everything you can do do.

93
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.640
So you'll see there are quite a few commands here.

94
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.150
We can go in, and in fact, I'm going to show a start and a stop to wrap up,

95
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.850
but we can start a machine, we can stop a machine.

96
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.020
I've shown you the status, the ls, and the ip, but there

97
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.170
is a lot of other things you can do.

98
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.730
You can actually create new machines.

99
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.310
We're not going to do that because the default

100
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.040
machine has everything we need for now,

101
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.310
but there is a lot of information. You can inspect and kill

102
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.840
a machine and do all kinds of fun stuff.

103
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.930
We're focusing right now on the key commands that you

104
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.740
need to know to get started here.

105
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.490
The last thing I want to show you is that you can also come

106
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.310
in and say docker‑machine start or stop.

107
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.430
Obviously, default is already started.

108
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.640
We've seen the ls and we can see it's running.

109
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.720
But I could also come in and say docker‑machine stop default. And now,

110
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.160
that's going to stop that virtual machine, and then likewise,

111
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.550
I could say docker‑machine start default and there is even a restart.

112
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.400
So let's go in and now that that one is stopped,

113
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.040
which was pretty quick, you could see, we can start default,

114
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.300
and this will take just a little bit more time to start it back up, but

115
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.670
then we'll have a running virtual machine again and we'll be kind of

116
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.540
ready to go. Now if when you start a machine,

117
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.690
if for some reason when you issue Docker commands,

118
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.020
you get a error, then you'll need to run that Docker environment,

119
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.040
the env command that I showed and then do that eval copy and paste thing.

120
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.810
So that's an example of how you can run Docker machine

121
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.920
commands on a Windows environment, and again,

122
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.690
if you happen to watch the earlier one on how to do this on a Mac,

123
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.040
you should now see that the commands are the same,

124
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.450
which is really, really nice.

125
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.150
It doesn't matter what your on Linux, Windows,

126
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.880
Mac,

127
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.430
you're going to be running the same exact commands. And so once you learn

128
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.840
these core commands that I'm going to focus on here,

129
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.000
you're pretty much good to go regardless of what operating system you're going to be running against.
