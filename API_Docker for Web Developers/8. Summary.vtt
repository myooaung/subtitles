00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.550
To wrap this module up,

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.410
we've learned that Dockerfile is nothing more than a simple

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.890
text file that has specific instructions.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.170
You can say what the image that you're going to be creating is based

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.440
on. That's the FROM instruction. We can run different types of

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.240
commands, such as npm install or many others.

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.420
We can define environment variables, set the entry point that

8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.940
will run as you run the container, and much,

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.440
much more.

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.690
Now the FROM is where it all starts as mentioned, and this has to go at the

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.100
very beginning of the file because we have to know what is the base image, and

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.630
then once we've added the other instructions we can,

13
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.230
go ahead and use the Docker build command, tag the image,

14
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.340
and then it will be available on your local system.

15
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.480
Now,

16
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.360
if you do want to make it available either remotely for other

17
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.670
team members or maybe even for the public,

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.760
then we can push that image up to Docker Hub, and that's very easy to do,

19
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.340
once you've logged in, using the Docker push command.

20
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.740
So now you've seen the process of building custom images,

21
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.040
getting those images working as containers, and now, what we're going to talk

22
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.000
about moving forward is how we could start to orchestrate multiple containers and have them start communicating with each other.
