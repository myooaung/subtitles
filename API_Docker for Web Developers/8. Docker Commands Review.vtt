00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's go ahead and do a quick review of some of the key commands so we

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.140
cement our knowledge and make it easier to remember them.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.260
So some of the image commands we talked about were docker poll.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.440
We talked about docker images lists all the images you have on your machine.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.650
And then we talked about how you can remove an image with docker rmi,

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.940
and you give it the image ID that's available when you run docker images.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.890
Now when it comes to container commands,

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.040
we talked about docker run, and the image name.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.270
And docker run, interestingly enough,

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.540
will actually pull the image if it's not already found locally.

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.440
So although technically you run docker poll first and then

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.270
run docker run, if you want to save a step,

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.810
you could actually run docker run and then give it the image name.

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.090
And if it doesn't find it,

15
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.740
it'll go download it and then we'll run that container.

16
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.880
We also talked about how you can list the containers.

17
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.470
Now if you only want the running container, so you could do docker ps.

18
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.330
But if you want to see all of them, you would add â€‘a to the end of that.

19
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.240
And finally, we talked about docker rm, which can be used to remove a container.

20
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.060
So that's an example of some of the key commands that

21
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.710
we've covered throughout this module,

22
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.000
and I hope that helps cement them a little better in your mind. We'll be using them throughout the rest of the course, actually.
