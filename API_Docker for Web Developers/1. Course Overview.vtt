00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.440
Welcome to the Docker for Web Developers course.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.930
My name is Dan Wahlin,

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.130
and I'm a web developer and software architect and really excited about

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.240
the potential that Docker offers us as web developers.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.760
Now, any time you start with a new technology,

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.040
you want to know the benefits that it's going to bring to you,

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.310
and we're going to start with that at the very beginning of the course.

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.710
From there,

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.200
we'll jump into installing Docker on a Windows machine and on a Mac and learn

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.870
about the tools and commands you can use to work with Docker,

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.590
including key Docker client commands you can run, such as docker pull,

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.640
which will pull images from Docker Hub.

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.720
We'll learn about what an image is,

14
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.300
how you can convert that into a running container, and how the

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.640
layered file system plays a role behind the scenes.

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.880
By the time we're done,

17
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.920
we'll have an entire development environment set up using

18
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.100
something called Docker Compose. And this is a really powerful

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.540
technology for the development environment,

20
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.080
and you'll see the process from start to finish of

21
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.740
building a fully functional website.

22
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.760
So we have a lot of great stuff to cover in this course.

23
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.000
As I said, I'm really excited about the technology, so let's jump into the official agenda for the course.
