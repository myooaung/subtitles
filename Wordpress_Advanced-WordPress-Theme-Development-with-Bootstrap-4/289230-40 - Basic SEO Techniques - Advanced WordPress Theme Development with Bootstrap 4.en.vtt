00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
Hello,

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.620
guys.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.110
This is a very special lesson in which we're going to talk about a very important issue.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.050
Search engine optimization,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.600
also known by the Acronym S C O.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.590
Okay,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.320
first of all,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.480
this course is not about s you.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.680
So the idea behind this lesson is not to bring your tips about how to rank your side on

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.290
Google.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.240
By the way,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.700
this course doesn't teach you only to create a simple website.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.650
The main go is to teach you how to create WordPress themes,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
that it's more than a website over time.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.800
You understand that Although it seems the same thing creating WordPress themes,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.340
it's a much more comprehensive subject.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.670
But what I am saying all this simply because I believe that the rial responsive for making

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.090
the sides rank wow in search engines like Google is the site owner.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.220
It is the content that he or she generates through the site that you make it more visible

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.400
to search engines.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.210
However,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.000
that doesn't change the fact that your theme has to lend a helping hand.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.130
So you,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.200
as a WordPress team developer,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.230
must be aware of the fact that your fame at least can offer a couple of good practice,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.100
which in the end will have anyone who uses your theme or,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.290
if you don't help,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.390
at least do nothing to get in the way.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.610
That said,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.850
let's see what our theme can do to have anyone who used its rank better on search engines.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.100
I start off with header dot PHP file.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.070
In fact,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.150
most of our tests will focus on this file.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.050
We also need to inspect the things source called to check.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.750
If our changes are working,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.650
let's get started.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.440
So go ahead and open.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.950
They had heard that PHP file.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.350
As you can see,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.590
you're still including some fixed values in the eight email cold,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.800
for example,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.810
the character encoding Acela's The Language attribute are all fixed values,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.670
but these values cannot be fixed in my let's imagine,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.650
Your fame will be downloaded by someone in China.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.000
For sure,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.520
this person's WordPress installation will not be in English.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.660
Therefore,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.950
these two values have to be added according to the data provided by WordPress itself.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.360
Fortunately,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.870
we can solve this easily,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.540
using two functions for the language attribute.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.170
Let's remove this here and called language attributes function,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.970
so whenever insulation language changes,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.950
your theme will change this value dynamically.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:48.330
Let's see if it works as open our theme and check the source cold notice here that the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.740
current language is US English.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.850
Let's go to the dashboards,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.140
Go over to settings,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.080
General,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.120
and they're gonna change here,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.860
decides language to Brazilian Portuguese.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.150
Now looking at the source code again,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.850
See here that the language has now changed.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.210
Now it's Brazilian Portuguese.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:28.210
Let's go back to English now for the character encoding.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.450
Let's use a fairly versatile function called block info.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.780
Previously,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.740
when People Butte WordPress themes,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.780
they used this function block info for many things.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.250
But nowadays it's the usage is quite limited.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:51.350
Let's exclude this value here and call blocking so and passed with a parameter called char

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.850
set.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.980
And that's it basically things one changed in the source code.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.150
But at least we are sure that everything's more dynamic now.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.580
Now a very important point since WordPress version 4.1.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.550
Several Met attacks are no longer used directly in the head portion.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.940
One of the tags that it's no longer used here is titled Really Title.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.870
So here,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.290
now html Head.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.110
We're gonna just remove that tag,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.070
but then you must be thinking this guy's totally crazy.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.830
The tight attack is one of the most important,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.750
if not the most important of all for the correcting decks and oversight by search engines.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.520
Well,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.400
let me explain them or else you'll think I'm kind of crazy.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.760
Since version 4.1,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.380
WordPress recommends that this stack is included not in the head portion but through the

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.970
functions that PHP file using themes.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.670
Support?

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.180
Yes,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.050
things support.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.510
So let's open,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.060
have the functions file and include one more thing.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.750
Support.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.720
The whole thing is very simple.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.550
Let's just pass the title tag parameter and you're good to go.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.050
So add themes supports title Take.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.760
Now,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.670
when we look at the updated source code of the thing,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.550
it magically have the title tank.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.440
And,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.040
of course,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.250
the value over I,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.390
according to the page,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.890
visited.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.920
Okay.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.530
And as for the Automat,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.950
attacks like description offer keywords.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.860
Well,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.920
we're not going to include these are dramatic attacks in our thing.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.670
To understand why we have to visit the WordPress Codex.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.220
So we're here in the Codex here on this page,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.210
who's think I will make available to you?

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.810
Of course.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.240
The WordPress team explains that over the years,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.070
many of these Met attacks no longer makes sense.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.770
Like,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.590
for example,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.350
the keywords met attack which could go no longer uses because many people abused it down

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.710
here,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.070
they have a phrase that I think it's great to explain this.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.750
They say,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.770
without a doubt,

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.970
content is the biggest contributor to search engine page ranking.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.670
So if you want to raise your rankings,

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.650
make sure you have quality content.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.150
OK,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.840
but if you still want to use some of thes met attacks like description,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.740
for example,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.440
well,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.460
on the same page,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.250
the WordPress guys explain how to do it,

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.580
so just go ahead and follow their instructions.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.320
I'm not going to include any other Met attack here because even the native WordPress teams

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.290
no longer used this mad attacks.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.590
If you think I'm crazy again,

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.150
you can see by yourself.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.630
See no more Met attacks here,

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.450
strangely as it may seem.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.730
Okay.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.890
As I said earlier,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.680
this course is not about a CEO.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.250
So I just went over here to talk about some good practice for you to apply when viewed in

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.090
your theme's.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.710
By doing this,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.090
you already have a good way to help those who will certainly use your theme.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.560
So I hope you like the tips.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.230
And I hope also that you feel like you learn something new.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.120
And I would catch you guys on my next video,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.250
actually on their new section.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.150
So And you there.
