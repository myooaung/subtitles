00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
Hey, what's up, guys?

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.825
Welcome to you one more lesson.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:10.725
In today's lesson, you're gonna learn what is the famous WordPress loop and how it works.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:15.630
Before you really get into the explanation of what the loop is,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.785
i'm going to show you what I've repaired to streamline this lesson.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.350
So hearing the index.html file,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.100
I have already added the classes related to bootstrap.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.850
You can see here that I just added the containers,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.385
rows and columns related classes for each section of the file.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:39.595
You have already learned how to do that in the previous lessons.

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:43.550
Thus, I really don't think there's any more secret for you here.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.070
Here in the footer dot PHP file,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.919
I've created a div called copyright,

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:51.290
also inside the Bootstrap structure.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.065
So there's nothing really new here,

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:57.545
only HTML tags and CSS classes.

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:00.500
And we have created a new menu to.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.440
This was left as an exercise to license ago.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.805
Remember, and see if your solution looks like mine.

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:11.750
If it's not, you can pause this video and correct it.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.100
Or you can copy this lines of code from the files available for download.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.765
As you know, they are all available in the first section of this course.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:25.250
In my case, the menu slug is footer underscore menu,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.380
but yours may have a different name.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.735
No problem, as long as this is the same as defined in the functions file.

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:37.775
So this leg here must be the same as the string we have.

00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:38.765
Here.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:42.560
I also added this new menu in the CSS file,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.650
so it will display inline as well.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.170
Another thing we did was create in the administration stream new posts.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.505
These are only simple posts with some dummy content.

00:01:55.505 --> 00:02:00.575
Each of them are within some categories which have also created.

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:03.050
And they have a couple of tags shoe.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.915
This will help us show the post content,

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:08.570
which is the purpose of today's lesson,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.850
is you then create your own posts.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.525
Okay?

00:02:11.525 --> 00:02:13.430
I believe you know how to do that.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.495
Just go over to the post menu and create your posts there.

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:21.140
That said, let's move on to today's lesson.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.730
Today, we are going to learn how to make our theme more dynamic.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.960
It you'll be then the first time something we're really happened when

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.399
we click on any link and change the content of posts and pages.

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.755
So what is the WordPress login?

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:39.140
If you look at the WordPress codecs,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.705
we will find the explanation there.

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:45.454
So here the WordPress theme says,

00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:50.405
the loop is that PHP code used by WordPress to display posts.

00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:52.879
And here's a key question.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.265
What do we mean by posts?

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:58.400
Posts are not just regular posts,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.300
but static pages are considered to be posted to,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.745
for example, the About Us page,

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:07.560
the contact page, etc.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.630
Using the loop WordPress processes

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.220
each post to be displayed on the current page. And Fermat said.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.785
According to how it matches specified criteria within the loop, tags.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:26.465
Within the loop, we can tell WordPress to show the title of each post,

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:28.745
the contents of the entire post,

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:32.540
or is snippets of this content, the tags used,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.945
the categories of dispose of this is done

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:40.175
with a combination of HTML tags and PHP commands.

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:45.905
Any HTML or PHP code in the loop will be processed on niche post.

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:49.940
Then it should serve as a template to display our posts.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.660
Well, to illustrate what this loop will be in practice,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.810
let's open the WordPress themes repository page.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:10.210
Here on the page I want to find a theme called Florida. And he really is.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.345
I'll go ahead and click on More info.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:16.490
And then on preview.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.530
At the top of the theme.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.025
There are several examples of what a loop looks like.

00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:27.590
But let's scroll down to the bottom of the page.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.595
This region shown here,

00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:35.350
which shows the category,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.400
the post title, the author, the publication date,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.625
an excerpt from the post,

00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:45.950
and the ellipses and link that leads to the full post,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.840
as you can see, is repeated in several other parts of the site.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.905
All of this can be created inside the WordPress loop.

00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:57.155
Let's go back to sublime them.

00:04:57.155 --> 00:05:00.350
We'll be creating our loop right here,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.914
where we have the word news.

00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:05.405
Let's make some space here.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:10.040
And let's start creating the loop inside PHP tags.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.845
Let's start by saying the following.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.055
If WordPress have any posts,

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:26.660
if health posts we want for expresses something while there are posts, do something else.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:36.215
So while have posts and that something else is simply bring in the post for us.

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:38.825
The post.

00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:42.620
So while half bows the post.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.230
Let's just type in some commands to make it easier to understand what is going on.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.560
So if you have any posts published,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.975
why WordPress can find those posts?

00:05:53.975 --> 00:05:59.690
It will show them on screen regardless of how many posts are found in the database.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.230
Later on, you'll see that we can even

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.310
control the amount of both returned by the database.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.945
And those posts will be called Here in this exact space here.

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:15.170
But according to some format and that Fermat,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.685
we're going to define it soon.

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:19.115
But in case no post was found,

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:20.870
we have to predict this to,

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.380
let's reopen the PHP tag here below.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.600
Let's end why command,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.760
which we started up here.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.660
And just below, we're gonna use the ls command to

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.275
determine what will happen if no poster found.

00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:43.020
So let's open a paragraph below or stuff like that.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:50.310
And finally, let's close out the if block that we started here and is.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.185
So let's recap.

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:56.585
I want this to be very clear to you.

00:06:56.585 --> 00:07:02.585
K, We started the dynamic area attending WordPress to check for post in the database.

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:07.715
For now, let's not worry about the kind of post that will be returns.

00:07:07.715 --> 00:07:09.275
If there are posts,

00:07:09.275 --> 00:07:10.790
then we start our loop.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.170
In fact, you loop itself goes from this while statement here to the end.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.055
While, while posts are found in the database,

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:24.275
will tell WordPress to show each post found one at a time.

00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:27.710
So let's say that two posts are found.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.105
The data from this first post will be loaded as shown on the screen,

00:07:32.105 --> 00:07:37.490
according to a specific formats which we have not yet defined, but you use,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.060
the code will reach the end while Persian and

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.155
check that there is still one post left to be loaded.

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:47.330
It will then go back up here,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.875
starting a new loop and load data from the second post.

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:54.215
When there are no more posts,

00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:57.920
the loop comes to its end and the code continues on.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.605
In our case, the code will continue running,

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.345
enrich this person here,

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:06.515
where later on we'll have a map and the story goes on.

00:08:06.515 --> 00:08:10.535
I know it's a wonderful gear. I must agree.

00:08:10.535 --> 00:08:13.280
But if there are no poles to display,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.850
look doesn't even start running.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:23.105
The code jumps directly to the else block and shows this message here.

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:26.360
Okay? But the way it is at the moment are

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.540
called students and show any content on the screen.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.050
We still need to define how we want the post to be presented.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.580
So we need to add a new HTML markup here and then display the content for

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.170
each HTML tag dynamically using some WordPress functions.

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.340
Wordpress has some building functions to print the post title,

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.425
the author, the tags,

00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:51.590
the publication date, and several other informations from

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.790
posts where breast simply call them template tags.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.905
There are a large number of them,

00:08:57.905 --> 00:08:59.225
but for this lesson,

00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:01.610
we are going to use only the main ones.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.705
Let's start by creating an HTML article tag.

00:09:05.705 --> 00:09:09.620
Within this article, you're going to create an H2 tag,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.470
since H1 tags fewer actually be used in

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.325
the headers of each section just below a paragraph.

00:09:16.325 --> 00:09:21.815
Let's type in here, posted in by.

00:09:21.815 --> 00:09:26.190
And three more paragraphs below this.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.820
In this first one,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.495
I want to type in categories.

00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:39.755
And later on, we'll see what the last two paragraphs are for.

00:09:39.755 --> 00:09:43.100
The first content we want here is the post title.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.480
To do this dynamically,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.110
we need to use a Wordpress function called the title.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:55.295
So let's type in here the underscore title within the page B tags.

00:09:55.295 --> 00:10:01.140
For the date. We're going to use another function called get the date.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.405
But in other free to work,

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.100
we have to equate out.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.930
Here's a tip for you guys.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:14.975
Usually WordPress functions that start with the word get needs to be echo out.

00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:17.825
They're only used to retrieve a certain value,

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:20.885
but don't display that value on the screen.

00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:24.635
To show it, we need to use the PHP echo command.

00:10:24.635 --> 00:10:27.890
Now you want to show a link that can be used to take

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.475
us to the author's page for their particular post.

00:10:31.475 --> 00:10:36.440
And for this, let's use the author postLink function.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.690
For categories. We use a template tag called the category.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:48.110
And one other thing I forgot to say is that some of these functions,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.025
except parameters that we can pass inside the parenthesis.

00:10:52.025 --> 00:10:55.220
This function called the categories, one of them,

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.570
the first parameter that this function accepts is a separator,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.905
since posts in WordPress can belong to more than one category.

00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:08.045
If you want to separate names of all categories by space,

00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:11.720
we can type out the space inside single quotation marks,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.465
and this corresponds to the first parameter of the function wishes the separator.

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:19.595
Now in the next paragraph,

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:21.485
let's make a list of tags.

00:11:21.485 --> 00:11:24.230
The function this time is the tags.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.420
It also accepts parameters.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.690
The first one is any texts that will be shown before

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.560
the list of tags as typing here, tags.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.425
And the second is the separator.

00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:39.590
Let's use a comma as the separator, okay?

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.945
And finally, the last paragraph,

00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:44.720
you'll be used to show the post content itself,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.995
which is everything we insert into the big post editing area.

00:11:48.995 --> 00:11:53.060
For this, let's call a function named the content.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:59.255
Now the Fermat, it's complete and we can see if our first loop we will actually work.

00:11:59.255 --> 00:12:04.400
Keep your fingers crossed and we want to refresh the front end.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.900
And here it is, our loop is working.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.430
You realize that as I told you,

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:16.160
the look was exactly three times bringing triples from the database,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:23.310
each of them with the format that we defined as go ahead and inspect one of them.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.150
And look.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.255
We have the article and within it,

00:12:32.255 --> 00:12:37.715
the content of each post with Dido, publication date.

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:42.575
Alpha link, content. Hearing the content,

00:12:42.575 --> 00:12:45.665
you see that we have a list of categories.

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:47.960
When you have more than one,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.855
there is a space separating each item.

00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:54.395
Same thing for the comma separated list of tags.

00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:56.570
Now there's one more test.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.405
What happens when there is no pole should be shown?

00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:02.570
As do this, let's go back to the dashboard.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.420
Send our posts to trash.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.450
And let's refresh our page again.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.875
And perfect.

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:19.355
Now, as no published pulse has been found,

00:13:19.355 --> 00:13:22.020
we have this message popping up.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.919
Well, let's restore our boasts as we will need them for the next lessons.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.650
Well, but we still have two big problems to solve here.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:41.975
The first one, you notice when we click the links to each page of the site.

00:13:41.975 --> 00:13:44.945
For example, if I click here on about us,

00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:48.200
notice that we also have a loop here.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.380
And the loop is spreading out the post title,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.185
which in this case is the page title.

00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:59.015
Since pages are also considered types of posts by WordPress,

00:13:59.015 --> 00:14:02.750
We have here the word categories with we don't have

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.725
any category because pages don't have categories.

00:14:06.725 --> 00:14:11.495
Publication date, author, and the page content.

00:14:11.495 --> 00:14:18.000
The same thing happens if you click on blog or on contact.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.560
But that's not what we want.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.520
We want the content of this inner pages to be different.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.515
Let's go to the second problem.

00:14:27.515 --> 00:14:30.800
The homepage shows us a list of posts.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.400
This listing should only appear on the blog page.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.700
However, the blog page currently only shows

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.045
the content we've included on a page called blog.

00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:45.515
That is, the role of these two pages is totally inverted.

00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:53.080
To solve this, we go over to our Dashboard settings menu, reading.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.060
Now here where it says front page displays.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.635
Let's say that the homepage will show a static page.

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:06.565
This page is going to be our homepage.

00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:11.395
And the post page is gonna be the blog page.

00:15:11.395 --> 00:15:14.095
Let's go ahead and save this.

00:15:14.095 --> 00:15:17.440
And now, when we visit the homepage,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.940
we see the contents of that WordPress static page called home.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.145
And many click on blog.

00:15:24.145 --> 00:15:27.910
We have a listing of all the posts.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.325
Grade itself for this lesson.

00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:31.575
I hope you enjoyed it,

00:15:31.575 --> 00:15:35.360
and I also hope you feel like you learned something new today.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.610
But as ever, it doesn't end here.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.204
In the next lesson, we'll have more.

00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:41.330
Until then.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.350
Happy coding.
