00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
Hey,

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.340
what's up,

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.950
guys?

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.200
In the last lesson,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.780
we learned how to register our menus using the functions That speech be filed in today's

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.280
lesson.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.330
You're gonna continue this process that you knew how to position the menu in the thing.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.650
So here we go.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.540
Let's open up our hair.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.650
That's PHP file,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.050
which is where we decided that our menu will stay.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.710
It's going to stay right here in place of the world menu before doing this.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.880
Let's style a bit.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.320
Our hair that's BBP file using the bootstrap glasses.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.560
Since we already know how to do that right here inside the menu area section,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.190
let's create a new container inside it.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.300
We want to create a new Jiff with the class ro,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.980
and before this role,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.680
we're gonna create a tiff with the class align.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.590
Later,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.410
in the course,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.620
you understand what this classes for and now for the logo section,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:19.240
let's add the following classes for the columns CO MD to co sm Trails Cole,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.180
12.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.640
Let's also add the text center class so that the locally centered in small and extra small

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.760
devices this last class you'll make sense at the end of the course when we add our logo for

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.480
the main menu.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.420
Neff tack.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300
We're gonna add forming classes,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.390
Cold mg tan text right.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.130
Notice that we will not be using the small and extra small sizes,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.320
not even the extra large sizes.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.860
The extra small columns are omitted because at the end of the course we'll be installing a

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.070
responsive menu.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.940
So once the regular menu you disappear in smaller screen device is replaced by the response

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.550
of menu.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.950
We don't need to add those glasses,

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.130
but you understand it better when they get there.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.570
Okay,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.350
let's go ahead and save that and go back to the front end and check those changes.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.430
Okay.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.200
As you can see,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.300
the elements are already positioning according to what we defined.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.460
Let's go back to the file now in place of the world menu,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.460
I'm gonna call a WordPress function that you finally position the menu be created in the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.220
last lesson.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.550
Dysfunction is WP on the score.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.650
Neve underscore.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.950
I mean you.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.830
So we opened enclosed princess and place a sink along at the end.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.090
Now here,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.320
inside princes,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.730
we're gonna add our menu position to remember what a minute position iss It's that

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.420
information we create in the functions fire.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.350
When we register and menu,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.640
it's slug.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.970
That's at an array here and in this ray.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.470
Let's bet some arguments.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.250
The most important of these arguments is the one called thing on the score location.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.120
They close attention to this on the score.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.640
Okay,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.640
My Brazilian students are very confused about this until this day,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.630
some of them type of hyphen set of on the score,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.750
and this can let your unexpected results so much out.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.960
The theme of the score location is nothing more than this lack of our menu.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:50.660
Let's go back to the Functions file and copied his leg for the main menu dysfunction except

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.210
several other arguments.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.990
For example,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.700
it can define a class for the menu a container,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.580
a value for before and after the menu,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.720
the amount of levels that this menu will have.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.970
But you can see more details about the other arguments in the link that is provided in this

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.650
lecture.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.590
For example,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.190
you can create a bootstrap menu by modifying arguments for this function.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.660
Unfortunately,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.480
as this would take too long to be explained,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.350
not going to address this topic in the course will be using a plugging to create a

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.330
responsive menu.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.460
That will be great.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.510
You a promise.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.990
But for a basic implementation of a menu in WordPress,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.980
the theme location arguments is enough,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.910
anyway,

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.540
in the extra resources off,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.480
this lecture left the link of a tutorial on my YouTube channel,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.100
where a teach how to implement a menu without using plug ins.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.490
In case you're interested,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.900
feel free to check it out until I save this file.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.090
And let's look at how our site is getting.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.200
So keep your fingers crossed.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200
OK,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.870
perfect.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.920
We have a remain.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.840
You finally great.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.590
It's too pretty simple,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.350
but it's already working.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.330
Now.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.300
Remember that we said that the new static pages would automatically be added to the menu.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.590
So let's see if this really works.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.950
Let's go back to the dashboard and let's create a new page.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:29.950
It's called it testing and refresh the page.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.920
Okay,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.500
look,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.040
the new bash has been automatically added to the menu,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.730
right,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.750
But let's remove this page from the menu because we don't need it here.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.600
Click on this little arrow and they can choose to remove it,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.750
save the options,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.350
and we refresh the page once again very little.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.510
There is only one small detail missing.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.150
This menu is all vertical,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.900
but we want a menu to be hard zone toe.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.400
How do you do that?

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.930
Well,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.780
the easiest way is to create a CSS roll that can change the display off each list Elements

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.850
of this menu.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.250
Let's go over to the CSS file.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.730
Let's create a rule for our main menu element.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.200
This rule will be applied to each element of the another list.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.560
So main hyphen menu you Well,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.210
l.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.960
I display in line off course.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.710
There are all the ways to do this with now.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.390
Let's just apply this rule.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:47.860
I saved file and refresh or beige and look.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:54.220
Now the menu is horizontal as they wanted since for using bootstraps text right class.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.230
It's also right,

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.470
aligned some.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.160
Marcello doesn't mean that if I click on one off this menu items,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.700
I can already go to the desired page.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.530
Well,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.650
let's go ahead and click.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.600
Um,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.030
it didn't open anything different,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.690
and the page remains in the same place.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.550
The explanation for this is quite simple.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.610
For now,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:26.110
the only thing we did was create a menu who have not yet defined what will appear in this

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.970
dynamic aerial decides when they click on Mitch.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:29.730
Menu item.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.270
This is what we're gonna do in the next lessons.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.690
So don't miss the next lessons as we're gonna learn about one of the most essential

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.150
concepts of WordPress theme WordPress Loop.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.500
So a bit for you,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.850
the next lessons and she'll then happy coding.
