00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
Hey,

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:01.880
what's up,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.490
guys?

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome to this lesson.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.100
Which is gonna be the last one about the theme customizer.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.540
In this lesson,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.520
as promised,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.250
we're gonna make our Mac more dynamic.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.820
You remember that in the lesson in which we created our map have included two values

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.620
manually.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.470
For those who don't remember,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.790
I'll start by opening the page home that PHP file again.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.720
Here at the end of the file,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.900
they have the Google maps I frame.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.480
But notice here that these two values the A p I key and the address were hard coded into

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.050
the file.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.050
And here comes that question.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.240
How the owner of the side,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.930
who most of the time doesn't understand anything about programming and it's not forced to

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.450
understand.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.000
Of course,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.480
you managed to added those values.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.890
This is very young likely to happen.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.880
So today we're going to learn how to create a friendly alternative to the site owner or to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.590
a fink user.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.090
Okay,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.750
at the end of this lesson,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.700
you're gonna have June new feuds and customizer,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.150
and you'll be able to set both the A p I key and the address In a very frankly way.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:23.630
I start with the customizer that PHP file as at a new comment here and down here,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.130
you're gonna be creating a new section to speed up a bit.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.250
I'm gonna copy this person here,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.050
and I'm going to change only the necessary venues.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:44.950
The section name issue will be sec Underscore Mac title and description.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.120
Okay,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.850
now we can create it sightings and the controls.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.990
As to this,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.770
first of all,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.080
for the a p I key,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.550
let's copy this setting here.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.840
And let's change the name of deciding in our case.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.150
It will be set on the score map on the score a p I key.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.730
This adding will be responsible for saving and retrieving the A P I key value in the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.970
WordPress WP Options table.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.140
The default value will be empty and as this you also be a common tax field.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.830
Let's keep the same call back Now let's include the control copy again has called this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.190
control city.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.750
Are l on the score neck underscore a p I key.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.240
We set a label and here in description as the different.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.080
Let's given instruction to the fume user.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.720
If they don't have a key yet.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.650
Let's include the link so that they can generate the key themselves.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.030
And now we only need to specify which section and siding this control belongs to.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.790
Okay,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.480
now let's do the same thing for the address feud.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.790
Let's copy all of this here and the only needs replaced values.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.860
It's called deciding.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.110
Set on the score.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.250
Mac on the score address.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.940
Now,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.600
as this field will be attacks area with multiple lines,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.320
it come back.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.350
Needs to be different.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.910
That's best here.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.450
Ask of the score text area.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.890
This one is another WordPress function capable of sanitizing the data passed in the text

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.630
area feud,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.270
and the corresponding control will be called Ctrl.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.790
Underscore Mac Underscore Address.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:57.310
Let's ask the user not to type special characters in here.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.800
Okay,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.630
In my experience,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.730
this field will work even if the user types of special characters in.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.180
But let's ask them not to do this.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.920
Finally,

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.540
that said,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:20.650
the section besetting and the feuds type will be text area.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.390
Okay,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.650
let's save and this check out our customizer.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:36.650
Now we have a new section here,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.350
last click here,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.970
and we finally have our June new feuds.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.210
Let's see if you can send any value here Let's copy the A P I Key.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:59.960
We're testing Ellis.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.050
Also specify a different address for a map.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:18.580
Let's say nice.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.910
We have no errors and the fields are still here,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.180
which means they have been saved onto the data days.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.440
Good and now how you're supposed to use this fields now?

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.250
Very easy.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.100
First,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.560
let's go back to the page home.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.670
That's PHP file.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:41.250
The way to do this that I consider to be the easiest way is first create two variables

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.550
above the I frame.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.590
Let's open the PHP tags up here.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.130
That's great.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:54.910
The first variable called Key and this variable You get value of a getting mowed with a

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.780
setting that host the value of the A P I key,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.530
which is called set on the score neck.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.240
On the score,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.150
a P I key.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.010
Now the other variable will be called the dress,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.110
and if you do the same thing,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.650
but for the other setting,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:18.810
but a very important detail When we retrieve the value off the address,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.050
it may not be passed with the correct formatting to the map.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.450
Depending on how the user enters the address,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.810
it will be included in the link with special characters,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.860
spaces,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.660
commas,

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.860
line breaks,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.100
and this can cause some problems.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.190
To prevent this from happening,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.910
we're gonna wrap the value returned from the database with a native beach be function

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.050
called You Are El in Cold.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:50.180
According to the Peach Be Manual.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.830
This function is convenient when in code in the string to be used in a query part of the

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.950
euro as a convenient way to pass variables to the next page.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.050
So let's use it here.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.060
Now comes Thies.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.050
This part has replaced the fixed values with the variables we just created.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.580
Seems these values come directly from the database,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.650
been sure that they are always dynamic.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.860
First,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:26.680
let's delete the key value and the echoed variable key out,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:44.050
and we're gonna do the same thing with your dress variable I save.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.790
And this time let's make the tax directly in the customizer.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:08:09.570
Let's change the address and automatically you know this that the map for the new dress is

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.950
rendered in the theme.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.080
Wow,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.830
that's simply fantastic.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.300
It's brilliant.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:45.250
Let's change the dress again and there this very good that's safe and everything's ready.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.250
That's it,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.820
folks.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:53.580
I really hope you enjoy this lesson And I also hope that you have the change to use these

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.480
ideas in real projects.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.440
For me,

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.190
that will be really,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.610
really rewarding.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.730
OK,

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.970
but the cars doesn't end here in the following sections.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.730
We're gonna learn the basics about thing internationalization.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.950
And we also learn a way to Pakistan surfing for distribution.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.550
So in juvenile CIA.
