00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330
Hey,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.910
guys,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.950
Everything okay?

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.740
Marcello?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.410
Here again.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.750
This is our last lesson about Gutenberg.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.090
Over the last lesson,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.120
he learned the basics about this Nia WordPress tool which will gradually replaced the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.560
editor used so far.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.130
The tiny emcee work breast promises that you will bring Ah whole new world to the CMS.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.140
So much so they they dare to name it after the inventor off the printing press,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.760
Gutenberg From what you sing,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.340
Gorenberg is really a very powerful tool and it looks like it's coming to stay.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.950
Despite the fact that my record this video with America still has some bugs and hasn't been

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.550
yet officially released.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.110
We hope that the WordPress versions after 5.0,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.550
show that before it was worth it.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.950
There are great expectations,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.890
and new futures are still to be developed over time for the students off this course.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.330
My promises that if any of the new futures impact from development,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.350
I will certainly talk about him.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.880
But as I told you earlier functionalities that have to do an effect on Lee,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.120
the end user won't be the focus off this course.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.510
Okay,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.810
But just for you to have another taste,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.680
I'll show you some more cool futures that we have here in Gutenberg.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.960
First,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.780
here in this Tobar we have this little menu,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.850
and clicking here shows you a number of interest in actions related to the document.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.360
For example,

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.850
you can switch between the visual editor Andy HTML editor.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.970
This can be very useful for you,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.930
the developer.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.350
It's also a good way to learn a little more about how the blocks are controlled.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.550
Inside the editor here,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.960
we have,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.640
for example,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.780
where comments that identifies the block itself and the gap values in Jason firm it,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.950
which are used to save the values for the settings that you pass to each block.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.550
Let's go back to the visual editor.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.050
Another very interesting thing you can do is create reusable blocks.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.410
Let's assume that he user wants to apply the same settings on all buttons that he or she

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.850
creates in posts and pages.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.000
They can create the first button,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.180
access this block action menu and click on add to reusable blocks,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.750
diaper name,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.970
and now,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.890
the next time the user adds a button block,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.850
he or she can only choose this reusable block from here,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.870
or,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.040
if we use in the insert.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.280
Er,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.900
come here and under reusable just the time that created cool,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.350
isn't it?

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.850
And this is the same for several elements.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.830
Another interesting thing is this information button you have here statistic about the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.610
document words,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.060
paragraphs and here below.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.620
If we,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.470
for example,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:23.310
at a new heading here you see the semantic structure of the document quite interesting for

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.180
the ones who cares so much about Seo.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.320
Well,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.050
what's your next step from here?

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.950
I believe that start doing some tests video fame.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.780
Make a backup of the installation,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.550
which is always good,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.160
and then installing Test Gutenberg.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.470
Hone your theme before finally offered it to your client.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.020
But just do it right.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.350
Gutenberg is coming to stay,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.620
and soon your client,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.210
it would start asking about it.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.490
Another interesting thing you could also learn is how to create your own blocks for

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.140
Gutenberg.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.660
I won't discuss the subject on this course right,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.530
because it has more to do with black and development,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.250
and this course it's not about plugging development,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.410
but it may also be interested in the subject and create your own blocks.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.510
It's like many developers today that great plug ins for their own things.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.550
The official Gutenberg Handbook has a very complete documentation on the subject.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.570
And I'll leave the link for you to find out more about it.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.220
Of course.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.170
Well,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.610
folks,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.070
that's it.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.370
I hope you enjoy this lessons.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.210
It was really cool for me to talk about this new world.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.100
Press your depending on when you're watching this video.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.020
It is not so new.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.090
But I'm sure that the lessons should have helped you a lot.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.960
Well,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.250
until them and I see you next time.
