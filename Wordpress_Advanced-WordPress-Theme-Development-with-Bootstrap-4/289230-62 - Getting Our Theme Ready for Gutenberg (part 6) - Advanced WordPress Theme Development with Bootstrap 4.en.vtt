00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.630
Hello students, back.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.100
And in today's lesson,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.905
we're going to move to a little more advanced approach

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:10.350
to integrate her theme and Gutenberg.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.165
So stay tuned.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:16.005
So far, we already know how to basically use the tool.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.410
We know how to add support to some advanced features,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.825
but there's still something missing.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:27.710
Well, don't you agree with me that it would be perfect if everything is seen,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.280
Gutenberg is exactly the same god in the front end.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.975
Or at least it's both.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:37.805
Gutenberg and front end had a look which will be as close as possible.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.670
For example, I see that the font used hearing

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.955
Gutenberg and not the same phones my theme is using.

00:00:43.955 --> 00:00:45.320
Is that possible?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.780
Yes, it is. In fact,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.775
that's one of the goals of Gutenberg.

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:53.180
The idea is that theme developers can also, if they wish,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.235
of course, Style, each block and also Gutenberg's own editing area.

00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:59.930
So that's what we see here.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.215
Can't be as close as possible to the themes from N,

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.690
but that's optional according to the WordPress documentation.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.620
Thin creators can, if they wish,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.735
use blogs as they are without any additional style.

00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:19.045
Overriding the default styles could bring a really cool experience to the end user.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:24.984
But of course, this can also mean more things to be done and considered by the developer.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.860
So let's get started.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.360
The first thing we need to do is to create a separate style sheet

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.030
that CSS file will be used only in the Wordpress admin area.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.115
So here inside the CSS folder,

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:45.770
we're gonna create a file called style hyphen editor that CSS.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.305
Now in Chicago, this file is really, really very simple.

00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:58.490
First, we add one more support called Editor styles.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.885
This theme support is required for most actions you need to perform in the backend.

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:12.710
Now we just need to call a function named Add editor style.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.870
And we're gonna pass the name of this CSS file we've just created.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.200
Don't forget to add the name of the folder CSS.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.905
Now we can write all the CSS that we control the appearance of the editor.

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:35.090
Let's try to make it similar to the front end.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.820
And we start by defining three things.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.100
First, the size of the container where the text part of her post S,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.515
which is this area here.

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:49.294
Then the size for the blocks that have wide alignment,

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.895
and finally, the size for the blocks that have full alignment.

00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:54.770
So defining this three things,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.495
we don't need much work.

00:02:56.495 --> 00:03:00.125
Gutenberg's documentation has all the code we need.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:03.740
We just go there and copy what we want, right?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.580
And of course I'll make this link available to you, okay?

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.300
The first section with the selector WP block is

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.020
used to define the total size for each of the Gutenberg blocks.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.765
You can set the values you want here in pixels.

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:25.490
Let me increase this value or legal,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.610
for example, 800 pixels.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.730
The next lines are for you to define the size of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.000
the blocks or the Wide and full-width type.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.830
Here for the white blocks,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.940
you can set the value.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.934
You want to test that out and see what value can give you the best results.

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:46.595
In my thing, 1080 was a great pixel value.

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:50.430
And we may already see some minor changes.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.100
Here. For example, you see that the size of the container is 800 pixels.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.360
And it's really coming from the file that we created.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.665
And let's change this category too wide.

00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:13.720
And if inspect it,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.515
you can also see that the size is 1080 pixels.

00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:20.590
You can do your test type in the values directory

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.610
here and look at

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.555
the results in frown end until you get what we want.

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:38.455
Another thing we can do is make the fonts look also closer to what we got in front end.

00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:40.335
At this moment.

00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:43.040
The font used here in the editor screen is

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.085
totally different from what they got in the front end.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:50.600
To change that, you have to know what funds are used

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.400
in frontend and apply the same phones to the right elements in Gothenburg.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.325
That of course, will depend on your theme.

00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:04.025
I'm gonna give an example how I did on my theme so you understand what to do, okay?

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:07.745
First, these are the two phones I used in my theme,

00:05:07.745 --> 00:05:12.365
plateau for paragraphs and also for the heading tags.

00:05:12.365 --> 00:05:18.665
First, let's see what classes will have to change in Gutenberg to speed things up.

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:20.780
I'm gonna pace here some CSS.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.960
Again. These are the classes and rules that we need. Up here.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.720
I'm targeting the whole editor area with special attention for the paragraphs.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.950
As I've already added support for the editor styles in the thin,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.290
I can omit this piece here if I want.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.890
Ok. In fact, I'm gonna get rid of it because

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.810
WordPress weapon the selector automatically in the backend for all of the elements,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.780
classes and ideas that I want to add to the file.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.350
And I'm saying that the font is going to be lotto with

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.095
this margin values is the same role I have in the frontend stylesheet,

00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:04.625
the template that CSS file with the addition of these margins.

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:10.025
And this one down here is the CSS that controls the post title.

00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:14.975
Look how interesting even the post title can be modified within the Azure.

00:06:14.975 --> 00:06:17.390
And this one uses a different font type.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.930
Great.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.850
Now if we reload Gutenberg, wonderful.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.695
Our texts is already very similar to the one in the front end.

00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:33.080
If we inspect the two elements,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.785
you see that they are ready stout according to the admin CSS file,

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:40.385
using the two phones and margins we defined.

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:44.495
And here you can see the class editor styles wrapper,

00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:46.640
which has been automatically appended.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.050
Very correct.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.014
So that's the idea folks basically will inspect Gutenberg.

00:06:53.014 --> 00:06:56.750
You'll find the element or block U12 style and

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.770
other rule here that target that element in the backend CSS.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.740
Your aim is to trick the backend Intuit get as close to the front end as possible.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.860
You just need to remember that it's optional, right?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.350
If you don't want to implement this, for example,

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.565
for your client side,

00:07:13.565 --> 00:07:15.200
you don't really need.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.725
However, if you want to make our fema available for download,

00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:22.925
I recommended to do at least the basics changes start here.

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:26.704
And marketplaces such as embarrassed theme forests,

00:07:26.704 --> 00:07:30.050
require you to ensure that all WordPress car blocks

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.800
or style to match the design of the theme or Demos.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.775
Another requirement is that web fonts are also enqueued.

00:07:37.775 --> 00:07:40.175
While in my tests I didn't need to enqueue.

00:07:40.175 --> 00:07:42.575
Might you Google Fonts, lotto,

00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:45.890
Eno's vote in order for them to display in Gutenberg.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:52.115
Maybe that was due to the browser cache to really ensure that they will indeed display.

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:55.200
Go back to functions that PHP.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.770
Let's create a new function.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.120
The point here is that this function needs to be fired on

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.140
a special book called enqueue block editor assets.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:29.735
And here we're going to enqueue the two fonts in a very simplified way.

00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:32.989
Wp enqueue style.

00:08:32.989 --> 00:08:34.850
We passed fund handle,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.700
for example, Landow font.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.050
And then the path to the style sheet file,

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.840
which we already have here in the CSS file.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.120
Let me just copy this here.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.860
And now we do the same thing for the Oswald font.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.035
A hint, you can add Google fonts using functions as well.

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:10.540
Most premium themes do that.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.920
I'll leave you, of course,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.710
the link with the great tutorial in this lesson too,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.050
if you want to delve into it.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.990
One more interesting thing you can do is to add a support called WP block styles.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.560
When it does it, it can make the appearance of the block

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.554
of the latest blocks you have here in good numeric looks the same.

00:09:30.554 --> 00:09:33.095
When you see them in the front end.

00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:35.900
It's only valid for the WordPress native blocks.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.200
Okay? For example, let's add a quote here.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.330
So as you can see, you have this formatting here.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.340
But if you take a look at the front end,

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.750
you see that it's quite different.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.900
But now if you add that support, let's do it.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.060
Now reloading the page.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.025
Now you see that the block here looks quite the same

00:10:24.025 --> 00:10:27.340
as the one we haven't Gutenberg once more.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.040
This is only valid for the WordPress native blocks.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.150
Okay? Another hint I can give you is that you take a look carefully

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.385
here at this official documentation because they're always adding new things,

00:10:39.385 --> 00:10:42.190
new features, new resources,

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.795
and you as a developer,

00:10:43.795 --> 00:10:46.105
we'll learn a lot from them.

00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:48.385
Well, in the next lesson,

00:10:48.385 --> 00:10:51.625
we'll close the Series with some final considerations.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:55.950
I'll show you some interesting features that I have not talked about yet.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.620
So until next time.
