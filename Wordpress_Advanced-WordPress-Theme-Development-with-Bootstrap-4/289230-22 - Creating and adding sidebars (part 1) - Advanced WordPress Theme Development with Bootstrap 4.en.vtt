00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.040
Hi there.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.585
In today's lesson, we are going to start talking about sidebars.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:08.265
In this first lesson,

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:10.320
we're gonna start creating the structure for

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.925
this design elements which are very important in a WordPress theme.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:16.425
But before we start,

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:19.815
you may have noticed that our theme is a bit different.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.475
Now the thing is a bit more like our initial layout,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.265
the one represented at the beginning of the course.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.965
The top bar is ready with the color we defined.

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:33.194
Initially. The menu is already a little bigger, etcetera.

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.760
But before you start complaining hand,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.650
there's always someone that you complain.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.170
I'm sure, as I said,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.060
since the beginning of the course,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.355
we will not focus on HTML and CSS here on the Course.

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:51.905
Despite the fact that you really need HTML and CSS attribute of WordPress theme.

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:55.070
I think the most important in a course like this one

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.880
here is to explain the WordPress way of doing things.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.365
So for the moment,

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:05.225
I'm not going to record lessons explaining water did in terms of CSS,

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:08.150
for example, how have changed colors?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.970
That's the basics of web development,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.940
which is not the focus of this course.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.425
If we did that,

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:20.510
it would take you a long time to learn what I think is the most essential here,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.630
which is explaining how the thing works.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.325
However, you can see all the changes have made in the files.

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:31.145
I'll make them all available for download.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:36.245
As you know, all the files are available in the second lecture of this course,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:38.225
everything organized by lesson.

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:40.625
So go ahead and download the files.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:44.045
And there you can see the changes. Okay?

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:46.955
So here in the CSS file,

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:49.865
I have the code a bit more organized.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:53.225
Here we have our Google Fonts call.

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:56.660
So minor changes to the heading elements,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.805
the background colors, the style for each section of the site.

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.550
Anyway, several style changes,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.125
only very simple CSS modifications, nothing very special.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.930
If you head over to the content files,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.195
you see that I've implemented.

00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.450
That suggests and I gave you in the last lesson,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.430
I've included the post class function here within each article.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.605
And using only CSS.

00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:27.710
I've styled each post formats in

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.820
different way using the class relative to each post format.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.295
If you had the curiosity to implement a suggestion I gave you in the last lesson,

00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:39.725
you must have understood how it works,

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:42.350
is you didn't go ahead and give it a try.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.200
That will be a very good exercise.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.200
Well, let's go over to the blog page.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.190
Here on the blog listing page,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.730
you can see that the pose which have the video posts

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.870
Fermat are different from the ones with the image pose format.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.810
The default post Fermat's have a heading tag with

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.685
a different color to changing the heading colors is a very simple idea.

00:03:13.685 --> 00:03:17.195
If you can remember the examples I showed you in the last lesson,

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:21.150
it can have even more advanced changes.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.425
Also, as you can see,

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:27.650
there's a new div here called Mapinfo.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.610
Actually, it has been added to all the content files.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.155
This will serve as a rapper and help us styled first paragraphs,

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:37.535
which contains the date,

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:41.130
the author, categories, and tags.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.350
I've used this wrapper just to apply this grey color to

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.265
these links here and to make the text border.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:53.645
So it's only CSS in a couple of HTML modifications.

00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:57.785
Nothing really special, and nothing related to WordPress itself.

00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:02.615
That said, we're going to start creating our sidebars.

00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:06.725
Before that, let us explain what those sidebars are.

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:14.525
Okay, for this, let's just switch things for a moment. This time.

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:17.045
Are we working with the 2016 theme,

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:20.520
which is one of the native WordPress themes.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.880
You see that on the right side we have this big area here.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.865
Here in this area, we have some features.

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:30.650
We have a search bar,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.535
an area with recent topics, comments.

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:38.660
The whole area is what we're press calls a sidebar.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.744
And within that sidebar,

00:04:40.744 --> 00:04:45.375
each small element which has the functionality is called a widget.

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:47.995
We'll be learning about these two elements,

00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:51.955
sidebars and widgets in this lesson and in next one,

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:55.270
you'll notice during the course that we can create

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.780
end position then practically anywhere in the thin.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.675
This by the name of this element sidebar,

00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:03.925
we can place them anywhere,

00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:07.555
not just on the left or on the right side of the thing.

00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:12.820
So the first thing we're going to do is open up the functions file.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.735
In the same way that we have previously registered.

00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:20.275
Our menus, are gonna register our sidebars.

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:21.445
For this course.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:24.250
You're gonna first registered choose sidebars,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.915
where you can register several sidebars for a single theme.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:31.805
Let's create a sidebar that will be displayed on the homepage

00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:36.095
and a second sidebar that will be displayed only on the inner pages,

00:05:36.095 --> 00:05:39.020
more specifically on the blog page.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.725
For now we only have HTML markup in both areas.

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:44.765
But nothing is happening here.

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:47.225
Once we've created the sidebars,

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.625
we can add whatever widgets we want.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:53.690
For example, here on the Homepage we can add a text widget.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.315
And later on we're going to add a contact form and own the blog page.

00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:03.155
We can add widgets to display the latest posts, for example.

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:06.065
But they can add wherever elements we want.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:12.065
In their sidebars are features that can bring a lot of dynamics to the theme.

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:16.580
Once we created, the end user can put wherever they want in

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.130
their making their websites are totally

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.010
different from another one that uses the same theme,

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.845
for example, okay, enough small talk,

00:06:24.845 --> 00:06:26.990
and let's get down to business.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.960
So let's get back to our functions file.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.290
This time, we want to register our sidebars outside of the main configuration function.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.840
Let's start by adding a new action.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.270
Let's pass to this action called widgets in it.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.840
Unless trigger a new functional that hook.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.440
Let's call this function learn WP underscore sidebars.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.945
Notice that this function doesn't exist yet and we will be creating its own.

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:07.775
In fact, we are doing the opposite of what we have been doing previously.

00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:11.435
We first created the functions and then added an action,

00:07:11.435 --> 00:07:12.950
but no problem at all.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:18.420
Here, changing the order of the factors doesn't change the product.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.970
Now, let's go ahead and create a function.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:32.225
So function, learn WP and the score sidebars and the net.

00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:35.345
Let's begin registering our first sidebar.

00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:40.500
To do this, we want to use a function called register sidebar.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.040
Inside that function, we create an array.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.095
And within this array,

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:55.205
we pass some arguments which I'm going to explain to you one by 1.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:57.980
First 1 is called name.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.910
This is the title data display in the admin area.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.875
For example.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:11.670
Let's go to appearance widgets.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.050
This one here.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.685
Let's separate each item of the array with a comma.

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:24.785
And the new line.

00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:28.715
Let's pass a second argument which is called ID.

00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:31.190
Pay a lot of attention here, okay?

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.865
Because this ID must be unique.

00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:37.880
As we are going to register choose sidebars.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.775
Each idea argument needs to be different.

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:43.400
Also avoid the user special characters.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.630
Here are spaces.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.515
Ok, let's consider this value as a variable.

00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:51.424
This way we don't make any mistake.

00:08:51.424 --> 00:08:54.950
The next argument is description.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:01.145
This argument corresponds to a short description that also appears in the admin area.

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:03.330
This one here.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.910
Okay? All the arguments we passed so far will be

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:18.125
used in the dashboard when we are inside the Widgets page.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:22.925
The remaining arguments refers to the display of each widget individually.

00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:28.055
The first one in this category is called before underscore widget.

00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:32.910
Let's just type in the argument and pass an empty value for now.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:41.045
And the next one is after underscore widget. Same thing.

00:09:41.045 --> 00:09:43.760
Let's just pass an empty value.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.490
Do you understand what therefore,

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.165
I need to use some visual aids for that.

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:53.370
Let us go back to our 2016 Theme.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.540
If we inspect each widget in the sidebar,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.575
we'll notice that it has a well-defined structure.

00:10:03.575 --> 00:10:07.325
Each widget is inside a wrapper element,

00:10:07.325 --> 00:10:10.715
which in this case is an HTML section.

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:14.885
Each section has its ID and it's CSS class.

00:10:14.885 --> 00:10:19.295
We also notice here that they all have a heading.

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:22.700
Elements are heading our HU style.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.030
Well, now we're gathering port in information

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.150
for all the other arguments we're gonna be using in this array.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.975
For the before rigid argument,

00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:38.145
we pass the HTML elements that will serve as a wrapper for each sidebar widget.

00:10:38.145 --> 00:10:43.030
For 2016, we saw that a section tag was chosen.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.670
In our case, let's pass a DFT DAG with rigid wrapper class.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.650
We can be much more specific and included CSS ID for example.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.470
But for this lesson, let's make it simpler.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.510
If you want, you can take a look at

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.080
the native WordPress themes and checkout how they do that.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.135
For the after rigid,

00:11:04.135 --> 00:11:07.645
we just close the HTML tag, the opened above.

00:11:07.645 --> 00:11:11.275
The last two arguments will be respectively before

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:19.460
underscore title and after underscore title.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.745
For before tidal, we pass the heading tag for each sidebar widget,

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:31.020
rice-based H2 tag with a class called Widget Title.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.565
And in after title,

00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:37.100
let's close out the H2 tag.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.024
Alright, we have all the structure you need to register end-user first sidebar.

00:11:43.024 --> 00:11:48.030
Let's go over to the dashboard and activate our theme again.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.160
And now if we hover over the appearance menu,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.460
you have the widgets option. Let's click on it.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.720
And here on the right side,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.195
you can see the sidebar recreated.

00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:07.250
As I explained to you.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.029
We got here the wages, title, and description.

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:16.954
Great, isn't it? Yes, it's so cool that we're gonna create one more sidebar.

00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:20.015
This time, it will be used on the blog page.

00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:22.145
To do this is very easy.

00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:26.405
We just copy this entire registered sidebar function.

00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:30.410
Be very careful because we need to copy that semicolon,

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.450
20K and less space,

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.910
everything down here after that semicolon.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:42.720
Now, we just need to change some values here as go ahead and change the name,

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:49.770
the id, and the description of the second sidebar.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.585
Rest of the code may look the same.

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:59.255
But if you wish, you can change both the tags and the ID's of each element.

00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:01.830
Let's save this.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.425
And now in the dashboard we have the second sidebar.

00:13:09.425 --> 00:13:10.985
Before I finish this lesson,

00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:13.100
I need to give you all a warning.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.035
There are lot of students making mistakes when writing the code for the widget areas.

00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:20.075
And the problem is always the same.

00:13:20.075 --> 00:13:22.790
So be careful when typing in the arguments,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.415
especially these ones here.

00:13:25.415 --> 00:13:29.540
Pay attention to the quotes, to the underscores.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.820
Shut away, the tags are being closed.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.795
Otherwise you likely end up with broken HTML.

00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:38.540
Well, that's it for this lesson.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.920
In the next lesson,

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.500
we will continue to talk about sidebars.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.380
You still need to place the sidebars within the theme.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.080
And that's what we'll be learning how to do.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.570
Simulator and happy coding.
