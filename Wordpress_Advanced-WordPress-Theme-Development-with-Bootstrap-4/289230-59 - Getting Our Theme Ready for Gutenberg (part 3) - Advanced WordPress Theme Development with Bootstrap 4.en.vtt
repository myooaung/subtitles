00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
Hey,

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.290
guys,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.700
Marcello here with you for another lesson.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.630
And today we continue owner overview on how to get your fame ready for Gutenberg,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.290
This new content creation experience in WordPress.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.980
In today's lesson,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.090
we'll start making some changes to our thing files.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.660
You begin to understand the connections between your femur and Gutenberg and what you need

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.750
to do if you want your thing to get the most out of the new editor.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.450
So let's begin.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.250
The first cool thing we're gonna do today is to enable new Gutenberg future.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.030
This future is called wide images and allows you to add two more types of image alignments

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.090
to some of the blocks.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.450
Not all of them,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.180
but some important wants.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.610
And those two alignments are called,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.550
respectively,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.840
a line wife and align food for you to have a video idea of what I'm talking about.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.350
We're gonna grab a test WordPress installation.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.750
This is not the one who will be working with today,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.790
and I'll be showing this little details in practice.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.420
So here,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.050
regard in image block.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.150
If I click this block,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.120
you see here that besides the three more common alignments,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.600
have two more.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.190
If I choose here,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.050
the 1st 1 that says white with you See that image becomes a little bigger,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.560
so it overwrites the size of the main container they see now.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.280
If I click the other button for with you see that image spends to the end of the page,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.450
well,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.130
this very cool future can currently be applied to nine block types you see on the screen

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.650
the name off all of the blocks that at the moment except wide and full alignment.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.750
Possibly that number will increase the time.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.550
And it may also be the case that some block generated by some plugging us.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.140
It can make use of him anyway.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.490
It makes no sense at all for me to show a list here,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.410
because it will surely be outdated now.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.350
I said earlier that we need to add support for this future if I want to use it.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.600
In fact,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.450
it's an opt in future that's very offend comes in.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.020
Do you remember that ad theme support function that we used extensively in the course?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.700
Well,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.410
another to have those wide images enabled,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.000
as well as other more advanced futures in Gutenberg,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.650
Your fame has to add supports first for this.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.600
Let's go ahead and open up the functions that PHP file.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:49.250
And here inside function learned WB come feet here.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.090
At the end of it,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.150
I thought I had another support.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.050
So and theme support.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.580
And we want to pass the kind of support called a line hyphen wide.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.250
And I say this now and we're load the answer.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.650
Let's go back to the previous page and close this one here because this is just the test.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.180
We have a lot of work to do today with this thing here and here in the gallery block.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.660
Look,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.500
we already got the Chuo line and buttons.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.890
If we click them,

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.650
look,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.150
they can already change the appearance of the gallery here in the editor.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.400
However,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.560
if I try to preview the changes I made,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.250
look,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.150
where are all of the changes?

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.700
I just can see them.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.890
So that means there's something just you have to do.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.080
If we expect this image Gallery block.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.050
You see that what happens here is that WordPress automatically as here in the U L element.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.230
A couple of CSS classes,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.980
some of them such as thes WP block calorie,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.000
already implemented by default.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.020
If you take a closer look.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.180
You see that most of this year says for the blocks already implemented within this file

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.650
here.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.030
That's why most native blocks were out of the box,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.670
as I mentioned before in this case,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.550
As you see here,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.150
they're coming from the Gutenberg plugging folder.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.520
I believe that after WordPress 5.0,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.760
they'll come from somewhere else.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.690
So that's the case for all of the native futures.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.710
But those other more advanced futures the ones that you need to add support you.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.320
They always require you to add extra CSS in your theme so they can work,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.750
at least for now.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.450
Maybe in the future that your change,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.240
who knows?

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.850
But the good news is that a lot of people have been working to implement this,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.450
and I found some good examples of things and tutorials about the subject.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.760
In short,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.900
all they need to do is to add this.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.140
Yes,

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.250
as for those two classes line wide and the line food in our film CSS file.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.380
So let's go ahead Open file,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.030
which is here.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:31.180
Inside the Themes folder learn WP CSS Thing played that's here says and here below.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.150
I'm gonna pasty success just to speed things up a bit,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.900
and I'll be explaining to you what's going on here.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.230
First,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.700
we need to make sure that this code here will only be applied when the View Portis at least

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.450
11 40 pixels 11 40 pixels is the with size of the container class of our theme.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.650
You can go on and said,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.300
also another values here later and see which makes more sense to you.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.700
Okay,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.800
here for the two classes,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.600
you said in margin bottom till nothing special here now to center each of the Jew classes,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.250
there's a handful of different solutions.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.200
Some developers prefer the use negative margins.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.050
For example.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.570
I prefer the solution here which used the CSS,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.480
transforms just center content.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.860
With that,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.830
it's enough that for each class you said the with relatives to the report Isn't VW unit for

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.710
the white alignment?

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.230
I said a value off 75 VW,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.420
which will correspond to 75% off the rendering area of the screen,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.280
which we call Vieux Port,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.430
and for the full with the value is 100 VW,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.000
of course,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.180
100% this Anapa date.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.610
Some students have been complaining that this year,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.260
says called,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.420
I indicate here is not working in longer.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.250
However,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.230
according to the tests,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.730
I did.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.690
He called Stuart works perfectly,

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.250
but just in case I'm leaving here,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.890
an alternative solution.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.240
You can see it on the screen in case the first solution doesn't work for you.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.750
Pause the video and used to saw the solution.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.150
OK,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.180
it's so it's safe,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.350
and you sometimes see just reload the page.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:32.650
Now we can see that the gallery is occupying 100% of the screen.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.340
But if you re size the screen,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:43.100
look if the with its mother than 11 40 pixels,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.140
as we defined,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:53.150
it's not so big the same thing for the wildlife.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.590
We contest that directly here in the the Element Inspector,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.440
if you wish,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.850
said here to white.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.110
And now,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.010
as you can see,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.160
the width is only slightly larger.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.200
Danny Container,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.380
but only went of your part is at least 11 40 picks us.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.590
How awesome.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.560
But there's only one strange thing happening,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.120
and maybe that's a Gutenberg bug.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.620
If I try to do the same thing for a video,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.550
it won't work.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.990
Let's add a YouTube video block,

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.750
for example,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.400
Ellis said.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.850
It as a fool with look,

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.060
well,

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.150
here in Gutenberg,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.210
it looks nice,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.270
But look,

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.790
what happens when we preview.

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:44.960
Mm.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.890
Look at that.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.740
That sex to sell that for now,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.070
we're gonna need some tricks,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.540
but that you do for the next lesson.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.650
So you then
