00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
hi guys.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.900
In today's lesson,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.240
I want to bring up a very important issue ever.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.710
Pages well with created template files for just about every sort of inner pages.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.650
Inward breasts.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.310
We also learned how to create specific templates and many other things.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.530
Everything looks like paradise.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.110
Everything's falling to place.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.270
But there will always be a time when a visitor will come across a page that doesn't exist

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.050
on your side.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.260
Let's say that the visitors sees a link point into your side while reading a post on

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.090
another side.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.070
Except that this link was spelled wrong.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.850
You can that that the visitor will end up falling on an error page.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.410
But at the moment we cannot handle this error requests in our thing.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.060
So,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.820
for example,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.750
let's simulator never here in the theme.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.000
Now,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.870
for example,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.450
I'm visiting a known existent page.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.100
But even so,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.750
I'm seeing some content.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.670
I bet you're ready.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.340
No one.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.490
The answer is that every time wordpress doesn't know what content you load,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.260
it lows.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.650
A very special file called Cold.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.610
Exactly called index dot PHP.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.720
This is the default simply file.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.940
You can see that in our plugging up here,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.820
it can also find other clues.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.250
If you inspect the page,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.490
notice that in the bud attack we have the addition of a class called error for all four.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.740
Another way to see more information is by modifying our head of that speech.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.350
Be foul.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.900
Nice.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.750
Open that file.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.460
And here in the title tag,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.650
we're gonna include a WordPress function called WP Underscore Title.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.440
Now reloading the page.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.910
We have a new clue since the browser tab shows in the title that the page was not found.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.820
But even so,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.450
this whole situation can lead your visitor to make a mistake.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.700
They're seeing some content and may find that the link there actually visiting thus exists

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.960
and that the contents they're seeing is really what they wanted to see.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.850
But that's not true.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.540
To solve this problem is quite easy.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:32.280
Let's create a new file called for awful dot PHP as ever To speed up things a bit,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.250
I'm going to copy one of the files.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.660
This time I'm gonna copy the archive that PHP file.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.400
But it can,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.050
of course,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.020
choose the index that bitch feature.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.520
Okay,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.190
but I need to make some modifications around here.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.960
Our error page.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.550
We'll have no look.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.700
So I'm going to remove all this cold here related to the loop.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.450
I want also to exclude the cyber.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.150
And as there will be no sidebar,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.180
this tiff tack here will be 100% wide for that,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.350
just remove this little class here.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.280
Let's also changed the main class off the defect.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.190
You error hyphen for ofour here,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.050
you're going to create a header and so informative text elements.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.550
Let's save.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.400
And now we already have something that really indicates to the visitor.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.280
Daddy content doesn't exist at this point.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.050
Our visitor must already be very frustrated.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.130
Lesson.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.060
Offer them some solution.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.890
For example,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.650
we can invite them to do a search to find what they want.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.450
Let's create a new tiff tack here and include a search for him here.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.750
We've already learned how to do that.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.050
Just called function gets search form.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.400
Another thing we can do is invite a visitor to check the latest vlog posts.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.690
To do this,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.570
let's learn yet another very useful WordPress function called the region.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.850
It does nothing more than call any WordPress fidget in a specific point of the cold.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.710
If we visit the WordPress Codex you'll see that there is a list of widgets available.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.520
In fact,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.020
this list is made up off those widgets that already comes into default installation off

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.800
WordPress.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.820
We can call this widget here WP widget.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.570
Recent posts So the visitor will see a list of recent posts,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.100
and you know how to use it.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.450
Just click here in the sidebar menu,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.440
and we already see all the parameters that we can use for each widget.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.890
We can use this function the way it is now with a very basic implementation are it can pass

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.610
a more parameters in our example Here,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.050
Let's play with these two parameters.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.750
Title and number.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.650
Let's copy this example here and based it in Should file we're creating.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.980
Now.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:24.050
Let's include an array and pass the title argument and number.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.850
Let's limit the number of links to three.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:36.320
Okay,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.760
accident result.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.620
Now,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.190
however,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.510
page has become much more meaningful for a visitor,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.250
don't you think?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.280
Okay,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.150
let me finish this lesson with an observation.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.350
As a thing developer,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.950
it is more than your obligation to create a narrow file.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.580
It greatly helps the visitor.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.820
It doesn't matter if you're creating the theme for yourself or for a single client are

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.460
distributing of things more.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.710
People never forget to create this fire.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.250
Okay,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.750
well,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.790
as you can see,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.850
we are making great strides and creating the theme.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.810
And I hope you're enjoying the lessons,

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.850
So see you next time.
