00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
everyone.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.010
This is a very short lesson,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.040
quite simple.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.800
And ago,

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.940
here is the teach.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.560
For those so still don't know how to stand aside created on the local server to a remote

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.940
server of your choice,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.660
I want to live aside the issue of reaches the best hosting company for WordPress even

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.760
because currently I am not affiliated with any of these companies.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760
By the way,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.710
if you want to know my onus opinion,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.990
the best type of hosting currently are the so called virtual private servers,

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.020
or VPs.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.720
However,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.480
I'm not going to give you many details of how this type of server works,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.460
even though this is something I'm still learning.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.590
Currently,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.100
there are a lot of people running away from shared servers in migrating that websites to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.370
some sort of ups.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.950
But for this lesson,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.110
I'm going to use a shared hosting service that I have purchased in any hosting company.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.850
Here I have access to a C panel which greatly helps installation of WordPress.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.960
One important detail.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.390
I'm gonna teach you how to my great website using a plug in called WP clone.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390
There is a way to migrate the whole site manually.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.600
Yes,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.950
well,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.770
But lately I've been preferring to use.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.960
Blagging should do this.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.710
It is much faster.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.420
And so I always spare a few minutes more off my day every time I need to perform this type

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.160
of desk,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.260
this Blufgan worst great.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.990
If your website is not too big,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.800
it will be perfect for migrating this website.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.920
We created you in discourse on top of that.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.820
Lately,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.750
I've been using this plugging as a backup solution for my sites as well.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.520
So let's get started to start off.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.950
We need to access the hosting company control panel,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.200
and we're going to create a database to install WordPress.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.890
I said over two data basis.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.600
But take on my sequel that a basis,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.730
What feel need in others?

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.790
To install WordPress,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.890
we'll need a user with the respective passwords and a database.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.360
First of all,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.250
let's create a name to database by clicking here where it says create new database,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.750
click here in create database,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.200
write down the name of your database or copy its name to any notes.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.210
Bad application.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.840
The fact is that we need to know the name off this database during the WordPress

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.600
installation,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.750
so keep it saved somehow.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.480
now that you created database user that scroll down a little or it says my sequel users at

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.550
New User.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.980
I'm gonna type a name to this user.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.450
And I wanted to generate the best word here.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.450
Click on Create User.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.450
And I'm gonna also save this user name and password somewhere.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.340
Well,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.670
now,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.250
with this to information,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.150
I have to add the created user to the database.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.660
A lot of people forget to do this,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.220
and in the end,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.610
they don't understand why the WORDPRESS installation doesn't work.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.620
The fact is that the created user needs to have all the privileges off creating changing

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.770
tables and other privileges within the database.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.800
Otherwise,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.600
this user would not be able to do anything inside of database,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.950
which include installing WordPress.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.650
Let's go to where it says at user to database,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.180
Jews are user and our database in click on ads in the next screen.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.210
We check all privileges,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.840
make changes and that's it.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.740
The whole process is finished.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.050
You already have a user and a database called figures.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.800
Now we can go ahead and send the WordPress installation fire to the server.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.900
If you know how to use an FTP client go ahead and submit the WordPress installation file

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.010
via FTP.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.250
But for this tutorial on going to use the C panels file manager,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.060
let's go back to the sea panel.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.450
Dashboard head over to fire Manager.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.180
I'm gonna choose to open the public eight CML directory.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.690
And here's the folder where you'll be saving all the files from the WordPress installation

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.690
.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.090
If this is the first time you access this folder,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.450
you probably see some files like these ones here,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.950
and you can safely remove this files.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.050
So I'm gonna select this files and click this button here.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.450
Okay,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.160
Now,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.350
I'm going to send the WordPress installation file to the server.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.950
You can download this file directly from the wordpress dot org page.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.450
Okay,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.000
I have already downloaded,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.470
so I just click here to upload it.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.720
And in this new screen,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.450
I'm gonna click on select file.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.410
I'm gonna choose my compressed file and wait for the upload to finish.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.640
Okay.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.450
I can go back here to my folder.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:25.350
I'm going to select this file and click on extract.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:32.270
Okay.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.790
Ready?

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.220
Now,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.990
I can delete this installer and the WordPress installation files are inside this folder

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.350
called wordpress.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.650
But I don't recommend you to start off installation through this folder.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.950
So what I'm gonna do,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.180
I'm gonna enter this folder,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.950
juiced all of the files,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.010
click and drag to the public html directory.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:08.700
So the installation of WordPress will have at its starting point the roots directory of the

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.280
server.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.450
Not this Wordpress folder here.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.950
It's much better this way.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.550
Trust me.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.840
And also,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.050
I can remove this folder which at moment it's empty.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:29.150
Now we have everything ready to make a brand new installation of WordPress on remote server

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.230
later around this lesson,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.310
you understand why you're installing WordPress from scratch.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.780
OK,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.030
now we can access the website address,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.620
and if everything is OK,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.250
we'll see the WordPress installation page.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.160
You already know this whole process here from the first lesson of the course.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.870
So I'm going to speed up the recording a bit.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.870
-

00:06:51.870 --> 00:07:27.780
Okay

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:27.780
.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.750
Now we have a new installation of WordPress and what we're gonna do with it.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.550
Let's install a new plug in here called WP clone.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:41.790
So the whole thing you work as follows you're going to start this plugging in both the word

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:47.890
pressing instance we just created and the one we have on the local server in the local

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.850
installation will be creating a file.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.840
In that file,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.090
you'll be used to restore the full side back up on the remote server.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.250
Well,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:01.580
let's show you how this will happen in practice that's installed the plug in here on the

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.550
remote server,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:08.600
and this is all for now.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.260
We don't need to do any configuration right away in this plugging.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.710
Let's leave this window for a moment.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:35.420
Let's open our local installation of WordPress now,

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.100
unless did the same thing that did on the remote server.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.070
Let's install the WP clan plugging here,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.550
too.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:54.410
Well,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.570
now we have the plug installed in both locations on the local installation.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:04.500
We need to head over to the main page of the planning Clicking here on WP Clone.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.150
This is the plug in configuration screen,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.570
but as I told you,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.610
it works great even without touching any specific settings.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.570
But if you want to know what settings are available,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.850
you can go ahead and click here in advanced settings.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.630
For now,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:29.350
what we're going to do here is to click on this large blue button and create a backup of

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.250
the local installation of Wordpress.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.820
When they did this.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.170
The plug in we create a backup file.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.490
If you can restore later on a remote server,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.850
let's click here them and wait a while until the process finishes.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.580
Okay,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.260
Once the backup is complete,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.250
have the screen.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.780
Here we have this link,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.400
which we could use to restore the backup.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:00.940
But this link works best when the nature transfer a site that is already online to a local

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.570
server or to a new remote server.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.310
But in our case,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.900
this link will be useless.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.250
However,

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.270
there was a short cut.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.360
We're gonna send this file,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:19.480
which is inside the WP content folder uploads WP clone directly to the same folder on a

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.550
remote server.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.710
To do this,

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.170
let's go back to the sea panel file manager.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:29.450
And what you see here at the moment is my remote server.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:29.950
Okay.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:37.480
As head over to WP content uploads no BP clone.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:42.240
Let's upload the file that is owned the local server in the same folder.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.500
But on our computer,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.400
I mean,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.660
on the hard drive.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:11:06.630
Wait,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.980
have this same file also on my remote server.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:15.150
Now let's head over to the mainstream off WP clone,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.500
Remember,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.270
I'm still on my remote server.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:20.750
Okay.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.310
And here,

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.100
as you can see,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.350
the gather file with just uploaded to the remote server.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.280
If you can't see this file here in the list,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.500
um,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.910
you see this button here that says skin and repopulate the backup list.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:40.800
Just click on it and you have this list updated what you're going to do next.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.570
Let's click this button here and down here.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.450
Another button we appear saying,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.950
Restore back up.
