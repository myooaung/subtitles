00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.725
Hello gays.

00:00:01.725 --> 00:00:02.985
In the previous lecture,

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.314
I told you that sometimes it's necessary to configure

00:00:06.314 --> 00:00:10.425
the Apache server if you find any problem in the way it's working.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:13.035
Or maybe when it's not working properly.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.040
If you are a MacOS ten or a Linux user,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.015
you certainly have promised installing WordPress duty permission issues.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.649
For example, on MacOS,

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.405
you'll see this screen here.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:27.900
When he tried to install WordPress for the first time, it says,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.250
sorry, but I cannot write WP config that PHP file.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.360
It's a good sign to us because that means WordPress will probably

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.570
not be able to write anything inside exams, HE docs folder.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.935
In the future, we may have problems downloading and installing plugins or themes.

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:51.110
The same happens only in x machines because you won't even be able to create a folder

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.930
inside the OPT lamp AT docs directory where XAMPP is installed by default.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.810
On MacOS ten, the HCI docs folder,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.550
which is inside the applications,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.295
doesn't have read and write permissions as well.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.895
So Mac users can live with that if they want.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:09.485
But I hate the idea.

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:15.754
I'll have integrate the WP config file manually every time I installed WordPress.

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:18.125
If you also run into this problem,

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:19.520
I'll teach you how to solve it.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.030
Now, for this, I'll be using my Mac OS ten,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.355
but you'll be able to do the same on Linux,

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:27.860
even using the very same Commands.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.010
I'll be showing you here because both Mac and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.655
Linux or Unix based operating systems again,

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.365
alright, to solve this problem,

00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:40.880
the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna change the location of the 80 docs folder.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.630
Okay?

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.360
So I suggest moving THE docs folder over to the Documents directory.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.975
So let's go to that directory.

00:01:55.975 --> 00:02:00.145
And I'm gonna create a new folder over here called H docs to.

00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:03.230
It is going to have the same name, right?

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.810
I'm gonna open my exams control panel.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.710
Select the Apache server, configure.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.035
Open come file. Click yes.

00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:28.210
So we're gonna make a change to the location where XAMPP looks for the application files.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.095
So instead of looking for those files in the Applications folder,

00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:36.170
it will start looking for them in the documents folder, right?

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.429
The first thing I'm gonna do is look for the correct place for editing.

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:50.240
So I want to find a line that starts with the word document root.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.640
Okay, these are the two lines and need to add it out.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.265
Let's change this path here and writing the new path for the API docs folder.

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:03.145
In my case, the new path is users.

00:03:03.145 --> 00:03:10.375
Marcello Vieira documents. At docs.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:14.380
In our case, the only thing that will change is your Mac username.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.284
Again, on Linux, it may be something like home.

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:22.520
Your user documents, 80 dogs.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.115
But if you don't know what your username is,

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:28.715
just open up your terminal and use the command, Who am I?

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.650
And you find out, okay,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.980
I'm gonna copy this and duplicate it down here.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.260
Alright? But I need to change one Murray Formation.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.010
Gonna look for a line that starts with user demon.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.790
So we need to change these two values here, user and group.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.545
The thing is that they need to reflect my own User and Group.

00:03:54.545 --> 00:03:56.675
To find out what those are.

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:59.489
I'm going to open up my terminal.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.925
And I'm going to use the id command.

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:11.435
And this here are the two information I need.

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:16.700
This u here inside the parentheses of the UID and the GID fields.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.550
Next I'm going to comment out this two lines.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.550
And I'm going to repeat the fields here with the new values.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.640
First the user, and then the group.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.590
Excellent.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.810
Now I can go ahead and save the file.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.595
I'm gonna restart Apache.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:45.170
Otherwise the server one,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.190
apply the changes made.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.585
Okay. Now it's already working with the new settings.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.355
Most of the time,

00:04:55.355 --> 00:04:58.745
all you have to do is to restart the Apache server.

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:01.655
But some users need to reboot the computer.

00:05:01.655 --> 00:05:03.485
I don't believe that's necessary,

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:06.200
but you may also try to reboot your computer.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.480
Now, if you're on Mac,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.690
just move the folder with your WordPress installation or

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.605
virtue its new directory are if you are only next,

00:05:15.605 --> 00:05:18.425
you need to start the installation process by creating

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:22.085
a new folder into the New Age docs directory, right?

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:23.795
And just to finish out,

00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:27.305
I need to give read and write permissions to the new folder.

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:31.355
So on my Mac, I'm going to unlock this padlock.

00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:35.070
And now we'll just change the permissions here.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.045
Close the bad luck.

00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:39.904
If you're using Linux,

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:43.040
it will variety depending on your Linux flavor, right?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.635
And now we can go back to the WordPress installation and it will work like a charm.

00:05:48.635 --> 00:05:50.705
If my solution doesn't work,

00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:54.095
you can always go back to the original settings.

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:57.905
You will just undo all the changes we've made, right?

00:05:57.905 --> 00:05:59.405
So that's all for now.

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.130
And I'll see you in the next lesson.
