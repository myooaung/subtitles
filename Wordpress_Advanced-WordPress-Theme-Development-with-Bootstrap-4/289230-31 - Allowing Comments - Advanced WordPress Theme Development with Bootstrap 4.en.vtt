00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:04.800
In the last lesson,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.645
we'll learn how to create a different view for each unique post of our fin.

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:15.645
In today's lesson, we go a little further by enabling a comment form for these pages.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:20.080
First, let's open up one of her posts for editing.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.110
I'm going to show you something that goes unnoticed for most WordPress users.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.745
Here at the top, I have this little drop-down menu screen options,

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:35.120
which most people don't even know about.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.330
Just so you know, in the new WordPress editor,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.700
you can find this menu in a different place.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.040
You just click here on these three little dots and choose options.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.380
In this menu, you'll notice that there is a series of check boxes.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.050
Each one of them allows us to enable or disable some editing area here of the page.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.065
In fact, we call these areas mailboxes.

00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:04.535
So every check box here lets you hide our show mailbox.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:08.285
One of these mailboxes is called Discussion.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:12.485
I'll show you here on the page.

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:14.765
It's this one here.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:19.730
It allows us to define whether comments will be opened or not for a specific post.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.320
If it click here, we end up disabling comments for this particular post.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.510
Less uncheck this and say we don't want comments for this post.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.170
So no visitor can comment on this post.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.055
Okay.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.664
Same thing works for pages.

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:41.765
They may or may not allow comments for any pages within WordPress.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:47.060
Well, this explanation is important in order to understand the code that you'll be using.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.090
She call the comments form within the post and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.630
thus allow visitors to interact with our content.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.690
So let's open up our single dot PHP file.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.180
And here, before the loop is finished,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.950
let's perform a check.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.260
Let's create an if block.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.125
Let's close it out here with an endif,

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:12.680
so we will not have any problems in the future.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.689
And here inside the parentheses,

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.960
we want to check if comments are open for the post,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.770
which is the one that is being displayed at the moment by the WordPress loop.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.850
Let's also call another function that let us

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.150
know how many comments we have for this post.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.080
Okay? If comments are open,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.710
we're going to call the comments form at this point.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.435
It do this by calling the comments template function.

00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:53.560
Well, what this function basically does is render a standard comment form on the screen.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.210
In order for this to work,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.970
you need to have a file called comments dot PHP at the root of our themes folder.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.680
If you don't have that file,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.010
WordPress for user fallback file.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.245
It has the same name,

00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:10.685
comments dot PHP, taken from its default theme.

00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:16.430
That's one of the reasons why removing this default WordPress themes is not recommended.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.455
You'll never know when you need them.

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:23.120
So what we're going to do now is to get a copy of that file taken from

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.010
the 2016 theme and create a new one at the root of our themes folder.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.605
If you don't have the 2016 theme installed,

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:34.370
you can download a free copy of the thing in WordPress themes directory,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.730
a recommended to use this particular thing because it doesn't

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.975
contain any specific function that you need to copy in order to use it.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:44.930
For example, if you open the 2019 thing,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.810
you will find a couple of specific functions such as 2019 gap discussion data,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.630
2019 comment form, or classes such as 2019 Walker comment.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.610
I mean, all of these functions and classes that has the thing's name on them.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.570
All of them are within the 2019 Themes folder.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.260
So if you don't copy the original functions to your own thing,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.780
the comment form will not work.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.015
By the time I recorded video,

00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:16.640
the 2016 theme has this advantage.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.995
There are no specific functions within it,

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:23.405
so it can take the whole Comments.find HB file with no worries.

00:04:23.405 --> 00:04:26.300
If in the future that scenario changes.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.510
Remember, you need to copy the function declaration to

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.680
your own thing in case you have doubts doing it, please do.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.185
Ask me and I will teach you how.

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:40.295
For this lesson, I'm not going to create a new market for this file,

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:43.220
but it can do that later as an exercise again,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.035
of course, if you want to try.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.515
The fact is that many themes developers do the same.

00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:51.410
They just make a copy of the default comments

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.890
template file and add it to their own themes.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.630
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.570
Actually, many things that can be downloaded from

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.095
the WordPress repository itself are made this way.

00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:10.490
So I'll go ahead and create a file called comments dot PHP and paste,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.430
everything you just copied in there.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.210
Let's save this file and let's open a post.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.695
We start by opening up posts where comments are allowed.

00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:27.050
For example, this one here.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.430
Look at this.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.055
We have now our comments form.

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:33.650
As I'm logged into the site,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.590
you see that the form is displaying like this.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.210
Now, if I log off,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.310
they have a slightly different form.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.185
And now you see a firm with different fields.

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:47.000
Now if I want to comment,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.655
I have to give more details like my name,

00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:51.690
my email, et cetera.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.010
Now, let us choose that post.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.649
We decided it wouldn't be open for comments.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.025
And as comments are not opened for the spores,

00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:06.970
we simply don't have the POS form displaying on it.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.785
But if you want to change them,

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.990
let's open this pose for comments them.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.730
Now reloading the page.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.180
We have the form to make comments.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.615
But if your thing is not displaying any form,

00:06:28.615 --> 00:06:34.155
it may be that your installation is completely closed for comments.

00:06:34.155 --> 00:06:36.860
You can check many other rules related to

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.430
the discussion within your site by going over to Settings.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.510
Discussion.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.950
For example, here I can define that my site will not accept comments.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.810
So regardless of the individual settings of each post or page,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.280
your site will never accept comments from visitors causing it.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.420
So I have an exercise to propose you copy everything you

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.175
have in your comments that PHP file and make a new file out of it,

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:10.265
and then make any changes in your new file.

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:14.390
For example, you can move tags from one place to another.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.795
You can remove some fields, you name it,

00:07:17.795 --> 00:07:22.775
then call this modified file inside the commons template function.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:27.950
To do that, you can simply pass the filename inside single quotation marks,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.820
starting with a slash and see what happens.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.690
Let's, it will be back in the next lesson,

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.210
which will then bees out.
