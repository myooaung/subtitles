00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370
Hey,

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.130
what's up?

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.070
Welcome to warm a lesson.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.150
As you know,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.720
we're learning to make our theme ready for good.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.200
And Berg,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.150
we already know what good number ISS You've been introduced to this new amazing tool.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.400
We enabled some cool features.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.100
We fixed some bugs,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.780
etcetera.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.560
In today's lesson,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.750
we continue to add support to some other advanced futures.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.150
This time we learn how to add our own custom colors to the good and very color palette.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.950
And what's this for?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.990
Well,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.820
by now you've seen that users can do almost everything they want when they're editing posts

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.630
and pages.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.680
But let's suppose you want the end users to be able to create an element that use only the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.250
callers who have already defined in your fame color palette.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.160
Well,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.740
you have the biggest job of all choosing the caller's testing them,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.770
combining them,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.800
and you don't want the user to turn his or her website into a rainbow home.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.560
My goodness,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.710
surely you don't want that.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.450
So with Gutenberg,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.920
he can determine that the user will only be able to choose the colors that you want

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.000
throughout the side,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.870
visually true for every element that can let you choose different background and tax colors

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.870
.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.630
For example,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.030
blocks such as the paragraph,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.710
all the button block by default.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.110
Gutenberg already comes with a default color palette set,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.670
so if you create a paragraph block here on the block inspector,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.630
under color settings,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.050
you already have these colors to find.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.320
Also,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.850
the user can choose other colors here,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.950
but let's put an end to this mass and find her own colors.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.040
First,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.050
let's add some more support in functions that beach be.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:04.010
The name of this new future is editor hyphen color hyphen palette.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.010
40 to work.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.150
We first opened in a ray here,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.970
an insight to have another array,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.870
and now we're gonna pass some arguments.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.950
The 1st 1 is name.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.850
Let's call the get text translation function.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.750
I will name this color blue to red.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.090
It's just a name.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.710
Okay,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.150
The next color won't be exactly blue to red,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.080
but it'll do for the moment.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.340
The next argument is the color slug.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.240
This is very important because it will help us define the caller via CSS.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.170
Well,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.450
I said its value as Blute hyphen read,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.750
and the less one is color.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.960
Harry,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.730
pass the hex color code in our case.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.220
It is the red color we use in our theme.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.550
Not exactly the blue red color has a said,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.270
but it doesn't matter to set a second color,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.190
just copy disarray here and change the values.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.360
Let's create an option for the white collar.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.150
For example.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:29.920
This will only help us showed shoe later.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.760
Color circles in the block.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.450
Inspector.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.840
If we saving reload good Romberg.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:53.100
Now we click to select the paragraph again color settings and look here our colors.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.040
I can use this white color too sad.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.690
The phone color and the red color will be the background off our paragraphs.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.750
I can do the same thing for a button.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.240
For example,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.450
let's add a block with a button.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:26.430
But the problem is that if you look at the front end,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.650
nothing will appear with the corner that we choose.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.310
As I told you earlier,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.690
we need some customization before using most of the futures we enabled via add things.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.080
Support There is.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.250
It's quite simple.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.240
If you look at the HTML called for the block here in Gothenburg,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.750
you see that WordPress creates a special class that starts with has hyphen,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.450
Then you have the strength for this luck argument.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.570
Any context of use in this case,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:07.010
that red color that was used for the background color and that what color set for the phone

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.300
color in other for them to be available in the front.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.700
And we have to add a correspondence CSS to the things CSS file.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.150
But that's it will be like a piece of cake.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.450
Let's open the CSS file again.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.410
First,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.330
let's set the red color to the background and phones the name of the selector will always

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.350
start with has hyphen.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.700
Afterwards,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.550
we need the colors luck,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.950
Blute,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.040
hyphen,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.950
rad.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.280
And then the context are the background.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:53.770
We used background Hyson color now just past the color hex code to the background color

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:05.310
property No for the front color.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.350
Let's best has hyphen Blute,

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.380
hyphen,

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:19.070
rad and color as the contexts of use and passed the hex code here to the color property.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:27.850
And that's a now just do the same thing for the white color.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:39.830
All right,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.600
just say ever changes.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.330
And now let's go back to the front end.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.790
Let's reload the base using contro,

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.940
shift our to clear the browser cache.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:59.150
We don't want to load our CSS fire from the cash and there you have it,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.260
the button and the paragraph,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.350
everything with the corner of a defined and one last tip.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.880
Let's assume you don't want the user to choose different colors at all on the side.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.460
You can even disable the color picker.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.350
For this,

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.400
you need to add some more support.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.850
This one is called disabled Custom colors,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.050
so at theme support,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.150
disabled hyphen,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:49.350
custom hyphen colors and for no own the user Onley be able to choose the colors that to

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.350
define earlier.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.850
That's great.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:58.280
One cool think is that Could Amber gives you some tips when the color combination is

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.250
inconsistent?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.120
This can prevent the user from chosen color combinations with very low contrast,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.970
for example,

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.760
but the final word is yours.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.980
As the film developer,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:15.560
you're going to define the extent to which your fame we restrict or extend Gutenberg's

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.600
functionalities.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.450
It's in your hands and the same concept or supplies for four sizes.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.450
Here in the paragraph block under deck settings,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.580
you can set different values for these buttons.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.430
For example,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.980
change the S M L and Excel labels,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.650
and also different sizes associate it with each of them.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:45.100
The process is very similar to the one explained in this lesson.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.650
I'll leave you a link to the WordPress documentation explaining which codes You have to use

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.340
the customized text as the process is very similar to the one we've just seen.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.750
I won't go over it.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.150
Okay.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.490
You can take that as an exercise if you want to implement it.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.880
But I'm going to stick with what they got.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.690
Well,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.080
I hope you like it and wait for you.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.650
Then in the next lesson recording.
