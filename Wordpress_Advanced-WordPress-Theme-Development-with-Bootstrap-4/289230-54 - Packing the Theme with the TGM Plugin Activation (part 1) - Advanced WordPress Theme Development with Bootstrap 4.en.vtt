00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
Hi there.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.590
We're almost coming to the end of this course,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.380
and you're ready to go on with another lesson.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.490
Remember that at the end of the plug installation section,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.550
we had an unanswered question.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.680
I asked you the following question.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.090
That's supposed I want to distribute my thing.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.950
How can I?

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.880
Did you also make plug ins available to download along with my theme?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.750
Is there a way to bound of the necessary plug ins along with the thing?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.100
Let's think for a moment when I create a word pressing,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.450
I can easily make all the thing files available.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.900
I just need to compress all the files that are inside the things folder.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.120
Basically,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.140
it is what the thing belters due to make their things available in wordpress dot org or in

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.880
theme forest,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.650
for example.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.660
But what about the plug ins?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.710
We have two problems with them.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.600
First,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.550
Most of the time,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.560
they are third power creations,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.650
so your thing users would need to download each blagging if they want to use them.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.230
The second issue is that all the information in this blood is not storing files.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.250
For example,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.950
you cannot make the plugging data available to this themes for their here.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.890
This data is stored in the database,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.560
so we are in dire straits.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.520
The theme we created needs certain plug ins to work,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.150
but we are unable to deliver this black things along with the thing.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.950
So what can I do to fix that?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530
Fortunately,

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.330
there is a very interesting library used extensively by thing developers that can help us

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.840
solve this dilemma.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.810
Its name is DJ AM plugging activation,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.030
and I'm going to teach you how to use its basic futures from now on.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.530
Okay,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.840
To start off as head over to the library website and here on the side,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.860
let's click on the download link on the first question you have transfer is very used,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.850
the DJ and plugging activation.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.250
I stay here,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.450
we're going to use it in a theme.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.450
It's also say that you distribute the theme in wordpress dot org,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.890
and next,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.350
let's inform the text domain over theme.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.490
The tax domain has been defined in our lessons about thing internationalization.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.770
In our case,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.100
it's called learned WP.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.710
Okay,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.720
with all the required field set,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.110
we're gonna generate the library files.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:45.230
Let's save it here onto the computer and when the open the folder have a bunch of files,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.680
but in fact well,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.350
basically need two of these files here.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.000
One of them is three class D g.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.180
M.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.350
Plugging activation that PHP file.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.610
And the other is this same profile here that we were renamed.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.150
Later.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.790
First thing.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:09.350
Let's copy these two files and paste them inside our things Inc folder.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.320
It doesn't have to be exactly in this folder,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.780
Okay,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.550
But I'm going to put the two fouls here just for organization purposes.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:30.050
And now I'm going to rename this file name example that HB two required plug ins that PHP

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.290
later on.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.580
You understand why I'm doing this now?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.050
Inside the simple file,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.050
I see what they got.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.650
Well,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.300
the first thing we notice is that it's a very big file with a lot of gold,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.590
and a lot of it is commented out.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.150
But don't be intimidated by this because it's very simple to deal with this file.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.680
The first practical think we're going to do is find a way jingle of this class file in our

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.140
fame.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.050
In fact,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.350
this is the true working mechanism off this to GM library.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.950
You're above you can see that this is the first instruction that we have to follow.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.750
We must use a require one speech.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.450
Be comment.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.050
Include this class file.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.010
Here We have an example of how to do this using apparent theme,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.440
which is our case or child theme,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.650
which is not our case at the moment.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.390
So let's do this.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:32.480
Let's comment out this line down here and we're going to copy the require one example to a

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.250
parent seem.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.010
And we're going to base this lying in our functions file.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.650
It's always the functions file,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.700
So let's open this file unless space the line,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.650
we have just copy it here.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:57.470
We just have to change the path in order to match the actual file.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.000
Let's delete is content here and type in ink instead.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.090
Now let's copy this line here and also called the example file that we re lane to required

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.560
plugging start PHP.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:23.810
So we need to require this Jew files here if you want a good copy dysfunction here to your

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.230
functions files that.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.900
But I prefer to require this whole file.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.500
I think it's easier by doing this when we're pressed lows the function foul.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.250
It will also automatically called DJM land remain class file.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.700
Well,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.410
this lessons will be divided into three.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.980
Okay,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.890
I think this way it will be easier to understand.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.600
So that's all we have for today's lesson and await for you,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.150
then in the next one,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.270
do you?
