00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.485
Hello.

00:00:01.485 --> 00:00:03.105
In todays lesson finally,

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.750
we'll learn how to put a map from Google at Barnard birthing.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.290
My initial thought was to install one more plug-in to do this,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.440
but we'll create this map without the use of plugins this

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.925
time for this lesson where we use the Google Maps in that API.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:21.030
Currently the use of this API is free.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.125
Since June 2018, Google started to require a billing account to use any API,

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.825
but it seems that this has changed recently.

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.495
Considering this documentation.

00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:34.940
I hate Google's documentation.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.470
You spend hours and hours,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.150
you understand how things work.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.560
But judging by this part of the documentation and by my testing,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.800
the use of the Maps API is once again totally

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.980
free and without any connections to a billing account.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.970
Much better.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.730
So let's go, let's implement our map.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.230
For this to be possible,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.635
we're gonna open the Google documentation to understand how it works.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:02.210
This link will be available to you in the additional material of this lecture.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.610
Ok, so don't worry about it.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.490
Well, the first thing I need to say is you need

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.115
to access the link with your Google account.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.095
Or if you don't have one,

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:14.540
you can create one for free, of course.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.595
And then you come back here.

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.490
Well, this API works quite simply.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.160
Basically it adds an iFrame with information from a map of a particular location.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.585
To implement these maps will basically need a Google API key,

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:31.385
as i mentioned previously.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:38.660
So let's copy all the contents of this iframe as open up the Page home dot PHP file.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.815
And we're gonna see where our map will be placed.

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:45.425
Let's delete what we have here,

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:47.900
including this container and this row,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.245
which we will not need because the map we'll span from right

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:55.235
to left and left space iframe here.

00:01:55.235 --> 00:02:00.935
As modified this markup a bit so that the appearance of the map stays the way we want.

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:04.490
Let's change this width to 100%.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.320
And the height is 350 and less.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:18.335
Add another information at the end of the string and present zoom equals 15.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:21.200
This ensures that the zoom over map,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.525
you'll start with a value of 15,

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:29.105
which is a zoom value that allows us to feel the streets on the map at a good distance.

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:31.474
Now to make the map really customized,

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:33.470
we need two pieces of information.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.170
The first one is the services API key.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.395
So let's go back to the Google's website.

00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:43.565
As click here on get api key.

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:46.670
Click on this blue button.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.630
And this will take you to the project creation page.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.865
If you're I own a project,

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.185
you can use it, okay?

00:02:54.185 --> 00:02:58.385
But usually you will have to create one from scratch.

00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:00.845
If this screen comes up,

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:04.230
select your country and agree with the terms.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.625
Click here to create a project.

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:10.205
Give it any name.

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:13.770
And click here to create the project.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.289
Project created.

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.945
Click on APIs and services.

00:03:26.945 --> 00:03:29.430
Credentials.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.910
Create Credentials. Api key.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.800
Now you can copy and use this API key.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.005
One important thing you can do is restrict the use of your API key.

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:53.990
This can help you avoid unauthorized use of requests coming from your API key.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.710
Since you may be charged if the number of request is too large,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.590
but that doesn't apply to the Maps API as far as I could tell still.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.900
So you can click here on this link and apply as many restrictions as you wish.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.910
For example, it can restrict the use of your API key only on your website.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.550
So to do this, click here,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.550
and then click here on this link.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.220
And let's go ahead and add your side.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.215
Let me cancel this.

00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:29.450
You can also select the services for which your API will be restricted here below,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.745
click here on restrict key and select the API if there is a logo.

00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:37.655
So let me cancel these once again.

00:04:37.655 --> 00:04:42.410
Now you need to define which API you use for the map.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.424
So here under APIs and services,

00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:52.020
we click on Library view.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.080
Let's enable these service called Maps embed API.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.729
Click here to enable.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.580
And let us go back to the credential space.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.685
Let's copy this key.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:25.700
Unless paste it in the field specified in the iframe after these key equals here.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.030
Now to finish, we just need to give an address.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.010
This address will allow the API to center the map and apply marker to this address.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.120
As I'm just doing a test here how we've addressed the way it is.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.600
But notice that the address has this plus signs.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.795
If you decide to change the address later, for instance,

00:05:46.795 --> 00:05:49.334
given your home or office information,

00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:53.315
just replace each space with a plus sign. That's it.

00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:55.715
But then you can ask me, Marcello,

00:05:55.715 --> 00:06:00.785
if I'm developing this theme for someone who doesn't understand PHP HTML,

00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:07.415
he or she will be forced to open this file and type the address and the key manually.

00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:09.785
Let's not feasible at all, don't you think?

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:12.800
Not? Everyone knows how to measure it code?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.300
Yes, I totally agree that it's really not feasible, but don't worry,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.295
because until the end of this course,

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:24.200
I will teach you how to churn out all this into something much, much more dynamic.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.985
Just wait, and trust me,

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:28.805
for now, let's see how our map looks like.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.625
Let's visit the homepage of our theme.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:36.180
And let's see if the map is showing up down here.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.970
Perfect.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.150
Is our map centered on the address we chose.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.395
And with the marker,

00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:51.575
as I said, Did you like it? I hope so.

00:06:51.575 --> 00:06:56.420
It's a very simple and fast way to implement a map without needing applying.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.400
Very good. In the next lesson,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.330
we'll continue and we'll implement our social media icons.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.560
So until then.
