00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Hey, what's up, guys?

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.930
Welcome to this lesson.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.775
Well, I'll start by saying,

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:07.545
this is an optional lecture.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:12.645
Its purpose is to teach you how to install a local server on your computer.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.720
So if you already know what a local server is,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.280
you already worked with it.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.545
If you already know how to install one,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.530
we can skip this lesson with no problems.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.815
Firstly, why do you need a local server?

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.125
A lot of people ask me this question.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:31.710
Well, the common practice in the web development world

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.830
is that you have separate environments for production and development.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.605
Production environment will be where the work would be public,

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.915
which in the case of web development,

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:44.570
will be a hosting servers for example.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.715
Whatever the scenario is,

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:52.160
I think it's always better to develop our solutions locally and only after it's ready.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.070
Sent everything out to a production server

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.520
where your application will be available to everyone.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.365
There are some reasons for this,

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.795
such as saving hosting bandwidth,

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:08.030
avoiding unnecessary use of server memory resources, et cetera.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.040
If you don't have to worry about it,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.310
it's OK. Another reason is that it's better to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.944
fail in a development environment than in a production environment.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:22.940
Imagine if you install a plug-in or make an update that breaks your website.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.180
If you do this on a production server, it's done.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.275
You have to make up lost ground and as soon as possible.

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:32.930
But if this happens on a local server,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.145
you have time to analyze any kind of error that may have occurred.

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:40.145
So that's what we're going to do in this course.

00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:43.415
Less initially installed our local server,

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:45.830
then WordPress on top of it.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.450
And at the end of the course,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.745
I'll teach you how to send the whole project to a remote web server of your choice.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.920
So let's get started.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.505
There are several choices for installing a local server.

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:01.265
Basically, you need not only the server,

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.215
which in our case will be Apache,

00:02:03.215 --> 00:02:05.900
but you also need some applications to manage

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.845
your database and the PHP language library itself.

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:14.180
Some more advanced users install all this future separately.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.280
But there's no need for that.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.480
As we can install a package that can manage the Apache server,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.195
MySQL database, and PHP.

00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:27.680
In this lesson, you'll be using one of these packages called XAMPP.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.515
Some people also pronounce it example.

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:32.105
Just a quick note.

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:35.405
I've noticed that currently some of my students are using

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.750
other tools like local by flywheel or Docker.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.700
If you want to work with them, Go ahead.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.260
I will not be using them here,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.120
especially since you never know when these jaws will no longer be available.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.530
If you want to use them,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.360
do it at your own risk.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.800
Okay. Because I won't be able to provide support for them unfortunately.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.935
So let's head over to the XAMPP website,

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:03.960
which is at www dot apache friends dot ORG.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.000
And here on the homepage we see this information saying that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.095
XAMPP is the most popular PHP development environment.

00:03:15.095 --> 00:03:20.135
Fit it, you can easily install the Apache server with Maria DB,

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:22.475
which is equivalent to MySQL.

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:24.065
Php itself.

00:03:24.065 --> 00:03:26.330
This is exactly what we did.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.800
One of the advantages of XAMPP is that it is multiplied for,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.895
I mean, you can style it on any operating system.

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:36.530
As I'm using a Mac,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.140
I'm going to download the Mac version.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.705
But if you use Windows, for example,

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:45.065
you see that the steps for installing are not that different.

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:47.030
By the way, in my opinion,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.455
the configuration of the XAMPP environment in Windows is even easier.

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:52.925
But let's go ahead.

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:57.140
Before we move on. There's only important information for Mac users.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.975
There are two types of installers for Mac.

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:04.820
When will a VM Virtual Machine and other version without the VM?

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.940
Now I recommend that you go ahead install the second one.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.445
I mean, the one without the virtual machine.

00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:12.305
So in order to download it,

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:14.930
I'm going to click here on this link.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.815
Now scroll down to see our options from egg.

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:20.840
If you use another OS,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.455
you could also choose another version here on this page.

00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:27.605
Now I can choose between the PHP versions.

00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:29.690
As I'm going to use PHP seven,

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.985
I can choose one of these options here.

00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:36.365
Actually were pressed needs at least PHP seven to work correctly.

00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:40.355
So down download introversion wishes ordered and seven, okay?

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:45.289
And my case, I'm not going to download the file again as I have done this previously.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.870
I'm going to access my downloads folder.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.190
Double-click the installation file,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.270
double-click the application icon,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.444
and click on open.

00:05:04.444 --> 00:05:07.200
Enter my password.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.895
And I will just proceed with the installation process. Next.

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:18.395
Next.

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:24.500
Next, I can uncheck this check box here. Next.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.520
Next, how the installation begins.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.755
Now from here, I can already launch the application or open it later.

00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:40.955
If I want you.

00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:45.305
I'm going to uncheck this option here and click on finish.

00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:49.320
Now can go ahead and fire up XAMPP.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.700
Enter my password again.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.600
And here I have the application main screen.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.365
Here I can choose to start and stop all the servers.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:12.094
For example, the Apache web server or the MySQL database server.

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:16.595
I can even start all at once by clicking on this button.

00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:22.100
And here I can also configure the Apache server or my SQL.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.220
But this will be useful if you have a problem or

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.460
if you want to do some more advanced configuration.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.485
By the way, in the next lesson,

00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:32.915
you'll learn how to make one of these settings.

00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:36.200
The next video lesson will be of great help for those of you

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.440
who have difficulties installing WordPress on Mac or Linux,

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.480
especially due to permission issues.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.740
For now, we have

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.080
a fully functional development environment to check if everything is really working.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.260
I start all the servers here at once.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.770
Go ahead and click this button, start o.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.120
And let's go back to our browser and typing here,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.330
local host, hose ledge, dashboard.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.860
If you can't see the screen,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.380
it means that the installation is working.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.910
If you're not seeing it,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.225
first check if the Apache server has started.

00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:18.800
It has to be green.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.184
And with the running status,

00:07:21.184 --> 00:07:26.240
you can also check if there is an error message under the application log.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.360
If there are any errors, you see them here.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.885
And you can have an idea of what is happening.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:35.705
Okay, to access the database manager,

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.195
just go to localhost,

00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:42.810
forward slash PHP, my admin.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.120
And you see the screen here.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.605
This is very be creating your database to install WordPress, for example.

00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:55.520
Okay, one more information before we leave for the next lesson.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.385
All the projects recreate on our local server.

00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:03.665
By default, you have to be created inside the XAMPP HCI docs folder.

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:08.900
To find it, you can open your file manager applications.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.520
Xampp, HCI dogs in Windows,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.340
this directory is in C. Then HE dogs for our project,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.045
for example, will be creating a folder called WP.

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.730
Later on, all your other projects can

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.585
also be created here with different names, of course.

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:32.360
In other two-axis your project,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.110
you just type in the browser the word localhost,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.645
followed by the name of the create a directory,

00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:42.740
for example, localhost, forward slash WP.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.370
Great, but you understand that better in practice.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.430
In the next lesson. I hope you found this lesson

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.180
useful and see you in the next lesson and show them.
