00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
Hey guys.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:06.825
In the last lesson we talked about the two basic files for creating a WordPress thing,

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:10.800
index.html and style.css in today's licensed.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.425
Finally, we're going to start creating something.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.015
In the next few lessons,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:18.135
you'll be able to create your first theme ever.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.925
You'll be able to access the Wordpress admin.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:22.320
See your theme there.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.290
An activated That sounds great, doesn't it?

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.060
So let's get started.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.965
The first of the things we're going to do is create the folder structure of the thing.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:36.660
As you know, my Wordpress is installed here in this WP folder.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.629
And inside that folder we have WP Content.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.785
And then the Themes folder,

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:46.235
which is where all of the themes must be created.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:47.645
So inside this folder,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.580
I'm gonna create a new one,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.159
and I will name it, learn WP.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.885
And inside this new folder,

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:59.765
I'm gonna create the two more important thing files.

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:08.160
First they have index.html and then style.css.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.750
Another thing I mentioned previously in this course is that we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.080
have to identify this theme within WordPress admin.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.170
So if it jump into the dashboard and head over to the appearance menu themes,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.295
you'll see all the things that we have already installing WordPress.

00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:31.490
We have the WordPress native themes here.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.100
And also our learned WP.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.980
Notice that the new theme was included

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.340
here in the list based on the new folder you just created.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.900
But there's nothing that can be used to recognize this particular thing.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.560
Unlike the other things that are easily identifiable.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.925
To solve this problem,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:55.355
we have to create an image file and it must be called screenshot, okay?

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:58.790
And the extension interns should be P&G.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.455
To start with, I have already created the screenshot dot PNG for you.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:08.225
This is the same file that I will make available for you to download with the course.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:11.540
And I want to point out that you can find a copy of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.440
this file in the material available for download in lecture number two.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.855
Ok. So there is no need to send me messages asking for, for that image.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:23.135
It's already available for download, right?

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:28.190
But anyway, it's not so hard to create this file with any image editing software,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.495
even a free one,

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:30.980
you can easily created.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.840
The rules are the following.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.915
First, the file must have the PNG extension.

00:02:35.915 --> 00:02:39.125
Can we use the JPG extension inside?

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.460
Yes, you can.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.400
But it's not recommended by WordPress itself.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.900
If you read the documentation,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.860
you'll see that the guys only recommend a file with the PNG extension.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.690
So what can you do?

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.250
The dimensions must be 1200 by 900 pixels.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.980
Despite the fact that the image will show with

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.670
that dimension in the admin only in a few situations.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.645
So the recommendation is to have an image with 1200 by 900 pixels or write.

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:10.910
Another tip I would give you for,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.530
for your next projects is that you create a file only after the fin is ready.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.730
But for this course I will use this previously created image.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.150
Alright, so let's go ahead and grab that file.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.680
Let's copy and paste it inside the themes folder.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.490
Now if everything is correct,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.875
when we refresh the Wordpress admin,

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:45.395
we'll see our themes from their image represented by a screenshot that PNG.

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:47.990
Great, it's working.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.590
Now when we click here to see more information about the thing,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.665
we'll see the image in a much larger size.

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:59.585
But soon, you realize that there is no additional information about this theme.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:02.480
We only have the folder name here.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.925
So there is no versioning information.

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:08.105
Now that we have the authorise thing name.

00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:12.500
So how do we make this FEM information available in the same way we have,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.065
for example, for the native WordPress themes.

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:18.110
I mean, if we choose one of the native things,

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.020
we have several additional information about it.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.320
What is the kind of magic that makes that happen?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.510
Well, it's no magic at all.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.515
This information will have to be created in our style.css file.

00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:36.425
That simple for this to work will be simply using a CSS comment schema.

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:39.769
So those who understand a bit about CSS

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:43.625
also know that a comment in CSS is written like this.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:47.610
At the beginning we have a forward slash and asterisk.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.675
And at the end of the comment block,

00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:53.050
again, an asterisk and another 40 slash.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.300
This is how we create a comment that has more than one line in a CSS file.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.474
Anything I write here within this space here will at first be ignored.

00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:05.019
But not for WordPress.

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:09.640
Wordpress you use this area to recognize many information related to the themes,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.010
such as themes name, themes,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.980
author, its description, et cetera.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.750
The first finger going to type in here is the most basic information of all.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.165
What is our themes name?

00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:23.935
So let's type in here.

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:26.650
Theme name.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.925
And the name of our theme will be learned.

00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:31.115
Wp.

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:33.965
You can choose, of course, whatever name you want, okay?

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:36.755
We can also type in here the themes webpage.

00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:40.730
This information will then appear as a link in the dashboard.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:48.180
So let's go ahead and type in here theme, your R, i.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.150
And what hours?

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.905
The author's name.

00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:57.090
Author.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.675
We may also have a link to the author's page.

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:03.695
Author.

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:09.410
You are I. Now it can be the same information used for the theme URI.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.710
But if you have plans to submit your theme to any market place

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.845
such as WordPress.org or invited,

00:06:15.845 --> 00:06:18.410
I think forest in such cases,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.050
the two URIs cannot be the same.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.525
Ok, and what else?

00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:27.720
A description for the theme description.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.310
There are a couple more items to be included here,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.535
but you get to know them later in the course.

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:40.745
You'll be returning to this file a couple more times. Okay?

00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:43.730
All right, now I want to save this file.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.730
And now let's see what we have in the admin.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.790
All right, forget the themes name

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.770
here as go ahead and click here to see more information about it.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.410
Look at the name of the theme.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.065
Again. We don't have the version yet,

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:06.095
but in the next lesson, we'll take care of it.

00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:08.675
We got the author's name.

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:10.520
And if I mouse over this link,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.750
you'll see the URL to the author goes in it.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.365
Alright, for now, let's take a short break in this video.

00:07:18.365 --> 00:07:21.080
And when we come back in the next lesson,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.925
I'll show you how to activate theme using stylesheet we are just creating.

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:28.800
So until then, happy coding.
