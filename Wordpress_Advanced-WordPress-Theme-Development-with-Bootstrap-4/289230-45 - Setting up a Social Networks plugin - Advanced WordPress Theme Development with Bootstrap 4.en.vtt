00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
So hello dear students.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.445
In today's lesson, we are going to install another plugin.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.055
And this plugin will be responsible for showing

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:11.460
as the social media icons here in this area,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.890
which for now has only this text.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.870
Well, there are a handful of plug-ins and WordPress repository for this purpose,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.930
but I chose one that is easily to set up called social icons, widget and block.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.405
The author is WP zoom.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:30.190
So let's start by installing this plug-in.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.725
With the plug-in installed.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.160
Let's think for a moment.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.780
This plugin is a different kind of plugging.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.625
In fact, it is a widget.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:47.795
So to use it,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.825
we first need a new widget area available to it.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:52.070
We can add it.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.689
By the way, her, let's remember that going over to appearance widgets.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.305
We then have these five widget areas and we need a new one here.

00:01:03.305 --> 00:01:07.310
Otherwise, we will not have where to add this widget which has installed.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.160
You already know how to create a widget area, right?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.180
So we need to register one more area in the functions that PHP file.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.335
So let's open this file up in our sublime text.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:20.240
And if we scroll down,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.540
we have dispersion of the code where the existing widget areas are registered.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.935
To create one more is very easy.

00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:30.310
It's just copy all of this code here corresponding to

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.900
the register sidebar function and paste it just below.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.840
Just be very careful K,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.370
because the copied code has to be placed right after this semicolon here, okay?

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.135
Now the work will have,

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:52.760
will be to modify the name of the widget area,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.510
the ID, and the description.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.200
And the rest of the code will stay the way it is.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.360
Ok, let's go back to the WordPress admin.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.870
Now reloading this page,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.525
we can see that there is a new widget area.

00:02:19.525 --> 00:02:22.705
Now we can drag as many widgets as you want into it.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:26.455
But of course, we are interested in just one of these widgets.

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:29.634
Let's look for the plugin widget we just installed.

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:32.425
Social icons by WP ism.

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:36.230
Let's drag and drop the widget to the new area.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.505
And we can go ahead and configure out your options. Let's do this.

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:43.285
First.

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:46.555
We don't want any title because according to our layout,

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:50.650
we only want the icons with respective links. Nothing more.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.325
Here again, we don't want any text above the icons.

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:58.735
Well, I'll be setting up this plugging in a very basic way later.

00:02:58.735 --> 00:03:01.285
If you're interested, you can tweak the settings,

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.205
do your testing and so on.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:06.115
So I don't want to display any labels.

00:03:06.115 --> 00:03:08.875
I want links to open in a new tab.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.695
I'll leave these options here checked.

00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:14.410
This will add some additional information to

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.350
the links and you can check the source code later.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.740
This is very useful for your site's SEO.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.185
No icon alignment.

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:25.720
I will leave this option checked this,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.790
so add a background color to the icon.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.265
And if I choose this other option,

00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:32.850
the icon will have no background color.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.860
Okay?

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.279
Well, the icon style I wanted in a square padding, six pixels.

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.265
I can size, I will live as it is.

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:47.030
Here. You can set a unique color for the background and for

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.530
the hover state for all the icons when our clear out these two colors.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.525
And here finally, I can type in the links of my social networks.

00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:02.045
From here I just want a face MOOC.

00:04:02.045 --> 00:04:06.060
I went to paste here my Facebook or URL.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.030
I wanna delete. These are the two.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.880
And I'll click add more to LinkedIn.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.685
Okay, I'm gonna save this.

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:22.685
Okay, but of course it's not just that,

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:24.515
it's never that simple.

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:29.690
We still need to make some changes to the hair that PHP file wishes where the code that

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.015
generates this red bar comes from and call the new widget area there too.

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:37.650
So let's open up this file.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.000
And we're going to remove this text here.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.405
And instead, let's call the new widget area here.

00:04:44.405 --> 00:04:46.415
To do this is pretty simple.

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:50.615
Let's open the PHP tag here and write the following.

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:57.375
If is active sidebar.

00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:59.440
And what sidebar?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.814
The one that we have just created called social

00:05:02.814 --> 00:05:11.260
hyphen media, dynamic sidebar.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.820
And we pass the name of the sidebar widget area again to the function.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.365
Notice that here I passed directly the functions that load the sidebar content.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:26.110
I didn't need to create any specific file for them

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.200
the same way we did before for the service area.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.945
Remember, I mean, you don't always need a specific file to load the widget area content.

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:37.975
Okay, now we can see the result on the screen.

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:40.640
Let's refresh the page.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.920
A hand there we have the icons of

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.505
the CEU social networks that we feel the end in our region.

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:51.635
And if you want to add more icons,

00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:56.090
just go back to the widget and fill in with the address for another social media.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.795
Okay, so that's what I had to show in this lesson.

00:05:59.795 --> 00:06:03.600
I hope you enjoy it. And I see you next time.
