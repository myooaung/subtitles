00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Hello guys, welcome to a brand new section of our course.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.460
This section will be slightly different from the rest.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.590
So far, we have been able to create pretty much the whole structure of our theme.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.145
We have already created the template for the inner pages.

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:20.220
We already know how to control the WordPress loop,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.720
handled the pagination, add him support and many other things.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.345
But if you look at homepage hover thing,

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:31.995
you see that it still seems a bit far from the original layout.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:36.045
This is because some essential areas like the slide show,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:39.810
the social media icons and the map are still missing.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.010
In addition to them, we still need to take care of

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.685
things like the responsive menu and the contact forms.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:51.050
My proposal is to use plug-ins to view these areas.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.775
A lot of people ask me,

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:55.909
Why do you ask people to style so many plugins?

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.350
There was a plugin to include

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.489
a responsive menu and under plugging for social media icons,

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.360
this one for the slider contact forms.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.660
Well, there's a couple of reasons why I do that.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.385
First, developing all this from scratch would be hard work.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:18.200
If we have plug-ins that can do this hard work for us, let's use them.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.840
If I decide to teach you how to view every single functionality from scratch,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.585
this will be a never ending course.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.850
The second reason is because

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.640
even professional thing developers include

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.225
plug-ins when they are making their themes available for download.

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:38.585
For example, if you take a look at thing forest,

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:44.405
you'll find that most themes or maybe all of the things bounded, some plug-ins.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.820
So I can we, Moreover,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.300
all the plugins I'll be using here are free, okay?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.100
Which is good news.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.035
And the good news is,

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:57.905
if feeling tension is to make your thing available for download,

00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:02.660
I'll be teaching you how to blend all of the plugins with your thing.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.020
Yes, really? Every single plugging.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.780
This will be later on this course.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.210
So hedonic, it's worth it.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.200
When literal thing I would like you to consider is that you are free to

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.550
choose other plug-ins other than the ones I use here in this course.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.330
The truth is that since the moment I recorded this course for the first time,

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.890
some of the plug-ins have changed a lot and some have stopped offering support.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.475
So I do my best to update our adolescence in this section,

00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:34.955
but sometimes a GIS can do it as fast.

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:37.220
So in case any of the plug-ins I bring in

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.100
this section are not working the way you expected.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.930
Or as I show in the videos,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.450
feel free to choose another plugin, okay,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.515
even if your theme gets a little different from the one in this course,

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:52.310
don't bind yourself to my choices since there are thousands

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.405
of plug-ins available for free on the WordPress plugin is Repository.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:59.150
Don't put off your studies because a one plugging.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.885
Ok.

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:04.775
So after this sort of Mayor Cooper, let's get started.

00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:08.660
In this lesson, you're going to start with this slide show plugging.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.149
Let's go over to the WordPress Dashboard.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:15.020
And we're gonna install a plugin called Morrow press slider.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.140
Head over to the plugins menu, Add New.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.590
And here we're going to look for a plugin called motto press slider.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.260
Let's go ahead and install it.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.050
And now we can activate it.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.655
Among the free slider Plugins.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:41.890
This is one that I find more complete.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.335
Of course, it's not as good as premium plugins such as Slider revolution,

00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:51.790
but it's free and it really does a great job for us.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.840
Once installed, we have a new menu Enter down here.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.940
Let's click on moral press slider.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.560
And we got to the screen here.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.890
Well, before you start creating something,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.325
let's go for a more theoretical explanation.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:13.495
I think it's necessary to make this explanation because

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:18.365
some students are confused how these plugins work.

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:22.625
In this plugging and in almost all plug-ins,

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.640
like they have a structure like this.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.350
That is, we have a container which are the sliders.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.730
And inside them, they have each one of these slides.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.065
So this slider one has a first light,

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:41.555
a second one, and so forth.

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:49.085
So you can have as many sliders as you want and then as many slides as you want to.

00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:52.055
So on this page that we're seeing now,

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:53.900
which is the plug-in homepage.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.239
We have the list of all the sliders,

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:58.100
which are the containers.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.115
You can create as many sliders as you want.

00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:04.850
For example, we can have a slider that will be displayed on

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.590
the homepage and another one that will only appear on the about us page.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.670
Or you can still create more than one slider for the homepage.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.950
But for now I have no slider.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.190
So let's go ahead and create our first one.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.340
Let's click here on Create slider.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.390
And here we can choose which type of slider we want.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.505
We can have a custom slider,

00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:31.880
which will be a slider with any kind of elements we like.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.130
For example, we could create a custom slider with three slides within it,

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.350
H1 with a background image,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.755
some text, nick clicked to action button.

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:45.830
We could also have a post slider.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.140
And unlike the custom slider,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.320
this one is made up by posts or pages

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.830
that the plug-in we grabbed from the WordPress installation.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.845
And of course, if you don't want to have much work,

00:05:57.845 --> 00:06:03.770
we can decide to import samples of both accustomed slider and a post slider.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.755
As we don't have much time for this,

00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:12.575
I'm gonna go ahead and choose a building templates to help me create a post slider.

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:15.215
So what's the idea behind this?

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:19.040
Well, the idea is that you have a slider at the top

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.954
of the homepage showing the latest posts in a slideshow.

00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:29.240
Each item on the slider will have a featured image from the current post title,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.835
the excerpt, and the publication date.

00:06:31.835 --> 00:06:35.075
Only the OK.

00:06:35.075 --> 00:06:40.169
This selected, I'm gonna click here on Create slider.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.475
And the plug-in shows that the post sliders structure has been imported.

00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:49.925
And now we can start setting up the slider.

00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:52.620
Let's click on this button.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.500
Notice though, that alternatively,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.035
I can also access this configuration page to the plugins homepage.

00:07:03.035 --> 00:07:06.350
Look, my slider is already here.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.810
Just go ahead and click here on Settings.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.025
Okay.

00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:15.140
Notice also that this is still the Slider Settings page.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.950
That is your Sue configuring the slides container.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.730
We're still not setting up each slider items.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.100
Okay, soon we'll do that.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.855
Here on the first step,

00:07:26.855 --> 00:07:29.285
you want to include some basic information.

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:32.690
For example, let's type a name for this slider.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.859
Less change the name here for home slider.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.455
And here we want to add an alliance,

00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:44.990
for example, home hyphen slider.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.960
This alliance will be very important.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.250
It will be part of the short code that we need in order to include

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.825
the slider on our tablet or on a WordPress page or post.

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:00.220
If you want to do that.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.255
Let's change the height and width information as well.

00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:08.800
For the width, we're going to set that you went 1170,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.035
which is the initial default with other side, made with Bootstrap.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.480
And for the initial height,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.880
less sad that you 650 pixels.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.490
Here on size.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.205
Let's check this first checkbox.

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:28.700
By doing this, I went to ensure that we are going to have a slider

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.045
that can extend across the full width of the screen.

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:37.070
You can later trick these other settings to learn more about this plugin if you want.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:42.785
I am only going to work with the basic settings right here on slide show,

00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:47.000
we can set the types of effects that slide show we will have.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.270
We are going to change only one of these values,

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.350
which is relative to the amount of time each slide is on-screen.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.130
Let's decrease this value to 7 thousand milliseconds,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.950
which is the same as seven seconds.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.840
Here on controls, we can choose the Elements we want for the navigation.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.960
We can, for example, show the bullets disabled.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.185
The navigation arrows is at your discretion.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.545
I'm just gonna leave this as it is, okay.

00:09:15.545 --> 00:09:21.035
Here, under Appearance, you can change the slide show more generally.

00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:24.530
For example, it can hide a certain amount of slides at

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.340
the top of the list or set a delay to the beginning of the slide.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.950
Show what matters most to us here is this text area below.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.665
Here we can define CSS for any slider.

00:09:36.665 --> 00:09:40.760
And later on the course we're going to return to this place here.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.090
And finally, here under content,

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.655
it can set the sliders content.

00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:50.585
As we defined. That is liner will be made up by posts.

00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:55.910
All options are relative to which posts will be displayed in the slider.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.735
You can choose here the both type that is going to be used.

00:09:59.735 --> 00:10:04.355
For example, you may have both or pages.

00:10:04.355 --> 00:10:07.595
Let's leave it as it was before.

00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:12.485
We can also choose just a few categories or some specific tags.

00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:16.580
Pause Fermat's, and a bunch of other information.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.810
Let's say we want only five posts in our slider.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.035
And if I click here,

00:10:24.035 --> 00:10:29.030
I can see below the posts that will be displayed in the slider after everything's done,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.900
all based on the futures, I said above.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.140
Well, when you're happy with all the choices,

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.974
just click here on safe settings.

00:10:38.974 --> 00:10:45.920
Now you're ready to set up each individual slide as reworking with a previously imported,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.865
both slider will have less work to set up the slides.

00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:52.910
But as this lesson is already taken too long,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.360
we will continue on this process in the next lesson.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.290
So thanks for watching and see you in the next lesson.
