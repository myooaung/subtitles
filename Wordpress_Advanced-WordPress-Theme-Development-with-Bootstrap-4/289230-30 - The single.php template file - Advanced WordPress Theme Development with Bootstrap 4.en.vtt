00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
Hello,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.000
guys.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.570
We're back for a new lesson today.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.750
We're gonna learn what is the single doctor PHP file and how we can create it.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.820
A hint.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.850
It's one of the most important template files in WordPress.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.930
Let's start its lesson with a quick recap in one of the first lessons off the scores,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.570
I told you that when the pages of a word pressing are opened,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.330
a mechanism called the template hierarchy comes into action.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.190
According to this hierarchy,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.040
there's a main template file,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.210
which is the index dot PHP file.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.680
But now I think every one of you know that the content of this file is always displayed,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.650
especially when WordPress doesn't know which file to load in a given situation.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.870
For example,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.170
which file will be loaded when someone tries to open a page that doesn't exist in the thing

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.170
?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.530
Which file will be loaded when someone performs a search For those two moments,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.950
we may have specialized template files.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.150
In the case of a page not found,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.030
we may have a file called 404 dot PHP,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.390
which could have inside it the conch insane.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.160
For example,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.830
hoops,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.150
the page you're visiting doesn't exist.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.040
Do you want to do a search or return to the home patients that.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.310
But what happens when they don't have a file called for for that speech?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.390
Be in our theme.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.430
Well,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.180
what happens is that WordPress doesn't know which five to load,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.040
and so that the user decides Visitor doesn't come across an empty page or press lows thing

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950
next dot PHP file instead.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.300
So being Dicks file is what we call a fullback file.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.250
This is what is happening right now in our theme.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.210
When we click on end link,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700
that leads to a post.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.980
Since we don't have any specific template fire to load what presses load in the index dot

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.400
PHP file for us.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.250
But the index file cannot be used in any which way.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.620
Because of this,

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.960
we can create a different thing.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.400
Place fire to show a single WordPress posed a unique post,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.550
and that file will be called single dot PHP.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:24.740
So let's go ahead and create the style and like everything plate file.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.050
Let's start by creating the get header call.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.150
So yet on the score header.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.340
By doing this of any click on a post,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:46.350
you'll see that we have our header and down here that's called the Footer.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:56.310
Now anything we type in here will be displayed every time I click on any Lincoln opposed.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.450
Look,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.760
OK,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.570
but that's not what we want.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.380
What I mean,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.930
it's great.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.480
Here is a look that can print out the Post contents,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.560
and this time we'll have a standard WordPress look.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.030
Okay,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.650
no custom lips for now.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.930
Before that,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:25.680
let's great our HTML markup that's had a tiff tack here with the I d primary and inside it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.300
another def tech with the I d off main here.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:39.150
We're going to create a container so that our content is always centered on the page and

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.050
the loop is going to start here.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.660
The only difference is that we don't need the part that says,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.450
If have posts,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.840
can you answer white?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.650
Well,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.310
the answer is pretty obvious.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.130
We are already in the post,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.240
so we don't need to check for pulse.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.600
Right?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.610
If you're already displaying a single post,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.660
why do you need to check for posts?

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.450
It makes no sense at all,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.150
so we start up.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:19.350
They don't y block while have boasts the post,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.470
let's close out the wild block with end vile.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.040
Now,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.430
here at this point,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.520
we can choose to load the full count.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.850
It exactly here are creating a new file for it as then create a new foul as college content

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:54.710
hyphen single dot PHP and require it through the getting click part WordPress function To

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.660
speed up a bit,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:04.400
I'm gonna base here the contents off this file from this coat.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.550
The only thing you'll never seen before is this section here.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:16.500
I'm using a WordPress function called the I D to display the world post hyphen,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.850
followed by the idea of each post.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.600
This can come in handy when we want to style each specific boast.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.680
In addition,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.240
we created a header with tidal notice that the title is within an H one tag and since it is

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.350
the main heading tag off the page and it doesn't have any things since we don't need the

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.780
link anymore because we are already inside the post here below have the full counted of the

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.300
post,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.920
and that's it.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.350
Let's save this file.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.250
And when you open a post link,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.690
they have a new view for our single post.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.380
As you see,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.820
you got a totally different look when compared to the view over have before.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.630
For example,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.690
before we had the post featured image which came from the index that beach before.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.250
Now it don't have any image.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.150
And instead of the post excerpt,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.170
what they have is the full content of the post.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.250
This is not working for all the places where we have links that lead to any WordPress posed

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.250
goes in it.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.950
But there's still something missing.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.650
What if our visitor wants to comment on our post?

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.730
How will he or she do it?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.020
That's what we'll be learning to do in the next lesson.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.300
I wait for you then by
