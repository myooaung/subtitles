00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.900
Hello guys, as I told you in the last lesson,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.250
now is time to learn how pagination works on a WordPress theme.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.855
Well, let's start by looking at the post we have in the Wordpress admin

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:18.220
right now as head over to pose and click here.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.020
Now we're just open this page because I want you to see

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.320
that currently we have 11 posts here.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.115
If you don't have 11 posts in your WordPress installation,

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:33.060
just go head and create more posts so you can follow the explanations.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.405
Ok, well, now that you know that,

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:38.445
let's go over to the frontend.

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:41.410
Let's go ahead and visit the blog page.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.200
Let's see if we have all those 11 posts here.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.110
So 1234.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.790
Then look how strange only ten posts are displayed on this page.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.940
If my math is correct, one poses missing.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.655
So why is this post?

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.815
Let's do another test.

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.470
Let's do a fairly generic search.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.505
Let's search for all the posts that contains the letter a.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:16.325
You agree with me that most, if not,

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.625
all, post, should contain the letter a, right?

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:23.645
So we should have at least 11 results on the search page.

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:27.935
If we take into account that pages are post types within WordPress,

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:31.235
we can have up to more than a Level results.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:36.170
Well, let's check that out and see how many results we have.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:46.160
So 123. But again we have only ten posts.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.255
But why?

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:50.930
Well, the answer, as ever is quite simple.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.450
This both are actually hitting.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.625
In order for them to be displayed,

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.720
we need to enable pagination both in our index.html

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.745
file for the blog page and other pages that may use the defaults template,

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:09.035
as well as this search dot PHP file for the search results.

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:14.405
Imagination allows us to navigate the other pages that at the moment are hidden.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.895
But first, I have to answer a question.

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:21.079
Why do we always have to impose on those pages?

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.975
So let's go back to the Dashboard.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:28.230
Let's go over to Settings, Reading.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.100
And here we see an option that says blog pages show at most,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.755
which has the value of ten.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:38.735
So let's answer.

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:43.140
Let's change this value to five and see what happens.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.330
Reload this search page.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.890
Now I only have five posts shown here.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.000
And here in the blog page,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.670
we also have five posts.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.920
If there were pagination.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.870
As we have 11 posts,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.895
we should have three pages,

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:14.405
two pages with five pose H N1 less page with only one post, right?

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:19.279
Okay, we can have at least two types of pagination in WordPress.

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.870
Again, first of all,

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.465
implement pagination with links.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:29.600
This is the most common type of pagination and can find it on many websites out there.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.570
And we also have a numeric pagination,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.124
also quite common and quite intuitive.

00:03:36.124 --> 00:03:40.445
I'm gonna teach you how to create both types of pagination.

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.695
Firstly, for the blog page,

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:47.285
we're gonna create a pagination with previous and next lengths.

00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:51.245
For this, we're going to open our index file.

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:54.740
And we have to modify this loop here.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.875
As you know, the loop goes from here,

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:01.610
from the Y to the N wire.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.755
We're going to create the pagination links soon after the loop is complete.

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:10.265
That is, since we have five posts for each page,

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:15.574
are pagination will only appear after the loop brings this five posts.

00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:18.140
So here, after the end,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.560
while we're gonna close the PHP tag, open it again.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.260
And here in this space,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.060
we're going to create the necessary HTML markup for the pagination links.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.240
First, we need a bootstrap rule.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.500
And now let's create two div tags, each,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.835
but the pages class,

00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:44.090
which will then help us style the pagination later.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.825
This pages classes, not a bootstrap class arrived.

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:52.190
It's Sonya, self-defined CSS class and Bootstrap classes.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.725
You have position each link.

00:04:54.725 --> 00:05:00.965
The first navigation link will be positioned to the left and the second to the right.

00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:06.320
So let's use the tax left and text right Bootstrap classes.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.420
This column classes will guarantee that both links will have the same size,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.520
each occupying half the screen.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.310
Now, in other forward pagination to work,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.450
Let's replace this texts with WordPress functions.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.530
First, I'll be including the two functions and then I'll explain them to you.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.565
Okay, you must be thinking,

00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:35.945
I did something wrong.

00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:42.140
How come the link pointing to newer posts uses the function called previews post link.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.550
And the link pointing to the older posts uses next postLink.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.985
This seems should be very wrong, but it's not.

00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:52.595
It takes a while to get used to the idea.

00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:53.375
I know.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:58.280
In fact, all this will make more sense when you see the result.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.190
So let's save and switch to the front end.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.605
Here on the first page,

00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:09.035
we have the link to the older posts.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:13.670
It's being generated to the next post link function.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.880
That makes sense because the next post on

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.185
our list are actually the ones with the earliest publication date.

00:06:21.185 --> 00:06:22.790
Following this logic.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.785
If you go to the last page,

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:31.355
we'll see they're the oldest post of all.

00:06:31.355 --> 00:06:34.595
And really, if you go back to the dashboard,

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:38.705
you see that this post here is the oldest one.

00:06:38.705 --> 00:06:45.484
Instead, the link that points to the newer post uses the previous post link function.

00:06:45.484 --> 00:06:50.315
That's because the previous pose are the newest posts.

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:52.010
Did you get it?

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.175
Well, that's what we have for today.

00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:58.100
I hope you liked it and that it made sense to you.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.530
I know it's kind of weird at the beginning,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.725
but when you start creating your own things,

00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:06.875
you understand the logic and how things works.

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:09.890
In the next lesson, we'll come back and we're going to

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.730
implement another type of pagination for the search page.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.220
And she'll then happy coding.
