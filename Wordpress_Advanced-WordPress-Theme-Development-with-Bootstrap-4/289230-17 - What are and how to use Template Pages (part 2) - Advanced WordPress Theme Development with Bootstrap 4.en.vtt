00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
hello again.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.600
So continuing where we left off in this lesson,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.370
you're gonna learn how to create template pages,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.180
but in a different way.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.320
We're gonna adopt this strategy for both the contact and your about us.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.080
Page is Are you ready?

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.350
So let's go.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.010
Let's start by removing this file here page about Is that beach be,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.750
since it will not be used virtuous any longer?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.950
And now let's create another file with a very different structure.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.120
Still living are things folder.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.050
We're going to save this file and its name is gonna be general hyphen template dot PHP.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.750
Let's use a comment structure that for President a magically identifies as a template page

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.750
.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.730
As the name implies,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.290
this file will serve as a template.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.520
The advantage of this template is that it can be reused.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.450
As you see,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.790
I start by opening the PHP tags inside them.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.550
You want to create a comment?

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.050
Let's type in here Template name.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.850
Let's call it general template.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.720
That is,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.390
it will serve any kind of pages I want.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.670
But if you want to give another name to your template,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.890
go ahead and do that well.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.770
How well the structure of this general thing play to look like again,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.720
let's grab a copy of our index dot PHP file l espace the content with Just copy it into the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.950
new template file.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.370
Okay,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.920
we cannot start excluding sections.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.570
And if tags we don't want in this template,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.950
we can even exclude the bootstrap row,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.680
since we will have only a single column that will span the entire width of the page so we

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.650
don't need column classes as well.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.550
For now,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.690
let's add a paragraph below this article tag.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.370
Now let's go back to the admin and added some pages.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.090
For example,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.450
I'm gonna add the de about a speech,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.680
and here you'll notice something we didn't have before on the right side.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.450
Here in the page attributes a few it called Template appears.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.690
And as the templates based,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.910
we have to default template option,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.720
which is now selected just the princess in this explanation.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.510
What is this,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.070
the fourth time place you may ask.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.740
Every time you hear this name the fourth thing plate,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.050
you have to think off the index dot PHP file.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.620
This file is always considered by WordPress as the defaults template,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.350
hence its importance.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.480
Whenever WordPress doesn't know how to display content in the front end it you use the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.550
default simply.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.750
That is the index dot PHP file.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.790
It's a fallback file.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.750
Very important you were breast seems OK now closing out the princes and coming back.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.290
We can say that the space is going to use a different thing.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.980
Please page not the default one based on the index dot PHP file.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.450
If you click here,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.760
we see that we now have the templates we created called General Template.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:41.090
Let's do this and update this page now on front end Reload that You see that the page

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.750
structure is shown according to the content we have in the general template dot PHP file

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.440
notice the paragraph he created for reference,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.350
for example.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.350
So let's do the same thing for the contact page.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.290
Let's go back to the dashboard,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.550
added the page.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.150
And inside it,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.750
that's choose again the same place page we created.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.450
This is the greatest advantage of this strategy.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.370
I've just created one file that serves as a template,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.210
and this template can be reused on whatever pages I want whenever I want.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.550
And,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.130
of course,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.350
I can create has many thing play pages I want.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.390
In fact,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.270
I want to show you something curious.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.130
Most of the things that downloads from the WordPress repository have several templates.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.810
For example,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.020
you can choose between the template page without sidebar,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.450
another template with a sidebar,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.740
another one with three columns,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.290
etcetera.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.220
This can variety from thing to thing.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.320
Also,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.450
most of the things that call themselves multi purpose themes adopt this strategy.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.620
For example,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.670
this thing here it's multi purpose because it allows the site owner to choose between

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.490
different home pasting plates.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.520
For example,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:12.490
this home page here that we're seeing now looks different from this shop home page template

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.490
.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.960
But in fact the in their pages,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.820
for example,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.150
the 404 error page.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.650
It's always the same.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.540
We can achieve this by creating different template page files to be used on a static home

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.100
page.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.450
But let's go back to our theme.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:35.750
So let's go ahead and update this page here and see how it's shown in the front end.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.150
Look at its.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.430
The contact page now has a template,

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.950
which is identical to the about US page.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:51.310
That's because they use the same page template called the General Template as I told you

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.610
earlier on Lee.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.040
The structure is the same.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.500
The content itself is not.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.870
For example,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.250
each one has a different pace title,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.960
but they are both in the same space.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.390
Same phone caller from size,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.050
etcetera.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.320
The other pages,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.830
however,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.550
follow another logic.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.110
Now that we have our template page up and running,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.430
let's make it look a little better from this look will be removing the publication date.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.450
The offer,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.340
the categories and tags sings.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.550
Pages don't have these items.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.750
Let's save this file.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:37.510
So let's have some dummy counted inside this pages.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:47.550
An update again.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.840
Okay,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.390
that's it.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.680
Now,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.110
any content we add on these pages will have a similar layout,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.450
since they follow the same thing plate and how finally,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.610
all over pages look different.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:11.650
We have the about a space and the context paste that follow a template based structure.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.270
The blood page that has the post list and follows the defaults template.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.970
That is the index dot PHP file and the home page,

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.850
which follows the convinced of a file called Page hyphen home dot PHP.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.010
But Marcello,

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.560
could I turn the page home that PHP file into a template five a spell?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.450
Yes,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.360
for sure.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.270
In fact,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.110
many things do this.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.050
It depends on your liking.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.010
Now,

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.040
at least you know how to use all this yours available.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.730
Choose the one you like the best or the one that makes the most sense for your thing and

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.200
applied.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.350
In fact,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.570
it can go ahead and turn your page home.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.680
That's PHP file into a template file.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.580
But just for the sake,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.500
as an exercise thinks we'll still need that file.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.820
In the next lesson,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.680
you come back talking about another subject.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.650
We're gonna learn what a theme support is and she'll van happy Colding.
