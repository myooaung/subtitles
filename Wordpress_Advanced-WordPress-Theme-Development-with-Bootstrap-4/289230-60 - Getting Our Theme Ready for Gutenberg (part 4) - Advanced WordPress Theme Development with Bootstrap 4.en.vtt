00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.884
Hi fellows.

00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:05.005
Continuing from where we left off in the last lesson.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:09.490
Today, we'll see how to fix that problem with the video element in our post.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.410
As you remember, our video needed to spending tyre width of the screen.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.255
But that didn't happen.

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:18.445
To solve this is a really easy,

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:24.115
we just need to open our functions that PHP file. So let's do it.

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:34.159
And we want to add one more theme support is one is called Responsive embeds.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.500
What this does is it adds a class called

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.615
WP embed responsive to the body element of the theme.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:43.970
So with that class,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.795
any block that you embed in the Post editor via iframe,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:49.565
such as a YouTube video,

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.190
can fit seamlessly into the page.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.335
So let's see how it looks them.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:01:00.680
I'm going to refresh the page and look.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.240
Now the video is spans the entire page even when I resize the browser.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.750
Perfect.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.075
Let me show you in the source code.

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:21.875
So here in the body element we have this class WP embed responsive,

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:24.470
and it has been added by the theme support.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.360
Now, we will be left with only one problem on the blog page itself.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.900
So let's visit that page and I will show you.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.655
Notice here that as the list is displaying the full post content,

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.010
Remember that we are using here,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.700
the content function instead of the excerpt function.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.230
And that's why the image,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.590
gallery and video are looking out of place.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.090
There are at least four ways to solve this issue here.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.910
The first will be to create a CSS rule just for the aligned for classes on the blog page.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.739
For that, let's go to the CSS.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.970
I will say here, for example, blog aligned f2.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:22.050
So only the aligned for elements of the blank page, margin-left, 68%.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.105
And you can see that the content seems now correct.

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:31.280
Except there's a problem.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.425
When this sidebar becomes bigger,

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:36.275
it will end up on top of the image gallery.

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:39.000
And we're gonna do a simulation here.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.055
I can add it the HTML directly here in the developer's tool.

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:51.050
Just like this. Copy and paste these elements.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.085
Is you see it.

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:57.820
It's so strange and you think the second way to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.645
fix this would be to remove the sidebar from the index.html.

00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:05.755
In practice, it will mean change the themes layout a bit.

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:07.900
So I'll simulate this again.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.540
Let me undo the CSS changes I made.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.095
Now reloading the page,

00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:22.970
I'm going to simulate it using the developer to removing the sidebar.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.905
I can delete this element.

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:30.150
Now since we don't have a sidebar anymore,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.960
we don't need the row and the column classes.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.310
I will just remove them.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.365
So check it out.

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:40.835
We could fix that tool.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:43.710
Now it's correct once again,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.170
the third way would be to call

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.490
the excerpt function instead of the content to load the post content.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.880
Since the excerpt will display text only,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.365
the problem will be solved.

00:03:57.365 --> 00:03:59.700
So let me show you.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.345
That's it.

00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:16.475
Problem solved once more.

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:18.755
And the fourth solution,

00:04:18.755 --> 00:04:20.900
unless one would be not to display

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.590
the elements that have the aligned through Class info sites.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:34.740
So let me just undo the changes I made before and reload the page.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.280
For this last solution,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.110
I would only need a bit of CSS.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.600
I will say that for the aligned foo elements are the blood page,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.235
I would have left margin of 0 instead of

00:04:55.235 --> 00:05:04.445
50% and with 100% instead of 100 VW.

00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:09.420
And the transform property would get its initial value.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.305
So reloading the page,

00:05:15.305 --> 00:05:18.665
I have the elements in normal size,

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:21.005
and i only see them in four sides.

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:23.790
And a click to view the full post.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.885
So this last one for me would be the most elegant solution.

00:05:29.885 --> 00:05:31.415
So let's say it guys.

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:35.850
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll wait for you in the next lesson.
