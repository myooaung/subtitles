00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
hi there were almost coming to the end of the section in which you're learning how to

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.980
create the inner pages off our thing.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.530
In previous licence,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.790
you have already learned how to create a single page in a search page.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.330
So every time I click on a post link or that we do a search,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.050
you have a different view.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.750
If you haven't created those pages,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.260
the whole view will be based on one file,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.160
which is the index dot PHP.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.660
I think you're very tired of knowing that,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.150
isn't it?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.040
But we still have some other template fires to handle.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.020
For example,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.610
when you click on the category,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.620
attack the offers name or as we'll see a publication date link.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.150
What's Loaded chewers is still the index dot PHP file.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.790
We can easily check this if install a plugging called show current template.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.880
This blogging is a great help for anyone who is a fin developer are in situations where you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.070
need to modify the thing that was not viewed by yourself.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.280
Let's then go ahead and install this plugging,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:16.460
and we don't have to set anything up because it's now ready to use.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.310
I go to the front and and now in the Alamin bar,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.350
you can see that there is this new option.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.880
It shows us the name off the main template file that is generating the current view.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.950
If you just mows over it,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.210
we can still see other template parts there are loaded along with the maintain plate.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's go to the block page and look as I've been explaining to you for a while.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.290
The Block pages uses to the forts template,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.300
which is index dot PHP.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.530
As I said at the beginning of this lesson,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.650
this also happens when you click on a category link attack the offers name or a publication

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.250
date link.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.060
Well,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.160
let's see if it's true.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.350
Click on the author's link and the thing plate is index dot PHP.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.150
Click on a category again index dot PHP.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.890
We click on a publication date,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.660
NC again.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.810
That it template file is the index dot PHP.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.130
Well,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.880
there is nothing wrong with it.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.490
If you really want to see this template when you click on any off those links,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.240
if your intention is the submit your thing to market places such as the thing forest.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.050
You see that they have this very special requirement.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:51.630
So here they saying index dot PHP should be reserved for standard block latest posed for

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.590
you so you can use index dot PHP for every scenario just for the block latest posed for you

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.590
,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.150
as you are doing here in our theme.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.090
So you better not use index dot PHP as the template for displaying categories.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.960
Tags date or offer pages just off all of these display problems.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.580
At once,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.150
you'll be creating a new template file called archive dot PHP.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.870
Typically,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.670
this fire would be used if you need to create a page well,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.570
a page with your size archive that is a base showing the content organized by date.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.570
My mouth,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.800
my years,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.450
etcetera.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.830
But we can use this file in this likely more general way.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.180
It's very versatile to understand this better.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.960
Let's go over to the WordPress Theme Handbook,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.150
which is a page with valuable documentation for thing developers.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.050
This base here talks about all the template files needed to create a theme.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.350
Let's go ahead and click here in common WordPress template files.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.000
He regard the list off all template files.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.200
With a description below.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.750
We can find something about the archive that PHP file.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.950
Look what they say about this file.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.690
The archive template is used when visitors request posed by category author or date.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.780
Note.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.710
This template will be over reading if more specific thing plates are present,

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.450
like category that pitch be authored outpitch B and they thought Peace be,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.350
that is we can create specific thing plates,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.650
files for categories,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.940
offers and date.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.400
But it can also choose to create a single file called archive dot PHP,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.850
which can handle these three situations at the same time for us.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.050
In fact,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.490
we can also create tax template page through this fire.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.950
Although the documentation don't mention this fact,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.050
that's what we're gonna be created in the next lesson.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.500
Okay,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.530
I wait for you,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.150
then in the next lesson by
