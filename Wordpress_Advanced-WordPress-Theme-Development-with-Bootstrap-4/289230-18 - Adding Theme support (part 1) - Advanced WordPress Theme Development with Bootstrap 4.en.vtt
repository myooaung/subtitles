00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
Hello,

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.410
guys.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.590
In this lesson,

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.300
we're going to talk about a very powerful future of WordPress called theme support.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.730
So what is that thing?

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.450
Support?

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.300
Well,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.250
let's first take a look at the feet.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.360
We'll see that visually,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.340
it's still quite simple.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.070
We have no logo,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.160
no header.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.110
Etcetera from support is a WordPress function that allows us to customize many aspects of

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.900
our thing.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.840
In fact,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.430
it comes in handy for those who want to allow the client all the user of the theme to make

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.090
specific changes to the thing.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.150
Even though your client or your user don't have any program knowledge,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.060
I start by going over to the dashboard.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.690
If we had over to the appearance menu,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.850
we can see only a few basic options here.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.590
Everything since the WordPress you can see the same options,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.950
so we have nothing new here.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.590
At the end of today's lesson,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130
we'll have a couple of new options here.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.980
They will allow us to make some customers ations to the theme through the dashboard to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.670
begin live.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.650
Let's open up our functions file.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.810
The first thing we're gonna do is create a new function.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.390
That function has nothing to do with things support necessarily.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.550
But it will help us organize the code a bit more.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.990
Let's call dysfunction,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.550
learn WB underscore CO fic.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:38.060
And here we will be concentrating all of the cold that has any relation with the theme

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.250
configuration itself.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.290
So,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.080
for example,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.910
I'm gonna move all the court related to the main use and paste it within this new function

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.910
.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:02:02.710
It's called a new ad action and say that this new function will be triggers on the hook

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.150
called after set up thing.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.890
But this time we're gonna pass the less parameter to dysfunction.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.000
This parameter handles the priority of execution for this function,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.090
which will be zero in this way.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.710
Everything you create here,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.780
then dysfunction will be executive when never the after set up thing who is available.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.080
I have already explained to you the dynamics off this mechanism in previous license.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.160
So I'm not going to explain that again.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.490
Right.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.140
Okay.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.820
Now that we have everything place we can start talking about the thing support well,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.050
the at things support function is quite versatile.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.490
If we visit the WordPress Codex,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.330
you see that it allows you to add things,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.450
support various features.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.240
We can enable post firm.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.810
It's both thumbnails,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.450
custom background,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.650
custom header and many other features.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.220
All of these futures are not enabled by default in WordPress,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.150
but can greatly enrich our thing when you add them,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.330
we're going to start by adding themes,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.070
support your custom headers.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.020
They will be very useful to us as they will help us make the thing inner pages a little bit

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.010
more different and with a more attractive look.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.750
So let's get started.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.940
Let's just add a new line inside of function we just created.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.330
So add thing support and inside Princess,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.400
we want to pass the type of theme support you want to add.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.450
In this case,

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.450
it will be custom hyphen header.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.280
Most futures can also contain additional arguments.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.210
In the case of custom headers,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.390
we can pass arguments,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.050
the chance,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.160
the height and the with for the header image.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.940
We can do this by creating an array of arguments That's colleague Ard's and passed the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:20.660
following arguments Height 225 and with 1920 with the jury created,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.950
we can pass it as a second parameter to this ad theme support function.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.460
No,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.460
just that height and live are just do off the many arguments we can pass to dysfunction.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.050
You can see all of them in the Codex.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.590
Okay?

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.150
And the links available as an additional resource for this lecture.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.750
Go ahead and save that.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.550
And now head over to the admin area.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.740
Refresh the page and we now see that under appearance.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.680
We've got a new option,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.050
which is this one here Header.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:03.620
Let's click here and scream that to open is a very interesting future of WordPress called

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.080
the theme customizer.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.070
If you have already customized thing in WordPress,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.220
possibly you are aware that this to exists we'll learn how to create more advanced controls

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.850
than this show at the end of our course.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.840
For now,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.850
you'll notice that this option here allows us to customize theme header.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:31.120
This option is also available because we have just enable support for header images in our

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.650
thing.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.210
So here we have some instructions.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:42.490
We say that our thing recommends a header size off 1920 by 225 pixels.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.890
Precisely the values that we passed your function.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.450
Remember,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.950
Let's go ahead and click here to add a new image,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.740
upload any large image in this case,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.730
Our image is at least 1920 pixels.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:08.270
Wife as we want the uploaded image with a high off at most 225 pixels.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.400
We see the screen here that asks us to crop the image first.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.700
So let's do that and click on this blue button.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.790
Let's repeat the process and shoes.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.520
Treat more images,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:35.460
a quick tip for you guys.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:42.740
One thing we can do to make our header images more dynamic is to randomize them for this

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.710
with just click on this button here and now,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.350
we can save and publish our changes.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.910
Good,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.200
but it's not over yet.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.650
If we visit the home page and refresh the page,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.760
we won't see our Harry image anywhere.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.050
And why that?

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.450
Because we still need to tell WordPress where we want to.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.450
Heather Image to appear Well,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.560
the first question we have to answer is to which pages in our thing or two.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.210
Which page types we want to add an image header.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.960
Okay,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.590
let's assume we want Heather in all pages that use the general template,

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.810
which for now the about US page and the contact page,

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.350
and on all pages that use the default template as well,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.480
so the home page will not have a header.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.840
There are two files that we need to change.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.250
General template dot PHP and index dot PHP.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:48.450
That is the only thing played file that will be left out is page home dot PHP.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.580
So let's start with index dot PHP file.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:59.640
Let's open it and the header will be placed right here between the cat header function call

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.160
and our first if dick visually,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:12.620
it will be Position it here where you see this red line as go back Just blind text as I

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.560
want to get ahead.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.390
I'm gonna pace here a code snippet for the header image call.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.730
This code can be found on the Codex Page.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:27.070
Who's link is also available as an additional resource for this lecture to spacing it here

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.070
.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.750
Sold Explanation can get a little faster.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.350
So what does this code mean?

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.210
First,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.440
we have a nature Mel image tag.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.430
The image service is returned by a function called header image.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.550
It will bring to us the footpath for our image.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.180
Since our images random with each page load,

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:55.440
that source will be changed dynamically to add a height and with for the header image.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.780
We used the PHP Echo Command to print out the haIf and lift properties off the image in the

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.440
stack.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.150
The function that returns these values to us is this one here called Get Custom Header.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.080
Now,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.280
when you save this file,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.470
we can check if the block bay just gonna load the header image.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.650
So let's go over to our browser,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:24.160
refresh the page and look at this.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.340
And now we have ahead of image as the images random.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.350
Possibly.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.930
When we refresh the page again,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.950
we will have a new image.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.550
And here it is another header image.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.920
But notice,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.620
however,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.950
that he manages to large for the page.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:47.830
It is generating a hordes own toes Kober that's braided bad.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.150
So let's fix that.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:55.850
Let's add another bootstrap class called I M G hyphen fluid.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.550
It will make the image in question become responsive,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:06.850
which I've been here class because I am,

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.440
see,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.100
haven't fluid save and refresh the page.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.530
Okay,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.250
Ready Now we don't have that horribles crowbar down here.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.090
Cool,

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.550
isn't it?

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.230
Now that we know what to do,

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:32.000
let's repeat the process for the pages that use the general template a sculpted this image

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.240
tag.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.780
Here.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.400
Open up.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.640
The general templates dot PHP file and paste tickled there too.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.750
In the same location below the scare header saved file.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:52.170
Now click on this link and here we are.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.850
They also have a responsive header here.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.800
Same thing for the contact page.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.260
Very good.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.130
Finally,

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.520
our feet is getting more professional and attractive,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.950
Don't you think so?

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.580
In the next lesson,

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.540
we will continue to add things,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.150
support and work with some nails say them.
