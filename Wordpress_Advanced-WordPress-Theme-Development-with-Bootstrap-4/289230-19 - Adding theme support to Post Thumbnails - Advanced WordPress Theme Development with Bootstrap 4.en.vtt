00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Hey, what's up? Welcome back again.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.185
As mentioned in the last lesson, in today's lesson,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.670
we will continue to talk about the ad theme support function.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.335
In the last lesson,

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:16.305
we declared support for custom headers.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.540
And in this new lesson,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.675
we're going to talk about thumbnails.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:23.400
Should begin this lesson.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.280
I want to show you one of the things available for download in the WordPress repository.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.750
Themes like this one are very good for understanding what

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.200
our thumbnails and how we can use them in WordPress.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.810
As you can see, this is a kind of news portal.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.825
It is divided into several sections.

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.490
And for each section,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.125
again loops with the posts and the featured image in them.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.845
There are moments when this image is very small,

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:56.825
others a little bigger.

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.205
Altogether.

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:03.349
In this theme, it seems like there are four or five different image sizes.

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:08.660
These images here are what Wordpress calls thumbnails.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.460
The question here is,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.260
how can we add those images,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.215
those thumbnails toward breast post.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:20.150
If you look at our current blood listing here on the blog page,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.665
we see that our loop has only tax contents, nothing else.

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:31.290
At the same time, if you go over to the dashboard and open some of those posts.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.570
For example, let's open up this box here.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.785
We'll see that there is no place here in the editor.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:43.070
Very can include a thumbnail that is an image that

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.480
represents this particular post and differentiated from the others.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.035
And this is what we're gonna do in this lesson.

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:53.330
So let's go back to sublime text.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.765
And we want to open our functions fire continuing where we left off in the last lesson.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.450
Well, to add thumbnail support,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.895
we got to use the same function we used in the last lesson called add theme support.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:11.030
Except this time we're going to be passing a new argument.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480
So still think our configuration function,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.745
let's type in at things

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:26.345
support and pass a new argument in here in single quotes as a string,

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:31.500
let's type in post hyphen thumbnails.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.730
Marcello, Can I add this add theme supports out of this configuration function?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.350
Yes, you can.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.545
But as I want, my code should be well-organized.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.860
I'll be writing it, writing side dysfunction.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.080
When we save this file and return to the Post editor, refresh the page.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.810
You can see that here on the right side they have a new box,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.190
WordPress cause these boxes mailboxes.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.360
And now I have a link that allows me to choose a featured image for

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.625
my posts as go ahead and click here and see how it works.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:22.910
Go ahead and upload any image and to set it as a featured image for this post.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.835
And if you click on this blue button,

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:32.015
now you can see that it will appear here in the mailbox as a featured posts.

00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:35.284
Go ahead and update the post.

00:03:35.284 --> 00:03:39.720
And I'm gonna do the same for the other posts.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.030
So far, so good.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.035
I just updated less posts with the featured image.

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:01.850
What are you going to do now?

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.140
Well, let's check our posts list to see what we haven't.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.215
You now reload the page and nothing happened.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.090
And why the well,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.190
the answer is always the same.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.040
We need to make clear in our files where we want the featured image to appear.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.145
In our case, we want it to be positioned between

00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:28.730
the title and the publication date floating to the left.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.085
But before explaining this to you,

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:34.010
I want to explain how WordPress controls the size of

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.270
thumbnails and what a thumbnail really means for WordPress.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.735
If we had over two settings media,

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:47.075
we see that there is a space where we can define the size of all images.

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:50.165
First item is thumbnail size.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:55.250
By default, the size is 150 by 150,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.350
that is a square thumbnail.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.570
Then we have the medium size,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.155
which has a maximum width of 300 pixels.

00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:07.969
Large size, maximum width of 1024 pixels.

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:13.460
And the resistive, an intermediate size that is not showing up here in the list.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.890
Today, we're gonna learn how to have greater control over the sizes.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.380
You see that it's quite simple.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.985
It's job is something that probably the author of this theme here must have done.

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.970
I say this even without looking at the code,

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.740
since as you can see,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.105
there are four or five different image sizes throughout the thing.

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:40.175
Of course, we can make a couple of changes even here in the Wordpress admin.

00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:46.715
For example, if you want all these mole size images to have a maximum of 100 pixels,

00:05:46.715 --> 00:05:48.230
we can define this year,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.800
but we can have even more control.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.315
This is the great advantage of knowing how to grade things ourselves.

00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:58.070
Let's see how we can do it.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.925
For this, we're going to edit our index.html file,

00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:06.740
which is the default template and is the file that is generated in this pose.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.415
Listen.

00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:10.760
But the basic idea that I'm going to present to you

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.870
can be used whenever you want to include pose thumbnails.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.220
First, let's find out where exactly we want to include the thumbnail.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.100
In our case, it's going to be placed between that H2 tag and the publication date.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.765
Here, we want to call a function inside the PHP tags.

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:35.370
This function is called the Post found now,

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.660
okay, after that, you can save the file.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.620
Let's reload the page and look.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.905
We have the featured image for the first item,

00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:55.135
for the second, for the third.

00:06:55.135 --> 00:06:59.530
But notice however, that each image has a different size.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.109
Some of them are so big that they generate this horrible scrollbar.

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:07.540
So why does it happen?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.985
Simply because we need to tell WordPress what thumbnail size we want.

00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:15.760
As go back to the index.html file.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.160
And let's do them.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.815
Well, as we've seen in the Wordpress admin area,

00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:26.000
there are four predefined image sizes.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.025
We have the thumbnail itself,

00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:32.015
that is the smallest featured image size for a post.

00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:34.924
They have the medium sizes,

00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:40.340
large sizes, and also full size.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.104
Let's pass the first image size inside the parenthesis,

00:07:44.104 --> 00:07:46.980
and that will be thumbnail.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.285
Now, when you reload the page,

00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:53.465
we can see that our images have the same size.

00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:57.545
This size is the default size of the thumbnail,

00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:01.879
150 by 150 pixels.

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:04.280
So what is happening here?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.740
Well, the moment we upload an image,

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.070
WordPress creates several copies of the same image,

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.605
each one with a specific size.

00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:15.770
If we expand the uploads folder,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.680
we'll see that for the same file,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.690
there is the original image,

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.875
an image of 150 by 150.

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:29.225
Another image with a maximum width of 300 pixels,

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:34.190
768 pixels, and 1024 pixels.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.435
This help us choose the correct size of the featured image to be used.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:41.600
If, for example, I choose the medium size,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.400
I will end up with an image with a maximum width of 300 pixels.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.365
We can also choose the large,

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:52.100
which will be slightly larger size or foe.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.405
That is the original image for with not cropped.

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:58.805
But the whole thing doesn't stop here.

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:03.950
We can be even more specific and create new image sizes on the fly.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.715
For example, let's say that in that position of the page,

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:14.390
I need an image that has 275 by 275 pixels.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.940
For this, we need to create an array in cellular function and separate them by commas.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.420
We're gonna pass the width and the height that we want.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.205
Look at this.

00:09:34.205 --> 00:09:39.365
Now the image is slightly bigger and this is just the beginning.

00:09:39.365 --> 00:09:41.240
If you visit the codecs,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.590
you can find even more advanced examples.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.150
Well, she finished out,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.120
we're going to apply some CSS to the images

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.765
because we want our images to look a bit better.

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:57.420
First of all, let's inspect element.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.430
Notice here that the feature image in WordPress

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.005
automatically receives a class called WP post image.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:10.800
We can create a new CSS rule based on this class.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.385
Let's suppose, for example,

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.055
that it will float to the left.

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:27.240
And it will have the following margin values.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:34.460
And you can also say that the article tags will have a different display.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:42.600
The so-called the article tag to display one underneath the other separated by a space.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.465
Okay, now we have a slightly more acceptable Luke.

00:10:50.465 --> 00:10:53.105
And I think that's all for this lesson.

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:55.805
I hope you enjoyed it. As I told you,

00:10:55.805 --> 00:11:01.715
we just scratched the surface of this argument that adds thumbnail support.

00:11:01.715 --> 00:11:05.240
There is much more to be learned in the codecs.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.055
So don't be lazy.

00:11:07.055 --> 00:11:10.280
Go ahead and take a look at the WordPress documentation.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.350
Okay. I'm also live in a very interesting tutorial in the extra material of this course,

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.925
you guys can learn about an interesting function called add image size there.

00:11:19.925 --> 00:11:24.455
It will help you create image sizes for your posts pretty much the way you want.

00:11:24.455 --> 00:11:25.850
So take it out.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.290
This out guys.
