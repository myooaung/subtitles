00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Hey, what's going on, guys?

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.085
In this lesson, we'll go ahead and keep creating

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:07.785
our basic building blocks for the WordPress theme.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.515
So picking up where we left off in the last lesson,

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:13.020
I want to start by selecting the region.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.050
There will become later on the themes header.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.430
The selection will have to go from the beginning of the HTML to the end of

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.095
the header tag is part of the code is going to be repeated on every page.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:27.525
So let's cut out the selection,

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:31.270
save the file, and create a new one.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.435
The name of this new fire is going to be header.html.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.810
Thus the name of this file have to be header.html.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.780
Yep, it must be Herald PHP.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.205
And later in this lesson,

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:44.675
you will understand why.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:46.610
Now you need to paste everything.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.740
You just copy it in there.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.545
And now we have our header that will repeat at the top for all pages of our theme.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:56.960
Let's go back to index.html.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.015
And now the next selection will go from the footer tag to the end of the file.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.205
Let's select in cat again,

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:08.910
and let's create another file called footer.html.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.445
Once again, that question,

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:15.335
does it have to be footer?

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:19.260
Yes, it must be footer.html.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.815
What is left now we're correspond to our indexed at PHP file.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.795
The dynamic part of the theme.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:30.335
Well, what happens if you open the homepage right now?

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:35.045
So let's flip tabs now and go over to our browser.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:38.075
By the way, from now until the end of this course,

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:42.350
I'll be using Firefox Developer Edition as their main browser.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.705
I believe it's a good choice in cities.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:48.155
It's a browser really tailored for web developers.

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:49.670
So let's give it a try.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.285
But it can still use Chrome or other browsers you want.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:55.880
It makes no difference for this course.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.340
As you can see, nothing came up.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.515
But if you inspect the code,

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:05.615
we see that we have the HTML with the body, the content tags.

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:10.985
But look, do you remember that we left a paragraph as a reference to us.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:12.980
Where is that paragraph?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.800
And another thing I told you that the body and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.370
the score class function will load some classes inside the body,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.020
tag him or sell.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.360
I think it didn't work.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.445
You may say, where are all of those glasses?

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:30.080
Well, those who have a basic understanding of BHB know that we can

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.835
load parts of a PHP file with include are the require command.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:38.015
Wordpress has a couple of functions that do the same thing.

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:42.665
There are very specific WordPress functions that can load the header and the footer.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:44.285
Our index.html.

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:48.890
We'll load the header from here up and further from here down.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.990
So we have to login here.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.155
And here. The how would we do that?

00:02:54.155 --> 00:03:00.810
Or I will be using Q Basic Wordpress functions that are get underscore header.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.290
This function loads or file that is named header.html.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.730
And now you understand why this file must be called heterodox PHP.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.375
And the other function, can you imagine what is called?

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:18.080
Yes, it's get underscore footer.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.885
Let's see if all of this works.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:25.730
So let's go back to Firefox and reload the homepage.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.950
And there you have it.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.560
Now the paragraph is displaying that reference paragraphs from header.html file.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.930
And also the name of the page is showing up coming from that title tag.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.200
And if we inspect the page as the told you,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.900
that function in the body finally worked.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.055
Ok here, class, home and plug.

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:52.625
So the homepage has at least these two classes.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.700
You can have more classes depending on what you have

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.910
installed or on how you WordPress is configured.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.550
So by using the Home class, for example,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.700
we could use CSS and create a specific rule for

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.440
all the H1 of what the paragraphs which belongs to the homepage.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.075
Just an example, right?

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:14.555
So those H1 or those paragraphs

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:18.440
would look different from those on the themes inner pages.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.730
But we can make even more complex things. So that's it.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.245
That's all for this lesson.

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:26.765
In the next lesson, we're gonna learn how to load

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:29.660
stylesheets within WordPress the right way.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.010
So see you then.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.820
Happy coding.
