00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
Hello guys, welcome to a new lesson.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:09.990
Today is time to talk about another valuable feature that we can add to our theme.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.140
Let's talk about post Fermat's.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.750
Post formats are one of the features that you can optionally add to your thing,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.185
making it even more attractive to the end-user.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.960
But in case you've never heard about them.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.605
I really like to explain everything in detail and visually.

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:31.350
So let's go over to a browser.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.350
Here in the blog listing page.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
You can see that all the posts entries appear in much the same way.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.450
Actually, we always have the same repeated several times.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.345
Here we have a featured image for the post,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:51.815
the title, and the other elements that we defined in the loop.

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.920
By the way, you certainly remember that its slope

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.550
is coming from the file called index.html.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.080
Alter the posa interests look the same precisely because we have

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.390
only one loop structure which is repeated as many times as necessary.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.420
But what if I want this listing to be different

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.755
depending on the post content or owned post category.

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:20.509
For example, let's suppose that for all posts in the web design category,

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.450
we wanted to show only a single image.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.385
I mean, no texts,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.460
only one image as the post content.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.039
And for the Social Media category,

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.810
we could have something different.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.300
For example, we could only show a video with some tutorial, for example.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.250
And we could go further.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.660
Let us say that all the headings of the Web Design category posts would have

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.869
different color and style and the same for items in the social media category.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.244
The post formats are available from WordPress

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:58.580
3.5.1 and help us make the differentiation deftly want?

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.929
Wordpress currently works with nine posts Fermat's.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.670
According to the codecs,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.354
we can have the following pulse Fermat's.

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:12.380
You can have an aside which is similar to a facebook note update.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.815
We also have Gallery post Fermat's link, image,

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:27.815
quote, status, video, audio, and chat transcripts.

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:30.950
We also have the standard wordpress post

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.000
Fermat's that you understand better later. One, this lesson.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.300
For this lesson, we're going to use three of this pose.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.750
Fermat's, the default one, video and image.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.235
Knowing how to use these formats,

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:47.110
the others will come naturally to you.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.695
Okay, so let's get started.

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:54.025
Let's open up our functions file again.

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.685
And let's add another support to the theme.

00:02:57.685 --> 00:03:01.810
This time, you're going to pass this shrink. Post.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.275
Hyphen Fermat's should function ok.

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:09.715
If you only do that and open any pose for editing,

00:03:09.715 --> 00:03:16.370
we'll see something that was not there before as open one of the posts here.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.810
Notice here on the right side,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.000
we have a new metal box.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.360
And it's quite strange because it's still empty.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.730
Surely you should have seen this on some other thing, but not empty.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.960
Of course.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.545
Just a quick update in WordPress blog editor,

00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:41.350
you'll find the post format options under document status and visibility tab.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.010
Here.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.375
This mailbox should be displaying a couple of new options, but it's not.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:54.820
Those options are for you to define what kind of content you are currently creating.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.540
For example, if it's a video post or an image post or an audio posts, etc..

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.475
If you want to display those options,

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:07.485
we have to pass some more arguments to the function we just created.

00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:10.955
Let's go back to our file and pass these arguments.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:15.290
Fortunately, this is very, very easy.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.200
We just create an array within the function and

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.545
type in which both formats we want to enable.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:24.605
Notice that we are talking about the thing as a whole,

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:26.795
not just a specific post.

00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:29.450
Let's say then that throughout the thing,

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.690
the following pose Fermat's will be allowed.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.990
Video image.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.730
Let's save that. Let's go back to our editing area and reload the page.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.895
Now we have three new options inside the mailbox.

00:04:49.895 --> 00:04:53.015
Standard, video and image.

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:55.445
This post Fermat called the standard,

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:56.900
has a special meaning,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.395
is the default option and means that no specific post Fermat is being indicated.

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:07.729
Well, now we can start playing around with our posts.

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.520
I can go ahead and create a lot of new posts.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.020
And for each post,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.405
I'm going to choose a different post Fermat.

00:05:14.405 --> 00:05:17.150
I'm gonna create six new polls here,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.395
tuples for each category and for each post Fermat.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:23.705
I'm gonna pause the video for a moment.

00:05:23.705 --> 00:05:25.175
And when we come back,

00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:28.025
I'm going to show you what I have done.

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:32.195
So we have these two new posts at the top.

00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:34.520
It's opened. The first one.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.704
This post belongs to the Social Media category.

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:42.125
I defined that for this category, outpost,

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:48.035
we'll have the video post Fermat and will only contain one video as a content.

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:54.080
I just grabbed a link from any YouTube video and paste it here in the Post editor.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.429
And I did the same for the other post from this same category.

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:04.865
Now back to the post table as open opposed from the web design category.

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:09.920
For the two posts in this category are defined that the post Fermat's will be

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.215
image and their content will be just a single image.

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.960
The idea will be that posts in

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.295
the social media category would represent only a video tutorial,

00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:27.020
and post from the web design category would only show an image.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.125
It could be, for example, a portfolio image.

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:33.230
That's just a hypothetical use case,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.865
just to illustrate the possibility of using posts Fermat's in real life,

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:41.960
the user of the theme or the site owner is the one who you've

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.880
defined if he or she wants to use this feature and for what reason?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.555
Ok.

00:06:47.555 --> 00:06:50.150
The other q remaining posts in

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.185
the web development category who have a standard post Fermat,

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:57.005
they are not present anything different.

00:06:57.005 --> 00:07:01.700
Notice that we can easily identify the post formatted in the table.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.125
That they still little icons here next to the title of each post.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.450
In the newer versions of Word Press,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.980
these icons have been removed.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.500
Okay? To know what the post format is,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.500
you have to open the polls for editing or install

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.625
some plugins that can add a pause format column to repost stable.

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:22.340
Okay, but when we go back to our thing,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.115
we'll see that nothing has changed yet.

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:27.665
The structure remains the same.

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:32.670
The only difference is that we have new posts with new content.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:38.405
What we want to do is proposed in the social media category.

00:07:38.405 --> 00:07:40.880
We want to remove this author link here.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.610
It can also present the title in a different color,

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.740
not the scholar we have at the moment.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.635
For the posts from the web design category,

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.530
we want to remove the publication date and we could

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.710
also present a title with a different style.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.340
On the other hand, both defined with a standard pause.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.695
Fermat won't change at all.

00:08:00.695 --> 00:08:03.230
She used the full potential of force.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.890
Fermat's.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.830
You gotta make some changes to our loop first.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.580
The first thing we're gonna do is added that file

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.615
we created in the previous lesson called Content dot PHP.

00:08:14.615 --> 00:08:17.945
It contains only an HTML article tag.

00:08:17.945 --> 00:08:20.495
As you can see, inside the article,

00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:24.665
we have a content that is repeated every time the loop runs.

00:08:24.665 --> 00:08:26.420
And the loop, as you know,

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.315
is the one at index dot PHP file.

00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:37.140
So let's call a function here inside this article tag, get post Fermat.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.890
And we're going to ACO this functionality to see what is returning.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.025
It will do nothing more than showing onscreen

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:49.015
the name of the posts Fermat related to the current post loop.

00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:52.640
Let's save that and you see what I mean.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.680
Notice that for the first two loops, we have video.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.699
For the next two posts, image.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.535
And for standard posts,

00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:14.170
nothing is printed out.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.455
Good, but what is this former sell?

00:09:17.455 --> 00:09:19.725
Well, for this to be useful,

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:24.005
we need to use the second parameter of the function we learned in the last lesson,

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:26.570
the Gad stain plate part.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.210
So let's just recap.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.880
The first parameter of this function is the file path without the PHP extension.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.110
So here we have template parts for slash content.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.750
The second parameter can be used whenever we

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.600
want you to call a specialized parts of this template.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.490
Kind of confusing, isn't it?

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.615
Yes. And this is a rather complicated concepts to explain,

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:54.530
but in practice, it is very easy to understand.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.700
Suppose we have, in addition to the content that PHP file.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.670
Another file called content hyphen image dot PHP with a different content.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.495
How can we do to include that file using the second parameter

00:10:08.495 --> 00:10:12.530
of the GAD template part function. Very easy.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:17.075
We just type in the word image in the second parameter.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:20.360
So we're press, we will understand that we want to include

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.080
a file called content hyphen image dot PHP.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.530
For this to work, the full filename must have a hyphen,

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.560
ok. That's very important.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.810
In a more detailed explanation.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.440
What happens here is that WordPress will always include

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.800
a file that has an identical name to the second parameter.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.935
It can't find this file.

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:48.155
It will fall to actually file that has the same name as the first parameter.

00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:50.179
So in this example,

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:53.030
if a file called content hyphen image

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.365
dot PHP exists inside our films folder. It will be included.

00:10:57.365 --> 00:11:02.990
If it doesn't, WordPress will include a file called Content dot PHP.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.230
Ok, but what does this have to do with pause

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.370
Fermat's And with that get posed format function I explained earlier.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.965
Well, you see that in a moment.

00:11:12.965 --> 00:11:18.485
Let's first create two new files here in the template parts folder.

00:11:18.485 --> 00:11:23.339
One called content hyphen image dot PHP,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:30.785
and another file called content hyphen VDO dot PHP.

00:11:30.785 --> 00:11:34.460
Inside the content image dot PHP file.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:40.470
Let's copy and paste everything you have inside the content dot PHP file.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.810
But here we want to remove the publication date.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.955
You don't want it here.

00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:53.840
And for the content video dot PHP file,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.625
let's do the same and just remove the authors link.

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:04.340
Okay, now, going back to the index.html lifespans,

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.675
the second parameter of

00:12:05.675 --> 00:12:10.535
the GAD template part function to include these two new files in the loop.

00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:16.770
To do this less past the get post Fermat function as the second parameter.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.615
As we already know,

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:25.340
get pose Fermat returns a string with the name of the post Fermat's.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:30.275
So whenever there is a post that has the video post Fermat,

00:12:30.275 --> 00:12:37.865
where brands will try to include a file called content hyphen the deal dot PHP.

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:42.470
Whenever in the loop there is a post that has the image pause format.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.855
The file to be included will be content,

00:12:44.855 --> 00:12:48.395
hyphen, image dot PHP.

00:12:48.395 --> 00:12:51.980
And then whenever the function returns nothing.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.915
That will be the case when we have a post that has the standard post Fermat,

00:12:56.915 --> 00:13:00.560
the file to be included should be content that PHP,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.279
the second parameter, will be completely ignored.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:07.040
So that's the magic ladies and gentlemen.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.090
And I say that.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.849
And look at this for posts from the social media category,

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:22.355
which have the video post formatting the content video dot PHP file was included.

00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:27.905
We can say that because these items don't display the authors link.

00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:32.165
And as below for posts from the web design category,

00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:34.115
we don't have the publication date,

00:13:34.115 --> 00:13:39.750
which means the file included here is the content image dot PHP file.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.895
The other post didn't change at all because

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:47.135
they were viewed upon the content that PHP file,

00:13:47.135 --> 00:13:50.090
which has the most complete loop of all.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.235
Now that you know all this,

00:13:52.235 --> 00:13:54.275
we can start playing a little more.

00:13:54.275 --> 00:13:58.550
We can, for example, modified tags of which content file by adding

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:04.025
certain CSS classes within those tags and then styling them differently.

00:14:04.025 --> 00:14:08.240
For example, for all posts that have a video pause format,

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.770
we can say that all heading elements will show in red color.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.545
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:18.650
Or we can do something even more advanced.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.480
Look at these examples.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.310
My

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.460
tip

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.510
for you guys.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.780
We can call the post class function inside

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.980
the HTML article tags of all the content files are created.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:27.290
In this lesson, inspect these elements and see which classes will be included.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.000
Think about what you can achieve with those classes using CSS.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.200
I am sure that many ideas will pop up from your mind.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.285
Well, that's all for this lesson.

00:15:38.285 --> 00:15:41.390
I hope you have understood and also liked it.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.235
If you have any questions,

00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:46.130
go ahead and user questions and answers page.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.960
So see you next lesson.
