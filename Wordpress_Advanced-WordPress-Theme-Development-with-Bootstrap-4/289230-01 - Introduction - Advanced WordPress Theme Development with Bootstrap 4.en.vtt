00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370
Welcome,

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.960
guys.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.840
This is our introduction lesson.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.250
My name is Marcello and that will be your instructor here on this course.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.050
Well,

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.770
just to begin to scores at me,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.550
Charlie will leader about myself.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.550
I have a degree in system analysis and I worked with that development since 2000 and eight

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.550
.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.670
I started my career creating websites,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.380
but using only HTML and CSS.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.470
Later,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.150
I learned how to use Djamila,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.530
which is another very good content management system.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.240
But since 2000 and 12 have been creating themes using WordPress as you know,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.740
where press is a very powerful chore.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.740
And when you master this tool,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.100
it can Butte just about any type of website.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.860
I always say that the limitation is almost always your creativity.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.050
There are several ways to beautify website using WordPress.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.090
There are people who prefer to buy a premium thing.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.720
Others use Page Bueller's in this course.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.760
We want to use this jaws.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.980
We will satisfy your curiosity and beautiful WordPress theme from scratch from the ground

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.450
up.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.690
Another For this to be possible,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.840
we'll follow all the recommendations off the WordPress team itself.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.520
I'll teach you how to create custom things,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.700
and you'll be able to understand all step by step,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.210
I want you to finish this course with a very broad view off.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.460
How thing works.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.530
By the way,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.550
you notice that I'm always mentioning she words website and theme.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.910
Over time,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.580
you come to realize that although they seem the very same thing,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.780
a thing is something a bit more comprehensive.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.040
A fame is replicable and can even become a great source of income for anyone who knows how

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.700
tribute it.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.260
But this course will serve both those who would like to create a simple website but with a

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.950
totally customized look created in a very detailed way as zealous those who want to learn

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.480
how to create things for redistribution.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.830
In this course,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.630
we will learn the basics of beauty,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.740
a word pressing later.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.940
You can decide whether you want to focus on creating custom sites or you want to go a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.700
little further by creating things that can be sold in marketplaces like thing for worst.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.450
For example,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.170
whatever decision is,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.500
the important thing is that you have a solid foundation and this is what this course wants

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.350
to offer you.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.600
Now who is the scores?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.990
Aim that well It's basically for people who already have a minimal idea of how to create a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.610
website.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.390
That issue have to necessarily know at least a little weight.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.100
She amero CSS and a bit of PHP s.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.480
Well,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.220
this course is essentially focused on teaching how wordpress works.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.410
So even if I wanted to,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.950
I would not have time to teach you some notions off html CSS and PHP here,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.140
that is you must have at least a leader experience with web development.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.450
Right?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.300
Since this course is not about HTML and CSS,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.450
I must make a couple of things clear from the beginning.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.960
The fact is that many of the CSS and HTML changes will make with dinner.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.350
Thing will not be explained in detail.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.480
Off course.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.500
I will show you where these modifications have been applied.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.890
Explain why they have been applied.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.290
But I won't explain html and CSS in detail,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.650
right.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.830
For example,

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.090
I will not show you how I make to change the color of an HTML Jif Tech.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.560
The real focus will be on showing the famous structure the WordPress functions used to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.770
build them the WordPress way off doing things.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.850
But all of the changes I make will be available to you in the files who have for download.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.750
You find the length to access all of the files that will be creating during the course.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.430
Then you'll be your guide to during the course.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.850
Okay,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.220
well,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.950
the basis off the course will be the layout I'm showing you right now.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.990
It's a very simple layout.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.020
It's absolutely not the most beautiful layout in the world,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.790
but it will help us understand the basics of a WordPress theme.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.150
But then you may ask me,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.450
But why didn't the teachers have too great a one page thing there so much trendy and cool?

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.350
Why is it down this way and not that way?

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.110
Simple?

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.040
Because I believe this kind of layout here makes it possible to use most WordPress jewels,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.900
I believe,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.550
is the most completely outside for what I want to teach you.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.450
We learned how to put these elements on the page and how and where to use plug ins in this

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.820
course to we will delve into more complex concepts like the thing customizer,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.850
and you learn how tribute custom fields for your clients.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:58.750
You learn about theme internationalization and also plug in packaging.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.540
I mean,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.950
you learn how to include all the plug ins used on your thing and make them available when a

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.880
user activation theme and at the end of the course,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.780
we also learn about the new WordPress editor Gutenberg.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.940
We should be officially launched by WordPress with version five point.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.340
Oh,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.650
but I'm bringing it to you right now inside this class.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.450
So as you see,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.800
hum,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.690
bring into you topics you cannot find in all classes on WordPress.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.120
Inspiration Also,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.990
you find everything you need to follow the skills share class.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.650
Just head over to the your project,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.050
Ted,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.280
just below the videos and you find here a couple of things first.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.610
Here is your project description.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.180
It's just a task that you need to do in order to test the skills that you'll be learning

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.200
during the class.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.820
It will be really,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.840
really great if you send us your task right and just below we have a couple of other

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.080
additional resources.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.440

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.950
typos and so on.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.210
You can download the food project you'll be building during the course if you wish.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.910
We also have a document with the frequently asked questions,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.160
and I believe the Stockman can help you a lot,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.650
too,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.250
especially if you face problems such as Thesis one.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.440
I can see this year says changes I make or this one here,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.850
too.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.520
And finally,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.060
there's also this document that can help you if you use Mac OS and find problems.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.670
Why working with Samp on local host?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.030
Also pay attention to the notes that you show up as the lessons and float.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.650
Every time I mentioned there's a link or any additional resource about any topic discussed

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.380
in lesson,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.700
they will be available as a new note.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.180
Okay.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.180
All right.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.760
That's it.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.650
I hope you like the class.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.560
So see you in the next lesson.
