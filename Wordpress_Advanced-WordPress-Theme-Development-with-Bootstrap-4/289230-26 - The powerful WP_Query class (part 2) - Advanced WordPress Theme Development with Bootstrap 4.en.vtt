00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
hello and begin up where we left off in the last lesson.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.260
That's creator of first custom query inward breasts.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.030
Before we begin,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.340
let's create the HTML markup.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.170
First,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.150
let's remove this paragraph here,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.200
and we need to create a bootstrap row here.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.350
You remember why from our last lesson,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.260
and inside it,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.780
I sat a container.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.130
Let's open up the beach.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.430
Be tags here.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.030
We're going to create a variable to identify the content we want here,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.550
which will be a future news item.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.860
So let's call this variable future.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.020
If you have some little knowledge of object oriented programming,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.350
you'll not have much trouble understanding what I'm going to do here if you don't pay close

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.770
attention because it's not that difficult.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.840
In the end,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.650
everything will look like ingredients of a cake recipe.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.360
This variable will be a new instance of a WordPress class called the Will You Be underscore

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.050
query.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.040
I didn't find this.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.070
We use the new command and passed the class name.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.310
Should there will you be on the score?

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.200
Query.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.230
This is what we call class instance,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.830
or a glass object.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.850
It will have access to several methods and also to the variable off this class here.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.480
But don't be scared,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.050
OK?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.070
We already know some methods off this class.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.920
For example,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.440
half bows and the post are all metals off this WP query class.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.960
But you'll understand that better as we create everything.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.470
Okay,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.550
What kind of value do you want to keep inside this object here?

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.250
We're gonna keep the category to reach the news belong.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.630
We can also save the category that we want to exclude from the list,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.430
for example,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.140
that say,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.950
we don't want news coming from the social media category.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.120
The advantage off all this is that we don't need very deep knowledge off my sequel.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.710
That is,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.730
we don't have to make a single select to get information about database about posts,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.840
about Bages,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.680
tax enemies,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.420
post types,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.150
etcetera.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.750
There are two ways we can get this information.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.230
One is using query strings.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.760
Acquire String is something like this with Besson argument and its value here followed by

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.620
10% and the new argument with its venue and new and percent and so on.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.550
And Jimmy gets to the end of the least of arguments.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.570
The other way is through an array and I'll be showing you both ways.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.950
Let's start with the first method that off the choir a string.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.250
So what we want to fetch from our database?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.200
Well,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.370
we want a certain number of posts,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.050
certain categories.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.730
The first argument You're going too fast,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.950
then is boast on the score type.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.780
The both type here in the case is supposed it could be a paste you,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.980
but for now,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.930
your own interested in posts the type in an 8% and then we have a second a Roman.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.340
How many post we want to submit in this case?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.560
Since we want only one post,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.170
which will be our future news item,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.850
this argument will have the value off one so posts per page equals one.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.050
Now the future news items belongs to which category.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.720
We have at least two ways to indicate this.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.710
Here you can use the cat argument or category on the score name.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.330
The difference is that for the cat argument,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.140
we would pass only the category in numeric i d.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.310
But for category on the score name,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.840
we would have to pass the category slug.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.790
Right.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.300
But how can we retrieve these two information?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.690
Very simple.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.970
Let's go to the dashboard head over to boasts categories.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.030
If we hover over the link for each category,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.350
pay attention to the link that is shown in the lower left.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.140
For the Web development category,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.300
we have the I D,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:31.360
which is four for the Web design Category 11 for Social Media aide Just pay attention.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.110
Since your WordPress installation is different than mine,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.540
your ideas may be different to okay.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.520
Otherwise,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.350
if you want to use the category name parameter,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.850
you can grab this leg that we have here in the category table.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.190
We can work with both arguments,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.320
but in this case,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.320
I think we'd better go with the cat element because the category I d will never change.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.300
Meanwhile,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.780
this leg can be changed in the dashboard very easily,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.170
so I stick with the category I d.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:09.360
Let's pass the categories for in 11 and leave lt category number eight to best more than

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.900
one category Inside query string We separate values by Commerz,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.430
and now,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.750
as we defined the content we want to fetch let's beauty WordPress look.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:30.450
He started if have boasts while have boasts.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.150
The post,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.850
however,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.890
seems for working with the custom query have to indicate first which class object has to

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.930
data coming from the database.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.010
In this case,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.850
the featured object is the variable that is doing this.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.580
We have to pass it here before the name of the functions,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.930
half boasts and the post followed by a small arrow which in fact is nothing more than a

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.260
hyphen integrator than sign.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.640
I'm not going to explain technically what's happening here.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.640
But the important thing to remember is that whenever we're creating the custom query,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.800
they have to pass the object variable,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:18.590
followed by the little arrow before half boasts and the post functions that's closed the

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.950
wire block and the east block as well.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.130
Right now,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.350
what's happening here is that we're working with a copy off the original WordPress loop.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:35.510
That copy is represented by this future variable we created here.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:42.880
It will give us a huge power since we will be able to work for the same methods used by the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.520
original WordPress query,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.350
such as half posts and the Post,

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.140
to make the modifications to the query parameters such as the number off returns boasts,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.280
which by the fault,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.730
is 10 posts.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:02.510
And here we changed to just one post any way we can control several things using this copy

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.150
off the loop.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.050
But his ankle band says,

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.190
with great power comes great responsibility.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.390
So we have to pay close attention to not matching up with the Defour's WordPress Square UK

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.390
.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.990
To do that,

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.750
we have to reset this custom query and restore the main query.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.460
To ensure this,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:29.030
we're gonna use a function called WP reset post data at the end of our modified loop right

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:36.030
here after the And while be very careful because this is very important.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.690
Not using this function can lead to unexpected results.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.150
Okay,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.320
Well,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.100
so far we've learned to create our custom loop,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.120
but it only fetches information from the database,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.250
but it still doesn't show anything on screen.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.050
In the next lesson,

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.580
you'll learn how to do that and show everything you want.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.090
Old screen.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.550
OK,

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.550
so see you later.
