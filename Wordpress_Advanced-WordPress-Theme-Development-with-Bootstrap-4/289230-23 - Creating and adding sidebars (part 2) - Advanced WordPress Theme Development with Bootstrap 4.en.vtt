00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
Hey,

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:01.660
what's up,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.240
guys?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.640
We're back here with another lesson in the last lesson started butin our first cyber.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.500
We stopped at the point where we were beauty.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.710
The structure of each over two sidebars Notice here in the region manager that we already

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.930
have the two sidebars area created.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.960
However,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.530
if you add some widgets in the sidebars,

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.750
nothing will happen.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.400
Let's,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.100
for example,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.050
and the text widget in the sidebar that is going to be placed on the themes home page

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.400
that's a title and some random next here.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.350
That's safe.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.900
Now,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.750
if you look at home page,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.460
nothing has changed it.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.980
The same thing will happen with a cyber that we're gonna add on the block page.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.870
The problem,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.750
as always,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.040
is that we need to tell WordPress where are sideburns were replaced.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.130
And this has to be done inside some template fire.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.880
So let's start by creating new fire here in our themes folder,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.970
this fire will be called Sidebar.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.680
Don't PH.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.920
B Inside this file,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.850
you're gonna add the following coat is is active Sidebar,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.470
sidebar.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.830
One What you're doing here is testing.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.170
If there is any active region inside our sidebar,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.420
if it's true,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.850
Let's call a function here.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.750
Dynamic sidebar.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:50.890
Cyber one There is if there's an active region in the sidebar named Sidebar one below the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.500
contents off that cyber.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.510
Excellent,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.270
but it's not ready for this new fire to be useful,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.670
you have to include it somewhere on our feet.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.050
But where?

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.830
Well,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.330
let's start with the home page.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.780
We want to include our new file here where you see this sidebar text,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.390
of course.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.420
OK,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.770
but how do we require a file that contains a sidebar?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.650
Very simple.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.050
Just use a WordPress function called Get on the score sidebar.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.610
By doing so,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.440
when we below the home page,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.950
we will see some results.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.910
Look,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.800
we have our tax reject with the title and also with the contents that we added on the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.110
region.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.370
Great.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.010
And now how can you do the same for the second side?

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.450
Were the one that we want to display on the block page?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.360
Do we need to use the same sidebar?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.670
That's PHP file?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.490
Is it possible to create shoes?

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.790
Sad burb watch PHP files one for eight sideburn,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.360
and my answer is,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.960
Yep,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.500
another for this to work.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.920
Let's rename the sidebar that speech before.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.410
Now it will be called Sidebar hyphen home dot PHP.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.750
We will Onley used this file to add the side bar of the home page template.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.260
Sounds out years,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.930
doesn't it?

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.610
It's because it's really obvious.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.550
Let's copy the entire content off this file and paste it into a new file.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:29.080
This one will be called Sidebar hyphen blawg dot PHP.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.850
Now just replace the name of the sidebar inside his new file.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.170
Otherwise it will load the same cyber as the home page.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.890
And it's not what we want.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.050
Now.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.350
I have two files.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.820
One off them adds a side bar to the home page template.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.380
The other one adds.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.590
The second side were If you only be displayed on the block beach now to finish out,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.330
we need to pass the string to the get sidebar function here in the beige home.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.440
That's PHP file.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:10.400
We add the word home inside the get sidebar function that's copies here and ending the X

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.900
file.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.050
Let's space what we just copied here at the point where we want to call sideburn.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.210
Just take care to change the name of the template.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.270
We shall now be blawg that is here At this point,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.340
the filing clothes is this one here.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.370
Sidebar,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.050
hyphen blogger dot PHP and our problems are solved.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:42.120
Let's head over to our dashboard and add some widgets to the block page Cyber that said,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.960
Um,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:52.940
an archive of Egypt and,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.550
um,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.240
you categories midget.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.410
Now let's see.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:11.650
Here on the home page we have the text regions and on the block page,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.230
we have the two week it's we just added,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.060
Very cool.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.230
See how much power the sideburns bring to the side owner with them,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.370
the user can at whatever we just he or she wants.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.540
They can even download their favorite regents or blood ins and use them as they wish.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.890
Okay,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.980
to finish this lesson,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.290
let's make Treem or modifications here first.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.430
How about the change?

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.550
Decide buyer here,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.050
Let's move it to the right side of the page.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.330
Right To do that,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.940
I'm going to cut these aside stag and paste it after this closing gift bag.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.460
Sublime text makes this really easy,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.270
since it shows me exactly where the stiff ends.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:07.120
The second modification that we want to do is Gary it off the elements we don't want on the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.610
block page for example,

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.540
on the blood page.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.800
We don't want the slide section and also the services section here.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.300
They'll only be displayed on the home page,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:24.050
so I'll go ahead and remove these elements here so I don't want them here.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.780
And the last one that's at a bootstrap for class.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.090
To this aside element called H 100 the Sioux calls the height of the aside elements not to

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.770
spend the entire height of the page.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.250
We can do the same for the aside tag on the page.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.770
Home that PHP file.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.480
Okay,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.110
excellent.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.160
Let's save reload page Perfect.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:01.790
It's working something's implement sidebars in a different way.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.780
For example,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.150
if you open the 2017 thing,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.130
you noticed that first of all,

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.540
it performs a check here.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.150
It's saying the following If the sidebar named Sidebar One is not active,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.640
notice the page.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.180
Be not operator Richard,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.710
that is,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.980
do nothing else.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.630
If we get this far,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.100
we do have Richards,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.240
and then it actually includes the sidebar inside in a size Dag.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.530
In our case,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:37.310
we choose to add the asides that outside of the sidebar fire itself so the aside stag will

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.460
always be displayed.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.750
It doesn't matter if have content or not.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.550
In cyber,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.970
in turn,

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.850
the 2016 thing does the same way I do.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:53.160
The only difference is that it uses the aside stack inside the fire too.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.930
Well,

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.990
these are possibilities.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.970
And you,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.400
as different developer,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.270
can choose the one you like the most.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.770
The important thing is to know how to get here.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.350
Exactly what I'm teaching you at the moment.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.530
So for now that so I went for you there in the next lesson by
