00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.305
Hi folks, Marcello here for another lesson.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.740
And we are almost coming to the end of this long work.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.040
And today we are going to be creating an area to include the thing logo.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:20.760
First of all, as head over to the WordPress Dashboard, Appearance menu, customize.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.970
And under site identity,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.725
you realize that we don't have a control to upload a logo to the thing yet.

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:33.635
So we have to figure out how to do this.

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:38.584
Fortunately, there is a fairly easy way to do this in WordPress.

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:41.435
To do so, let's go back to our code.

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:47.765
Today we can forget the customizer dot PHP file because we need only the functions file.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:50.960
The changes will be, as you will see many more.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.840
Let's go ahead and add another thing support.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.705
This time, the theme supports we want is called Custom hyphen logo.

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:05.020
This theme supports, accepts an array of arguments in

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.560
which we can set both the width and the height of the image.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.050
So let's begin the array here.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.110
Height is going to be 110,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.914
and width is going to be 200.

00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:22.765
This is going to be enough for our logo image.

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:26.260
As you're setting an exact size for this image,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.585
you'll notice that we're press will allow us to crop the image used for the logo.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:38.239
Let's save this here and reload the customizer dashboard.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.785
Now if you access site identity again,

00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:49.675
you have here an exclusive area to send our logo coup, isn't it?

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.280
Let's upload an image.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.345
Look here, as I said before,

00:01:55.345 --> 00:02:03.625
the customizer suggests that the uploaded image has a dimension of 200 by 110 pixels.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:08.780
And once you choose a name age that I have already set aside for the logo.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.695
Notice that this image is larger than the suggested size.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:17.335
So when I click Select WordPress,

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:19.210
asked me to crop the image.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.470
Before that, I'm going to type here

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.865
an alternative text for the image and also a description.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:28.860
I'm going to just type the thing name.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.910
Okay?

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.440
I'm going to click on this button here and proceeds to crop the image.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.565
Okay, great.

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.860
The image is here in our field.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.670
But of course, it's not displaying on the theme yet.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.995
Let's say this year for now.

00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:55.280
And we go ahead and include the logo in our thing.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.555
To do this, let's open up the header.html file.

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:03.090
Let's remove it all here.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.650
And I scholar logo.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.160
To do that, it's really very simple.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.520
Let's just call the Custom Logo function.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.235
Lets it nothing more.

00:03:18.235 --> 00:03:20.920
But now you understand the reasons why we

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.725
created some things at the beginning of the course.

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:27.760
For example, we have this tax Sandra class here.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.105
And we also have this div tag just below the bootstrap container called a line.

00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:38.260
The tax send reclaimed ensures that the logo will be centered.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.160
Even when we are at a very small screen resolution,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.930
such as a smartphone.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.330
And the online class,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.595
we used to align both the logo and the menu vertically.

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:54.005
Well, before showing you how we are going to align these items,

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:57.770
let's see if our logo is already showing up on the screen.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.630
Let's open our thing here.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.865
Excellent. Our logo is already showing on the screen.

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:09.080
Look here.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.580
However, you can see that it's not aligned with the menu.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.330
In fact, we have this space all under the menu.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.780
It really seems very, very ugly.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.519
To solve this, Let's use only three CSS commands.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:30.050
Let's go ahead and create a very simple rule for that align class.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.510
Let's open up our CSS file.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.545
And let's say the following.

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:44.075
Display.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.050
Flex.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:57.365
Align items center with 100%.

00:04:57.365 --> 00:05:02.390
Using only this, we can ensure that our items aligned vertically.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.440
So let's see.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.445
Well, something went wrong here.

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:15.950
We'll have to figure out what happened.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.585
Let's go back to our code because I believe the problem isn't that

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:26.510
aligned if yes, it's here.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.820
In fact, this div must be inside the row, not outside.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.785
Otherwise, the display flex once worked for the two inner div tags.

00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:39.780
Let's reorder the code.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.580
And let's refresh the page again.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.260
Gray, his working, it can't get more perfect than this.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.780
So now let's resize the screen.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:11.340
And when we get below 767 pixels are responsive menu will display.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.490
And the logo image is centered thanks to the online class.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.770
Another alternative to align the menu wishes even easier

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.400
is to pass to Bootstrap four classes to this row here.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.930
Instead, you can delete these aligned tiff and leave

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.710
only the row passing the deflects and align items center Bootstrap classes to it.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.605
Passing the flags, we are saying that the rho,

00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:43.640
which is the parent of both the section and the nav elements,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.605
will display as a flux element.

00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:51.155
And the align items center aligns the two children elements to the center.

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:54.320
Well, folks, that was it for this lesson.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.715
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:59.495
And I invite you then to be hearing me in the next lesson,

00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:02.930
which will be our last on the WordPress theme customizer.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.090
Until then, happy coding.
