WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Now that we have done the rest ful Web series,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.350
it's important to add a p a documentation toe our surveys.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.380
Otherwise,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.160
when we shared this toe some customers who want to make use off other standpoint now it is

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.130
very difficult for them.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.310
Toe read our understand or a PS and many implications we wouldn't be sharing the source

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.010
score with them.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.340
So how do we do this?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.030
Not This is where you have a fantastic AP.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.140
I called Swagger.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.700
So if you go toe swaggered are are you?

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.940
You can learn about how a P a development is simplified with the documentation off swagger

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.940
.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.130
Now,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.580
I don't want to go too deep into how this works,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.870
but I want to show you how to add swagger,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.340
toe our application and get the A p a up and running.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.460
So the first thing we want to do is toe get this swagger.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.170
So if you go to spring initialize er and look for swagger here,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.620
you may not see that now,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.430
somehow,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.410
spring boot does not have the default.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.440
Dependence is included over here,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.080
so we may have to explicitly goto envy and deposited dot com and look for Strugar to press

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.770
enter.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.230
You can see it come from I o Lord spring folks start spring folks Swagger too.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.970
So I'm gonna select that and the current washing happens to be 292 So I just had a copy of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.390
this.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.590
Go back to our bombed or XML at this as a dependency.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.720
So I can go to the end of the dependency list here and pasted escape this And now I have

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.650
one dependency that is added.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.420
With this dependency,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.350
we will be able to scan and get information about all the AP is we have,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.860
If you want a graphical user interface that displays all the AP is provide some testing

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.510
options,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.690
then you have the other one more dependency,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.620
which is from Let's goto swagger you I andi if you see that it's again from my own our

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.320
spring folks spring folks swagger you,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.970
I The washing also is the same thing toe nine to a copy that once again go back to my palms

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.670
or XML at as the last dependency Save it.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.990
It's gonna download the job fights for the same.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.010
There are two more steps in all in enabling swagger.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.190
Number one we goto application or Java and we say that we want enable swagger documentation

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.190
.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.430
So I'm gonna go here and then type at the it enabled swagger and it says enable swaggered

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.800
to and we have to add a bean definition here.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.710
So now what is this being definition?

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.270
Now,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.110
let me say enable swagger toe.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.850
It's gonna look for an object that is going to scan your entire project for all the A P s

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.140
and then build the documentation.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.970
Now this is called is a docket.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.690
And the way you do that is by typing public docket said documents supposed to come from

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.070
spring Forbes documentations spring dark Web plug ins and then we can call any name we want

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.070
.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.790
Let's call it best FBI and we have done some docket object.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.500
So with their return new dock it and then we supply a what Washington So you can see that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.990
it says,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.790
What's the documentation type?

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.650
That's argument.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.040
So we think your documentation type dot swagger one off swagger,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.470
too.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.880
So we want to say swagger to Technically,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.260
we should be able to go Oregon.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.520
This object and everything should be okay,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.770
but this gives us conflagration as well.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.610
Now we have to mark this as a bean so that spring automatically instance shit.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.730
This object and then this doctor object can be used for building the A P A.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.240
Documentation Now to specify some configuration.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.750
Here we say your dark select.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.310
And then this is what to say what a B is to be selected with his select the AP eyes like

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.390
dot AP eyes and then say What are the AP is that we want toe document on.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.160
We say Any request handlers are they?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.050
It's such as get mapping,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.730
post mapping.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.250
It's a trance.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.050
So we want that.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.090
So we say request handler.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.580
Selectors don't anything that any type of handlers we want.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.150
And then we also say any type off parts that we want to specify again,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.990
you can say what selector off any now.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.590
Once again,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.840
we are seeing that we want to just document everything but heroes.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.160
Well,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.530
instead of saying any,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.250
I can add some filter saying that a provide documentation for only get handlers,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.940
not for post Oregon,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.290
say slash ap a slash secured should not be imported.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.700
It starts that I can do that and then I can say build.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.980
So finally build.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.820
So a lot of documentation configuration.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.080
You can go over here.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.790
Then let's let's see.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.800
What is the error here?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.690
So we see some kind of a console log.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.000
Let's see.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.650
What is that?

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.520
It is your class,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.050
not phoned docket.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.860
So this could be because when we actually added the mainland dependencies it waas still

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.480
building.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.690
So we may have to stop this once.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:12.360
That's clear.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.350
The console on drum the application once again on see if everything is OK.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.990
All right.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.540
Looks like everything is fine.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.450
It's being scanning.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.250
You can see that.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.920
Scanning for FBI listing references.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.480
Tanker has been started.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.750
Application has been started in 10 seconds.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.580
So I'm gonna go back to the browser on first,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:49.440
look for something like local host 7777 slash and then I type your V two slash 88 docks.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.890
Now,

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.260
this is where you will be able to see some Jason Documentation representing a lot of

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.820
information.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.460
Let's copy this on open in.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.070
Postman on.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.190
Let's based it.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.320
Press enter.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.170
You can see that it's gonna give me a Jason representing lots off AP A yours.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.680
Now,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.600
this is not very useful for us.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.380
But this is gonna be used by swagger.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.880
You it.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.130
So how do I get into that?

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.000
Very simple.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.600
You just have to stay here after that,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.890
you dot html But when I pressed enter,

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.350
you can see we get a hollow spring boat on.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.520
This is because we have mapped the slash to this particular hello spring book.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.890
Now what I can do is I can just changes Toe slash.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.390
Hello?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.290
So that when slash Hello is asked.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.100
This is the onset that we're gonna get.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.560
If you're accessing the root off your service,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.010
then swagger you I should give the response in our buffet.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.320
Explicitly Access slash.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.920
Hello.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.780
We get this.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.230
Hello,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.570
string.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.030
Good.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.980
But if I think here Swagger,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.940
you write our HTML on now we should see that we got an a p A.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.800
Documentation over here.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.280
Now the a p a documentation includes application,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.720
which has a slash.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.890
Hello as one a.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.130
B.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.390
I.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.980
There's a basic error controller.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.270
No,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.750
we did not configure any other controllers,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.590
but if we do that,

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.350
we will get.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.580
But there is a slash error with all get head post etcetera.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.630
So this is not configured by us,

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.960
but you can see customer rest controller.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.050
That's the name we gave in our application.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.190
So efface expanded.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.540
You have slash AP.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.670
A.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.230
Customers get all customers is a function of the handler for the same.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.590
The post for a beer customers they get put on delayed for this particular you are.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.550
If you select a P A customer's,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.530
you can see that I'm able to supply some parameters on.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.960
So here it says there's an underscore limit Underscore paid as quiet string parameters that

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.900
optional because they're the default value off 10 and one year,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.700
respectively.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.820
This could be the possible responses.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.950
If it is 200 there's gonna be okay.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.050
Example values and so on and so forth.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.500
Now what you can do is you can also test the same thing but thinking on trade out.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.690
So let's do that.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.540
When I do that,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.860
it says the two values defaults.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.790
Do you want to execute?

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.660
Let's execute and see on it comes back and say,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:09.810
Hey,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:15.690
this is how you do where I see you are not call So I on a Mac in torture are Lennox like,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.680
and just copy this and based on I should be able to get it on a terminal.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.400
But if you want to access from the Broza,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.030
this is gonna be on.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.020
This is the response that we got our we were supposed to get when we make a request.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.190
And,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:28.590
of course,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.080
there's some options to download and so on and so forth.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:38.480
So this is how you use swagger toe create a P A documentation for all your micro services.
