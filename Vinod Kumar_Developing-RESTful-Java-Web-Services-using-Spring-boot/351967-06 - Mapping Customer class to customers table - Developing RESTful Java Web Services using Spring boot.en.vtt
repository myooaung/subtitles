00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
know that we have customers Data.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.080
Let's map our customer class that we wrote earlier to this particular table.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.920
Now for this,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.650
we need a few more dependencies.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.670
First,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.180
let me stop the cerebral if it is running,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.640
because every time I make some changes,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.120
the Sarwar keeps restarting and sometimes it becomes a night.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.000
So let's go back to start our spring there.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.280
Are you close this bombed or examine on?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.860
We want toe art this time.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.950
GP Springdale A GP provides a persistence mechanism to our application.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.100
So let's click on that.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.150
Get the new washing of the Bombing or XML computer to the Clipper.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.480
Let's go here replace our current formed or XML with the new one Andi as soon as they do

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.910
that,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.900
newer dependencies have been added to my project,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.620
and the first thing that I want to do is to specify information about the DB on that I can

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.570
do by going to the application that properties a couple off JP related information.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.540
Number one is what is the driver class that we want to use.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.760
So this is done by giving strict dot data source dot driver class name equals to our dark

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.570
heads to dart Driver is the value for the same next spring.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.120
The data source dot you order You may get the value for this Europe from our H two point

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.760
that's was distinct and then copy this one and then based over here.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.590
Similarly,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:49.610
I also want to give using me equals toe say password equals toe blank,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.840
so do not give any additional space.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.730
But along with this,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.670
you also have to give one more thing,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.590
which is spring dot jp a dot hibernated.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.220
Don't deal,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.680
Dash Otto.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.990
None Now,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.750
if you're familiar with hibernate,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.420
you know that there is something for hitch bm toe video.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.280
Otto were hibernate automatically creates their tables corresponding toe the customer job

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.910
that I have written to say that we already have table and the leader corresponding toe the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.900
customer or job.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.470
They say that Haibin it should not manufacture the new table in the back in,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.790
but there ways your data along with the table will be deleted on newly constructed.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.130
So let's save this and go back to customer Gela.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.180
Now in the customer job,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.820
we have to say that this particular class corresponds toe the customer stable.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.340
There are two and traditions for doing this.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.750
Number one is Derek entity on This comes from Java Extort Persistence package.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.310
This is required because J.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.590
P.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.740
A.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.050
Which is Java persistence.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.370
AP.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.970
I will only consider classes that are marked with 100 entity now,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.030
since the table name is different than the class name,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.490
we may have toe specify that exclusively by typing are very table name.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.750
It wants to customers once again import the same thing from Java Extract Persistence

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.450
package.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.110
Though this is not a case in to do,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.990
it is a good practice to follow.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.350
The lower case are uppercase for the table names.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.660
One other thing that you may want to mention here that the idea is the primary key among

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.480
the others.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.510
So I can say here at the rate I d as the less If you want to say that this is automatically

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.550
generated by back in with the average generated value,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.740
strategy equals toe identity.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.700
This is applicable for any column in the back and where auto underscore increment has been

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.080
given.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.440
In case.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.220
If you have not given auto underscored increment but still want high benetto automatically

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.130
increments this,

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.350
then you can say generator equals toe increment.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.590
In this case,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.960
hibernate will automatically increments the value from the application rather than from the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.440
server.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.320
So,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.610
Cindy,

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.130
in our case,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.070
we're given idea as art on the score increment.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.270
I can roll back toe strategy equals toe generation typed our identity.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.260
The other values for this could be something like sequence sequence is applicable for

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.540
Oracle all you can also specify that it is table.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.270
So where a specific table would be created representing only primary key values.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.730
Or you can let it go automatically.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.630
By choosing Otto here.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.160
In my case,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.840
I'm gonna specify identity.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.680
If any of the columns are off different names than their respective field names,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.370
you may also want toe on a date that by at the red color.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.070
So in my case,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.460
all of them have the exact same name as the back end table columns.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.750
So I don't have to do that
