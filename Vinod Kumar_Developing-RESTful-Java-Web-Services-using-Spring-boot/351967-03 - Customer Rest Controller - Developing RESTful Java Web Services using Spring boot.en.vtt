00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
Now let's have a more useful rest controller here.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.710
Instead of doing everything in this application itself,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.160
it created a new class that acts as a customer rest controller.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.750
And this controller should have mapping for get post put delete requests.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.030
So first of all,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.780
let's create a new class here called as customer arrest controller.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.270
We can also add a sub package or here saying that this is something to do with controllers

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.050
say finish and notice that every time I add or modify some fights,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.740
springboard project is gonna restart.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.800
So that can be sometimes annoying.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.850
I'm going to stop that.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:03.740
And here I am going to say that this is a rest controller as well as this is gonna handle

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.500
all the request for a perfect called a p A customers.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.650
So you can do that by typing at very request mapping slash a B I slash customers,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.250
which means that I can come or here locals double seven double seven slash AP,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.060
I slash customers.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.320
And then when I send the request,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.560
this request will now be handled by one of the function within this particular class.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.470
And let's say we want to have a function here,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.450
which gives me some response.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.420
So I'm generating function here called Public.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.230
I can say stream.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.850
Let's call it as get all customers.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.150
Have you done all customers?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.550
Data will come from here.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.050
The only thing that I have to do here is to say a deal.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.450
It get mapping.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.780
Now,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.770
after it get mapping is equal in tow.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.570
A request mapping with a matter off.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:14.620
Get so I can as well say you request mapping Met hurt equals toe request method.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.400
Don't get so this was the only way you could have done in the past.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.270
But no,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.410
we have a simpler way of doing by saying get mapping.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.560
So let's say this or on the program and see if we can get this going.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:44.430
So I'm gonna go here right click run as shower application and then I can come down here

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.070
and then say,

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.650
a p a slash customers.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.580
I pressed Enter and it says all customers data will come here.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.650
But what we want is not a string but a Jason representation off customer data,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.540
and we don't have any class representing customers.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.690
So let's begin by creating a classical customer representing customer data for this.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.050
I'm gonna go and clear the new class called customer.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.020
A right click on this chord.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.270
Urbino dot controllers New class.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.070
But this class being an entity class,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.440
I can name the packages quarter,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.650
you know,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.330
dark entity or model our domain and then you the name as a customer.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.420
Let's assume that we do have a in teacher i D.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.450
For a customer.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.430
A couple of other details,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.910
such as customer mean and Eamon.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.870
Probably a phone number.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.860
Let's say City stayed on and probably country.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.890
We also want to know whether the customer is male are female,

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.900
so I can say private string gender and I think this should be good enough for our customer

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.690
class.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.250
Since all these are private variables,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.420
you can only make use off them by exposing while getters and setters.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.430
Traditionally,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.180
we would have done that by going to source generate getters insiders.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.790
And then you can add a two string constructor using fields.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.360
Constructor is in super class,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.770
etcetera,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.240
etcetera,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.220
but we do have a better mechanism called Lombok.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.450
Now to work with Lombok.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.050
Let's goto our spring initialize er add Lum book as a dependency.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.920
Get the new your washing off bomb.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.750
Can't be that and go back to our project.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.730
Replace the current ponder XML with that one.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.480
And in a minute that project is ready.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.910
Now,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.840
in my case,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.850
Lombok has been already set up.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:08.320
So if I goto customer java and adhere agday rate no arcs Constructor,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.220
you will see that there is a constructor in the Hope line as well as I can say that the

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:22.050
rate getter at the rate setter and you can see that get us and said us are added

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.190
automatically.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.290
Now,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.940
in your case,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.790
if you're using lumber for the first time,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.850
this will not happen.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.330
So first thing you do is tow Goto.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.760
Maybe Independence is expand this finder Where is the lumber jar?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.970
In my case,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.290
right here Rightly can say copy,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.410
qualified name.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.890
And this will give me the name and location off the job.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.610
You can also see it stages.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.920
But here it's under my users.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.690
We don't Come on.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.710
Don't m two repository our project.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.150
Lumber,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.780
Lumber.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.270
It's a lot so you can find it right here.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.370
Now,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.250
on windows,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.000
you have toe go to that location and double click the lumber.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.640
Torture on Mac are leaners open air terminal and then just job minus job followed by the

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.200
jar.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.850
Finally,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.440
because this copied from eclipse and then when I pressed Enter it is gonna come up with the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:27.070
user interface on this user interface will search for on the ideas that are there like this

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.070
.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.650
In my case,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.670
it is under slash applications eclipsed or app.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.100
If you don't see your eclipse location over here,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.980
you can kick on the specified location finder the eclipsed our I A file on.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.910
Then you should be able,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:39.250
tow,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.490
install or update.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.010
In my case,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.170
it's already updated.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.300
You can see that the symbol here.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.840
But if you want,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.320
you can always say install update and then quit the installer.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.440
Once you have installed,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.250
you have tow close eclipse and open.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.810
Now do not go file Restart.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.200
That doesn't help your physically close eclipse and then open again and then you should be

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.910
able to see your respective get a sitters.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.550
Are any other additional annotations that you have used now that I have here a customer

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.150
class,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:20.770
let's go to our customer rest controller and say that we would like toa return a list off

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.220
customers over here.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:31.400
And to do so I can say List off customer import list from Java Util by pressing control,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.450
shift on Windows or command ship on Mac and make sure that you select from Java Util list.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.660
And now we need to return a list off customers Over here.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.850
Let's say I want to create to customers and then you're done them as a list.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.810
So it's a custom or C one equals toe new customers,

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.970
If you wonder,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:08:01.510
said I d off one that is a name off that they have you my name C one dot said email.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:14.980
The wonder said for but and then see Wonder said City Bangle City Wonder said Gender.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.700
I can also create a second customer.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:29.080
Let's call it as C two closed toe new customer and then I'd say seafood are said idea off

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.760
to settle Rcep Name off rotation,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.570
said email.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:44.630
Andi,

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.250
I think see do DOT said City should do the job.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.910
Now,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.950
in order to return these to customers as a list,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.830
I'm going to simply say return.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.450
They start as list off.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.210
See one.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:00.640
Come on,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.150
C two.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.610
Now that dysfunction is ready,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.600
let's go on read on the application Dark Java,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.300
which starts over Tomcat server.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.780
And then I can go back,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:19.600
toe the browser and access the same thing and you'll see No,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.650
I got a Jason wash in off the object.
