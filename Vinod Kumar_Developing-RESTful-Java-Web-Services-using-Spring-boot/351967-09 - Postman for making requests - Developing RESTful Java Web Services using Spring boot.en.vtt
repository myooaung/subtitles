00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
before we go any further,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.870
let's use a tool called Postman.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.320
So go to Google and then look for postman.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.050
For Mac.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.590
You've got on,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.050
Mac,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.850
are you can save indoor sickle on windows and then it says here,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.170
get postman dot com Download sick.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
You go to that you should be able to see based on your operating system.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.870
A download button is given.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.180
So since minus macro is,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:35.160
I'm able to see that it's Mac OS application Now what this does is it allows us to make a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.110
request based on the method,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.190
like get put post delete.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.180
For example,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.990
on the browser.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.750
When I typed here and press enter,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.200
it was always a get mattered and not post method.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.250
Also,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.360
at some point in time,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.400
if you want to send additional details like hitters,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.800
you will not be able to send from the browser.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.110
But from postman,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.570
you will be able to do this now if you want.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.610
You can also look for other rest clients,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.490
but I use postman,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.990
so let's go ahead and download and use that.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.570
So in my case,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.430
though I only have God Postman installed,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:19.030
let me open the same and then make a request for our local host 7777 in the a slash

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.710
customers.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.700
So that's so that's had a new request that request IBIs.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.930
Get the Ural Happens to be http local host Colon Double seven,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.080
Double seven ascended.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.500
We're gonna get the hello from spring.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.870
I believe that's the response.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.810
Follow spring Boot.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.250
But if I say you're slash FBI slash customers,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.750
I said send.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.250
You can see that we got the customers from 1 to 10.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.150
So it also specifies that the status is 200.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.080
Total time taken is 56 milliseconds.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.510
What's the size of it and so on and so forth.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.430
Now,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.630
if you want to send some additional parameters,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.380
you can just put a question mark over here itself or reconsiders a section here.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.090
Corp Adams Key happens to be Let the underscored page on the value happens to be,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.390
Let's say,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.040
four.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.090
Andi,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.640
you can see that automatically updated Over here,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.400
I say send and I'm going to get from 31 to 40 which is the content off page number four
