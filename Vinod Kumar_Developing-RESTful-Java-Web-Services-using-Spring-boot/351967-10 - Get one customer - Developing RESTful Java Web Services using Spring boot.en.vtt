00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Now that we have got a to like postman,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.320
let's are more functionalities.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.260
For example,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.780
instead of getting all the customers are off a particular page,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.190
whatever I'm looking for a customer by a idee.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.950
So,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.730
for example,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.590
I can say customers slash 66 where I want to say that Gimme customer whose ideas?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.730
66.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.580
Without mentioning the world,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.930
I'd be so we're not sending a quiet listing perimeter like question.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.610
Mark I d equals Store 66 but we're saying here that slash 66 So we want to assume that this

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.930
66 year is a variable or ivy.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.890
So let's go and add one additional function.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.640
This time I won't say public customer because I want to return a single customer.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.900
That's call it as get customer by highly.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.930
We want an integer Eylea on.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.210
Then I can simply say,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.870
return a little dot find by idee off.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.300
Heidi.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.840
This is that the return type is not a customer,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.370
but something got optional on.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.120
All I have to do is to say dot get and I get an actual customer object based on this idea.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.410
The question is,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.280
how do I map this?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.470
Because slash Abia slash customers cannot be mapped to two functions.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.470
We have to have some kind of difference.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.100
So we also say they get mapping.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.630
But this time it is for something with a perimeter.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.480
So the cuddly black It here is to say that this is a place holder on whatever is given over

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.630
there is now recognised as I d.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.450
So it's gonna be like slash ap slash customers slash 66 that 66 is now identifiable by

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120
using the world idee.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.390
And now we want to say that whatever is there in the I d should be given to this now.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.850
Previously you so we said it's a request perimeter,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.100
but this time it's not a request perimeter.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.680
It's called us part variable.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.500
I have to simply on your attended part.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.960
Variable on.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.250
That should be good.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.920
Now,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.730
in case if the value that you're given your idea is different than the name of the variable

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.730
,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.110
then it won't happen.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.240
So all you have to do in that case is to say that this is idee since in my case,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.620
the perimeter idea here is same as the variable name.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.470
This part is optional.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.650
So let me get rid of that,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.250
so I'm gonna save it.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.140
And now,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.210
if I go back to Postman and then send this request,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.150
I should be able to get a single customer data.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.270
So let me check it out by typing a different idea.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.210
Let's for example,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.100
45.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.730
Send it on.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.040
We do get a different object.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.890
What if I type your 4500 where I don't have the corresponding data?

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.130
Now what happens is that you simply get an exception.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.580
So it says your 500 internals there were better.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.040
And that's because there is a no al you present and this exception was actually created by

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.980
a spring and hibernate combination.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.600
Now,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.320
if you don't want this exception on,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.870
if you don't want this to be reported as Internet,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.060
sir,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.570
where it out?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.140
Because it's just that we don't have a value for this,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.740
i d.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.660
It's still a proper response from the server,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.620
but I don't have a response content.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.750
If you want to do anything different,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.170
then what we can do here is to surround this with a try,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.680
catch block and then return a customer if it is phone.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.470
But return and novel you are a plank if there is no customer.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.580
So the first thing I'm gonna do is to change the data type here,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.940
toe something called response Entity off and put a question mark.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.890
Question mark is being very generate.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.690
We say that we want to send some response,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.830
but we don't know what is a data type because it can be a customer.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.190
It can be annulled value as well.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.240
So the number one thing that I'm gonna do is to say,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.120
get up this first and then I'll say Here,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.090
try Andi,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.670
catch an exception.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.460
So we're gonna say you're customer C one equals toe report out.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.530
Find my i d off.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.050
I d dot Get so we got the customer.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.640
But if there is an exception,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.460
I'm gonna go inside this and then I wanted it on something else.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.120
First,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.790
let me return a valued response from here,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.510
so we're gonna say response entity,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.510
Don't.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.360
Okay.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.000
And then we can say that Hey,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.350
c one is the body for this particular response because we have a valid values.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.370
And what is okay represents the state of scored 200.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.270
Whereas,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.120
if anything else is that I can probably send some other response.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.610
For example,

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.120
I can say for not for saying that it is not phone instead of 500 so I can see your response

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.120
.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.850
Entity.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.490
Andi,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.790
I can see your dart status off.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.430
I can say for not four and then I can say dot Body off none because I don't have any

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.330
response to be sent on.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.160
Then I can say you're cynical.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.370
Off course I have to say return because I have to return some values of what?

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.630
The places I have to say.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.090
Return Onda.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.370
Now you see that when there is data,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.560
I'm gonna say 200 then I'm sending that customer object.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.270
But if the data is not foreign,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.270
I'm sending a 404 but a body off now,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.080
so that's got tested out.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.790
So first,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.090
let's say 45.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.970
No problem in that.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.320
So we got the actual date of 45.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.320
But if I say you're 4567 which we don't have and not that previous or put is 200 status

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.540
here.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.870
But when I send this now,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:46.020
we're gonna get for nor for and the body is now so there's no better as Internet star error
