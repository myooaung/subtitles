00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
hello and welcome toe developing.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.470
Rest full Web services using springboard.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.640
My name is we know,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.750
and I have over 24 years of teaching experience in 90 industry.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.190
In this course,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.480
I will show you how easy it is to develop practical production.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.070
Really rest ful micro services using springboard step by step A springboard is the springs

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.790
convention or configuration solution for creating stand alone production grade spring based

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.300
applications that you can just run.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.820
It is pre configured with the spring teams opinion interview off the best configuration and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.760
use off spring platform on third party libraries such as Apache Tom.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.770
Get so you can get started with minimum fuss.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.260
Most of springboard applications need very little are no spring configuration at all.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.850
Even if you do not have any prior knowledge offspring,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.700
I assure you that you will be able to understand on you spring boat for your projects.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.750
All I expect from you is fundamental knowledge off Java programming language.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260
Before you start quoting along with me,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.700
make sure that you have Java Wonder eight or later Russian install,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.450
and you have downloaded the eclipse idee for into placed our developers.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.460
So let's get started
