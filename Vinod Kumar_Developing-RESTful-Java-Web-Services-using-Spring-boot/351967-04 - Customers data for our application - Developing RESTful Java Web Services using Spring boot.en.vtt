00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
No.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.400
The big art data,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.560
which is hard coded.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.770
Let's get the data from databases.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.200
For this,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.210
we need two things.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.030
Number one,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.160
we need an RV VMS server and number two.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.800
We need data file so forth.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.100
Let's go to our website car Masaru dot com which gives me mark data.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.560
So here I can choose.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.000
What are the fields I want?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.080
What kind of data that I want for those fields.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.340
And I can choose between CSP Jason SQL etcetera.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.430
How many does he want up?

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.980
2000.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.650
You can get it for free of cost.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.260
You can also choose what kind of line ending and so on and so forth.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.400
So in our customer dot Java,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.230
we have i d as a number.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.500
So this is gonna be okay.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.100
Roll number.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.550
I don't have a first name.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.910
Last name,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.790
but I have just name so I can delete one off them and then call this as name but the kind

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.760
of data I don't want only last name.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.580
I want the full name so I can look for full name.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.650
And that's gonna be full name.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.690
I want email.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.500
Gender.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.710
I don't want an I P address but I want a phone number.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.480
So I select the data like to be a phone,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.110
and that's gonna be a phone number.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.990
You can also say what format?

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.930
Off the phone number.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.850
I just want 10 digit phone number.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.660
Nothing else.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.750
I can also rearrange them on another field within city.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.910
That's at a city.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.090
One more skit,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.980
Andi.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.660
One last four country.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.940
And then I can say here,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.580
Hominy Rose,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.750
I want 1000 is okay with me on one sq all format.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.650
What is the name of the table?

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.050
I'm gonna call this s customers in good clear table also,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.430
and I can click on download data and I don't want the same thing in tow.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.950
My workspace location,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.400
which is under desktop on my course folder under workspace.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.850
I'm gonna save it as customers dot m s s.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.810
You know that the file is ready.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.060
Let's go and open the same thing in a text editor which is here.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.670
Customers are MSs you'll open with.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.200
I'm gonna open that with extend it on this.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.420
No,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.340
it looks like create table customers into idee noticed that there is no primary key.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.480
We can add them on DSI here primary key.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.590
Otto underscore.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.820
Increment name is supposed to be not none.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.940
Our email.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.060
Let's make it us unique.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.370
Sending with phone is gonna be unique.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.660
And the rest of them are okay with me.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.050
I'll save this and close the fight.
