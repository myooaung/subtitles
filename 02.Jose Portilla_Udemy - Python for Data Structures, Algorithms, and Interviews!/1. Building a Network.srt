00:00:01,440  -->  00:00:06,500
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture about building your personal network.

2

00:00:06,810  -->  00:00:13,230
So it's important for you to realize that a huge amount of job opportunities are never publicly shown

3

00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:13,270
.

4

00:00:13,290  -->  00:00:17,090
So companies tend to hire through the networks of their employees.

5

00:00:17,310  -->  00:00:23,010
If you just apply to a company straight through their job site if it's a large company your application

6

00:00:23,250  -->  00:00:25,280
may never be actually seen.

7

00:00:25,320  -->  00:00:31,320
So it's important to build a network and leverage it when you're hunting for a job.

8

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:35,280
So as far as building a network it can be difficult to start out especially if you're young and out

9

00:00:35,280  -->  00:00:36,180
of school.

10

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:40,270
So we're going to look at some options to build out your network.

11

00:00:40,650  -->  00:00:41,630
So there's a lot here.

12

00:00:41,640  -->  00:00:46,200
So you can just go ahead and check out the PowerPoint presentation that's attached as a resources lecture

13

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:46,310
.

14

00:00:46,310  -->  00:00:51,120
But I was going to go through a few of these if you're coming straight to a school alumni organizations

15

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:55,560
and classmates are a great way to go as far as building a personal network.

16

00:00:55,560  -->  00:01:01,650
If you're older and already have children your children's contact such as PTA little league scouts are

17

00:01:01,650  -->  00:01:06,890
parents of those friends of your kids are also great contacts for building a personal network.

18

00:01:07,170  -->  00:01:10,950
Let them know that you're available for a job and you're looking around.

19

00:01:11,100  -->  00:01:13,270
Bring it up in conversation.

20

00:01:13,290  -->  00:01:19,740
Former employers including supervisors and co-workers your friends your relatives members of clubs such

21

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:25,560
as your gym either your softball team or hiking club are all great ways to build out your personal network

22

00:01:25,560  -->  00:01:26,340
.

23

00:01:26,340  -->  00:01:31,620
Again strike in conversation that you're looking for a job on the market.

24

00:01:31,620  -->  00:01:36,610
Also members of the church temple synagogue or mosque are great resources for building up a network

25

00:01:36,610  -->  00:01:36,770
.

26

00:01:36,870  -->  00:01:40,660
Your neighbors both past and current even just professionals.

27

00:01:40,740  -->  00:01:46,800
Your attorney or accountant your doctor your dentist is who knows they may have a link to someone who

28

00:01:47,340  -->  00:01:51,720
knows that there's an opening at their company and then volunteer associations.

29

00:01:51,720  -->  00:01:56,510
It's a great way to spend time volunteering and you also make it valuable network connections there

30

00:01:56,510  -->  00:02:00,450
.

31

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:04,220
Just remember to be proactive and to give as much as you get.

32

00:02:04,230  -->  00:02:08,490
You just can't be taking everything from your network opportunities.

33

00:02:08,490  -->  00:02:11,160
You should be giving equal amount of time.

34

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:16,230
So if they're giving an effort in helping you find a job you should be rewarding them with an effort

35

00:02:16,230  -->  00:02:17,120
back.

36

00:02:17,130  -->  00:02:22,890
Also make sure to take full advantage of the opportunities your network provides in the next lecture

37

00:02:22,890  -->  00:02:22,950
.

38

00:02:22,950  -->  00:02:28,770
We're going to be discussing networking events and Web sites to help you find networking events.

39

00:02:28,770  -->  00:02:29,100
All right.

40

00:02:29,130  -->  00:02:32,520
With that being said let's go ahead and move on to the next lecture.
