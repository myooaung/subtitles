Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview problem for this interview problem.

2

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:08,800
I want to implement a bubble sort.

3

00:00:09,090  -->  00:00:09,720
So go ahead.

4

00:00:09,720  -->  00:00:13,780
Open up a Jupiter notebook and you can begin to implement the bubble sorts.

5

00:00:13,800  -->  00:00:18,150
Go ahead and check the implementation of little bubble sort lecture or the solution explanation of the

6

00:00:18,150  -->  00:00:19,850
sorting algorithm.

7

00:00:19,860  -->  00:00:21,230
All right thanks everyone.

8

00:00:21,300  -->  00:00:22,090
And best of luck
