Hello everyone and welcome to the bridge crossing problem solution.

2

00:00:06,180  -->  00:00:12,150
So this is part of the common group of something called the river crossing puzzles and it's known as

3

00:00:12,330  -->  00:00:17,190
the bridge and torche problem and sometimes at times assigned to each person are different and there's

4

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:25,050
actually solution algorithms for just generalized times the solution to this version is this.

5

00:00:25,050  -->  00:00:28,600
But before I show you that go ahead and check out those links.

6

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:35,010
So I have a link here for the river crossing puzzle I'll take you to a bunch of versions and the one

7

00:00:35,010  -->  00:00:37,350
we're looking at is the bridge and torch problem.

8

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:40,220
In this case we had a bridge and a flashlight.

9

00:00:40,350  -->  00:00:44,220
So here's another example of what you can do.

10

00:00:44,700  -->  00:00:49,920
And there's a semi-formal approach you can look at the variations of the problem on those links as far

11

00:00:49,920  -->  00:00:52,010
as the one we're dealing with.

12

00:00:52,260  -->  00:00:54,030
It looks like this.

13

00:00:54,240  -->  00:01:00,690
First you have the one minute person and the two minute person cross with the flashlight or the torch

14

00:01:00,690  -->  00:01:01,910
whatever you want to call it.

15

00:01:02,110  -->  00:01:03,210
That's two minutes.

16

00:01:03,330  -->  00:01:07,800
Then the one minute person returns and that's another one minute.

17

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:14,980
And here's the tricks of the problem getting five and 10 to cross together and then have to return with

18

00:01:14,980  -->  00:01:18,920
the torch then I have 1 and 2 cross with the torch.

19

00:01:18,960  -->  00:01:23,970
A lot of people think just right off the bat you might as we'll have The One Minute person be the guide

20

00:01:24,330  -->  00:01:25,990
and do all the crossings.

21

00:01:26,130  -->  00:01:30,860
But the trick is this step to have five and 10 cross and have to return.

22

00:01:31,080  -->  00:01:34,820
That way you can get it down to 17 minutes.

23

00:01:34,830  -->  00:01:35,670
All right.

24

00:01:35,670  -->  00:01:36,820
That's a solution.

25

00:01:36,840  -->  00:01:41,850
Check out the links in case you want more variations or draw out this solution in case you're having

26

00:01:41,850  -->  00:01:43,980
trouble understanding it.

27

00:01:43,980  -->  00:01:45,780
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
