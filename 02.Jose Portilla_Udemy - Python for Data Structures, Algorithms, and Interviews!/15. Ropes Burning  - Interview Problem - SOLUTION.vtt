Hello everyone and welcome to the ropes burning riddle solution.

2

00:00:05.490  -->  00:00:10.830
The solution is actually quite simple but there's kind of a trick to figuring it out here's the solution

3

00:00:11.220  -->  00:00:15.200
you're going to take one of your ropes and burn it at both ends.

4

00:00:15.330  -->  00:00:22.290
Then at the same time you burn one end of the other rope once the first rope finishes burning.

5

00:00:22.560  -->  00:00:28.750
Then you light the other end of the remaining rope and then when it burns out that's already been 45

6

00:00:28.800  -->  00:00:30.560
minutes.

7

00:00:30.570  -->  00:00:36.150
The key to this problem is really understanding what were the possibilities of actions that you are

8

00:00:36.150  -->  00:00:36.600
able.

9

00:00:36.640  -->  00:00:40.120
Take your New You can only burn a rope.

10

00:00:40.350  -->  00:00:43.900
And the trick was realizing you could burn both ends of a rope.

11

00:00:44.160  -->  00:00:50.760
So just keep in mind when you're facing a riddle like this what can you physically do to solve the problem

12

00:00:50.760  -->  00:00:50.850
.

13

00:00:50.850  -->  00:00:56.220
So you know you can burn rope at one end and then you figure out you can bring it at both ends.

14

00:00:56.220  -->  00:00:59.850
So start trying different combinations and see how the timing works out.

15

00:01:00.420  -->  00:01:01.150
All right.

16

00:01:01.410  -->  00:01:03.120
So that's it for the solution.

17

00:01:03.120  -->  00:01:08.610
Again maybe draw it out if you still don't get it but that's it for the spraining problem.

18

00:01:08.610  -->  00:01:10.380
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
