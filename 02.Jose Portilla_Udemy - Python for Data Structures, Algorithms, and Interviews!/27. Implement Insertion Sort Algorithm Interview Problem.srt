Hello everyone and welcome to an X interview problem.

2

00:00:05,400  -->  00:00:10,550
So for this interview problem I want you to implement an insertion sort.

3

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:14,790
You can go ahead and check the implementation of an insertion sort lecture for the solution that an

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:17,010
explanation of the algorithm.

5

00:00:17,020  -->  00:00:18,840
All right that's it.

6

00:00:18,870  -->  00:00:19,600
And best of luck
