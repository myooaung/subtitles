Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview.

2

00:00:02.540  -->  00:00:03.250
Problem.

3

00:00:03.270  -->  00:00:05.860
This one's called unique characters in a string.

4

00:00:06.420  -->  00:00:11.400
So simply given a string term and if it's comprised of all unique characters.

5

00:00:11.610  -->  00:00:19.800
So for example the string A B C D E has all unique characters and should return True the string A B

6

00:00:19.800  -->  00:00:22.500
C D E contains duplicate characters.

7

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:25.380
These two days that should return false.

8

00:00:25.380  -->  00:00:30.270
So go ahead fill out your solution below and then you can test your solution by running this test cell

9

00:00:30.290  -->  00:00:31.030
.

10

00:00:31.200  -->  00:00:33.930
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
