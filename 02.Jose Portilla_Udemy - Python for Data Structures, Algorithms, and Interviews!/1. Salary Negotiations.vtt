Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on salary negotiations.

2

00:00:05.550  -->  00:00:10.440
In this lecture we'll get general tips links for salary information and you'll have a homework assignment

3

00:00:10.440  -->  00:00:12.700
at the end of it.

4

00:00:12.720  -->  00:00:16.910
So here are some general tips about negotiating a salary.

5

00:00:16.920  -->  00:00:20.890
First off don't bring up salary before the company initiates the conversation.

6

00:00:20.910  -->  00:00:24.640
You should wait for the company to ask before you bring it up.

7

00:00:24.640  -->  00:00:30.750
Then always provide a range of salary options based off a minimum that you're willing to take.

8

00:00:30.750  -->  00:00:37.260
So for instance if the minimum amount that you'll do a job for is $50000 your range should be somewhere

9

00:00:37.260  -->  00:00:40.810
between 50 and let's say 65.

10

00:00:40.950  -->  00:00:45.510
You should also understand what you're worth and we'll look at the links later on the lecture to get

11

00:00:45.510  -->  00:00:49.370
a better understanding of salaries are given positions you're applying for.

12

00:00:49.470  -->  00:00:54.320
That will also help you be prepared to support your numbers with evidence.

13

00:00:54.330  -->  00:00:55.470
Couple of more tips.

14

00:00:55.530  -->  00:01:00.720
Don't forget to include benefits as part of the total compensation package such as health insurance

15

00:01:01.290  -->  00:01:06.600
free meals gym etc. but also make sure you don't overvalue these.

16

00:01:06.630  -->  00:01:10.230
For instance if your company provides free gym membership.

17

00:01:10.230  -->  00:01:12.850
Keep in mind how much gym membership costs per month.

18

00:01:12.990  -->  00:01:19.600
If it's just an extra $40 a month that's not a huge addition to your total compensation package.

19

00:01:19.680  -->  00:01:27.120
Again don't be too quick to accept a counteroffer and give yourself room to negotiate some resources

20

00:01:27.120  -->  00:01:30.270
for finding out relevant salary information are listed here.

21

00:01:30.270  -->  00:01:36.000
Their salary the pay scale that come and finally I highly recommend glass door though especially for

22

00:01:36.000  -->  00:01:38.360
the tech field.

23

00:01:38.400  -->  00:01:44.460
All of these Web sites use reported salaries to give you a range for either the specific company position

24

00:01:44.910  -->  00:01:48.360
or just the general geographical area and you're working.

25

00:01:48.360  -->  00:01:49.730
Company title.

26

00:01:50.250  -->  00:01:51.750
So go ahead and check out those links.

27

00:01:51.750  -->  00:01:56.480
Try Glassdoor first and then check out salary that common pay scale but come.

28

00:01:56.670  -->  00:02:02.890
Finally your homework is to view the following video lecture by a Harvard Business School professional

29

00:02:02.900  -->  00:02:03.210

30

00:02:03.300  -->  00:02:06.540
Scuse me professor on how to negotiate your job offer.

31

00:02:06.550  -->  00:02:07.610
It's about an hour long.

32

00:02:07.620  -->  00:02:12.960
So keep that in mind that it's a great resource for learning the ins and outs of negotiation.

33

00:02:12.990  -->  00:02:15.950
It's also followed by a question and answer session.

34

00:02:15.960  -->  00:02:20.580
The link is also in the resource section of the lecture so you can either download this PowerPoint presentation

35

00:02:20.580  -->  00:02:24.860
and click the link from it or check out the resource section of this lecture.

36

00:02:24.870  -->  00:02:26.070
All right that's it.

37

00:02:26.070  -->  00:02:31.130
So go ahead and check that video out and that's it for salary negotiation tips.

38

00:02:31.350  -->  00:02:32.160
