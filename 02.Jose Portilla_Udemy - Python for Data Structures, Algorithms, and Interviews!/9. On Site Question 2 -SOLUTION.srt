00:00:00,990  -->  00:00:06,090
Hello and welcome to the second on site question solution for the large search engine company a mock

2

00:00:06,150  -->  00:00:07,530
interview.

3

00:00:07,530  -->  00:00:13,650
So this question you had the reverse of your first one which was given a dice which rolls from 1 to

4

00:00:13,650  -->  00:00:14,320
7.

5

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:15,660
Simulate 4:59.

6

00:00:15,750  -->  00:00:18,700
In that case we just threw out anything above 5.

7

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:22,810
Here it's a little harder because you're never given a dice which throws 1 to 5.

8

00:00:22,950  -->  00:00:26,100
Simulate a uniform seven sided dice.

9

00:00:26,130  -->  00:00:26,600
All right.

10

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:29,720
Let's go ahead and think about this and walk through the solution here.

11

00:00:29,730  -->  00:00:34,150
We're not going to be coding anything out live because it's actually a pretty simple idea.

12

00:00:34,370  -->  00:00:36,010
Well let's go ahead and explain it.

13

00:00:36,510  -->  00:00:42,270
So because the five sided dice can't produce seven possible outcomes on a single roll immediately we

14

00:00:42,270  -->  00:00:45,110
know we have to roll the dice at least twice.

15

00:00:45,630  -->  00:00:49,470
If we roll the dice twice then we have 25 possible combinations.

16

00:00:49,500  -->  00:00:51,160
Five times five.

17

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:55,920
While 25 is not divisible by seven we know that 21 is.

18

00:00:56,130  -->  00:01:00,110
So that means we can implement our previous strategy of throwing out rolls.

19

00:01:00,210  -->  00:01:05,880
Not an intended range but it's also important to know that we can expand the solution to implement more

20

00:01:05,880  -->  00:01:08,070
rules in order to not throw any out.

21

00:01:08,310  -->  00:01:15,940
So for instance there's no number times 5 where excuse me no exponent of 5.

22

00:01:16,080  -->  00:01:17,300
That will be divisible by seven.

23

00:01:17,310  -->  00:01:22,940
No matter how high you go because they're both primes run right after the other.

24

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:28,400
So we'll needed to find a range of the section of the 25 possible combination of rolls.

25

00:01:28,470  -->  00:01:33,750
So a good way to do this is by converting the two rolls into a unique outcome number in the range 1

26

00:01:33,750  -->  00:01:35,410
through 25.

27

00:01:35,610  -->  00:01:38,440
Then we can create this number by taking the rolls.

28

00:01:38,520  -->  00:01:43,200
Then we take the first roll and after subtracting 1 from it we multiply it by 4.

29

00:01:43,200  -->  00:01:46,570
Now the first roll corresponds with values between 1 and 20.

30

00:01:46,740  -->  00:01:51,330
Then we take the second roll added to the result the first manipulation giving us a range from 1 to

31

00:01:51,330  -->  00:01:52,100
25.

32

00:01:52,320  -->  00:01:54,030
So let's go over that one more time.

33

00:01:54,060  -->  00:01:55,780
Our main strategy is this.

34

00:01:55,860  -->  00:02:00,090
We're going to roll the dice twice on the first roll.

35

00:02:00,150  -->  00:02:01,570
We're going to multiply it.

36

00:02:01,680  -->  00:02:04,340
Whatever value we get by 4.

37

00:02:04,340  -->  00:02:12,540
So since the dice can roll between 1 and 5 1 5 1 to 5 times 4 gives us a corresponding range from 1

38

00:02:12,720  -->  00:02:14,010
to 20.

39

00:02:14,010  -->  00:02:20,700
Then we take that second dice roll it or roll the same dice again and add it to the result of the first

40

00:02:20,700  -->  00:02:25,930
manipulation which would be 1 through 20 plus something 1 to 5.

41

00:02:25,950  -->  00:02:28,600
And now we have a range from 1 to 25.

42

00:02:29,130  -->  00:02:34,920
So our final solution is to roll the dice twice checked the manipulator range from 1 to 25.

43

00:02:35,190  -->  00:02:39,140
And if it's greater than 21 just like within the last problem do it reroll.

44

00:02:39,150  -->  00:02:42,200
So let's see how this would look like coded out.

45

00:02:42,570  -->  00:02:46,500
We have a function which produces that random integer between 1 and 5.

46

00:02:46,500  -->  00:02:50,400
So dice 5 returns a random integer between 1 and 5.

47

00:02:50,410  -->  00:02:52,280
Now we have a conversion function.

48

00:02:52,470  -->  00:02:57,040
So we have a while true and this is so we constantly keep rerolling.

49

00:02:57,060  -->  00:03:00,550
If we roll out of range then we roll the dice twice.

50

00:03:00,660  -->  00:03:05,570
We'll call roll one our first roll roll to our second rule.

51

00:03:05,700  -->  00:03:06,070
All right.

52

00:03:06,120  -->  00:03:08,690
I have a print statement here that you can check out yourself.

53

00:03:08,730  -->  00:03:12,070
It's commented out but this may help you understand what we're actually doing.

54

00:03:12,420  -->  00:03:19,020
Then we're going to convert these two rolls into something on the range of 1 to 25.

55

00:03:19,020  -->  00:03:20,500
So how do we do that.

56

00:03:20,790  -->  00:03:25,930
We can take our first roll value so Track 1 from it and then multiply that by five.

57

00:03:26,010  -->  00:03:29,150
That gives us a range from 1 to 20.

58

00:03:29,640  -->  00:03:38,290
Then we're going to roll the second dice once and that automatically gives you range from 1 to 5.

59

00:03:38,430  -->  00:03:44,160
And then you can print that converted range by summing them together 1 to 25.

60

00:03:44,160  -->  00:03:50,100
So here you have 1 through 5 and here you actually have zero through 20 excuse me because if you're

61

00:03:50,100  -->  00:03:53,660
all a one you can subtract one from it in zero times five at zero.

62

00:03:54,000  -->  00:03:59,510
So this portion on your first roll is converted to a number that falls between 0 and 20.

63

00:03:59,790  -->  00:04:03,540
And this one it gets converted to a number that falls between 1 and 5.

64

00:04:03,670  -->  00:04:07,680
Summing those together you have a range of 1 to 25.

65

00:04:07,680  -->  00:04:14,820
Since we're only considering 6:59 simulation will say if the number is greater than 21 reroll just like

66

00:04:14,820  -->  00:04:21,990
we did in the last one and then we can finally just use mod 7 plus 1 to get that conversion since 1

67

00:04:22,010  -->  00:04:24,690
321 is evenly divisible.

68

00:04:24,750  -->  00:04:28,140
Or excuse me since 21 is evenly divisible by 7.

69

00:04:28,330  -->  00:04:30,480
Can just made by 7 and add 1.

70

00:04:30,510  -->  00:04:33,970
So basically break up 1 through 21 into chunks.

71

00:04:34,230  -->  00:04:34,790
OK.

72

00:04:34,940  -->  00:04:38,390
So make sure you check out this solution.

73

00:04:38,390  -->  00:04:42,430
It helps if you write it out by hand or add a print statements in here.

74

00:04:42,510  -->  00:04:44,530
But that's really all there is to it.

75

00:04:44,550  -->  00:04:44,890
All right.

76

00:04:44,910  -->  00:04:48,320
Make sure you review it and understand it and I'll see what the next solution.

77

00:04:48,330  -->  00:04:50,030
Thanks everyone.
