Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview question.

2

00:00:03,330  -->  00:00:08,540
This one is to implement a depth first search algorithm or DSF.

3

00:00:08,820  -->  00:00:14,670
So again for this you can assume the graph is in a simplified form of and it basically in a simplified

4

00:00:14,670  -->  00:00:19,550
adjacency list where you have the node and then a set of the nodes it's connected to.

5

00:00:19,940  -->  00:00:21,990
OK that's all there is to it.

6

00:00:22,050  -->  00:00:26,780
You can go ahead and reference the previous implementation lectures for the solution.

7

00:00:26,850  -->  00:00:28,710
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
