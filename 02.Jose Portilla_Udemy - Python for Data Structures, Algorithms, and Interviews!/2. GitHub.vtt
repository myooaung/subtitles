00:00:01.350  -->  00:00:04.410
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on get.

2

00:00:04.710  -->  00:00:10.670
Now we're going to discuss what it is and how you can use it as a job search tool.

3

00:00:10.680  -->  00:00:17.520
We won't go over how to use it but we'll send you the proper links on how to learn and get training

4

00:00:17.660  -->  00:00:18.320
.

5

00:00:19.470  -->  00:00:27.320
So first thing we want to know is that get g i t is an open source version control software used to

6

00:00:27.330  -->  00:00:37.050
track changes in the code get and get up are two separate things get GHC is open source software that

7

00:00:37.080  -->  00:00:45.660
anyone in the world can download github is a company and it's a service hub is a web based get repository

8

00:00:45.660  -->  00:00:53.200
hosting service so you can host your own code and github for free and keep track of changes to it.

9

00:00:53.280  -->  00:01:00.510
So you use get as version control to keep track of changes and if you want to host code online you can

10

00:01:00.510  -->  00:01:07.470
use get Hub's service and it's free as long as you're repositories the actual place keeping your code

11

00:01:07.790  -->  00:01:08.800
is public.

12

00:01:08.910  -->  00:01:12.990
You need to pay the company get Herb for private repositories.

13

00:01:13.380  -->  00:01:15.210
And so that's how it makes her money.

14

00:01:15.360  -->  00:01:20.640
So even though both get and the basics of github for public repositories is free if you don't have a

15

00:01:20.640  -->  00:01:28.130
private repository on the web you need to pay hub most open source projects have moved to github.

16

00:01:28.740  -->  00:01:29.430
All right.

17

00:01:29.730  -->  00:01:37.560
So moving along if you don't have a hub profile yet your next step is to go to get a car and create

18

00:01:37.620  -->  00:01:39.210
a profile.

19

00:01:39.210  -->  00:01:42.570
Let's go ahead and jump to hub dot com so we can see what it looks like.

20

00:01:42.570  -->  00:01:44.030
Real quick.

21

00:01:44.140  -->  00:01:47.200
Sure sure take you here to have them come.

22

00:01:47.250  -->  00:01:52.420
You pick the user name the T.M. create a password and sign up for it.

23

00:01:53.130  -->  00:01:53.580
All right.

24

00:01:53.580  -->  00:02:00.720
So once you've done that you can also download get a desktop and it's a way for you to use a graphical

25

00:02:00.720  -->  00:02:04.110
user interface to help contribute to projects.

26

00:02:04.320  -->  00:02:11.460
And you can do things such as create branches make changes do commits and deploy or from a native interface

27

00:02:11.460  -->  00:02:14.350
regardless of what system you're using.

28

00:02:14.370  -->  00:02:19.950
So even if you don't understand what these terms mean you'll probably be asked to download get a desktop

29

00:02:20.460  -->  00:02:22.460
and if you're not familiar github at all.

30

00:02:22.500  -->  00:02:25.290
I'd definitely recommend downloading it.

31

00:02:25.290  -->  00:02:25.830
All right.

32

00:02:26.100  -->  00:02:31.860
So I'm going to go back to the presentation real quick if you're interested in learning more about gets

33

00:02:31.860  -->  00:02:34.830
and github which I highly recommend you do.

34

00:02:34.830  -->  00:02:40.910
Most companies use getting hub as their version control software.

35

00:02:40.920  -->  00:02:45.210
There's two really great guides that get herbed themselves provide.

36

00:02:45.210  -->  00:02:49.830
These guys are so good that it's really not worth for me to try to teach you.

37

00:02:49.860  -->  00:02:56.410
Since these guys do an excellent job of teaching you the basics of getting hurt and how to use it.

38

00:02:56.550  -->  00:02:59.250
So start with this link guides.

39

00:02:59.390  -->  00:03:02.220
Hodak com such activities slushed Hello world.

40

00:03:02.280  -->  00:03:07.920
And once you've done that then continue onto this training web site which is also provided by Kit github

41

00:03:08.370  -->  00:03:09.140
.

42

00:03:09.420  -->  00:03:13.380
These two links are really fantastic they're provided by get themselves.

43

00:03:13.500  -->  00:03:16.680
They're constantly updated in case there's a change in their platform.

44

00:03:16.770  -->  00:03:23.620
So that's why I'm suggesting you go to these two core learning how to use get in the hub.

45

00:03:23.700  -->  00:03:29.010
So if we just check out these links real quick they'll look something like this.

46

00:03:29.010  -->  00:03:30.390
So this is the hello world.

47

00:03:30.600  -->  00:03:35.200
Takes about 10 minutes to read we'll teach you how to create a repository.

48

00:03:35.430  -->  00:03:41.270
Open an issue create a branch make a commit and then open a request and merge poor requests.

49

00:03:41.520  -->  00:03:42.900
So go through this.

50

00:03:42.900  -->  00:03:48.630
It's really great and it's probably the best introduction online how to use get and get Herb which makes

51

00:03:48.630  -->  00:03:54.500
sense because it's provided by hub themselves something else I want you to know.

52

00:03:54.540  -->  00:03:56.580
There's actually video guides.

53

00:03:56.580  -->  00:04:03.660
So if you look over here at the top right you'll see a link to click excuse me video guys.

54

00:04:03.690  -->  00:04:09.050
And if you click that it'll take you to their YouTube channel here on a home.

55

00:04:09.420  -->  00:04:16.650
And if you go to videos you'll see here there is an intro to get her on get her and get foundations

56

00:04:16.650  -->  00:04:17.130
.

57

00:04:17.130  -->  00:04:22.350
You can go in and check those out if you want with video explanations on how to go about learning the

58

00:04:22.350  -->  00:04:24.670
basics and foundations get in get.

59

00:04:24.990  -->  00:04:27.520
It's all free and it's all provided at home.

60

00:04:27.690  -->  00:04:30.360
So I really recommend you check that out.

61

00:04:30.380  -->  00:04:34.990
It's pretty much the best way to learn it and how to use it.

62

00:04:35.130  -->  00:04:43.110
One other link I want you to be aware of is the training link so you can use these four simple slides

63

00:04:43.770  -->  00:04:48.210
on learning on how to use get heard and teaching other people how to use get help.

64

00:04:48.210  -->  00:04:52.050
So there are just basic slides teaching the basics of the hub.

65

00:04:52.590  -->  00:04:57.990
So again really recommend a checkup the hello world documents and if you want video guides click on

66

00:04:57.990  -->  00:05:03.630
the top right take it to their YouTube channel and they have plenty of information on the basics and

67

00:05:03.630  -->  00:05:12.140
they also have advanced factors to learn about and get going back to the presentation quickly.

68

00:05:12.750  -->  00:05:19.650
As far as what where it fits into this overall larger picture of your job search you should make sure

69

00:05:19.650  -->  00:05:25.260
to post personal projects that use code to get her as long as you don't mind them being public and have

70

00:05:25.260  -->  00:05:26.090
them be present.

71

00:05:26.090  -->  00:05:27.660
You've read me files.

72

00:05:27.660  -->  00:05:28.800
You don't know what those are yet.

73

00:05:28.920  -->  00:05:31.800
Don't worry after you do the training you will.

74

00:05:31.950  -->  00:05:36.150
Recruiters sometimes look at hub for potential hires so they may search.

75

00:05:36.150  -->  00:05:44.550
Get help for certain software packages or certain modules or libraries in a language and see what users

76

00:05:44.580  -->  00:05:46.590
have projects in those languages.

77

00:05:46.590  -->  00:05:54.650
So it's pretty important to have a good hub presence and github also has its own job search tool.

78

00:05:54.690  -->  00:06:00.190
So go ahead and hop and check that out real quickly that job search tool looks awfully like this job

79

00:06:00.210  -->  00:06:05.520
Stockett have them come and similar to the Linked-In job search tool we just saw.

80

00:06:05.820  -->  00:06:09.100
You can enter jobs scription in a location and then search.

81

00:06:09.360  -->  00:06:17.880
Obviously since this is a hub it's pretty much directly directed exclusively to programmers or things

82

00:06:18.360  -->  00:06:20.760
that have to do of programming.

83

00:06:20.760  -->  00:06:21.460
All right.

84

00:06:21.750  -->  00:06:27.000
So that's going to be it's you're just going to be left with a homework assignment to complete.

85

00:06:27.180  -->  00:06:34.290
So it's going to check that out is your homework assignment is this you need to create a hub accounts

86

00:06:35.230  -->  00:06:37.050
for the hello world tutorial.

87

00:06:37.110  -->  00:06:41.200
If you're not familiar if get to it hub that will take about 10 minutes.

88

00:06:41.250  -->  00:06:45.580
Then check out the basics of training link or check up those training videos on YouTube.

89

00:06:45.810  -->  00:06:48.580
That should only take about 10 to 20 minutes.

90

00:06:48.930  -->  00:06:53.550
Then for an interesting project on it you'll learn what a fork is.

91

00:06:53.550  -->  00:06:58.070
After doing the hello world tutorial and then push some code to get help.

92

00:06:58.560  -->  00:06:59.390
And that's it.

93

00:06:59.400  -->  00:07:00.600
That's your homework.

94

00:07:00.600  -->  00:07:06.600
Basically that should give you the ins and outs of her accounts and as you move on throughout this course

95

00:07:06.990  -->  00:07:13.140
you'll learn how get her can be used for your personal projects and creating a good web presence.

96

00:07:13.140  -->  00:07:13.800
All right.

97

00:07:14.010  -->  00:07:15.310
That's it for this lecture.

98

00:07:15.510  -->  00:07:16.410
Thanks everyone.

99

00:07:16.410  -->  00:07:17.460
I'll see you at the next lecture
