Hello everyone and welcome to the stack queues and deques section of this course.

2

00:00:06,690  -->  00:00:11,470
So in this section of the course we're going to be learning about three main linear structures stack

3

00:00:11,780  -->  00:00:17,820
queues and decks and they're similar to arrays but each of these structures differs by how it adds and

4

00:00:17,820  -->  00:00:19,130
removes items.

5

00:00:19,200  -->  00:00:25,470
So that's going to be the key difference between all of these linear structures in this section as far

6

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:27,320
as the theory portions.

7

00:00:27,330  -->  00:00:32,580
We're going to have a brief overview of what linear structures are then an overview of stacks.

8

00:00:32,610  -->  00:00:36,720
We're going to have an implementation of a stack class and then we're going to do the same thing for

9

00:00:36,730  -->  00:00:41,470
queues and decks both an overview and an implementation of both of them.

10

00:00:42,130  -->  00:00:42,810
OK.

11

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:45,180
With that being said let's go ahead and get started.

12

00:00:45,270  -->  00:00:49,950
The next lecture we're going to go have an overview of Stack's theory and how they work.

13

00:00:49,950  -->  00:00:51,150
All right thanks everyone.

14

00:00:51,150  -->  00:00:52,170
I'll see if next lecture
