Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview question for this interview question I want you to

2

00:00:05,490  -->  00:00:11,820
implement a breath first search algorithm or a DFS algorithm and you can assume that the graph is in

3

00:00:11,820  -->  00:00:19,210
the simplified form where you have the node and then the set of connected notes here.

4

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:22,420
So it's basically a very simplified adjacency list.

5

00:00:22,770  -->  00:00:24,780
OK that's it.

6

00:00:24,780  -->  00:00:30,810
Go ahead and refer to the FS lectures in case you need to see the implementation.

00:00:30,810  -->  00:00:32,340
Thanks and I'll see the next lecture
