Hello everyone and welcome to your first interview question for this section of the Course.

2

00:00:06,440  -->  00:00:11,310
Your first answer to your question is just a common interview question and that question is just implement

3

00:00:11,370  -->  00:00:12,280
a stack.

4

00:00:12,720  -->  00:00:17,260
So you're going to have to try your best implements your own stack class objects.

5

00:00:17,640  -->  00:00:22,580
So it should be able to do the following methods check if it's empty.

6

00:00:22,650  -->  00:00:26,700
Push an item to the stack pop an item to the stack.

7

00:00:26,700  -->  00:00:30,960
Take a peek at that top item and then return the size stack.

8

00:00:30,960  -->  00:00:36,250
Keep in mind how a stack works while you work through your weight and your implementation.

9

00:00:36,270  -->  00:00:42,600
Try not to look at the implementation lecture until you've given it a fair shot on your own.

10

00:00:42,630  -->  00:00:43,410
All right.

11

00:00:43,410  -->  00:00:48,120
There won't be a solution lecture associated with this because we already did an implementation of a

12

00:00:48,120  -->  00:00:49,480
stack earlier.

13

00:00:49,530  -->  00:00:51,430
Go ahead and check that previous lecture.

14

00:00:51,540  -->  00:00:53,610
If you want the solution to this one.

15

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:56,420
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
