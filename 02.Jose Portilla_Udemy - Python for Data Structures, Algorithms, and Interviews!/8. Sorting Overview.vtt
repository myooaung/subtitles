Hello everyone and welcome to the sorting.

2

00:00:04.040  -->  00:00:06.490
Half of this section of the course.

3

00:00:06.600  -->  00:00:13.290
So we've already discussed how to search for items and now we're going to discuss how to sort data structures

4

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:15.380
specifically in Python.

5

00:00:15.570  -->  00:00:19.220
But these algorithms are used in all languages.

6

00:00:19.380  -->  00:00:25.800
So in this section we're going to be discussing six main algorithms used commonly in computer science

7

00:00:25.800  -->  00:00:31.740
for sorting and it's going to consist of explanations of how the algorithms work and we're also going

8

00:00:31.740  -->  00:00:34.540
to be implementing these algorithms in Python.

9

00:00:34.860  -->  00:00:42.810
Specifically we'll be discussing about the bubble selection insertion shell merge and quicksort.

10

00:00:42.990  -->  00:00:49.200
So to put this in a little bit of context a common interview questions consist of being asked to implement

11

00:00:49.200  -->  00:00:52.070
a sorting algorithm in real life.

12

00:00:52.080  -->  00:00:56.880
You'll probably never have to implement your own sorting algorithms since the best ones are already

13

00:00:57.030  -->  00:01:00.600
built in to the programming language of your choice.

14

00:01:00.930  -->  00:01:05.010
So in this lecture we're going to focus on the context of being asked to implement a sorting algorithm

15

00:01:05.040  -->  00:01:06.640
in an interview setting.

16

00:01:07.200  -->  00:01:13.020
Lectures are going to focus on three things a verbal explanation a visual explanation and a full implementation

17

00:01:13.170  -->  00:01:16.220
of the sorting algorithm discussed in that lecture.

18

00:01:16.650  -->  00:01:17.410
All right.

19

00:01:17.730  -->  00:01:19.830
Before that being said let's go ahead and get started.

20

00:01:19.830  -->  00:01:24.420
Our first algorithm for soring we're going to learn about is bubble sort I'll see the next lecture
