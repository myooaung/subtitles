Hello everyone and welcome to your last riddle.

2

00:00:04,470  -->  00:00:06,470
This one's called the ropes burning.

3

00:00:06,840  -->  00:00:08,520
Here's the problem statement.

4

00:00:08,640  -->  00:00:13,680
You're given two ropes each takes exactly 60 minutes to burn.

5

00:00:13,680  -->  00:00:15,520
However they're made of different material.

6

00:00:15,540  -->  00:00:20,280
So even though they take the same amount of time to burn they burn at separate rates.

7

00:00:20,400  -->  00:00:23,880
And in addition each rope burns inconsistently.

8

00:00:23,880  -->  00:00:29,110
So how can you measure out exactly 45 minutes.

9

00:00:29,130  -->  00:00:35,910
So for instance to give you an example if you had to measure out 120 minutes you would just burn one

10

00:00:35,910  -->  00:00:37,220
rope at one end.

11

00:00:37,260  -->  00:00:42,480
Wait 60 Minutes for it to fully burn then once it finished burning you would notice start the other

12

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:47,070
rope at one end burn it and then you'd have measured out 120 minutes.

13

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:54,240
But a much more challenging question is how do you measure exactly 45 minutes given that they burn in

14

00:00:54,240  -->  00:00:57,350
separate rates and they burn inconsistently.

15

00:00:57,390  -->  00:00:58,350
All right.

16

00:00:58,350  -->  00:01:00,660
Best of luck everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
