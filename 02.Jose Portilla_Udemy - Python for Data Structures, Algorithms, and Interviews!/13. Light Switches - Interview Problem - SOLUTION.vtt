Hello everyone and welcome to the solution to the light switches riddle.

2

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:09.830
So this is the one I noticed that it was a bit of a trick question.

3

00:00:09.840  -->  00:00:14.970
So hopefully you don't get asked this type of question in an interview since it's not really math or

4

00:00:14.970  -->  00:00:16.550
logic base.

5

00:00:16.620  -->  00:00:22.110
The solution is to realize that you can leave an incandescent light bulb on for a while until it heats

6

00:00:22.110  -->  00:00:22.800
up.

7

00:00:22.800  -->  00:00:26.320
That's the real trick or gotcha to this sort of riddle.

8

00:00:26.340  -->  00:00:32.310
So I personally think would be unfair to be asked this question in an interview setting but once you

9

00:00:32.310  -->  00:00:35.160
figure out that fact here's the solution.

10

00:00:35.340  -->  00:00:41.220
The solution is a TURN ON switch one and then wait for 15 minutes until that corresponding bulb in the

11

00:00:41.220  -->  00:00:42.780
other room is hot.

12

00:00:42.780  -->  00:00:46.690
Then turn it off and turn on switch to then head to the room.

13

00:00:46.980  -->  00:00:53.600
Then you know that the bulb which is hot off corresponds to switch one the bulb which is on corresponds

14

00:00:53.600  -->  00:00:59.650
a switch to and the bulb which is off and cold corresponds to switch 3.

15

00:00:59.730  -->  00:01:04.860
So that was the real trick realizing that you could keep us light switch on for a while wait for one

16

00:01:04.860  -->  00:01:09.930
of the light bulbs to heat up then turn it off turn on the second switch walked to the room and then

17

00:01:09.930  -->  00:01:12.390
you can correspond to the switches.

18

00:01:12.390  -->  00:01:13.000
All right.

19

00:01:13.110  -->  00:01:14.940
That's it for this problem again.

20

00:01:15.090  -->  00:01:20.040
I think it's an unfair question but who knows maybe it might be asked something like this in an interview

21

00:01:20.040  -->  00:01:20.790
.

22

00:01:20.790  -->  00:01:22.560
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
