00:00:00.720  -->  00:00:04.020
This is the technical section overview lecture.

2

00:00:04.080  -->  00:00:07.230
Welcome to the technical section of this course in this lecture.

3

00:00:07.230  -->  00:00:13.120
We're just going to be giving you an overview of what to expect for the second half of this course.

4

00:00:13.350  -->  00:00:18.120
The next section is called Introduction to Jupiter notebooks and covers the materials and installation

5

00:00:18.120  -->  00:00:19.230
of Python.

6

00:00:19.650  -->  00:00:24.780
We'll tell you how to access the notebooks that correspond to all the technical video lectures as well

7

00:00:24.780  -->  00:00:30.050
as giving you an overview of how best to use the Jupiter notebook system for programming and learning

8

00:00:33.000  -->  00:00:35.720
as far as the actual technical sections topics.

9

00:00:35.720  -->  00:00:44.580
They are algorithm analysis and Big O notation array sequences stacks queue's index linked lists recursion

10

00:00:45.120  -->  00:00:53.850
trees searching and sorting algorithms Grath algorithms and riddles or brainteaser type questions.

11

00:00:54.120  -->  00:00:58.560
Each of those sections usually starts with a presentation on the theory of the topic.

12

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:04.520
Then we do some hands on implementations of those data structures or algorithms.

13

00:01:04.560  -->  00:01:10.380
After that we'll do some interview practice problems presented to you and then walk through of the solutions

14

00:01:10.410  -->  00:01:13.560
to those interview problems.

15

00:01:13.920  -->  00:01:17.850
After all those topics are presented we'll have mock interview sections.

16

00:01:17.850  -->  00:01:24.240
There are several mock interviews with questions designed to simulate an interview at a real tech company

17

00:01:24.240  -->  00:01:26.430
.

18

00:01:26.490  -->  00:01:31.110
The section outlines are reviewed along the way so don't worry about having to memorize everything we

19

00:01:31.110  -->  00:01:33.130
just covered in this lecture.

20

00:01:33.130  -->  00:01:37.510
Information getting technical help and disclosure on discussion questions are coming up next.

21

00:01:37.510  -->  00:01:40.220
For the technical break section.

22

00:01:40.230  -->  00:01:43.470
Best of luck on all the interview problems and let's go ahead and get started.

23

00:01:43.530  -->  00:01:45.600
The technical section of this course.

24

00:01:45.600  -->  00:01:47.160
Thanks everyone.
