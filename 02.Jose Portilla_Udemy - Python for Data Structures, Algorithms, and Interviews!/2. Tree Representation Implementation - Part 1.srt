Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on tree representation implementation.

2

00:00:07,150  -->  00:00:11,510
So in this lecture we're going to implement a tree as a list of lists.

3

00:00:11,550  -->  00:00:15,240
So this is probably the simplest way you can implement a tree in Python.

4

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:19,860
It's not going to be the standard way of implementing a tree we'll learn about nodes and references

5

00:00:20,040  -->  00:00:21,240
in a subsequent lecture.

6

00:00:21,300  -->  00:00:25,940
Right now just want to get a basic idea of how we could represent a tree in Python.

7

00:00:26,630  -->  00:00:32,740
So in a list of lists tree we're going to store the value of the root node as the first element of a

8

00:00:32,730  -->  00:00:33,670
list.

9

00:00:33,840  -->  00:00:39,210
Then the second element of that list will actually be a list itself that represents the left subtree

10

00:00:39,220  -->  00:00:39,440
.

11

00:00:39,810  -->  00:00:41,120
And that third element.

12

00:00:41,130  -->  00:00:42,740
So it's going to be index too.

13

00:00:42,780  -->  00:00:46,800
Remember you have 0 1 2 since the axing starts at zero.

14

00:00:46,860  -->  00:00:53,700
So that third element index 2 of that list will be another list that represents the right subtree.

15

00:00:53,700  -->  00:01:00,150
So for instance if you have a tree like this you can represent as a list of lists here a is at index

16

00:01:00,150  -->  00:01:07,460
0 that's your roots and the notice at index 1 of this main trialist you have B.

17

00:01:07,800  -->  00:01:12,900
And then again you have a list of lists representing trees and notice say you have these empty sublists

18

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:18,840
here since D E and F don't actually have any children of their own.

19

00:01:19,270  -->  00:01:19,870
OK.

20

00:01:20,280  -->  00:01:22,500
So that's what we're going to be implementing.

21

00:01:22,500  -->  00:01:24,260
So let's go ahead and get started
