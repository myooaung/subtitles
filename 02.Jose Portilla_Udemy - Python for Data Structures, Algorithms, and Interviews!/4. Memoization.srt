Hello everyone and welcome to the memo ization lecture.

2

00:00:05,460  -->  00:00:08,910
Now I know in the previous lecture I said that interview problems were next.

3

00:00:08,910  -->  00:00:15,300
But I wanted to make you aware of the topic memoization and this lecture which is actually going to

4

00:00:15,300  -->  00:00:18,710
be mostly a homework reading assignment that I want you to be aware of.

5

00:00:18,990  -->  00:00:25,620
So if you're in the Jupiter and B viewers under the recursion folder there's a python notebook called

6

00:00:25,680  -->  00:00:33,100
memoization the I P Y and B you can go out and click it will take you to this lecture here.

7

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:39,840
And what I want you to do is before reading the notebook itself go ahead and click the link to the Wikipedia

8

00:00:39,900  -->  00:00:42,600
article on minimization.

9

00:00:42,720  -->  00:00:43,870
Give it a read through.

10

00:00:43,970  -->  00:00:52,260
It's actually quite good as an overview in the pseudo code is very reminiscent of Python code so you

11

00:00:52,260  -->  00:00:53,900
should have no problem reading it.

12

00:00:54,030  -->  00:00:59,960
And it uses the factorial example that we used earlier to explain memorize zation.

13

00:01:00,300  -->  00:01:08,670
And it turns the example we use which was recursive using a memorized version of the factorial function

14

00:01:08,670  -->  00:01:09,330
.

15

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:15,470
So go ahead and take a look at that Bill line up perfectly with the factorial example we showed earlier

16

00:01:16,470  -->  00:01:21,570
and go ahead and you can also read about automatic minimization which we discuss a little bit at the

17

00:01:21,570  -->  00:01:23,180
end of the notebook.

18

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:29,160
But what I really want you to focus on is this first section of the overview for that article.

19

00:01:29,160  -->  00:01:35,490
Once you're done reading that come back and then take a look at a coded example of the same factorial

20

00:01:35,490  -->  00:01:38,820
problem using Python.

21

00:01:39,260  -->  00:01:41,040
OK that's it.

22

00:01:41,040  -->  00:01:46,890
Only one or two of the recursion interview problems will actually need memorization.

23

00:01:46,920  -->  00:01:53,130
I believe it's actually just one memoization with recursion.

24

00:01:53,160  -->  00:01:58,070
It's sometimes known as dynamic programming or at least a type of dynamic programming.

25

00:01:58,260  -->  00:02:00,460
So I want you to be aware of that.

26

00:02:00,510  -->  00:02:05,520
So I would recommend that you read that article and go through this lecture before heading into the

27

00:02:05,520  -->  00:02:06,770
interview problems.

28

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:10,060
But it's actually not necessary to tackle the first interview problems.

29

00:02:10,080  -->  00:02:17,170
First you'll see a warning or a note or  hints that will lead you to read the memorization lecture.

30

00:02:17,430  -->  00:02:22,770
If in case the recursion interview problem requires it or is just the better solution to solve it using

31

00:02:22,770  -->  00:02:24,200
that technique.

32

00:02:24,210  -->  00:02:26,070
All right so that's it.

33

00:02:26,070  -->  00:02:28,640
This is mostly just the reading assignment lecture.

34

00:02:28,650  -->  00:02:34,050
So go ahead and read that Wikipedia article Overview section and then go through this python notebook

35

00:02:34,080  -->  00:02:35,880
or Jupiter notebook.

36

00:02:35,880  -->  00:02:37,650
All right thanks everyone.

37

00:02:37,650  -->  00:02:43,380
And the next lecture Well we're actually going to be doing is going over the recursion into real problems

38

00:02:43,440  -->  00:02:45,110
and the solution.

39

00:02:45,210  -->  00:02:45,740
OK.

40

00:02:45,830  -->  00:02:47,280
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
