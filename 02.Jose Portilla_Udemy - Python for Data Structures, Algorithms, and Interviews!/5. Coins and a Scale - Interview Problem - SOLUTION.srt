Hello everyone and welcome to the solution to the coins and skill problem.

2

00:00:05,820  -->  00:00:10,540
So here's how we go about finding a solution to finding the heavy coin.

3

00:00:10,710  -->  00:00:11,270
You begin.

4

00:00:11,310  -->  00:00:14,970
You begin by dividing the coins into two groups of three.

5

00:00:15,300  -->  00:00:21,490
And then you have two coins extra set aside so you have three three and two.

6

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:27,300
So out of the two groups of three you grab them both and put them on the scale.

7

00:00:27,300  -->  00:00:29,950
One group of two has been left off.

8

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:36,480
So if the two sides weigh the same the three and three then you already know the heavy coin is in the

9

00:00:36,480  -->  00:00:37,510
group of two.

10

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:40,060
And then you just find that out with one more way.

11

00:00:40,350  -->  00:00:42,820
That's a total of two ways there.

12

00:00:42,900  -->  00:00:47,790
On the other hand if when you put the original two groups of three on the scale if either side of the

13

00:00:47,790  -->  00:00:51,630
scales heavier than you know the heavy coin must be in that group of three.

14

00:00:52,050  -->  00:00:57,630
So you can eliminate all the other coins and then place one coin from this group on either side of the

15

00:00:57,630  -->  00:01:02,240
scale leaving the third coin aside if one side is heavier.

16

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:03,930
It contains the heavy coin.

17

00:01:04,020  -->  00:01:08,600
If neither side is heavier and there even then the heavy coin is the one that you actually didn't play

18

00:01:08,670  -->  00:01:10,070
on the scale.

19

00:01:10,110  -->  00:01:12,310
So this is a total of two weighings as well.

20

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:17,700
So you can always find the heavy coin in a group of eight just using two weighings.

21

00:01:18,270  -->  00:01:20,430
Draw out the solution in case you didn't get it.

22

00:01:20,430  -->  00:01:22,700
But it's relatively simple.

23

00:01:22,830  -->  00:01:29,670
Key to this is by making sure you were thinking outside of the box a bit and not being caught on the

24

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:32,010
fact that there's only two pans.

25

00:01:32,010  -->  00:01:35,310
So you can actually divide the coins into more than just two groups.

26

00:01:35,310  -->  00:01:37,310
That's the real key to this quest.

27

00:01:37,650  -->  00:01:40,350
OK everyone thanks and I'll see at the next lecture
