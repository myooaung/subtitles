00:00:01,650  -->  00:00:05,700
Hello everyone and welcome to the tough interview questions lecture.

2

00:00:06,210  -->  00:00:10,370
So some non technical questions can actually be pretty tricky to answer.

3

00:00:10,560  -->  00:00:16,210
But we're going to do is prepare for a rundown of them and talk about general response strategies.

4

00:00:16,260  -->  00:00:20,100
So overall strategy should be demonstrate your ability to create.

5

00:00:20,220  -->  00:00:25,920
Use real examples from the past and show how you'll fit into the company's culture.

6

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:30,750
So we're going to do just get some general practice what you'll see is a bunch of slides of questions

7

00:00:30,750  -->  00:00:33,850
on them and for each question after we ask it.

8

00:00:33,900  -->  00:00:38,120
Go ahead and pause the video and then attempt to answer it afterwards.

9

00:00:38,130  -->  00:00:42,280
Play the video and then listen to some general response strategies.

10

00:00:43,080  -->  00:00:45,500
So your first question is tell me about yourself.

11

00:00:45,780  -->  00:00:49,130
Go ahead and post the video now and try to answer the question.

12

00:00:50,040  -->  00:00:50,630
OK.

13

00:00:51,060  -->  00:00:52,620
So hopefully you're tempted to answer.

14

00:00:52,620  -->  00:00:55,680
Tell me about yourself some general strategies.

15

00:00:55,680  -->  00:00:58,710
First off this is one of the first questions you're going to encounter.

16

00:00:58,710  -->  00:01:04,860
It tests for composure communication skills and ability to develop some sort of rapport with the interviewer

17

00:01:04,860  -->  00:01:05,450
.

18

00:01:05,640  -->  00:01:11,880
Prepare a 60 second script which breaks the ice in the first 30 seconds of an overview of your achievements

19

00:01:12,570  -->  00:01:17,130
and then the second half should include mention of your recent professional or academic accomplishments

20

00:01:17,490  -->  00:01:20,430
to enhance how good of a candidate you are.

21

00:01:20,430  -->  00:01:26,340
So again just a brief personal background overview include your academic background if you're a recent

22

00:01:26,340  -->  00:01:32,030
student or some key accomplishments or credentials depending on the type position and your experience

23

00:01:32,880  -->  00:01:37,710
and then you also want to include the most impressive or at differentiating strengths that will resonate

24

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:39,380
with the interviewer.

25

00:01:39,420  -->  00:01:44,570
Next question why are you leaving your current position.

26

00:01:44,580  -->  00:01:49,130
Go ahead and pause the video and come back to it once you're done answering.

27

00:01:50,520  -->  00:01:51,190
All right.

28

00:01:51,480  -->  00:01:57,720
So this question the interviewers probing for some sort of dissatisfaction or this content he or she

29

00:01:57,720  -->  00:02:02,670
wants to see if you will speak negatively about your employer or supervisor and this question really

30

00:02:02,670  -->  00:02:04,560
tests your character and ambition.

31

00:02:04,560  -->  00:02:09,330
So point is regardless of the reasons you're seeking the new position.

32

00:02:09,330  -->  00:02:11,850
Always remain positive and don't complain.

33

00:02:11,850  -->  00:02:14,770
Demonstrate that you have the vision of your future.

34

00:02:14,790  -->  00:02:18,830
Emphasize that your departure will be professional in any setting.

35

00:02:19,140  -->  00:02:23,640
So the key message you want to convey here is that you're sitting in front of the interviewer and considering

36

00:02:23,640  -->  00:02:25,900
leaving because you want to grow.

37

00:02:26,010  -->  00:02:30,990
You want more responsibility and growth opportunities and that's why you're leaving your current position

38

00:02:31,010  -->  00:02:31,560
.

39

00:02:32,100  -->  00:02:32,600
OK.

40

00:02:32,720  -->  00:02:35,620
Let's go ahead and go to the next question.

41

00:02:35,760  -->  00:02:37,880
Why do you want this position.

42

00:02:37,950  -->  00:02:41,990
Go ahead and pass a video now in answer the question.

43

00:02:42,270  -->  00:02:42,820
All right.

44

00:02:42,870  -->  00:02:44,020
Why do you want this position.

45

00:02:44,060  -->  00:02:47,230
It's going to be another common but tough interview question.

46

00:02:47,340  -->  00:02:50,610
The answer here will vary depending on the position and the company.

47

00:02:50,610  -->  00:02:55,500
But what you really want to come across as someone with desire commitment passion toward your career

48

00:02:55,500  -->  00:02:59,000
goals that's going to be really important to the hiring manager.

49

00:02:59,370  -->  00:03:04,210
So your confidence in answering this question should come from knowing capabilities desires and goals

50

00:03:04,220  -->  00:03:04,420
.

51

00:03:04,680  -->  00:03:09,780
The sort of self-assurance comes across in an interview in your voice and body language in addition

52

00:03:09,780  -->  00:03:11,910
to the actual content of your answers.

53

00:03:11,910  -->  00:03:13,090
Confidence is everything.

54

00:03:13,080  -->  00:03:13,810
With this question.

55

00:03:13,890  -->  00:03:15,310
So remember that.

56

00:03:15,890  -->  00:03:18,780
OK let's move on to the next question.

57

00:03:18,780  -->  00:03:21,010
Where do you see yourself in five years.

58

00:03:21,010  -->  00:03:21,980
Has the video now.

59

00:03:22,110  -->  00:03:25,550
And answer the question OK.

60

00:03:25,950  -->  00:03:31,770
So was this sort of question the interviewer wants to see how you envision your future evidence that

61

00:03:31,770  -->  00:03:37,010
supports the fact that high achievers are also people who have defined goals for themselves.

62

00:03:37,080  -->  00:03:41,820
So the interviewer also wants to see how realistic your objectives are and how well they mesh with the

63

00:03:41,820  -->  00:03:43,190
company's goal.

64

00:03:43,260  -->  00:03:45,050
So just keep that in mind.

65

00:03:45,840  -->  00:03:48,600
Let's go ahead and go to the next question.

66

00:03:48,600  -->  00:03:49,480
Here's a tough one.

67

00:03:49,500  -->  00:03:51,360
What's your greatest weakness.

68

00:03:51,360  -->  00:03:52,940
Go ahead and post a video now.

69

00:03:52,950  -->  00:03:55,340
In answer to a question.

70

00:03:55,650  -->  00:03:56,280
All right.

71

00:03:56,280  -->  00:04:01,110
So this is one of the weirder and tougher questions and actually personally think it's a pretty poor

72

00:04:01,470  -->  00:04:06,360
indicator of how well someone will do in your company's culture but you should be prepared to answer

73

00:04:06,360  -->  00:04:08,970
it because it's a common interview question.

74

00:04:09,510  -->  00:04:14,250
The general strategy for this question is to turn this question around and discuss an area that needs

75

00:04:14,340  -->  00:04:15,390
improvement.

76

00:04:15,570  -->  00:04:17,940
That's not just an outright weakness.

77

00:04:17,940  -->  00:04:22,330
Then you're going to want to demonstrate that you're doing something to improve in that area.

78

00:04:22,650  -->  00:04:28,400
You should definitely avoid overused and cliched answers such as I work too hard or I expect too much

79

00:04:28,410  -->  00:04:29,270
of others.

80

00:04:29,340  -->  00:04:33,780
What you should do instead is give one or two examples of something that won't affect your ability to

81

00:04:33,780  -->  00:04:36,260
do the job and that you're improving it.

82

00:04:36,270  -->  00:04:40,330
It's not just an outright weakness it's an area that you're working on improving.

83

00:04:40,890  -->  00:04:42,720
Let's go ahead to go to the next question.

84

00:04:43,350  -->  00:04:46,110
So what do you know about our company.

85

00:04:46,110  -->  00:04:50,400
Go ahead and pause a video now and answer the question.

86

00:04:50,400  -->  00:04:56,820
So granted the answer to this question will very wired wildly the pending on what the company actually

87

00:04:56,820  -->  00:04:58,710
is and who you're talking to.

88

00:04:58,890  -->  00:05:03,750
But after all the work you did prior to this and preparing for the interview there should be a no brainer

89

00:05:03,770  -->  00:05:03,840
.

90

00:05:03,900  -->  00:05:08,040
The answer to this question demonstrates the interviewer that you've taken the time to research the

91

00:05:08,040  -->  00:05:11,540
company and have identified where and how you can contribute.

92

00:05:11,550  -->  00:05:12,600
So keep that in mind.

93

00:05:12,660  -->  00:05:16,660
The answer to this question is going to change a lot depending on what the company is but you should

94

00:05:17,010  -->  00:05:19,790
be prepared to answer it.

95

00:05:19,800  -->  00:05:24,440
Next question is what's the most difficult situation you had to face at a job.

96

00:05:24,480  -->  00:05:28,320
Go ahead and pause a video now and answer the question.

97

00:05:28,320  -->  00:05:28,950
All right.

98

00:05:29,080  -->  00:05:34,050
With this question the interviewer is looking to discover what you consider a difficult situation and

99

00:05:34,050  -->  00:05:36,480
how you resolved that situation.

100

00:05:36,480  -->  00:05:39,830
Again this answer should roll right out when you're asked.

101

00:05:39,830  -->  00:05:44,460
Prepare a good script for this question and spend about 80 percent of the time on the solution.

102

00:05:44,460  -->  00:05:46,460
Only just mentioning the problem itself.

103

00:05:46,830  -->  00:05:51,240
Again you want to focus on the solution to the situation not the situation itself.

104

00:05:51,780  -->  00:05:54,380
Let's go ahead and go to the next question.

105

00:05:54,390  -->  00:05:58,620
Next question is What do you think makes a successful manager.

106

00:05:58,770  -->  00:06:03,120
Go ahead and pause the video and answer the question.

107

00:06:03,120  -->  00:06:03,720
All right.

108

00:06:03,760  -->  00:06:08,640
With this question the interviewer is trying to determine your management style and philosophy here

109

00:06:08,640  -->  00:06:14,400
the emphasis should be on teamwork training and development coaching and leading by example a mention

110

00:06:14,400  -->  00:06:17,250
of attaining corporate objectives would also be appropriate.

111

00:06:17,250  -->  00:06:20,680
If you're interviewing at a larger company.

112

00:06:21,480  -->  00:06:23,070
So those are all the questions.

113

00:06:23,070  -->  00:06:27,600
Make sure you have answers are general ideas prepared for these sort of questions.

114

00:06:27,600  -->  00:06:28,430
Good job.

115

00:06:28,560  -->  00:06:32,660
And in the next lecture we're going to focus on questions designed for students.

116

00:06:32,730  -->  00:06:34,370
Are people just getting out of school.

117

00:06:34,460  -->  00:06:36,500
I don't have a lot of experience yet.

118

00:06:37,020  -->  00:06:38,130
Thanks everyone.

119

00:06:38,220  -->  00:06:43,950
Again go through this lecture right before your interview Seacom prep for the tough non-technical interview

120

00:06:43,950  -->  00:06:45,410
questions.

121

00:06:45,450  -->  00:06:45,880
Thanks.

122

00:06:45,890  -->  00:06:47,130
I'll see you at the next lecture.
