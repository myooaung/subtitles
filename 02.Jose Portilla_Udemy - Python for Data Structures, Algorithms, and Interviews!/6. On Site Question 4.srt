Hello everyone and welcome to onsight question for for the large search engine company mock interview

2

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:07,690
.

3

00:00:08,580  -->  00:00:11,610
The question problem statement is as follows.

4

00:00:11,610  -->  00:00:19,110
Find the square root of a given number rounded down to the nearest integer without using a builtin square

5

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:20,860
root function in Python.

6

00:00:20,970  -->  00:00:23,620
That's the s q r t function.

7

00:00:23,670  -->  00:00:25,710
So for example.

8

00:00:25,710  -->  00:00:34,540
Square root of a number between 9 15 should return 3 and 16 and 24 should be 4.

9

00:00:34,620  -->  00:00:38,400
So you're going to be given a number.

10

00:00:38,460  -->  00:00:45,210
Just a single integer and then you have to give the square root nearest to it rounded down.

11

00:00:45,570  -->  00:00:52,510
So your function should be able to take any number between 9 and 15 and the output 3.

12

00:00:52,650  -->  00:00:55,930
Any integer that is between 9 and 15.

13

00:00:55,930  -->  00:01:02,760
It should output 3 and then any integer between 6 and 24 will output 4.

14

00:01:02,910  -->  00:01:08,310
Since you're going to be rounded down to the nearest integer member you have to do this without using

15

00:01:08,310  -->  00:01:10,240
the square root function.

16

00:01:10,590  -->  00:01:12,420
As far as requirements go.

17

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:16,900
Feel free to code this out either in Jupiter notebook or an idea of your choice.

18

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:24,600
But as always it's recommended that use paper and pencil or white board to simulate a real interview

19

00:01:24,600  -->  00:01:26,190
setting.

20

00:01:26,190  -->  00:01:26,680
All right.

21

00:01:26,940  -->  00:01:28,570
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture
