00:00:00,990  -->  00:00:06,260
Welcome to the course curriculum overview for the Python for data structures algorithms and interviews

2

00:00:06,270  -->  00:00:13,070
course there's a lot of content in this course but it can be broken up into three major components.

3

00:00:13,260  -->  00:00:19,030
The non-technical sections the technical sections in the mock interviews sections of the course.

4

00:00:19,140  -->  00:00:23,830
Let's begin our discussion of the course curriculum is the not so critical sections since those appear

5

00:00:23,840  -->  00:00:27,510
first to begin the course.

6

00:00:27,510  -->  00:00:30,420
We have a discussion of company and job types.

7

00:00:30,540  -->  00:00:35,310
This section of the Course discusses the company types and the various shop types available to you in

8

00:00:35,310  -->  00:00:37,080
the software technology field.

9

00:00:37,500  -->  00:00:40,900
After that we have a discussion on resume preparation.

10

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:45,810
You'll get hints and tips on how to prepare a great resume as well as a list of resume creation tools

11

00:00:45,810  -->  00:00:48,380
for you to access online.

12

00:00:48,420  -->  00:00:53,760
Then we have an online presence section you'll learn how to establish a web presence for recruiters

13

00:00:54,150  -->  00:00:57,850
on Web sites such as LinkedIn and github.

14

00:00:59,190  -->  00:01:01,260
Then we discuss networking.

15

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:05,990
In this section you'll learn how to build a network and leverage it for job opportunities.

16

00:01:06,010  -->  00:01:11,040
After that we have the job searching section Well you'll learn about tools and resources to use on your

17

00:01:11,040  -->  00:01:17,070
job hunt such as job search sites how to organize your job search and a list of company matching sites

18

00:01:17,070  -->  00:01:17,550
.

19

00:01:17,580  -->  00:01:22,650
Then we have the non-technical interview questions and answers section in this section of the course

20

00:01:22,650  -->  00:01:22,700
.

21

00:01:22,710  -->  00:01:25,290
You'll get ready for your interview of the fundamentals.

22

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:29,850
You'll learn the five steps to ace an interview and you'll also have a list of interview questions and

23

00:01:29,850  -->  00:01:31,170
answers as well.

24

00:01:31,220  -->  00:01:36,520
Discussion each one and how best to prepare for the non-technical portion of the interview.

25

00:01:36,600  -->  00:01:42,630
After that the Post's interview section and this section we discuss post interview topics and learn

26

00:01:42,630  -->  00:01:44,750
what to do after you have your interview.

27

00:01:44,760  -->  00:01:50,770
This includes things like salary negotiations and preparing your references.

28

00:01:50,790  -->  00:01:55,650
Once we do those topics we'll have the technical sections.

29

00:01:55,650  -->  00:02:00,030
This will begin if a technical material installation guide to make sure you have all the materials you

30

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:04,200
need as well as of set up on your computer regardless of your operating system.

31

00:02:04,260  -->  00:02:11,370
In order to do that technical questions and have all the materials set up for you beforehand then we

32

00:02:11,370  -->  00:02:12,890
get to the meat of the course.

33

00:02:12,960  -->  00:02:15,100
Algorithms and data structures.

34

00:02:15,450  -->  00:02:20,530
Each of the specific algorithms and data structure sections has two parts to it.

35

00:02:20,820  -->  00:02:27,960
Theory lectures in practice interview problems specific on the particular algorithm or the particular

36

00:02:27,960  -->  00:02:31,270
data structure discussed in that section.

37

00:02:31,770  -->  00:02:38,580
The algorithms and data structures we discuss are algorithmic analysis and Big O notation array sequences

38

00:02:38,580  -->  00:02:39,080
.

39

00:02:39,080  -->  00:02:39,640
Stacks.

40

00:02:39,670  -->  00:02:48,790
Use index linked lists recursion trees searching and sorting algorithms graph algorithms and riddles

41

00:02:48,800  -->  00:02:49,070
.

42

00:02:49,320  -->  00:02:56,250
Again each of these sections includes lectures on theory and the topics such as algorithms and the various

43

00:02:56,430  -->  00:02:59,370
data structures we discuss and then the second half of the.

44

00:02:59,360  -->  00:03:06,050
Each of these sections has interview problems focus on that specific topic.

45

00:03:06,540  -->  00:03:14,460
Then we have the mock interview sections in the mock interviews section we simulate for mock interviews

46

00:03:14,460  -->  00:03:16,410
with four separate companies.

47

00:03:16,410  -->  00:03:23,370
They include simulating an interview for e-commerce company a large search engine company a ride share

48

00:03:23,370  -->  00:03:27,200
company and a large social network company.

49

00:03:27,210  -->  00:03:32,550
Each of these mock interviews consists of tons of questions as well as the answers and solutions to

50

00:03:32,550  -->  00:03:38,350
them all explained in a mock interview format.

51

00:03:38,670  -->  00:03:43,980
After all that there is a lecture with bonus special offers for my other courses in case you're interested

52

00:03:44,040  -->  00:03:45,910
in expanding your knowledge.

53

00:03:46,460  -->  00:03:50,540
OK with all that being said it's time to begin the course.

54

00:03:50,550  -->  00:03:52,770
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
