00:00:01.710  -->  00:00:07.650
Hello everyone and welcome to the Mac OS installation video at the beginning of this section called

2

00:00:07.680  -->  00:00:09.440
Introduction to Jupiter notebooks.

3

00:00:09.460  -->  00:00:12.690
There's also a written now Course material installation guide.

4

00:00:12.960  -->  00:00:18.150
In this lecture we're just going to go over those instructions on a Mac system.

5

00:00:18.150  -->  00:00:21.960
You can go ahead and follow these instructions if you have a Linux based system because they're going

6

00:00:21.960  -->  00:00:23.880
to be extremely similar.

7

00:00:23.880  -->  00:00:26.120
All right let's go ahead and get started.

8

00:00:26.130  -->  00:00:29.850
First thing we want to do is go ahead and jump to an internet browser.

9

00:00:30.060  -->  00:00:33.130
I highly recommend chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

10

00:00:33.390  -->  00:00:37.380
The Jupiter notebooks always work best with Google Chrome browser.

11

00:00:37.440  -->  00:00:38.120
OK.

12

00:00:38.550  -->  00:00:41.450
Now we're here at the Google Chrome browser.

13

00:00:41.520  -->  00:00:45.790
First thing we're going to search for is Jupiter that's j u p y.

14

00:00:45.790  -->  00:00:49.970
TR That will take you to Jupiter dot org.

15

00:00:49.990  -->  00:00:54.110
Go ahead and click that link and you should see a page that looks something like this.

16

00:00:54.270  -->  00:01:00.510
If you scroll down you'll then see a link that says try it in your browser and install the notebook

17

00:01:00.510  -->  00:01:01.160
.

18

00:01:01.260  -->  00:01:08.330
If you click try it in your browser here moping in a new tab you'll see a page begin to load.

19

00:01:08.340  -->  00:01:10.470
And it looks something like this.

20

00:01:10.500  -->  00:01:14.130
This is basically the cheaper notebook system in your browser.

21

00:01:14.190  -->  00:01:18.990
So if you're running this on a Chromebook for example or anything where you only have access to the

22

00:01:18.990  -->  00:01:25.980
browser you can actually use this web site try Jupiter dot org to run Jupiter notebooks completely in

23

00:01:25.980  -->  00:01:27.600
browser.

24

00:01:27.600  -->  00:01:29.610
Just click here on NEW.

25

00:01:29.610  -->  00:01:37.110
Then click Python to wait for it to load and then you can actually type python code here and print something

26

00:01:37.110  -->  00:01:46.600
like hello world and then run the cell will go into much deeper detail about how to use that you are

27

00:01:46.600  -->  00:01:49.510
notebooks and how to get the Course notebooks in general.

28

00:01:49.510  -->  00:01:51.570
But I just want you to be aware of this Web site.

29

00:01:51.600  -->  00:01:52.630
Tried that chapter.

30

00:01:52.680  -->  00:01:55.170
Org in case you're interested in it.

31

00:01:55.760  -->  00:01:58.090
You want to install the notebook system locally.

32

00:01:58.350  -->  00:02:04.110
Click install the notebook link and it should take you to the official documentation and we can go ahead

33

00:02:04.110  -->  00:02:05.400
and zoom in here.

34

00:02:06.180  -->  00:02:09.870
And this section just explains how to install the Jupiter note book system.

35

00:02:09.960  -->  00:02:11.400
You'll see there's three options.

36

00:02:11.430  -->  00:02:17.850
Installing Jupiter in Python installing Jupiter if you already have Python and upgrading a Jupiter installation

37

00:02:17.850  -->  00:02:18.430
.

38

00:02:18.660  -->  00:02:24.430
It should be noted that Mac and Linux systems almost always come with Python already installed.

39

00:02:24.690  -->  00:02:31.410
However I still recommend going with the install Jupiter in Python because when you click it it'll tell

40

00:02:31.410  -->  00:02:35.270
you about Anaconda Anaconda conveniently installs Python.

41

00:02:35.310  -->  00:02:40.600
The Jupiter notebook and other commonly used packages for scientific computing in a field known as data

42

00:02:40.620  -->  00:02:41.370
science.

43

00:02:41.600  -->  00:02:48.710
If you go out and click here on the link installing Anaconda they'll take you to continue on to slash

44

00:02:48.720  -->  00:02:56.080
downloads and then you can just jump to OSX or Linux and follow the relevant instructions.

45

00:02:56.160  -->  00:03:01.210
In this case just go ahead and click here on the graphical installer and follow directions.

46

00:03:01.230  -->  00:03:07.320
Once you're done executing the graphical installer There is also a command line installer for that option

47

00:03:07.320  -->  00:03:07.920
.

48

00:03:08.010  -->  00:03:14.820
If you are using Anaconda for Linux you also have the same options here for 64 bit and 32 bit but for

49

00:03:14.820  -->  00:03:19.170
those you'll have to execute them on the command line by following the instructions here.

50

00:03:19.350  -->  00:03:23.340
Again if you're using Mac I just recommend to use the graphical installer.

51

00:03:23.340  -->  00:03:28.050
There is a command line installer option but the graphical installers usually it's easier to use in

52

00:03:28.050  -->  00:03:28.990
general.

53

00:03:29.490  -->  00:03:38.730
OK so once you've done that and follow the directions if you go back to the documentation you should

54

00:03:38.730  -->  00:03:45.830
just be able to go to your terminal for a Mac or Linux or command prompt for Windows to find your terminal

55

00:03:45.840  -->  00:03:53.490
just click the command key and space to open a spotlight search and then begin to type terminal and

56

00:03:53.490  -->  00:03:55.500
you'll get something that looks like this.

57

00:03:55.500  -->  00:03:57.370
Here we have my bash terminal.

58

00:03:57.390  -->  00:04:08.250
Once you've done that you can say conda and we'll zoom in here Khanda install Jupiter.

59

00:04:08.250  -->  00:04:12.570
Go ahead and click enter and once you've run that I won't run it right now since I already have Conda

60

00:04:12.570  -->  00:04:18.120
installed and Jupiter installed they'll automatically install the Jupiter notebook's after that.

61

00:04:18.120  -->  00:04:21.200
Once that's all installed you should just be able to write.

62

00:04:21.300  -->  00:04:22.010
Jupiter.

63

00:04:22.060  -->  00:04:24.590
Space notebook.

64

00:04:24.690  -->  00:04:31.380
Hit enter and you should see a new notebook system pop up.

65

00:04:31.410  -->  00:04:37.050
You can come to the right click on Python too and now you're running Jupiter notebook's locally wherever

66

00:04:37.050  -->  00:04:38.910
you are in your terminal.

67

00:04:39.090  -->  00:04:39.640
All right.

68

00:04:39.930  -->  00:04:43.840
That's the basics of the material of course instruction installation.

69

00:04:43.980  -->  00:04:49.980
You can go ahead and check lecture 28 for more details on the introduction to Jupiter notebooks and

70

00:04:50.010  -->  00:04:55.770
how to understand every single step of the way for installation and the next lectures will actually

71

00:04:55.770  -->  00:05:00.450
go over the notebooks and much more detail how to get the course material and how to create the interview

72

00:05:00.450  -->  00:05:01.590
notebooks.

73

00:05:01.590  -->  00:05:04.660
This is just instructions on the basic installation.

74

00:05:04.680  -->  00:05:07.300
OK thanks everyone and I'll see if the next lecture
