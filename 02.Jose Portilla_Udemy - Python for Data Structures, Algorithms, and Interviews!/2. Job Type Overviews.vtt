00:00:01.140  -->  00:00:05.570
Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on job types overview.

2

00:00:06.240  -->  00:00:12.030
So we're going to categorize job types and programming into seven different categories.

3

00:00:12.030  -->  00:00:18.110
Those are infrastructure back and Front-End native science and theory marketing.

4

00:00:18.120  -->  00:00:21.540
And then finally hardware and graphics.

5

00:00:21.540  -->  00:00:25.740
So one thing to know is that there's definitely overlap between the skills required for each of these

6

00:00:25.740  -->  00:00:29.510
positions and even some titles overlap between categories.

7

00:00:29.520  -->  00:00:34.850
So just keep that in mind first up infrastructure.

8

00:00:34.870  -->  00:00:40.260
So there's this admin which is a position where you manage set up and keep systems running.

9

00:00:40.260  -->  00:00:45.510
And there's also dev ops where you create and use tools that developers use to manage systems.

10

00:00:45.570  -->  00:00:51.060
There's also network engineering setting up Xining and optimizing network infrastructures so is data

11

00:00:51.060  -->  00:00:56.970
center operations who basically keep the clock running along with that there's also cable and router

12

00:00:56.970  -->  00:01:02.580
technicians database administrators and then technical support and documentation staff who actually

13

00:01:02.580  -->  00:01:06.260
have to interact with customers and users.

14

00:01:06.480  -->  00:01:07.590
Then there's backend.

15

00:01:07.800  -->  00:01:10.030
So quite a few positions here.

16

00:01:10.030  -->  00:01:15.030
There's full second in-ears to do a little bit of everything back and application development we use

17

00:01:15.030  -->  00:01:16.620
things such as rails and Django.

18

00:01:16.740  -->  00:01:21.370
So Ruby and Rails and then Python for Django node et cetera.

19

00:01:21.480  -->  00:01:27.090
So so project management which isn't always a technical role and there's engineering management where

20

00:01:27.090  -->  00:01:31.350
foreign developers usually get hired into a management position.

21

00:01:31.620  -->  00:01:36.450
Just keep in mind that the terms product management project management and engineering management may

22

00:01:36.450  -->  00:01:39.120
mean different things at different companies.

23

00:01:39.140  -->  00:01:43.710
It's also software architects who plan out features before they're actually coded.

24

00:01:43.710  -->  00:01:49.920
There's also API design where you design interfaces between systems security and penetration testing

25

00:01:50.490  -->  00:01:57.450
distributed system architects who deal of consistency availability partition tolerance timing of large

26

00:01:57.450  -->  00:02:01.440
globally separated systems and there's also database administrators

27

00:02:05.430  -->  00:02:06.800
then the Front-End.

28

00:02:06.870  -->  00:02:12.060
So the Front-End there is full stack engineers who again do a little bit of everything but they're focused

29

00:02:12.060  -->  00:02:15.750
primarily on the pieces that support a frontman of a Web site.

30

00:02:15.750  -->  00:02:20.810
So then there's you X and UI front end designers who deal with Photoshop in design sketch.

31

00:02:20.850  -->  00:02:26.140
Each team elenchi SS etc. that's their piece of the pie there.

32

00:02:26.220  -->  00:02:33.480
Then there's general far and the Web development so TMLC SS and Javascript single page app development

33

00:02:33.480  -->  00:02:33.600
.

34

00:02:33.630  -->  00:02:38.760
So those are people who mostly deal with javascript framework such as angular or react.

35

00:02:38.760  -->  00:02:40.590
Then there's also quality assurance and testing.

36

00:02:40.590  -->  00:02:44.900
So you write tests do human tests make sure things actually work.

37

00:02:45.750  -->  00:02:48.600
Then the next category is native.

38

00:02:48.630  -->  00:02:55.800
So these are people who develop an iOS or a swift Android Windows Mobile etc. They also work on consumer

39

00:02:55.800  -->  00:03:02.100
facing windows desktop applications OSX desktop applications and even Linux app development.

40

00:03:02.280  -->  00:03:05.070
So enterprise software development so large.

41

00:03:05.070  -->  00:03:10.820
Made to order applications for businesses I.T. administration and Adam in software design.

42

00:03:10.830  -->  00:03:15.990
These are often very system specific events that go in their native category here and also software

43

00:03:16.080  -->  00:03:24.490
architecture similar to that back and architectural design features before they're actually coded.

44

00:03:24.660  -->  00:03:27.070
Then there's a science and theory category.

45

00:03:27.270  -->  00:03:28.830
So there's scientific research.

46

00:03:28.830  -->  00:03:32.940
These are people in academia who use Matlab are in Python.

47

00:03:32.970  -->  00:03:34.860
And more those kinds of things.

48

00:03:35.010  -->  00:03:40.770
So so pure computer science or pure math rolls where they research with Pascal lips and lots of other

49

00:03:40.770  -->  00:03:42.000
languages.

50

00:03:42.070  -->  00:03:44.040
There's scientific software development.

51

00:03:44.310  -->  00:03:48.500
So for instance there some companies working on protein folding software.

52

00:03:48.570  -->  00:03:50.370
A lot of biotech companies.

53

00:03:50.670  -->  00:03:56.550
There's just a general term data science which is what I do personally which again is matlab are I Python

54

00:03:56.550  -->  00:04:01.540
sikat learn etc. and machine learning which also falls under data science.

55

00:04:01.770  -->  00:04:07.050
Then there's OS design which isn't just Microsoft Windows and Linux but also things and companies such

56

00:04:07.060  -->  00:04:12.420
as Qualcomm and lots of other telecoms hire tens of thousands of engineers right embedded and mobile

57

00:04:12.870  -->  00:04:16.150
operating systems.

58

00:04:16.230  -->  00:04:21.600
It's also marketing which has a lot of crossover with data science but terms like growth hacking or

59

00:04:21.600  -->  00:04:27.680
web scraping where the selenium beautiful soup packages for Python Fantom James sikat learn which is

60

00:04:27.680  -->  00:04:31.430
a machine learning package for Python pattern etc..

61

00:04:31.620  -->  00:04:35.310
There's analytics so you can use Mixpanel optimized et etc..

62

00:04:35.470  -->  00:04:39.620
This is also closely tied of marketing and SEO Search Engine Optimization.

63

00:04:39.930  -->  00:04:45.540
And then just general marketing development things such as sales force analytics content design and

64

00:04:45.540  -->  00:04:48.860
again search engine optimization as CEO.

65

00:04:49.920  -->  00:04:53.780
Finally there's hardware and graphics so there is embedded software.

66

00:04:53.810  -->  00:04:58.860
This is known as code that runs very close to the metal such as the assembly code running an elevator

67

00:04:58.900  -->  00:04:59.480
.

68

00:04:59.500  -->  00:05:01.650
There's also chip design and architecture.

69

00:05:01.810  -->  00:05:05.870
There's game development which a lot of people feel is much different than normal development.

70

00:05:05.880  -->  00:05:07.040
Just keep that in mind.

71

00:05:07.230  -->  00:05:09.520
And there's also graphics software development.

72

00:05:09.600  -->  00:05:12.720
Sometimes is a crossover between that and game development.

73

00:05:12.760  -->  00:05:15.020
Then there's 3D printing and machine coding.

74

00:05:15.300  -->  00:05:18.630
And then there's CGI and animation.

75

00:05:18.630  -->  00:05:19.120
All right.

76

00:05:19.230  -->  00:05:22.980
I know there was a ton so you can go ahead and check out the resource link at this lecture for this

77

00:05:22.980  -->  00:05:26.640
PowerPoint presentation so you can look over the position slowly on your own time.

78

00:05:27.030  -->  00:05:31.740
But in conclusion most engineers and programmers have skills in multiple categories.

79

00:05:31.740  -->  00:05:35.970
So just think about what interests you as you go on and continue throughout this course.

80

00:05:35.970  -->  00:05:38.700
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
