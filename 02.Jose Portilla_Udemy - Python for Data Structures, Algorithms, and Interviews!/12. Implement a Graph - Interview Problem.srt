Hello everyone and welcome to your first interview question for the graphs section.

2

00:00:06,580  -->  00:00:10,500
This interview question is simply to implement a graph class.

3

00:00:10,500  -->  00:00:15,660
Now we've already seen this done twice once as an adjacency list and another time as an adjacency list

4

00:00:15,690  -->  00:00:20,790
but with the Node class that vertex class you can do either one or whatever you feel comfortable with

5

00:00:20,930  -->  00:00:21,270
.

6

00:00:21,470  -->  00:00:25,560
There's not going to be a solution lecture after this or after any of the interview questions here because

7

00:00:25,560  -->  00:00:30,300
they're all going to be implementation questions that we've seen implemented before.

8

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:35,460
Again there's no solution you can go ahead and check out the references to the implementations I've

9

00:00:35,460  -->  00:00:37,530
seen before but that's it.

10

00:00:37,770  -->  00:00:38,340
OK.

11

00:00:38,580  -->  00:00:41,370
Best of luck and just implement a graph class.

12

00:00:41,370  -->  00:00:41,780
Thanks.

13

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:42,780
I'll see you at the next lecture
