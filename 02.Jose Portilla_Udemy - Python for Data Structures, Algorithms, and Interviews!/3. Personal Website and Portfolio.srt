00:00:01,350  -->  00:00:08,070
Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on personal Web sites and online portfolios personal web pages

2

00:00:08,070  -->  00:00:11,850
are a great way to showcase your online portfolio or your blog.

3

00:00:11,850  -->  00:00:16,770
So we're going to discuss some options and set you up have some links to check out and see what works

4

00:00:16,770  -->  00:00:17,660
for you.

5

00:00:18,600  -->  00:00:24,420
As far as blogging platforms some of the most popular ones right now are medium Wordpress and blogger

6

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:25,860
dot com.

7

00:00:25,980  -->  00:00:31,200
I personally like medium but I encourage you to check all three of them out and see what works for you

8

00:00:31,200  -->  00:00:31,830
.

9

00:00:31,830  -->  00:00:37,680
Blogging is a great way to show recruiters that you're interested personally in the topics of programming

10

00:00:38,220  -->  00:00:43,560
and can give you some or give them some insight into your own personal projects and what you're interested

11

00:00:43,560  -->  00:00:45,630
in.

12

00:00:46,560  -->  00:00:53,370
As far as website creation goes if you plan on applying for web development or UI positions any job

13

00:00:53,430  -->  00:00:59,070
where you're required to use H to measure CSSA or javascript you should actually definitely be building

14

00:00:59,070  -->  00:01:00,800
your site from scratch.

15

00:01:00,840  -->  00:01:02,450
So just leave it at that.

16

00:01:02,580  -->  00:01:07,680
Since web development and Web site creations any part of your job you should be familiar with this and

17

00:01:07,740  -->  00:01:11,520
should probably already have your own web presence.

18

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:17,130
If you're looking for more standard programming jobs then there's website creation services.

19

00:01:17,130  -->  00:01:21,690
These services are basically just drag and drop interfaces that make it really easy to create your own

20

00:01:21,690  -->  00:01:23,090
web site.

21

00:01:23,100  -->  00:01:27,180
Some of these services services right now include weebly Wick's Squarespace.

22

00:01:27,180  -->  00:01:30,190
There's tons of options so google around for more.

23

00:01:30,240  -->  00:01:36,090
A lot of them provide free versions on their own subdomains So for instance you could get your name

24

00:01:36,380  -->  00:01:38,400
dot we bleed dot com.

25

00:01:38,610  -->  00:01:44,790
If you don't want to pay for a domain name if you do want to pay for your own domain name I suggest

26

00:01:44,820  -->  00:01:45,320
you check out.

27

00:01:45,330  -->  00:01:51,670
Name cheap or Google Donat domains as ways of buying your domain.

28

00:01:51,750  -->  00:01:59,640
But again google around for purchasing domains as far as the basics of a personal web site.

29

00:01:59,670  -->  00:02:02,520
Make sure to keep it updated during your job search.

30

00:02:02,520  -->  00:02:06,870
If you're running a blog it's a great way to keep track of everything you're learning.

31

00:02:06,870  -->  00:02:11,760
So I would definitely recommend blogging your process of learning about different things but data structures

32

00:02:11,760  -->  00:02:12,840
and algorithms.

33

00:02:12,870  -->  00:02:15,830
Recruiters love to see that kind of stuff.

34

00:02:15,840  -->  00:02:21,720
One final know personal Web sites some personal pages aren't really necessary as a LinkedIn profile

35

00:02:21,960  -->  00:02:26,730
but they can definitely improve your standings among other candidates especially if you have an impressive

36

00:02:26,760  -->  00:02:30,240
online for polio on your personal web site.

37

00:02:30,600  -->  00:02:35,760
So that being said go ahead and check out some of those links if you are interested in blogging or starting

38

00:02:35,760  -->  00:02:37,520
your own personal Web site.

39

00:02:37,740  -->  00:02:39,760
I'll leave that up to you.

40

00:02:39,810  -->  00:02:42,690
It's more important the focus on your LinkedIn.

41

00:02:42,690  -->  00:02:47,570
If you're just beginning your job search right now then building up your personal web site.

42

00:02:48,090  -->  00:02:53,610
So if you're just starting out I would recommend build your LinkedIn and github and then maybe start

43

00:02:53,610  -->  00:02:57,390
a blog and keep track of what you're learning so far.

44

00:02:57,390  -->  00:02:58,420
All right everyone.

45

00:02:58,650  -->  00:03:01,140
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
