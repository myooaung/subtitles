00:00:01,260  -->  00:00:06,300
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on linked in this lecture we're going to discuss what Linked-In

2

00:00:06,300  -->  00:00:11,160
is and how best to taken advantage of it in your job search.

3

00:00:11,300  -->  00:00:17,040
So that is one of the most important social media platforms for job searching and networking and it's

4

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:21,150
imperative to have one as you begin your job search.

5

00:00:21,240  -->  00:00:26,580
So in case you're not familiar if Linked-In Linked-In is a business oriented social networking service

6

00:00:27,120  -->  00:00:31,680
something to know is that most of the site's revenue comes from selling access to information about

7

00:00:31,680  -->  00:00:38,700
its users to recruiters and sales professionals meaning a lot of recruiters at large corporations actually

8

00:00:38,700  -->  00:00:44,490
have their company pay LinkedIn so that the recruiters can use it to find people looking for jobs.

9

00:00:44,490  -->  00:00:52,740
People like you so if you don't have a link and profile yet you should go make one right now before

10

00:00:52,740  -->  00:00:55,110
continuing on with the rest of the lecture.

11

00:00:55,140  -->  00:01:00,720
Something I want you to note though is you can actually use your email contacts to get connections.

12

00:01:00,720  -->  00:01:03,330
So keep that in mind as you create your profile.

13

00:01:03,370  -->  00:01:10,760
LinkedIn should automatically ask you this and get a pop up as the image shows here on the slide.

14

00:01:10,770  -->  00:01:15,990
So again go to Linked-In and create a profile explore the Web site a bit and then come back and complete

15

00:01:16,020  -->  00:01:18,210
this lecture.

16

00:01:18,210  -->  00:01:18,610
All right.

17

00:01:18,780  -->  00:01:20,710
So you may already have Illington profile.

18

00:01:20,720  -->  00:01:23,160
You should have created one looked around the bit.

19

00:01:23,340  -->  00:01:25,980
Let's discuss some of the features of Linked-In.

20

00:01:25,980  -->  00:01:31,770
First off Linked-In recommendations Linked-In recommendations are bit almost like a letter of recommendation

21

00:01:32,010  -->  00:01:35,730
on yearly than profile if you want a recommendation.

22

00:01:35,730  -->  00:01:41,040
You start off by asking people you've worked under or with to give you recommendations.

23

00:01:41,070  -->  00:01:46,140
Always remember to thank them and if possible return the favor by recommending them back if it's appropriate

24

00:01:46,140  -->  00:01:46,950
.

25

00:01:46,950  -->  00:01:51,150
You can also ask professors and teachers to leave recommendations on your profile.

26

00:01:51,150  -->  00:01:56,760
Under education section again you should really only ask people you personally know for a recommendation

27

00:01:58,070  -->  00:01:58,890
next.

28

00:01:58,920  -->  00:02:01,380
Arlington skil endorsements.

29

00:02:01,380  -->  00:02:08,070
When you're creating a LinkedIn profile there's a skills section and you may have skills such as programming

30

00:02:08,070  -->  00:02:11,520
or python that you'll put on your user profile.

31

00:02:11,520  -->  00:02:14,370
Other users can endorse you for these skills.

32

00:02:14,550  -->  00:02:18,570
Having scores on these skills might give your profile an edge.

33

00:02:18,570  -->  00:02:21,230
Some recruiters keep an eye out for these.

34

00:02:21,240  -->  00:02:23,210
Others don't really care.

35

00:02:23,220  -->  00:02:25,830
Their actual usefulness is kind of debatable.

36

00:02:25,830  -->  00:02:28,430
Different people vary the perception of them.

37

00:02:28,620  -->  00:02:30,160
Some people think they're worthless.

38

00:02:30,210  -->  00:02:34,800
Some people take them really seriously but you should at least know that they exist and keep an eye

39

00:02:34,800  -->  00:02:39,780
out for skill endorsements and if someone endorses you for a skill.

40

00:02:40,500  -->  00:02:47,400
Ok next following in link then you can actually follow people on LinkedIn and if you produce content

41

00:02:47,580  -->  00:02:51,930
let's say you have blog posts articles or you produce new code and get her.

42

00:02:52,170  -->  00:02:56,460
You can post it on Linked-In to your followers and they're going to see it in their feed and get notified

43

00:02:56,980  -->  00:02:59,260
and you can also add a follow me button.

44

00:02:59,340  -->  00:03:05,360
If you have a personal web site next linked in as a job search tool.

45

00:03:05,820  -->  00:03:08,620
So Linked-In has its own job hunting platform.

46

00:03:08,700  -->  00:03:12,780
You can check it out at WDW that link then that com slash jobs.

47

00:03:12,780  -->  00:03:17,050
So if we hop over to that real quick it will look something like this.

48

00:03:17,130  -->  00:03:19,350
So I'll say start your job search here.

49

00:03:19,440  -->  00:03:24,420
You put in job titles keywords or company names the location and then search.

50

00:03:24,780  -->  00:03:27,960
So it's a pretty good job search tool.

51

00:03:27,960  -->  00:03:33,330
I definitely recommend trying it out especially if you have a pretty complete LinkedIn profile.

52

00:03:33,360  -->  00:03:35,980
They'll try to match you have jobs that makes sense to you.

53

00:03:36,270  -->  00:03:37,380
So check it out.

54

00:03:37,380  -->  00:03:42,450
We'll discuss other job sites search tools and job boards later on in this course.

55

00:03:42,510  -->  00:03:47,250
But as far as Linked-In you should be aware of this one and will come back to it later on the course

56

00:03:47,410  -->  00:03:51,040
we did when we discuss job searching tips in general.

57

00:03:51,150  -->  00:03:54,020
So let's go ahead and go back to the presentation.

58

00:03:54,900  -->  00:03:55,440
All right.

59

00:03:55,440  -->  00:04:01,560
So after checking out Linked-In dot com slash jobs I want to discuss a few Linked-In premium so Linked-In

60

00:04:01,560  -->  00:04:08,340
premium is actually a premium service and we discussed earlier that some people pay Linked-In to get

61

00:04:08,340  -->  00:04:11,540
a premium version of the web of their web site.

62

00:04:12,300  -->  00:04:15,360
So Linked-In premium gives you a few things.

63

00:04:15,390  -->  00:04:23,310
It allows you to mail people such as recruiters and email is basically linked end's own internal messaging

64

00:04:23,310  -->  00:04:24,600
system.

65

00:04:24,630  -->  00:04:30,120
It also allows you to connect with and contact recruiters more directly and that gives you improved

66

00:04:30,120  -->  00:04:33,020
information on lengthens job search tools.

67

00:04:33,030  -->  00:04:40,470
So if you're looking for jobs on lengthens job search having a Linked-In premium profile will actually

68

00:04:40,470  -->  00:04:44,670
give you information such as how many people have applied that job through LinkedIn.

69

00:04:44,790  -->  00:04:46,950
What's the average education background.

70

00:04:47,250  -->  00:04:49,640
Years of experience cetera.

71

00:04:49,930  -->  00:04:51,890
There's a 1 month free trial.

72

00:04:52,170  -->  00:04:57,030
And what I would recommend you do is after you're done studying and you're ready to actually begin applying

73

00:04:57,030  -->  00:05:00,780
for jobs try the one month of Linked-In premium.

74

00:05:00,780  -->  00:05:04,490
Use it to contact recruiters and take advantage of that one month.

75

00:05:04,710  -->  00:05:05,680
Really milk it.

76

00:05:05,730  -->  00:05:09,190
And then if you decide you need it more pay for it.

77

00:05:09,240  -->  00:05:11,880
If not end your 1 month free trial.

78

00:05:11,880  -->  00:05:12,570
No problem.

79

00:05:12,570  -->  00:05:14,210
It took advantage of it.

80

00:05:15,000  -->  00:05:15,640
OK.

81

00:05:15,780  -->  00:05:18,900
A quick now on discussion etiquette.

82

00:05:18,900  -->  00:05:24,090
Please be polite and thoughtful when posting your linked in profile to discussion boards.

83

00:05:24,090  -->  00:05:28,950
I want you to feel free to post if you generally need help and try to give honest feedback to other

84

00:05:28,950  -->  00:05:31,770
people who have posted their Linked-In profiles.

85

00:05:31,770  -->  00:05:38,130
However don't just spam the discussion boards on this course with your profile for no reason.

86

00:05:38,130  -->  00:05:38,530
All right.

87

00:05:38,730  -->  00:05:41,840
With that being said here's your Linked-In homework.

88

00:05:42,090  -->  00:05:47,610
You should create Illington profile update your picture to a professional looking picture.

89

00:05:47,610  -->  00:05:53,560
Make sure your face is fully seen in the photo complete your profile information.

90

00:05:53,730  -->  00:05:55,470
You should get at least 10 connections.

91

00:05:55,470  -->  00:06:01,560
People you know people you work with and your final homework assignment is to get a connection to recruiter

92

00:06:01,970  -->  00:06:04,950
hopefully at a company that you're interested in.

93

00:06:04,950  -->  00:06:07,790
All right that's it.

94

00:06:07,890  -->  00:06:12,570
Make sure to complete that task list and I will see you at the next lecture.

95

00:06:12,570  -->  00:06:13,270
Thank you everyone
