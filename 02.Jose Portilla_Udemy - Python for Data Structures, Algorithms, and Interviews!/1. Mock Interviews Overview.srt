00:00:01,140  -->  00:00:07,220
Hello everyone and welcome to the introduction to the mock interviews section of this course this looks

2

00:00:07,220  -->  00:00:11,150
sure just going to be going over some general non technical questions.

3

00:00:11,280  -->  00:00:16,590
Resources for you and also the structure of the mock interviews section of the course.

4

00:00:16,680  -->  00:00:20,880
So in this section of the introduction you're going to have a list of general non-technical questions

5

00:00:20,880  -->  00:00:26,340
you may be asked such as questions during a phone screen of a recruiter so you can get that in the next

6

00:00:26,340  -->  00:00:31,250
lecture and then you also get a list of questions that you should ask after the interview.

7

00:00:31,290  -->  00:00:35,540
So make sure you actually review those questions non-technical questions.

8

00:00:35,550  -->  00:00:37,960
We won't really discuss those in a mock interview.

9

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:40,850
We're going to focus more on actual technical questions.

10

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:47,550
Make sure you can answer several non-technical questions for the company that you're applying to.

11

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:54,150
As far as the mock interviews themselves you'll usually see two folders in your and B in the packet

12

00:00:55,020  -->  00:00:57,020
or on any viewer of the board.

13

00:00:57,090  -->  00:01:01,800
It's going to consist of interview problems and then another folder called interview problems solutions

14

00:01:01,800  -->  00:01:02,250
.

15

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:05,190
So pay careful attention to the requirements.

16

00:01:05,190  -->  00:01:11,880
Sometimes they ask you to just use a pen and paper and also note the simple format you're not going

17

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:18,390
to have a cell to test your solution you're basically just going to be asked a question and be asked

18

00:01:18,390  -->  00:01:23,700
to make reasonable assumptions for your answer or your solution.

19

00:01:23,700  -->  00:01:29,760
So again those mock interview questions are just going to be simple usually just a few lines of a question

20

00:01:29,850  -->  00:01:32,420
and that's it.

21

00:01:32,610  -->  00:01:40,020
Moving on what you should really do is record yourself talking or explaining out loud a lot of the mock

22

00:01:40,020  -->  00:01:45,180
interviews section questions are going to ask as a requirement that you don't code out your solution

23

00:01:45,190  -->  00:01:45,220
.

24

00:01:45,240  -->  00:01:48,520
They actually write it on paper and pencil or on a whiteboard.

25

00:01:48,660  -->  00:01:55,110
So practice with a friend or family member give them the solutions and you can have the interview problem

26

00:01:55,110  -->  00:01:56,010
yourself.

27

00:01:56,010  -->  00:02:00,750
It really helps for you to record yourself or practice for a friend.

28

00:02:00,750  -->  00:02:06,900
So you can see how well you do and get the real life situation of talking to someone in a room and explaining

29

00:02:06,900  -->  00:02:08,820
your thought process.

30

00:02:09,060  -->  00:02:12,930
Again make sure you have a paper and pen or paper and pencil or some sort of white board.

31

00:02:13,020  -->  00:02:16,310
Because a lot of the mock interview questions aren't going to be coded out.

32

00:02:16,320  -->  00:02:19,350
You'll have to do them by hand.

33

00:02:19,740  -->  00:02:25,020
Once you've attempted all the problems for a specific companies mock interview then take a look at the

34

00:02:25,020  -->  00:02:25,880
solutions.

35

00:02:25,920  -->  00:02:27,480
So don't go one at a time.

36

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:32,650
Do all the phones in site questions first and then attempt the solutions.

37

00:02:32,790  -->  00:02:37,350
Again the problems are going to feel much harder than the previous exercises and interview problems

38

00:02:37,680  -->  00:02:39,730
we've done previously in this course.

39

00:02:39,840  -->  00:02:44,430
And that's because they're not going to be attached to certain sections so you'll have to think of what

40

00:02:44,430  -->  00:02:46,140
strategy works best

41

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:52,510
practice interview problems you missed again after reading the solution.

42

00:02:52,650  -->  00:02:57,270
So after you go through a mock interview all the phone screen and onsite questions and then check your

43

00:02:57,270  -->  00:02:59,340
solutions are the ones you missed.

44

00:02:59,340  -->  00:03:04,550
Make sure you practice that entry problem again and hopefully record it yourself or doing it.

45

00:03:04,560  -->  00:03:07,750
If a family member or friends.

46

00:03:08,100  -->  00:03:13,020
So if that being said Best of luck let's go ahead and get started in the next few lectures you'll see

47

00:03:13,020  -->  00:03:15,420
that list of questions you should be able to answer.

48

00:03:15,600  -->  00:03:18,260
And after that we'll get sort of the mock interviews.

49

00:03:18,270  -->  00:03:19,140
Thanks everyone.

50

00:03:19,140  -->  00:03:20,070
I'll see you at the next lecture
