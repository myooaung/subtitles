Hello and welcome to the first onsight question for your social network company mock interview your

2

00:00:07.350  -->  00:00:12.970
problem statement is this given a list of integers and a target number.

3

00:00:13.020  -->  00:00:19.830
Write a function that returns a boolean indicating if it's possible to sum to integers from that list

4

00:00:20.120  -->  00:00:22.360
to reach the target number.

5

00:00:22.890  -->  00:00:29.150
Some requirements for this is to try pen and paper or Whitehorn before coding out your solution and

6

00:00:29.190  -->  00:00:35.640
other requirement is that you cannot use an integer element twice and you want to optimize for time

7

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:37.120
over space.

8

00:00:37.560  -->  00:00:42.990
So again to give you an idea of what this problem is like you're given a list of integers let's say

9

00:00:42.990  -->  00:00:47.600
the list is 1 to 3 and then a target number.

10

00:00:47.820  -->  00:00:50.770
Let's say the target number is five.

11

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:55.680
So you want to write a function that returns a boolean indicating of it's possible some to integers

12

00:00:55.680  -->  00:00:57.930
from that list to reach the target number.

13

00:00:57.930  -->  00:01:04.300
In this case you would to return true since 2 and 3 can be summed up to equal 5.

14

00:01:04.320  -->  00:01:10.720
Again you're given a list of integers a target number and you want to see if it's possible that from

15

00:01:10.860  -->  00:01:17.590
two numbers are two integers from that list you can sum them up to create that target number.

16

00:01:17.610  -->  00:01:22.500
Now you can't use an integer element twice so you can't use.

17

00:01:22.500  -->  00:01:30.870
For instance if your list was 1 to 3 and your target number was 4 you couldn't say add 2 and 2 again

18

00:01:30.870  -->  00:01:30.980
.

19

00:01:31.080  -->  00:01:34.050
Because it only occurs once in your list.

20

00:01:34.050  -->  00:01:34.980
All right.

21

00:01:35.010  -->  00:01:36.240
But that being said.

22

00:01:36.480  -->  00:01:38.780
Best of luck and I'll see you at the next lecture.
