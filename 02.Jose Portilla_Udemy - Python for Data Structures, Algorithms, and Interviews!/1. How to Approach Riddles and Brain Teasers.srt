00:00:01,020  -->  00:00:05,970
Hello everyone and welcome to the Riddell's section of this course and this section of the course we're

2

00:00:05,970  -->  00:00:10,830
going to discuss riddles and brainteasers in general and in this particular lecture we're going to discuss

3

00:00:10,830  -->  00:00:13,110
how to approach riddles.

4

00:00:13,200  -->  00:00:19,850
So a lot of companies actually have policies now banning brainteasers and riddle type questions.

5

00:00:19,860  -->  00:00:25,350
This includes Google and Microsoft and Google became famous back in the day for asking these sort of

6

00:00:25,350  -->  00:00:26,300
brainteasers.

7

00:00:26,430  -->  00:00:31,260
But then they realized they had really little to correlate with solving and being good at brainteasers

8

00:00:31,260  -->  00:00:33,350
with actual performance on the job.

9

00:00:33,360  -->  00:00:38,490
So now they have policies to bend them over some interviewers are still going to ask these type of tricky

10

00:00:38,490  -->  00:00:39,840
questions.

11

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:42,750
So there's a few types of riddles and brainteaser.

12

00:00:43,380  -->  00:00:50,190
The three main categories are trick questions estimation problems and math puzzles trick questions usually

13

00:00:50,190  -->  00:00:57,250
rely on you having some sort of weird prior knowledge and are really the worst type of Riddle and brainteasers

14

00:00:57,330  -->  00:01:01,590
can be asked and hopefully you're never asked the trick question in an interview.

15

00:01:01,620  -->  00:01:04,200
These are really unfair problems to be asked.

16

00:01:04,200  -->  00:01:10,710
We do have a sort of trick question in this riddle section but I will make you aware that it's a sort

17

00:01:10,710  -->  00:01:11,690
of trick question.

18

00:01:11,760  -->  00:01:14,430
So you don't spend too much time trying to solve it.

19

00:01:14,610  -->  00:01:21,060
The next type of Riddle and brainteaser is an estimation problem estimation type problems are also being

20

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:25,230
banned at some companies but you should be aware of them.

21

00:01:25,230  -->  00:01:31,830
So for instance common estimation problems are how to estimate how many McDonalds there are in the United

22

00:01:31,830  -->  00:01:38,100
States or estimate how many happy birthday posts are there on Facebook in a given day.

23

00:01:38,160  -->  00:01:39,760
Things of that nature.

24

00:01:40,200  -->  00:01:44,940
And keep in mind for estimation problems you may be required to estimate things that are relevant to

25

00:01:44,940  -->  00:01:46,060
your position.

26

00:01:46,110  -->  00:01:52,140
So if you're interviewing for the G-mail team at Google you may be asked to estimate how much time is

27

00:01:52,140  -->  00:01:58,170
spent on Gmail in a given day for an average person or how many people log in to G-mail every day.

28

00:01:58,230  -->  00:01:59,950
Things of that nature.

29

00:02:00,030  -->  00:02:01,970
Finally you have math puzzles.

30

00:02:02,190  -->  00:02:07,200
These are puzzles whose background is rooted in some sort of logic or computer science and you should

31

00:02:07,200  -->  00:02:08,270
be able to solve these.

32

00:02:08,280  -->  00:02:14,130
And that's what the main focus of the riddle section is the sort of algorithmic and math puzzle type

33

00:02:14,190  -->  00:02:15,940
riddles and brainteasers.

34

00:02:16,020  -->  00:02:17,960
So how can we approach these problems.

35

00:02:17,970  -->  00:02:19,390
Let's find out.

36

00:02:20,220  -->  00:02:23,420
First off don't panic when you get a brainteaser.

37

00:02:23,580  -->  00:02:26,200
Interviewers want to see how you tackle a problem.

38

00:02:26,310  -->  00:02:28,990
They also don't expect you to immediately know the answer.

39

00:02:29,100  -->  00:02:34,030
Just start talking and show the interviewer how you approach a problem.

40

00:02:34,110  -->  00:02:38,670
In many cases you're also going to find that the brainteasers have some sort of connection back to the

41

00:02:38,670  -->  00:02:41,340
fundamental laws or theories of computer science.

42

00:02:41,370  -->  00:02:46,230
The data structures and algorithms that we've been discussing throughout this course if you're stuck

43

00:02:46,230  -->  00:02:46,620
.

44

00:02:46,620  -->  00:02:51,960
It's recommended to try simplifying the problem solve it for a small number of items or a special case

45

00:02:52,050  -->  00:02:54,710
and then see if you can generalize it.

46

00:02:54,720  -->  00:02:59,370
Remember to check if you can relate the problem to some sort of fundamental data structure algorithm

47

00:02:59,400  -->  00:02:59,770
.

48

00:02:59,790  -->  00:03:02,150
Remember to break down the problems.

49

00:03:02,680  -->  00:03:04,660
OK that being said.

50

00:03:04,710  -->  00:03:06,490
Best of luck on these riddles.

51

00:03:06,570  -->  00:03:08,550
They're presented as Jupiter notebooks.

52

00:03:08,820  -->  00:03:13,920
So the first Jupiter note book will present the problem and then the second one will present the solution

53

00:03:13,920  -->  00:03:14,410
.

54

00:03:14,460  -->  00:03:19,630
We'll walk through the solution for all of them after we present the problem statement to you.

55

00:03:20,040  -->  00:03:20,910
OK.

56

00:03:20,910  -->  00:03:22,040
Best of luck on the Riddell's
