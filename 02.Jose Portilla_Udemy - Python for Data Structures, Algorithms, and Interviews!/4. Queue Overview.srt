Hello everyone and welcome to the Q overview lecture.

2

00:00:04,650  -->  00:00:08,050
So we've learned about stacks and implemented our own stack class.

3

00:00:08,070  -->  00:00:11,380
Let's go ahead and now learn about queues.

4

00:00:11,460  -->  00:00:16,500
So as I mentioned we'll get an overview of what is in this lecture and in the next lecture we're going

5

00:00:16,500  -->  00:00:19,810
to implement her own Q class.

6

00:00:19,820  -->  00:00:25,470
So AQ is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end called the

7

00:00:25,470  -->  00:00:31,620
rear and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end which is called the Front as an element

8

00:00:31,680  -->  00:00:32,700
enters a queue.

9

00:00:32,700  -->  00:00:35,700
It starts at the rear and makes its way towards the front.

10

00:00:35,700  -->  00:00:40,970
Waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.

11

00:00:41,100  -->  00:00:47,100
So the most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection the item that has

12

00:00:47,100  -->  00:00:50,330
been in the collection the longest is at the front.

13

00:00:50,400  -->  00:00:57,210
So this ordering principle is sometimes called First in first out or F I O by for FIFO.

14

00:00:57,210  -->  00:00:58,830
Anyhow you want to pronounce it.

15

00:00:59,010  -->  00:01:02,430
It's also known sometimes as first come first serve.

16

00:01:03,360  -->  00:01:09,120
So the simplest example of a Q is a typical line that we all participate from time to time so we can

17

00:01:09,120  -->  00:01:14,070
wait in line for a movie or a checkout line at a grocery store or a cafeteria.

18

00:01:14,070  -->  00:01:19,580
The first person in that line is also the first person to get serviced or helped.

19

00:01:19,680  -->  00:01:21,990
So that's the parallel and why the naming scheme is.

20

00:01:21,990  -->  00:01:23,030
Q In this case.

21

00:01:23,040  -->  00:01:26,460
So first in first out.

22

00:01:26,670  -->  00:01:33,240
So for example in this figure we have two new terms here and q or on Q and then dequeue are they.

23

00:01:33,240  -->  00:01:35,450
Q pending how you pronounce it.

24

00:01:35,520  -->  00:01:37,970
So we had the back front of the queue.

25

00:01:38,620  -->  00:01:46,440
So NQ term describes when we add a new item to that rear of the queue and a cute term describes removing

26

00:01:46,440  -->  00:01:49,540
the front item from the queue.

27

00:01:49,680  -->  00:01:54,840
So when we're thinking about how this relates to the push and pop methods that we saw in that stack

28

00:01:54,840  -->  00:02:01,570
implementation in this case as we push items into the queue they're the first in.

29

00:02:01,740  -->  00:02:06,270
But as we pop them out those first in items are also the first to come out.

30

00:02:06,270  -->  00:02:09,210
So you can see how this is different than a stack.

31

00:02:09,210  -->  00:02:15,250
So remember stack was last in first out in this case we're first in first out.

32

00:02:15,270  -->  00:02:17,890
So keep that in mind.

33

00:02:18,090  -->  00:02:22,040
So you should now have a basic understanding of what a queue is.

34

00:02:22,170  -->  00:02:27,950
And that first in first out principle for them in the next lecture we can actually implement our own

35

00:02:27,960  -->  00:02:29,260
Q class.

36

00:02:29,650  -->  00:02:30,300
OK.

37

00:02:30,570  -->  00:02:34,170
So go ahead and review this lecture in case anything was unclear to you.

38

00:02:34,170  -->  00:02:36,710
There's also a Jupiter note book that goes along with the lectures.

39

00:02:36,720  -->  00:02:38,380
You can check it out as well.

40

00:02:38,410  -->  00:02:42,630
You can check out the resource for the PowerPoint that we went over in this lecture.

41

00:02:42,630  -->  00:02:47,130
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture where we're going to implement our own

42

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:47,880
cute class
