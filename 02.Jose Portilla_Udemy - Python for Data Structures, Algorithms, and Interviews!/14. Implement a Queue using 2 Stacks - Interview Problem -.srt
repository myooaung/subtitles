00:00:01,410  -->  00:00:07,470
Hello everyone and welcome to your final interview question with the stacks Qs and decks portion of

2

00:00:07,470  -->  00:00:08,980
this course.

3

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:14,250
So your question or assignment for this problem is this implementer.

4

00:00:14,260  -->  00:00:21,180
Q Using two stacks so you're going to be given a stack class below and what it wants to do is implement

5

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:24,330
a q class using two stacks.

6

00:00:24,330  -->  00:00:26,920
You should also note this is a classic interview problem.

7

00:00:26,920  -->  00:00:32,880
She should really know this one but I want to do is use a python list data structure as your stack.

8

00:00:33,330  -->  00:00:39,330
So instead of having to create your own stack class what I'm going to do is say this list is a stack

9

00:00:39,420  -->  00:00:41,850
class so here stack one.

10

00:00:41,850  -->  00:00:42,980
It's just an empty list.

11

00:00:43,020  -->  00:00:44,170
And here stacked two.

12

00:00:44,240  -->  00:00:46,370
It's an empty list.

13

00:00:46,530  -->  00:00:48,250
And so your solution right here.

14

00:00:48,510  -->  00:00:57,060
You're given a class was going to zoom in on it called Q two stacks and here are your two stacks those

15

00:00:57,060  -->  00:00:57,940
empty lists.

16

00:00:57,960  -->  00:01:01,540
I've already set them up as self-taught stack one self-taught stack two.

17

00:01:01,720  -->  00:01:08,250
And what I want to do is fill out these two methods so that you're essentially creating a cue using

18

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:10,370
these two stacks.

19

00:01:10,740  -->  00:01:12,890
You can go ahead and test your solution here.

20

00:01:13,290  -->  00:01:18,510
Well you should be able to do with your current knowledge of stacks and queues you should be able to

21

00:01:18,510  -->  00:01:20,340
tell it to working as it should.

22

00:01:20,610  -->  00:01:25,660
So for example the following should print as such here.

23

00:01:25,760  -->  00:01:30,270
So Friday x range 5 and an x range 5 when you're calling on Q&A.

24

00:01:30,330  -->  00:01:36,090
Q Is this something that looks like this so go ahead and run the cell and make sure that your solution

25

00:01:36,090  -->  00:01:42,290
output makes sense and behaves as a cue that you've built out of two stacks.

26

00:01:42,320  -->  00:01:47,070
You need a quick reminder on what stacks and queues look like and operate.

27

00:01:47,160  -->  00:01:52,020
You can go ahead and check out the theory lectures on them trying out to check out the actual implementation

28

00:01:52,020  -->  00:01:56,770
of lectures until you've given your fair shot at this interview problem.

29

00:01:56,790  -->  00:01:57,440
All right.

30

00:01:57,650  -->  00:02:02,100
With that being said I'll see you at the next lecture where we're going to be going over the solution

31

00:02:02,100  -->  00:02:03,500
to this problem.

32

00:02:03,510  -->  00:02:05,010
Thanks everyone.
