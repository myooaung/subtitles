Hello everyone and welcome to your next interview.

2

00:00:03,290  -->  00:00:05,880
Question for the tree section of the Course.

3

00:00:05,880  -->  00:00:08,760
This one's called tree level order prints.

4

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:11,550
So you're given a binary tree of integers.

5

00:00:11,640  -->  00:00:14,290
And what we want to do is print it in level order.

6

00:00:14,370  -->  00:00:17,470
The output will contain space between the numbers and the same level.

7

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:19,780
And the new line between different levels.

8

00:00:19,800  -->  00:00:27,980
So for example imagine that given this tree where the is one left to the right of the root is three

9

00:00:28,420  -->  00:00:34,890
and then you have four or five six so you have three levels to this tree your output given a tree that

10

00:00:34,890  -->  00:00:37,720
looks like this should look like this.

11

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:41,210
One two three four five six.

12

00:00:41,220  -->  00:00:46,640
So your function if you were given something that looked like this for a node class let's say left or

13

00:00:46,640  -->  00:00:54,660
right now should be able to take in a tree just take in whatever tree and then you can go ahead and

14

00:00:54,660  -->  00:00:55,680
be creative.

15

00:00:55,680  -->  00:01:02,370
As I mentioned in the previous interview problem go ahead and call right left vowel or whatever node

16

00:01:02,370  -->  00:01:04,360
properties you want off that tree.

17

00:01:04,550  -->  00:01:10,100
So we want you to do is print out the levels of the tree as such.

18

00:01:10,510  -->  00:01:11,060
OK.

19

00:01:11,340  -->  00:01:15,870
So this is more of a traversal problem and again you might want to take your time with it.

20

00:01:15,870  -->  00:01:20,070
Think about what we learned about tree traversals and how you would print this out and go through this

21

00:01:20,070  -->  00:01:23,650
tree essentially in all levels as you're printing it out.

22

00:01:24,030  -->  00:01:29,760
OK with that being said again just given a binary tree of integers prints it in level order.

23

00:01:29,760  -->  00:01:31,810
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
