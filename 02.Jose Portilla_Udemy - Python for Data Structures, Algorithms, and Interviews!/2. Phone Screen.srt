Hello and welcome to the phone screen problem for the social network company mock interview questions

2

00:00:07,850  -->  00:00:08,510
.

3

00:00:08,670  -->  00:00:15,870
So the problem statement is this remove duplicate characters in a given string keeping only the first

4

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:17,050
occurrences.

5

00:00:17,430  -->  00:00:26,890
So for example if the input is a string tree traversal the output will be t r e space a v s l.

6

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:33,000
So I notice that since you haven't already occurring the second Ian tree gets removed as well as the

7

00:00:33,050  -->  00:00:40,340
E and traversal and then the t r get removed because they're already in tree.

8

00:00:40,350  -->  00:00:41,040
OK.

9

00:00:41,700  -->  00:00:47,880
So write a function again that removes duplicate characters in a given string keeping only the first

10

00:00:47,880  -->  00:00:49,580
occurrences.

11

00:00:49,620  -->  00:00:55,170
So your requirements for this problem is to complete the problem in a text editor that does not have

12

00:00:55,170  -->  00:01:01,120
syntax highlighting such as a Google doc or any word processor a text editor.

13

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:07,950
Again as we've stated before a lot of phone screens will just have you screen sharing on a normal text

14

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:10,730
editor that doesn't have syntax highlighting.

15

00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:17,610
So it's important to practice writing out code without syntax highlighting or automatic indentation

16

00:01:17,660  -->  00:01:18,320
.

17

00:01:18,320  -->  00:01:23,610
Now again don't worry if it's perfect it doesn't have to run but at least get the general concept of

18

00:01:23,610  -->  00:01:29,550
what you're trying to do and then you can go to either Jupiter or notebook or any other ideas and test

19

00:01:29,550  -->  00:01:31,080
out your code.

20

00:01:31,080  -->  00:01:31,500
All right.

21

00:01:31,500  -->  00:01:32,960
With that being said.

22

00:01:33,000  -->  00:01:35,440
Best of luck and I'll see you at the next lecture.
