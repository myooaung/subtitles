Hello everyone and welcome to the solution to the jugs of water problem.

2

00:00:05,790  -->  00:00:09,790
So this problem actually has a kind of a famous cameo in the movie Die Hard three.

3

00:00:10,080  -->  00:00:14,670
So I've written out here the solution below a walk through it that if you scroll down on the solution

4

00:00:14,670  -->  00:00:17,990
up book you also see a reference to the movie here.

5

00:00:18,030  -->  00:00:18,610
OK.

6

00:00:18,900  -->  00:00:22,200
So hopefully your injury is not a stressful as the diehard situation.

7

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:24,930
Well let's go ahead and walk through the solution.

8

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:28,900
So first action you take is filled the five gallon jug.

9

00:00:28,950  -->  00:00:34,950
So you have five gallons in the five gallon jug and the three gallon jug is empty then fill up the three

10

00:00:34,950  -->  00:00:37,300
gallon jug of water from the five gallon jug.

11

00:00:37,470  -->  00:00:42,350
So now you have three gallons of the three gallon jug and only two in the five gallon jug.

12

00:00:42,540  -->  00:00:48,350
Then you pour out the three gallon jug transfer the two gallons in the five gallon jug.

13

00:00:48,400  -->  00:00:49,780
The three gallon jug.

14

00:00:50,220  -->  00:00:52,970
Then you fill up the five gallon jug.

15

00:00:53,460  -->  00:00:54,490
And then here's the trick.

16

00:00:54,510  -->  00:01:00,450
You transfer water from the five gallon jug to the three gallon jug.

17

00:01:01,260  -->  00:01:04,230
Since the three gallon jug was already full to gallons.

18

00:01:04,260  -->  00:01:08,110
You know the empty space and it only had room for one more gallon less.

19

00:01:08,250  -->  00:01:10,570
So that five minus one becomes four.

20

00:01:10,710  -->  00:01:13,430
And now you have four gallons.

21

00:01:13,500  -->  00:01:14,060
All right.

22

00:01:14,190  -->  00:01:15,300
That's it for this solution.

23

00:01:15,300  -->  00:01:16,680
Walk through it.

24

00:01:16,680  -->  00:01:21,660
Make sure you should have understood logically that since you're being asked for four gallons you should

25

00:01:21,660  -->  00:01:26,250
have immediately noted that the only jug that would have ended up with those four gallons is the five

26

00:01:26,250  -->  00:01:27,090
gallon jug.

27

00:01:27,330  -->  00:01:30,950
So you could have started logically based on that fact alone.

28

00:01:30,980  -->  00:01:33,590
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you in the next lecture
