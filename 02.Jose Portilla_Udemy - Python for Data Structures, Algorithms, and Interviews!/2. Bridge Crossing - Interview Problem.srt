Hello everyone and welcome to your first riddle slash puzzle problem for this section of the course

2

00:00:07,560  -->  00:00:08,050
.

3

00:00:08,340  -->  00:00:10,310
Here's the problem statement.

4

00:00:10,360  -->  00:00:14,730
There's a group of four travelers that's coming across a bridge at night.

5

00:00:14,730  -->  00:00:16,080
So it's dark.

6

00:00:16,200  -->  00:00:22,170
The bridge can only hold the way that most two travelers at a time and it cannot be crossed without

7

00:00:22,170  -->  00:00:24,290
using a flashlight.

8

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:31,110
However for travelers only have one flashlight among them each traveler also walks at a different speed

9

00:00:31,110  -->  00:00:31,680
.

10

00:00:31,680  -->  00:00:34,680
The first traveler can cross the bridge in one minute.

11

00:00:34,680  -->  00:00:40,540
The second in two minutes the third and five minutes and the fourth person takes ten minutes across

12

00:00:40,610  -->  00:00:41,630
a bridge.

13

00:00:42,120  -->  00:00:48,900
Here's the challenge if two travelers cross together at the bridge at the same time they have to both

14

00:00:48,900  -->  00:00:51,450
walk at the speed of the slower traveler.

15

00:00:51,480  -->  00:00:57,240
So for instance if the person that can cross a bridge in one minute walks along the bridge with a 10

16

00:00:57,240  -->  00:01:02,940
minute traveler then they both have to walk at ten minute pace and they both take 10 minutes to cross

17

00:01:02,940  -->  00:01:04,930
the bridge.

18

00:01:05,190  -->  00:01:05,610
All right.

19

00:01:05,790  -->  00:01:11,400
So your question is What does the least amount of time in which all the travelers can cross from one

20

00:01:11,400  -->  00:01:14,030
side of the bridge to the other.

21

00:01:14,040  -->  00:01:20,490
Remember the bridge can only hold two people at once and one person has to be carrying that flashlight

22

00:01:21,570  -->  00:01:27,300
and if two travelers cross together they walk at the speed of the slower traveler.

23

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:27,990
All right.

24

00:01:27,990  -->  00:01:28,560
Best of luck.

25

00:01:28,560  -->  00:01:30,970
You definitely want to draw this out.

26

00:01:30,990  -->  00:01:36,330
So practice using a pen and paper or a white board to try to draw out your logic of how you would have

27

00:01:36,330  -->  00:01:41,440
people cross the bridge for the slowest or excuse me for the least amount of time possible.

28

00:01:41,940  -->  00:01:42,780
OK everyone.

29

00:01:42,780  -->  00:01:44,110
Best of luck.
