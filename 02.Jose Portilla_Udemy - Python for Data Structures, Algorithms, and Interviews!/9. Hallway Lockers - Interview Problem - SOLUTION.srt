Hello everyone and welcome to the solution for the hallway lockers problem.

2

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:10,710
This is probably one of the trickier ones out of these riddles so let's go ahead and walk through the

3

00:00:10,710  -->  00:00:11,450
written solution.

4

00:00:11,450  -->  00:00:18,420
The notebook so obviously just Camb. brute force and turn out this problem since there's 100 passes

5

00:00:18,490  -->  00:00:18,880
.

6

00:00:18,880  -->  00:00:20,030
There's just too many to count.

7

00:00:20,070  -->  00:00:23,060
So you'll need to think about this algorithmically.

8

00:00:23,130  -->  00:00:28,440
So let's begin by solving this problem choosing an arbitrary locker and see if we can then detect the

9

00:00:28,440  -->  00:00:30,260
pattern.

10

00:00:30,540  -->  00:00:36,810
So we'll start by choosing just Lochore 12 and then seeing if it's been toggled open after your first

11

00:00:36,810  -->  00:00:37,890
pass.

12

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:42,970
So to start off we know we won't have to toggle it on any Pask greater than 12.

13

00:00:43,290  -->  00:00:47,590
So we just have to think of the passes that occur on 2 through 11.

14

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:49,480
Now we're actually going to be able to count these out.

15

00:00:49,500  -->  00:00:53,850
Remember it's a good strategy to get smaller subproblems.

16

00:00:53,880  -->  00:00:57,070
And in this case we're just looking at singular locker.

17

00:00:57,090  -->  00:01:03,930
So if we count these out we know on past Number two we're going to toggle two four six eight 10 12 or

18

00:01:03,930  -->  00:01:13,200
past three we toggle lockers 3 6 9 and 12 past four we toggle 4 8 and 12 on past five.

19

00:01:13,320  -->  00:01:18,470
We don't toggle the number 12 locker we just go 5 and 10 and then we've passed 12 already.

20

00:01:18,480  -->  00:01:25,260
So we don't title it on past 6 we do 6 and 2 up on past 7 which is 7 and 14.

21

00:01:25,260  -->  00:01:28,030
There's no toggle on that pass etc..

22

00:01:28,350  -->  00:01:30,460
So hopefully now you're seeing a pattern emerging.

23

00:01:30,460  -->  00:01:37,710
We're only toggling the locker when the past number is a factor of the locker number and we can begin

24

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:44,340
to make the generalization that all lockers started open after the first pass and alternate between

25

00:01:44,340  -->  00:01:46,080
being open and closed.

26

00:01:46,380  -->  00:01:53,210
So lockers are closed after a second fourth six and so on times there are a toggle.

27

00:01:53,250  -->  00:01:59,490
In other words if a walker is toggled an even number of times then it ends close.

28

00:01:59,490  -->  00:02:05,970
Otherwise it ends open and you know that a Locker's toggled once for every factor of the locker number

29

00:02:05,970  -->  00:02:06,460
.

30

00:02:06,570  -->  00:02:12,070
So you can say that a locker is open only if it has an odd number of factors.

31

00:02:12,090  -->  00:02:18,780
So we've now been able to reduce the task to finding how many numbers between 1 and 100 have an odd

32

00:02:18,930  -->  00:02:20,750
number of factors.

33

00:02:21,120  -->  00:02:28,710
So we can think about this in the following manner if we have a number I is a factor and we want to

34

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:30,270
know what that means.

35

00:02:30,270  -->  00:02:34,350
It means that I timed some other number let's say J is equal to.

36

00:02:34,390  -->  00:02:42,510
And so because multiplication is competitive we can say I times J equals eight times I and that means

37

00:02:42,510  -->  00:02:44,110
that J is a factor.

38

00:02:44,150  -->  00:02:45,150
And as well.

39

00:02:45,440  -->  00:02:50,470
So the number of factors is usually even because factors tend to come in pairs.

40

00:02:50,700  -->  00:02:56,560
And if she can find numbers that have unpaired factors you will know which Locker's will be open.

41

00:02:56,610  -->  00:03:00,000
So multiplication isn't a binary operation.

42

00:03:00,150  -->  00:03:03,270
So you have two numbers will always be involved.

43

00:03:03,420  -->  00:03:07,080
But what if they're the same number so i equal J.

44

00:03:07,380  -->  00:03:13,860
In that case a single number would effectively form both halves of the pair and there would be an odd

45

00:03:13,860  -->  00:03:15,360
number of factors.

46

00:03:15,480  -->  00:03:17,100
And when this is the case.

47

00:03:17,220  -->  00:03:19,110
Times equals N.

48

00:03:19,410  -->  00:03:23,450
So then we can say that N must be a perfect square.

49

00:03:23,910  -->  00:03:28,650
So go ahead and try a perfect square to check the solutions reasoning.

50

00:03:28,650  -->  00:03:35,660
So for example for 16 the factors are 1 2 4 8 16.

51

00:03:35,790  -->  00:03:43,290
And those operations would then be open on one close on two open for close on 8 open on 16.

52

00:03:43,290  -->  00:03:47,360
So as you expected it ends open since 16 is a perfect square.

53

00:03:47,370  -->  00:03:48,770
Four times four.

54

00:03:49,230  -->  00:03:54,030
So based on this reasoning you can actually conclude that only Locker's of numbers that are perfect

55

00:03:54,030  -->  00:04:03,390
squares end up open and the perfect squares between 1 and 100 including one and 100 are 1 4 9 16 25

56

00:04:03,390  -->  00:04:05,820
36 49 etc..

57

00:04:05,940  -->  00:04:11,760
So one square to square three squared four squared five squared continuously until you get to 10 squared

58

00:04:11,760  -->  00:04:12,190
.

59

00:04:12,240  -->  00:04:16,820
So that means 10 Locker's would remain open.

60

00:04:16,950  -->  00:04:22,470
All right I know we went through that kind of fast but you have the solution book to read through if

61

00:04:22,470  -->  00:04:25,080
you want to look at other solutions.

62

00:04:25,110  -->  00:04:28,950
It's the same standard solution but other explanations for it.

63

00:04:29,190  -->  00:04:33,810
You can just look up hallway Lochore 100 on Google and you'll see it.

64

00:04:33,810  -->  00:04:38,800
This is actually a fairly common puzzle but that being said makes me read through the solution.

65

00:04:38,820  -->  00:04:43,050
I know we went through it kind of fast here but really you should just take the time to draw it out

66

00:04:43,090  -->  00:04:43,270
.

67

00:04:43,330  -->  00:04:48,710
It makes you understand that you're just looking for the number of perfect squares between 1 and 100

68

00:04:48,730  -->  00:04:49,320
.

69

00:04:49,890  -->  00:04:50,490
All right.

70

00:04:50,850  -->  00:04:51,840
That's it.

71

00:04:51,840  -->  00:04:53,700
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
