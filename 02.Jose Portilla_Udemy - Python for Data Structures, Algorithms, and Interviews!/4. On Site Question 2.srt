Hello and welcome to the second onsight question for the social network company mock interview here's

2

00:00:08,040  -->  00:00:16,110
your problem statement given a list consisting of a count ID numbers in the form of integers which contains

3

00:00:16,120  -->  00:00:19,820
duplicates find the one unique integer.

4

00:00:20,280  -->  00:00:25,620
The list will be guaranteed to only have one unique non duplicated integer.

5

00:00:26,130  -->  00:00:30,680
Some requirements do not use built in Python functions or methods.

6

00:00:30,870  -->  00:00:36,330
However you can go ahead and feel free to code this out in a group or a notebook or an ID of your choice

7

00:00:36,330  -->  00:00:36,900
.

8

00:00:37,410  -->  00:00:49,530
So to give you an example you may have a list that goes 1 1 2 to 3 so you have duplicates of the integer

9

00:00:49,530  -->  00:00:55,080
1 and the integer 2 but the integer 3 is unique.

10

00:00:55,080  -->  00:01:00,100
So your function should be able to take in that list and find that one unique integer.

11

00:01:00,110  -->  00:01:04,960
Sorry keep in time you want to do or keep in mind you want to do this efficiently.

12

00:01:05,100  -->  00:01:09,210
So keep in mind Big O and how that can affect your function.

13

00:01:09,390  -->  00:01:11,180
All right with that being said.

14

00:01:11,190  -->  00:01:13,230
Best of luck and I'll see you at the next lecture
