Hello everyone and welcome to the array interview problems.

2

00:00:04.590  -->  00:00:07.600
Half of this section of the course.

3

00:00:08.010  -->  00:00:14.280
So as you already know technical sections are essentially split up into two parts theory and learning

4

00:00:14.280  -->  00:00:18.990
exercises and then the interview problems and solutions.

5

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:24.120
So sometimes that theory lines up really well with common interview questions.

6

00:00:24.240  -->  00:00:27.720
And unfortunately this isn't actually the case with a raise.

7

00:00:27.750  -->  00:00:33.030
Most likely you're going to find that the injury problems here just for the section don't have much

8

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:37.860
in common with the theory and exercise lectures and that's just because of the way array based questions

9

00:00:37.860  -->  00:00:40.720
are asked in interviews.

10

00:00:40.770  -->  00:00:47.390
So another thing to mention on the array interview problems is don't use Python tricks when answering

11

00:00:47.410  -->  00:00:52.190
the interview problems and this will also be noted in specific interview problems.

12

00:00:52.200  -->  00:00:55.010
So for example if you're asked to reverse a string.

13

00:00:55.170  -->  00:01:01.110
Don't use a python slicing trick since your interviewer isn't really looking for that.

14

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:06.910
Again these interview problems will seem very challenging if you find yourself completely stuck.

15

00:01:06.930  -->  00:01:09.730
Try writing out what you would do manually to solve the problem.

16

00:01:09.870  -->  00:01:14.710
Just brute force solution and it's highly suggested you try solving these.

17

00:01:14.730  -->  00:01:16.310
Pen and paper or a white board.

18

00:01:16.310  -->  00:01:23.010
First don't just code out your solution so using a white board or pen and paper for a problem makes

19

00:01:23.010  -->  00:01:24.500
it much harder.

20

00:01:24.540  -->  00:01:28.270
You're completely stuck on a problem and I've already tried brute forcing it.

21

00:01:28.270  -->  00:01:29.390
Is it one or two days.

22

00:01:29.400  -->  00:01:30.300
Try it again.

23

00:01:30.450  -->  00:01:36.600
And if you're still stuck look at the solution and code it out then wait one or two days and try the

24

00:01:36.600  -->  00:01:39.060
problem again on pen and paper.

25

00:01:39.060  -->  00:01:43.860
Keep in mind what the requirements are for that specific interview problem.

26

00:01:43.860  -->  00:01:47.930
So again the lectures alternate between problems and their solutions.

27

00:01:47.940  -->  00:01:50.320
So just keep that in mind.

28

00:01:50.640  -->  00:01:56.720
But that being said good luck you got this thanks and I'll see you at the first interview problem.
