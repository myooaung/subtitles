00:00:01,290  -->  00:00:05,560
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on job search sites.

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:09,900
So we're going to discuss a variety of sites and job boards and you can go ahead and check out the next

3

00:00:09,900  -->  00:00:16,070
lecture for continuously updated list of links that we're going to discuss in this lecture series couldn't

4

00:00:16,070  -->  00:00:16,820
jump to a browser.

5

00:00:16,830  -->  00:00:21,540
Check out the sites again quick reminder in the next lecture there there's a list of all the sites that

6

00:00:21,540  -->  00:00:22,550
we check out here.

7

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:24,200
But the URL.

8

00:00:24,360  -->  00:00:27,090
So let's jump to the browser.

9

00:00:27,360  -->  00:00:33,170
OK everyone first say I want to let you know about is Angel dot co slash jobs.

10

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:39,480
This is focusing exclusively on startup jobs so you can go out and apply to thousands of jobs or just

11

00:00:39,480  -->  00:00:40,740
one profile.

12

00:00:40,740  -->  00:00:44,770
What's also nice about this is usually see salary and equity upfront.

13

00:00:45,090  -->  00:00:46,830
Now a lot of times they're inflated.

14

00:00:46,860  -->  00:00:51,870
So just keep that in mind when you're applying to companies here but you can go in to make a profile

15

00:00:51,990  -->  00:00:56,320
and remember this is focusing exclusively on startup jobs.

16

00:00:56,340  -->  00:00:59,670
So up next is glass door.

17

00:00:59,700  -->  00:01:05,970
So glass door in case you're not familiar with it is a job review site so you can actually review your

18

00:01:05,970  -->  00:01:08,340
current job or more your current company.

19

00:01:08,370  -->  00:01:14,160
So people working at a company let's say Google if they're enjoying their job they give feedback to

20

00:01:14,160  -->  00:01:19,560
glass door and say hey I rate Google of five stars out of five stars to work here.

21

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:25,740
Now Glassdoor also has a job search so you can look up a job location search and see if there's any

22

00:01:25,740  -->  00:01:28,020
connections that way.

23

00:01:28,020  -->  00:01:36,090
Next up is LinkedIn LinkedIn has its own job search tool that you can use and you need Illington profile

24

00:01:36,090  -->  00:01:36,880
to use it.

25

00:01:37,200  -->  00:01:42,170
And as I mentioned back in the Linked-In lectures if you have linked in premium or on the Linked-In

26

00:01:42,180  -->  00:01:48,440
premium free trial you'll get extra information about the people who are applying to the same job you

27

00:01:48,440  -->  00:01:48,800
are.

28

00:01:48,810  -->  00:01:51,920
So it may give you an advantage there.

29

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:57,730
After that there is indeed that calm and needs a general search job search engine.

30

00:01:57,740  -->  00:02:02,850
So you just put in your job title keywords or company name your location and then you can go out and

31

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:05,040
search for it.

32

00:02:05,040  -->  00:02:08,190
After that there's monster you may have heard of monster it's pretty famous.

33

00:02:08,190  -->  00:02:12,570
It was one of the first job hunting slash job searching Web sites.

34

00:02:12,580  -->  00:02:15,480
Again put in your job title search for location.

35

00:02:15,480  -->  00:02:20,070
See if anything pops up that matches this really similar.

36

00:02:20,080  -->  00:02:23,640
It's more focused on the tech side of job search just keep that in mind.

37

00:02:24,060  -->  00:02:27,490
Again quitting your job title keywords you're looking for location.

38

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:30,390
Then find tech jobs.

39

00:02:30,630  -->  00:02:33,790
After that there is Stack Overflow careers.

40

00:02:33,930  -->  00:02:39,300
So if you ever had an air and were looking up air hints or how to fix your code you probably ran a stack

41

00:02:39,330  -->  00:02:40,140
overflow.

42

00:02:40,290  -->  00:02:46,080
So Stack Overflow also has a careers section where you can put in keywords your location and search

43

00:02:46,080  -->  00:02:49,060
for jobs on their listings.

44

00:02:49,170  -->  00:02:55,290
If you're looking to get into Android development there's Android jobs the IO and will be focusing more

45

00:02:55,290  -->  00:02:57,780
exclusively on just Android development.

46

00:02:57,780  -->  00:03:04,410
So keep that in mind that you want that as an option another job search site is simply hired dot com

47

00:03:04,740  -->  00:03:10,810
similar to indeed dot com in the keywords location and you search your jobs.

48

00:03:10,860  -->  00:03:15,300
And then finally if you're looking for an internship right now there's a Web site called W.W. that look

49

00:03:15,300  -->  00:03:15,690
sharp.

50

00:03:15,710  -->  00:03:22,620
Dot com which focuses exclusively on internships for trying to help students find careers and entry

51

00:03:22,620  -->  00:03:23,940
level jobs.

52

00:03:24,000  -->  00:03:25,690
Again all of these are tech jobs.

53

00:03:25,710  -->  00:03:26,670
Most of them are not.

54

00:03:26,670  -->  00:03:29,930
So just keep them in mind when looking at through this Web site.

55

00:03:30,660  -->  00:03:33,100
So that's it for all the job Web sites.

56

00:03:33,120  -->  00:03:37,540
Make sure you check them out on your own time see which ones you like and use those.

57

00:03:37,560  -->  00:03:41,730
I won't go into any more details here because you have the links in the next lecture.

58

00:03:41,810  -->  00:03:44,010
You can check them out on your own time.

59

00:03:44,010  -->  00:03:44,460
All right.

60

00:03:44,550  -->  00:03:47,190
But that being said I'll see you at the next lecture.

61

00:03:47,190  -->  00:03:47,760
Thanks everyone
