Hello everyone and welcome to the algorithm analysis and a Big O notation section of this course.

2

00:00:07.320  -->  00:00:12.540
This is just a brief overview video describing what this section will be like.

3

00:00:12.540  -->  00:00:18.570
So as I mentioned in the section we discuss Big-O notation and we discuss it from a level of why we're

4

00:00:18.570  -->  00:00:24.320
doing algorithm analysis to begin with and how we can actually construct the paradigm of thinking for

5

00:00:24.330  -->  00:00:25.940
Big O notation.

6

00:00:25.950  -->  00:00:30.630
So if you're already familiar Big-O notation maybe you've already taken in algorithms and data structures

7

00:00:30.630  -->  00:00:33.500
class and you've covered it and understand this already.

8

00:00:33.570  -->  00:00:36.320
Feel free to just look over the Jupiter notebooks.

9

00:00:36.330  -->  00:00:39.900
Take the quiz at the end of the section and quiz yourself if you've passed all of them then you're probably

10

00:00:39.900  -->  00:00:40.920
good to go.

11

00:00:41.250  -->  00:00:44.130
If not feel free to watch the lectures and follow along.

12

00:00:44.130  -->  00:00:50.130
Throughout this section this section approaches the topic as if you've never heard of Big O notation

13

00:00:50.130  -->  00:00:50.510
before.

14

00:00:50.510  -->  00:00:56.130
So just keep that in mind as always links the note books are provided in the additional resource section

15

00:00:56.130  -->  00:00:58.370
of this lecture so go ahead and check them out.

16

00:00:58.410  -->  00:01:02.400
There's a link to the NBA viewer as well as the hub notebooks.

17

00:01:02.460  -->  00:01:04.800
OK with that all being said lets go ahead and begin
