Hello everyone and welcome to lecture on salary questions and answers.

2

00:00:06,390  -->  00:00:11,070
So in this lecture we're going to go over a few SALIR related questions and some appropriate answer

3

00:00:11,070  -->  00:00:12,790
strategies for them.

4

00:00:12,810  -->  00:00:17,040
There's really no need to pause and practice these sort of questions until you're actually getting interviews

5

00:00:17,040  -->  00:00:19,130
and offers.

6

00:00:19,230  -->  00:00:23,680
So the first question is what kind of salary are you looking for.

7

00:00:23,850  -->  00:00:27,050
So attempt to get the company to make the first offer.

8

00:00:27,150  -->  00:00:32,070
Most negotiating professionals believe that whoever brings up salary first loses in the negotiating

9

00:00:32,070  -->  00:00:32,760
game.

10

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:36,830
So if possible try to deflect the question so you don't disclose an exact number.

11

00:00:36,830  -->  00:00:43,470
First another question is what is your current salary.

12

00:00:43,890  -->  00:00:49,650
So bear in mind that what you earn has no direct bearing on what your work and what you want to make

13

00:00:50,160  -->  00:00:55,430
though it can be difficult to support this in an interview without seeming defensive or awkward.

14

00:00:55,440  -->  00:01:00,510
So although the interviewer is looking for specifics here you can be somewhat elusive in general without

15

00:01:00,510  -->  00:01:04,860
compromising the quality of your response.

16

00:01:04,990  -->  00:01:09,070
You know the question is What would you like to be earning five years from now.

17

00:01:09,810  -->  00:01:13,270
Here the interviewer is most likely just trying to gauge your ambitions.

18

00:01:13,320  -->  00:01:18,600
So this is a good time to be honest of your aspirations to try to assess what the interviewer is looking

19

00:01:18,600  -->  00:01:20,370
for with this question.

20

00:01:20,390  -->  00:01:21,640
It's a pretty uncommon question.

21

00:01:21,660  -->  00:01:25,740
You're more likely just to be asked Where do you see yourself in five years not what you're going to

22

00:01:25,740  -->  00:01:28,230
be exactly earning.

23

00:01:28,260  -->  00:01:31,020
All right that's it for this specific salary questions.

24

00:01:31,020  -->  00:01:33,770
Up next we're going to cover how to prepare references.

25

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:36,940
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
