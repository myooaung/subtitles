Hello everyone and welcome to your next riddle.

2

00:00:03,600  -->  00:00:06,080
This film called jugs of water.

3

00:00:06,150  -->  00:00:09,240
It's kind of famous but maybe you haven't heard it before.

4

00:00:09,240  -->  00:00:10,720
Here's a problem statement.

5

00:00:10,860  -->  00:00:16,800
You have two jugs a five gallon jug and a three gallon jug and you have an unlimited supply of water

6

00:00:17,340  -->  00:00:19,270
but you don't have any measuring cups.

7

00:00:19,470  -->  00:00:24,920
So using only these two jugs the five gallon jug and the three gallon jug.

8

00:00:25,230  -->  00:00:31,040
How would you come up with exactly four gallons of water inside one of the jugs.

9

00:00:31,050  -->  00:00:32,010
All right.

10

00:00:32,010  -->  00:00:33,960
Best of luck and I'll see at the next lecture
