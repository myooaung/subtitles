00:00:01.140  -->  00:00:06.270
Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on special case interview questions.

2

00:00:06.270  -->  00:00:09.090
So these questions won't apply to everyone.

3

00:00:09.120  -->  00:00:12.730
It's only practice the ones you feel apply to you personally.

4

00:00:13.050  -->  00:00:18.630
Again after each question posited an attempt to answer if you feel the question applies to you after

5

00:00:18.630  -->  00:00:22.910
that will give you some general advice on how to approach that particular question.

6

00:00:23.280  -->  00:00:25.500
So let's get started.

7

00:00:25.500  -->  00:00:30.080
First question is how do you explain the gaps that appear in your resume.

8

00:00:30.090  -->  00:00:32.930
Go ahead and pause the video now.

9

00:00:34.350  -->  00:00:40.200
OK so if you have long breaks unemployment or a number of gaps you should prepare a brief and credible

10

00:00:40.200  -->  00:00:41.390
response.

11

00:00:41.400  -->  00:00:45.870
Make sure you're able to convince the interviewer that you won't be moving on to a new job soon after

12

00:00:45.870  -->  00:00:48.150
taking this one.

13

00:00:48.180  -->  00:00:52.130
The next question is Why has it taken you so long to find work.

14

00:00:52.140  -->  00:00:55.870
Go ahead and post the video now.

15

00:00:55.950  -->  00:00:56.340
All right.

16

00:00:56.430  -->  00:01:00.080
So you want to provide a short concise account of why you've been out of work.

17

00:01:00.090  -->  00:01:02.940
And be sure the interviewer knows that you've been working on yourself.

18

00:01:02.940  -->  00:01:04.830
Your skill set and your career.

19

00:01:04.830  -->  00:01:07.320
While you've been out of a job.

20

00:01:07.380  -->  00:01:11.190
Next question is Have you ever been fired.

21

00:01:11.190  -->  00:01:16.140
Go ahead and pause the video now if possible.

22

00:01:16.140  -->  00:01:18.660
You want to avoid answering this in the affirmative.

23

00:01:18.660  -->  00:01:22.780
Try using the terms layoff downsizing restructuring and so on.

24

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:27.070
If there's no clear way around it the best approach is to be honest and show humility.

25

00:01:27.070  -->  00:01:30.930
Take responsibility.

26

00:01:30.930  -->  00:01:34.990
Now the question is how many positions have you applied for GO him.

27

00:01:34.990  -->  00:01:38.290
Pause the video now.

28

00:01:38.490  -->  00:01:39.010
All right.

29

00:01:39.300  -->  00:01:43.980
So this question usually is just so the interviewer can get a better idea of how motivated you are and

30

00:01:43.980  -->  00:01:46.360
how close you are in making a decision.

31

00:01:46.380  -->  00:01:50.330
Try to avoid giving an exact number unless you feel it can gain leverage from it.

32

00:01:50.370  -->  00:01:54.840
Otherwise just refrain from specifics and that's it.

33

00:01:54.840  -->  00:01:55.560
Good job.

34

00:01:55.560  -->  00:01:57.430
That concludes this section of the course.

35

00:01:57.530  -->  00:02:02.610
Then the next section of the Course will discuss Post interview tactics such as salary negotiations

36

00:02:03.010  -->  00:02:05.820
and answering questions about your salary.

37

00:02:05.820  -->  00:02:08.130
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
