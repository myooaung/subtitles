Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture it's going to be a quick one.

00:13.820 --> 00:19.340
We're just going to go for a real quick strategy that has really helped us accelerate the vetting process

00:19.340 --> 00:25.760
for finding who is a good project who has a good project proposal and who's a good freelancer and to

00:25.760 --> 00:28.260
save you a lot of time in this process.

00:28.460 --> 00:34.910
OK so the short of it is get the freelancer or the firm get them off the platform.

00:34.910 --> 00:39.890
So what I mean by getting them off the platform is that at the very beginning of the process you have

00:39.890 --> 00:47.300
a lot of project proposals and it's very very helpful if you get them to leave the messaging system

00:47.300 --> 00:52.360
or the embedded system that each platform uses to facilitate conversation.

00:52.370 --> 00:57.710
Now in general if you use Elance or freelancer up work the very bulky systems are communicating you

00:57.710 --> 01:04.250
send a message sends it to them they accepted and then they respond and there's usually a lag in between

01:04.250 --> 01:04.790
the times.

01:04.790 --> 01:10.130
It's almost like writing an email back and forth and it's completely anonymized and you can't contact

01:10.130 --> 01:12.050
them directly off the platform.

01:12.050 --> 01:14.030
Now that messaging system is fine.

01:14.060 --> 01:14.410
Right.

01:14.420 --> 01:19.610
You can get a lot of information out of people but you will notice is that over time the more messages

01:19.610 --> 01:25.400
you send you'll get a lower and lower response rate simply because they're bidding on other projects

01:25.400 --> 01:28.000
that probably got something else that's come through.

01:28.010 --> 01:29.530
They're focusing their attention over there.

01:29.540 --> 01:32.690
They might disappear entirely if you ask too many questions.

01:32.690 --> 01:37.820
So what I like to do is I like to get them off the platform for at least the messaging part of this

01:37.820 --> 01:41.210
whole process so I usually like to ask them if they have skype.

01:41.230 --> 01:45.600
I ask them if they have whatsapp ask them if they can talk on the phone whatever it is.

01:45.610 --> 01:50.490
Ninety nine percent of time it's Skype if you get them on Skype and then you talk to them you can vet

01:50.540 --> 01:50.850
them.

01:50.870 --> 01:53.000
So much more quickly.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.770
You don't have to wait for them to respond.

01:55.880 --> 02:01.330
You don't have to wait for them to get an e-mail notification to log on to e elands to message you.

02:01.320 --> 02:06.890
You can talk to them instantly and all of a sudden you can see how they are you can see how responsive

02:06.890 --> 02:07.440
they are.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.810
You can see how thoughtful they are.

02:08.810 --> 02:10.840
You can see how smart they are.

02:11.090 --> 02:16.310
You can figure out very quickly how well they understand the project and how well of a fit they're going

02:16.310 --> 02:20.210
to be and you can do that honestly in ten minutes with them on Skype.

02:20.210 --> 02:21.620
You don't necessarily need to call them.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.750
You can do skype chat that's perfectly fine.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.560
There's a lot of benefits to doing that.

02:25.610 --> 02:30.170
And honestly you can ask them Hey do you have Skype to talk on Skype and if they don't have skype you

02:30.170 --> 02:31.640
can use that as a red flag.

02:31.640 --> 02:37.130
It's very strange that a freelancer who supposedly is good at what they do is been doing this for a

02:37.130 --> 02:43.080
period of time is not willing or does not have the ability to talk to you on Skype.

02:43.100 --> 02:49.380
So if you want to save time and get them off the platform those communication tools are very clunky

02:49.380 --> 02:49.470
there.

02:49.480 --> 02:54.050
The worst part about those outsourcing platforms.

02:54.050 --> 02:58.820
So if you just navigate around that you can get people on Skype you can have.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.960
I mean you can interact 20 times faster through Skype.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.940
Figure out if they're worth it in 10 minutes as opposed to taking several days to figure out whether

03:07.940 --> 03:08.850
or not they're worth it.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.750
And having an abandonment rate that's way too high to be acceptable.

03:12.770 --> 03:14.410
OK that was a quick strategy.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.160
That's something that really really helped me.

03:17.180 --> 03:22.760
It really helps me kind of establish long term relationships with them really helps kind of improve

03:22.760 --> 03:25.240
the response rate on both sides.

03:25.250 --> 03:30.140
It's really nice that you can directly contact someone if you need anything or have a question you can

03:30.140 --> 03:33.540
just message them and it doesn't have to be monitored by the other platforms.

03:33.560 --> 03:39.410
I always suggest using the other platforms for their escrow service and there are milestone services

03:39.410 --> 03:46.010
so all of them have this system where you can pay money to them and as an intermediary they'll judge

03:46.010 --> 03:49.400
when the project's done and release it at the correct time.

03:49.400 --> 03:55.220
Now don't try to do the transaction off of their system entirely until you have a rapport with the freelancer

03:55.460 --> 04:01.540
or you at least have your own established process and a lot of expertise with contracting.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.880
So really simple if you want to figure out who's the best.

04:04.880 --> 04:10.760
Very quickly get them off the platform get them onto Skype and figure it out so much faster.

04:10.770 --> 04:19.880
Or see the next lecture.
