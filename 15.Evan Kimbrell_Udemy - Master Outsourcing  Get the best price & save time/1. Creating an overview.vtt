00:06.030 --> 00:06.430
All right.

00:06.480 --> 00:14.250
So the way that you want to tackle the first section of your specification sheet is very similar to

00:14.250 --> 00:20.610
the way that we wrote the overview when we wrote the description in our job posting.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.950
The only difference in a spec sheet is that your overview is going to be a little bit more comprehensive

00:26.990 --> 00:33.360
and if you remember in the job description we had posted it pretty simply.

00:33.360 --> 00:38.860
We really only described it with two or three sentences here.

00:38.880 --> 00:45.780
It's OK to go a little bit farther with it but for the most part you really just want to say the same

00:45.780 --> 00:48.390
thing and expand on it a little bit.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.540
Now you can actually go back to your job posting and copy it in here.

00:53.550 --> 00:59.910
You can get away with posting a little bit more info but for the most part it's the same information

00:59.910 --> 01:01.440
really.

01:01.530 --> 01:07.590
Here is where you would think to put something that not every single person needs to even read about

01:07.650 --> 01:12.670
but someone who's doing a detailed estimation of your application.

01:12.810 --> 01:17.860
The information here is going to help them kind of wrap their head around what exactly they're estimating.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.500
It just makes it easier to process.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.670
Now you can go without an Overview section if you want to.

01:22.770 --> 01:29.430
I always suggest you do you always want to make sure that your developer or whoever is looking at this

01:30.090 --> 01:31.500
is in line with your vision.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.380
So we just copy that.

01:33.390 --> 01:40.050
And for this example we're going to be using that that dating app that I just kind of made up if you

01:40.050 --> 01:46.070
guys want me to do other examples of creating specification sheets I definitely can.

01:46.100 --> 01:51.140
It's a very important process for not only getting the right estimate but not having problems later

01:51.140 --> 01:57.920
down the line because you left something out or you said something in a way that was a little bit iffy

01:58.670 --> 02:03.180
or didn't have concise language in this section.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.700
Really again we're answering the what.

02:06.070 --> 02:10.060
But I would try to expand a little bit farther.

02:10.130 --> 02:16.420
General I want to say answer questions like What does the app do.

02:16.480 --> 02:21.730
What does what does the app called.

02:21.990 --> 02:24.790
I would say things like who uses the app.

02:24.940 --> 02:36.810
I would answer questions like I would answer questions like what Jiajia graphical area is going to use

02:36.810 --> 02:51.370
the app what is the key differentiator Shater and then even things like what are the most important

02:51.370 --> 02:53.870
features.

02:53.930 --> 02:57.960
So these are all questions that I would want to answer in the overview.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.530
Now if your disk your over you created for your job scription is a little lacking.

03:03.560 --> 03:10.070
Use these questions that I'm just asking right now to go back and add a little bit more to it.

03:10.100 --> 03:18.860
So I would even go in and say the app is restricted to United States only.

03:19.060 --> 03:22.120
What is the app called we'll call it.

03:22.120 --> 03:27.880
The app is is called lovely.

03:28.070 --> 03:33.410
I know that there is already an application called lovely that helps you find apartments for the most

03:33.410 --> 03:33.760
part.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.420
This is helpful for us because this is fake.

03:36.580 --> 03:40.490
The app is called lovely and then I could say key differentiators.

03:40.490 --> 03:51.550
The biggest difference between us and others is it is on mobile only.

03:51.910 --> 04:06.740
And to give you a limited amount of matches per day and then three matches based off a questionnaire.

04:06.740 --> 04:11.480
Now there are applications that match you off questionnaires.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.400
OK keep it does that.

04:13.430 --> 04:17.360
There are ones that are mobile only tender is mobile only.

04:17.750 --> 04:23.460
There are ones that give you unlimited amount of matches per day coffee meets bagel does that.

04:23.690 --> 04:26.000
And but in this case it has all three.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.190
So that is the key differentiator.

04:28.220 --> 04:31.100
So that was what I would list off.

04:31.100 --> 04:36.810
It's helpful to understand if I'm reading this why do I care why are we making this.

04:36.830 --> 04:38.170
Those are kind of important.

04:38.180 --> 04:50.090
And then I would say things like the key features are say the the questionnaire questionnaire and the

04:50.090 --> 05:00.750
ability to see and say like them to send stickers.

05:01.280 --> 05:07.410
OK so this is just really coming out to be a terrible application but you're kind of getting the point.

05:07.430 --> 05:13.390
So in this section try to capture everything that you would consider broad strokes.

05:13.400 --> 05:18.430
Everything you consider big picture but you don't really want to get into the nitty gritty.

05:18.430 --> 05:22.070
You're not going to say it does this it does this it does this it does this because that is actually

05:22.070 --> 05:24.470
the next section that is in functions included.

05:24.470 --> 05:28.350
So in the next lecture we're going to cover functions included.

05:28.370 --> 05:34.160
We're going to cover how you can find everything that's in your application and what's kind of a good

05:34.160 --> 05:40.780
process by to go through and list off what we also call the scope of your application so I'll see you

05:40.780 --> 05:49.220
in the next lecture.
