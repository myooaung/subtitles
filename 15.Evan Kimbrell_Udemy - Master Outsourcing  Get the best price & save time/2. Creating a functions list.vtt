WEBVTT

00:06.860 --> 00:07.130
All right.

00:07.130 --> 00:13.640
So let's talk about the section called functions included another way that you might often hear this

00:13.640 --> 00:15.410
call is actually called scope.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.230
A lot of people just call it the scope of your document.

00:18.230 --> 00:24.680
I kind of put this in simple English because the assumption is you may or may not be technical so calling

00:24.680 --> 00:30.320
it go up might be meaningless to you when you list out your functions.

00:30.320 --> 00:36.110
Now this is one of the more important sections of your specification sheet.

00:36.140 --> 00:38.530
It doesn't need to happen in this order.

00:38.570 --> 00:45.990
I put it in this order because it really does help us figure out what exactly is going into the application.

00:46.010 --> 00:52.880
And then it's much easier to list out all the other stuff because this is kind of the discovery process.

00:52.880 --> 00:59.630
Now when I talk about functions included what I mean does ever think of every single thing that your

00:59.630 --> 01:04.490
project or your application or your website needs to do now.

01:04.490 --> 01:06.520
I mean quite literally anything.

01:06.520 --> 01:13.320
It doesn't just necessarily mean like my Web site outputs a PTF with this and with user information.

01:13.320 --> 01:18.740
Now that is a function but it also is things like they need to be able to log in with Facebook.

01:18.740 --> 01:26.450
It also is things like I need to be able to delete users or save all of my use information in one area

01:26.660 --> 01:33.760
or things like I need to have payment integrations or I need to have certain levels of security.

01:34.400 --> 01:41.750
Now those are all things that I would include in here because this is a document you're using to create

01:41.780 --> 01:47.030
an estimate to get an accurate estimate and then it's going to function as you're working document to

01:47.030 --> 01:50.270
figure out what exactly is included in your estimate and what's not.

01:50.270 --> 01:54.770
So you want to include as much as you possibly can.

01:55.430 --> 01:58.970
One of the harder parts about writing your functions included section is that sometimes you just you

01:59.030 --> 02:01.530
can't think of every single thing.

02:01.640 --> 02:06.560
One of the things the hard things about the functions included are the scope section is that it's very

02:06.560 --> 02:11.150
hard to think of every single thing that could possibly be needed in your application.

02:11.150 --> 02:14.160
And there's a couple of things I can say to that one don't worry about it.

02:14.180 --> 02:17.230
You're always going to miss one thing or two things.

02:17.240 --> 02:22.190
What I suggest is that you write your first go at it and then you come back to it later and you try

02:22.190 --> 02:27.950
to think on it and you really try to think if there's anything missing or any process that you didn't

02:28.010 --> 02:30.320
actually list out on this.

02:30.440 --> 02:36.950
And the second thing I like to say is that if you are having trouble listing off the scope section you

02:36.950 --> 02:43.730
can either go to the pages section first and try that or go to the end of the section in this course

02:44.150 --> 02:49.500
and watched my my lectures on wireframe and using balsamic.

02:49.550 --> 02:57.560
Now if you're someone who can think about your project visually or prefers to organize your information

02:57.590 --> 03:03.110
visually I strongly suggest that you go to the wire framing section and you do that because what happens

03:03.110 --> 03:09.950
is you're going to sit there and draw it out and draw out what exactly your application does screen

03:09.950 --> 03:10.880
by screen.

03:10.970 --> 03:16.580
And when you visually see it a lot of times that can help you visually recognize what exactly are the

03:16.580 --> 03:23.620
functions what would be nice to put over here what doesn't make sense to be in the application.

03:23.690 --> 03:30.980
It gives you a very good comprehensive view of what the user sees and essentially what are all the functions

03:30.980 --> 03:32.090
that are going to be included.

03:32.090 --> 03:37.070
So if you have trouble with that go to that section but otherwise if you think you have a good idea

03:37.070 --> 03:39.580
what's in your application just follow along.

03:39.590 --> 03:43.880
So when I'm writing out my scope section are the functions included.

03:44.030 --> 03:50.330
I generally like to think in my head like I'm a user using it for the first time and then start listing

03:50.330 --> 03:56.020
it out every single thing I can think of as that user goes through the application.

03:56.030 --> 04:03.770
So that's the idea we're using is this lovely and I've described it somewhat very quickly.

04:03.770 --> 04:08.750
Previously when we were writing the job posting I have a little bit of a head start but what I'll do

04:08.750 --> 04:12.820
is I'll start with what the first user would do in this scenario.

04:13.100 --> 04:19.170
So the first user blogs in Adela's the app goes to a splash page remember.

04:19.220 --> 04:30.580
So I would say has a splash page that allows users to log in with Facebook.

04:31.180 --> 04:31.520
OK.

04:31.560 --> 04:36.690
And then here might be a great opportunity to mention that you don't need to log in with anything else.

04:36.690 --> 04:42.540
What are the difficulties of working with developers is that they are very very literal especially when

04:42.540 --> 04:46.540
they're looking at a specification sheet they're going to assume that this is the law.

04:46.560 --> 04:53.180
This is kind of the absolute code of FIDE everything for this application.

04:53.220 --> 04:56.250
And if you don't list something out there just don't assume that it's not in it.

04:56.250 --> 05:02.220
Now they make assumptions like that all the time and so it is important that you try to be as explicit

05:02.280 --> 05:08.130
as possible and even sometimes when you say it doesn't have this it's very helpful to point out even

05:08.130 --> 05:11.550
negatives because a lot of times they'll just make incorrect assumptions.

05:11.550 --> 05:15.110
So I can even say no other logon type.

05:15.330 --> 05:19.600
Now don't worry about your jargon or if you label everything perfectly correct.

05:19.620 --> 05:24.180
It is up to the developer to make sure that they understand every single section before they begin the

05:24.180 --> 05:25.410
project.

05:25.410 --> 05:30.090
If they don't go over this with you then you have a bad developer.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.130
So what happens after they log in.

05:32.130 --> 05:35.770
If we remember previously that it goes to a page or it introduces.

05:35.820 --> 05:38.910
So it goes to a page that introduces the questionnaire.

05:38.910 --> 05:45.000
Now one thing that people forget a lot of times are entered or what are called intermediate screens

05:45.360 --> 05:52.800
intermediate screens are things that you have in polished applications that make the user flow more

05:52.800 --> 05:55.260
fluid as they go from section to section.

05:55.260 --> 05:58.460
So what's an example when I upload an image.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.230
What generally happens.

06:00.240 --> 06:05.140
Usually you have like a loading icon or a screen that comes up that says something's uploading.

06:05.160 --> 06:10.350
That's an intermediate screen an intermediate screen might be even something like a search box and there's

06:10.470 --> 06:11.070
nothing.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.440
It doesn't come up with anything.

06:12.490 --> 06:13.620
What does it display.

06:13.620 --> 06:16.710
It should display something saying hey we didn't find anything.

06:16.870 --> 06:20.070
Here's some suggestions for making your search more effective.

06:20.070 --> 06:24.820
These are all intermediate screens and these are things that are not immediately apparent to you.

06:25.290 --> 06:30.720
So what I typically will like to do is if I'm writing a user flow like this I might actually go and

06:30.720 --> 06:36.150
play around with some other applications and see what are all the separate screens that they have because

06:36.150 --> 06:42.270
I think that could help me kind of remember Oh be nice to have a screen here that explains this.

06:42.540 --> 06:48.210
A lot of people forget that explainer screens are popular in mobile applications.

06:48.210 --> 06:49.680
It's very popular too.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.660
When you first log in have arrows pointing to different sections that explain what's happening on each

06:54.660 --> 06:55.740
section.

06:55.740 --> 07:00.570
Those are things that are very helpful if you don't put those and the developer is not going to assume

07:00.570 --> 07:05.590
that they're in there so make sure that you have an opinion about that either or either way.

07:05.670 --> 07:17.370
In this case I'm going to say yes so user Whoa see a screen that explains how the questionnaire works.

07:17.580 --> 07:24.900
And I'm just going to let this be static screen static graphic static graphic means that just means

07:24.900 --> 07:29.100
that it's not dynamic it's not really clickable you can't do anything with it it's literally just an

07:29.100 --> 07:37.000
image being displayed with Continue button ok user answers

07:40.910 --> 07:55.520
user answers three screens of questions for a total of 25 questions 25 questions are pre-determined

07:56.510 --> 08:04.210
and read the radio buttons range from one to 10.

08:04.660 --> 08:09.170
OK so I'm trying to be as literal as possible.

08:09.210 --> 08:13.690
I've read technical writing before try to emulate that.

08:13.810 --> 08:16.360
Now don't worry if you don't get it perfect or you don't.

08:16.380 --> 08:21.130
If you say something that makes you sound like a layman that's fine these people are used to working

08:21.130 --> 08:26.650
with people who are Lehmann's the majority of people are asking for them to build these projects or

08:26.650 --> 08:32.890
people who do not have a technical background are not trained in writing product specifications so don't

08:32.890 --> 08:33.490
worry about it.

08:33.490 --> 08:38.140
The point is to just literally girded state as much as you can on the page.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.760
Just take everything in your head and throw it down.

08:40.810 --> 08:42.940
Make sure you don't miss anything.

08:42.940 --> 08:47.860
So after they ask those questions I'm probably going to need to explain that the system does something

08:47.860 --> 08:49.150
with those answers right.

08:49.330 --> 09:05.260
So system saves information saves answers to the user user and gives them a rating for matching other

09:05.260 --> 09:06.880
users.

09:07.060 --> 09:11.050
You know you don't need to be that as that explicit You don't need to explain what's going on on the

09:11.050 --> 09:11.580
back end.

09:11.590 --> 09:15.970
That's kind of something that they would have to figure out regardless because later you could just

09:15.970 --> 09:22.090
say system uses these questions to match them to other people and they can infer from that that's perfectly

09:22.090 --> 09:23.180
fine.

09:23.350 --> 09:36.870
But I would then say like we said before user sees a page with two list options list option number one

09:38.570 --> 09:45.170
display the matches based off 25.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.640
QUESTION Question air.

09:49.460 --> 09:55.820
And then the last option number two two and then here was the where the person can change information

09:55.820 --> 10:02.030
about themselves say sorry we could say per day to you as well.

10:02.540 --> 10:13.400
So we could say option to change profile photo and option to create.

10:13.590 --> 10:18.020
We could just make this up 50 order by about them so.

10:18.050 --> 10:18.750
OK.

10:19.120 --> 10:24.350
OK.
