WEBVTT

00:05.960 --> 00:12.890
All right so we're going to take a look inside one of our actual projects that we ran just told you

00:12.890 --> 00:14.920
a little bit about what it did.

00:15.030 --> 00:20.270
But I can show you that we followed pretty much all of the guidelines that we gave you in this course

00:21.020 --> 00:26.750
gave a project description that wasn't overly wordy but it kind of gave you the 10000 foot description

00:27.620 --> 00:33.410
and then it gave things like perks like down here we kind of describe saying you know we have lots of

00:33.410 --> 00:35.880
projects this will be a long term thing.

00:35.900 --> 00:40.460
There's lots of reasons why you should be excited about this and then gave in-depth instructions over

00:40.460 --> 00:46.550
here in this document that we gave a nickname just for purposes of remembering it.

00:46.550 --> 00:52.830
So I want to talk a little bit about how to overview some of the language that you get in your description

00:52.880 --> 00:58.100
your proposals in a lot of times it's hard to read especially if you're not technical or you don't have

00:58.100 --> 01:04.390
a lot of experience looking over proposals specifically on these online platforms.

01:04.400 --> 01:10.370
You'll notice very quickly that there's a lot of themes that happen with people's messages.

01:10.370 --> 01:19.130
This is different then say if you had posted a project on Craigslist or saw or if you directly contacted

01:19.130 --> 01:24.350
a web development firm they would send you something entirely different it wouldn't look like this at

01:24.440 --> 01:25.370
all.

01:25.400 --> 01:29.780
So you'll notice that a lot of these messages have kind of conformed to the constraints of the actual

01:29.780 --> 01:31.190
platform.

01:31.220 --> 01:36.030
We can look it up work and freelancer as well but they're really the same thing.

01:36.110 --> 01:41.930
Elance is easiest to look at because people actually put time into their messages whereas you'll notice

01:41.930 --> 01:46.720
on up work and freelancer they pretty much evolve very quickly.

01:46.790 --> 01:53.910
So if you can sniff out a good proposal in L.A. You can certainly find one in freelancer or upward.

01:54.110 --> 02:00.890
So the first thing you'll notice pretty much immediately is that you'll notice that the country will

02:00.890 --> 02:04.290
always match the way that they speak.

02:04.430 --> 02:09.580
And occasionally you'll find situations where they don't they simply just don't match up.

02:09.590 --> 02:15.920
This one says the United States the man's name is Paul Matthews which is extremely American.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.450
It's almost as if you are imitating an American.

02:18.890 --> 02:24.680
But then when you read his English it actually comes off a little bit strange as if it was if it doesn't

02:24.680 --> 02:27.280
really come from a native English speaker.

02:27.470 --> 02:30.950
So that's typically something that you know you should be aware of.

02:30.950 --> 02:39.980
Some times people say things like United States but rather not say whether or not they're the exact

02:39.980 --> 02:43.330
same thing as hiring a Native American.

02:43.470 --> 02:47.440
That's you have to actually look at their proposal and make a better decision about that.

02:47.450 --> 02:49.640
I'll give you an example down here.

02:49.640 --> 02:56.280
We have someone called Sereny him which is definitely not an American name listed as the United States.

02:56.570 --> 03:02.750
And then he writes something down here which is just in one of the worst English you'll ever see.

03:02.780 --> 03:05.120
So you'll notice that a lot of disconnects.

03:05.120 --> 03:10.910
This is something that's really bad on freelancer and it's really bad on up work a lot a lot of people

03:11.210 --> 03:15.470
will list themselves in a nicer country because they think that's going to allow them to raise their

03:15.470 --> 03:16.620
price.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.780
And if they think that it makes him stick out.

03:19.790 --> 03:25.300
But it's very obvious that that is not actually representative of them and where they're from.

03:25.300 --> 03:25.570
OK.

03:25.580 --> 03:31.010
So try to be aware of that these mismatches a lot of times you can very easily sniff out there's some

03:31.010 --> 03:36.980
kind of a disconnect going on here and use that as a way of discounting some of these proposals.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.140
So in this case we've got 18 proposals.

03:39.140 --> 03:44.000
I'm not surprised because it's this is a blow for us because one we didn't invite a lot of people to

03:44.000 --> 03:49.970
it we only invited one group that we'd worked with before but also we are asking to use a service called

03:49.970 --> 03:56.150
Twilley which is something that manages S-M mass and it's just something that not a ton of people know

03:56.150 --> 03:59.060
how to use or have a lot of experience with it's very specific.

03:59.060 --> 04:03.010
So in those cases yeah you would expect to get fewer proposals.

04:03.020 --> 04:06.470
I'd say for a Twilio application 18 is pretty good.

04:06.470 --> 04:11.350
OK so after you have kind of look for immediate mismatches.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.540
And typically if I were doing this I would find this one.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.840
And I would almost immediately hide this person's proposal something is completely off.

04:19.880 --> 04:26.420
You'll notice this thing called Camel backing camel backing is not something you should ever do in your

04:26.420 --> 04:27.470
messages.

04:27.480 --> 04:33.500
It's when you put capitalizations randomly throughout your sentences and then the punctuation and then

04:33.500 --> 04:38.210
lack of capitalization that's usually quite obvious to look for.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.330
You'll notice that pretty much all over the place.

04:40.340 --> 04:45.350
If it's a message coming from India and they're doing Caml backing that's completely normal.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.060
You can see right here.

04:47.060 --> 04:52.480
Details for your Android iPhone taxi driver app to manage drivers.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.650
I don't know why that's capitalized.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.460
That is something that is one cultural thing.

04:58.460 --> 05:05.800
Indians will typically do that but also developers do that because developers have a tendency to guys

05:06.520 --> 05:11.900
anything that they think would represent like a user or represent a variable because in their language

05:11.900 --> 05:16.630
when they're actually programming it they have a tendency to capitalize it to show that this is a separate

05:16.720 --> 05:17.640
entity.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.190
So when you combine the two.

05:19.210 --> 05:23.540
Yeah you end up getting these really kind of weird style messages.

05:23.540 --> 05:30.070
So after you look for media kind of mismatch it the second thing I like to screen over is to look for

05:30.070 --> 05:34.660
whether or not the proposal gets off topic very quickly.

05:35.020 --> 05:42.100
And what I mean by that if they get off topic that means that they didn't read your test your actual

05:42.100 --> 05:46.720
description completely it means that they ran out of things to say and it means that they're probably

05:46.810 --> 05:50.620
copying a lot of information into their proposal.

05:50.620 --> 05:57.220
Now what does that kind of mean to me when I see a lot of template a lot of repeat in a lot of off topic

05:57.220 --> 05:58.310
discussion.

05:58.360 --> 06:02.860
Usually that means to me what we call message fatigue.

06:02.860 --> 06:09.760
So if you see message fatigue that just means that they are messaging tons of people and they've gotten

06:09.760 --> 06:15.320
to a point where it's not realistic for them to write a custom thing every single time.

06:15.370 --> 06:21.310
So you get a lot of copy and paste copy and paste and that just means that you know you're not going

06:21.310 --> 06:22.600
to have their full attention.

06:22.600 --> 06:27.340
That means there's there could be a potential problem that they pick up a project while they're working

06:27.340 --> 06:28.110
on yours.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.220
It's just not a professional thing.

06:30.220 --> 06:34.270
So that's something that we try to avoid and I'll give you an example of someone who goes off topic

06:34.270 --> 06:40.690
very quickly these first year up here you'll notice if you read their language this guy stayed Avid

06:40.690 --> 06:44.550
Technology stayed on topic the entire time.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.820
So hi there.

06:45.820 --> 06:51.340
I've seen your requirement for the S based application as is true with S M s talks about his experience

06:51.340 --> 06:56.710
into ileo says what he programs and or what they program in which is you know this is fine.

06:56.710 --> 07:04.090
It doesn't really matter what you use with Tullio gave an estimate for time this we'll discuss later.

07:04.600 --> 07:09.400
Gave a link to their information and then right here gave an example of other things they've worked

07:09.400 --> 07:11.500
on so they stayed on topic the entire time.

07:11.500 --> 07:18.070
Not a fantastic proposal not a lot of information but at least you can tell that they probably do not

07:18.070 --> 07:19.110
have message fatigue.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.920
They're probably not building all over the place here.

07:22.120 --> 07:27.970
OK so here is an example of someone who stays on topic some of the time and off topic some of the time.

07:27.970 --> 07:32.410
So what you can see right here is he introduces himself My name is Paul mathies I'm an expert in Twilio.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.200
That's what's important.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.580
I'm a U.S. his head and with my office in Silicon Valley and a development center in India.

07:38.960 --> 07:43.240
OK that right there has nothing to do with my project.

07:43.540 --> 07:48.400
And then this I just literally highlight all the information that has nothing to do with my project

07:48.400 --> 07:49.660
whatsoever.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.670
So right there is where he stops.

07:51.780 --> 07:56.140
OK then he actually gets back to the point he says it's about six years of asterisked and trick's box

07:56.140 --> 07:57.980
experience two years of Toli experience.

07:58.090 --> 08:05.050
Then he gets off topic again and he says you know I'm one of the best people ever here he gets on topic

08:05.710 --> 08:08.870
and he lists out prize time.

08:08.890 --> 08:14.590
He lists out one of the requirements was that I was looking for someone who lives locally in this area.

08:14.590 --> 08:15.810
So that's a plus.

08:17.450 --> 08:23.280
Right here he gives an example of a Tullio project which is good so he's on topic this section looks

08:23.280 --> 08:30.170
like he is not on topic but at the very end you notice that it involves phone call so he is.

08:30.430 --> 08:33.640
The job is completed in two days it is completely worthless.

08:33.630 --> 08:37.470
It means nothing to me I don't know how big the project was here.

08:37.470 --> 08:44.580
He started simple work but he does a good job of only picking applications that involve S M S A lot

08:44.580 --> 08:50.400
of people will give you their sample work and they'll paste it in the message and has nothing to do

08:50.430 --> 08:52.030
with it.

08:52.090 --> 08:55.060
There's absolutely nothing to do with whatever you're asking.

08:55.440 --> 09:00.090
So that's typically a bad thing if someone does that but it's good if this guy can honestly conjure

09:00.090 --> 09:03.350
up three to four examples of things he's worked with SML.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.550
That's a great thing.

09:04.590 --> 09:06.720
And then right down here this is where he deviates.

09:06.720 --> 09:14.560
He just copies and pastes some descriptions from current testimonials which is fine.

09:14.580 --> 09:17.610
This is typically inappropriate for a message.

09:17.610 --> 09:22.240
You don't want to read all of this in your message unless it's pertinent to your project.

09:22.290 --> 09:27.270
You can put this in your profile information and I can find that they are just trust me if I like what

09:27.270 --> 09:28.940
you say I'll read your profile.

09:28.950 --> 09:33.300
I don't need to read this and the message just again comes off like you're trying to cram irrelevant

09:33.300 --> 09:43.030
information into your post.
