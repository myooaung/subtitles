00:06.030 --> 00:11.520
Let's talk about where you should go to find freelancers and freelancing firms.

00:11.820 --> 00:17.630
For me there are the big three Elance oDesk and freelancer dot com.

00:17.820 --> 00:21.500
I'm sure you've used other Web sites people per hour.

00:21.570 --> 00:23.630
Seems to be a decent one.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.860
There are lots of freelancing sites that target certain knishes.

00:27.880 --> 00:34.560
You'll notice things like like video Pixi is her freelancer's for videos specifically Ines.

00:34.570 --> 00:38.830
Course we're talking more about building mobile applications or web applications so we're going to focus

00:38.830 --> 00:41.790
on software freelancers.

00:41.920 --> 00:47.260
The big three Elance oDesk and freelancer these are the ones I've used throughout my career and the

00:47.260 --> 00:51.080
ones I've used for over 50 60 apps.

00:51.430 --> 00:58.840
Each one of these has their own pros and cons Elance is probably by far my favorite for finding high

00:58.840 --> 01:05.880
quality contractors when you bid on elance you can get bids from pretty much all over the world.

01:06.100 --> 01:13.930
When you typically post something I see a good mix between Western countries and typical outsource countries

01:13.930 --> 01:19.930
and then people all in between you'll find a lot of freelancers who are simply location independent

01:19.930 --> 01:25.080
like traveling programmers very very vibrant community of people.

01:25.120 --> 01:31.750
Elance is where you would go if you were looking for a better established firms or essentially higher

01:31.750 --> 01:37.990
quality freelancers freelancers that are in the mature stage of their freelancing career.

01:37.990 --> 01:43.840
A lot of programmers who have full time jobs that work at reputable companies will go on elance and

01:43.840 --> 01:46.600
bid on projects for their weekends and off hours.

01:46.600 --> 01:53.020
The firms on elance typically have better portfolios they're usually better at articulating what they're

01:53.020 --> 01:53.940
good at.

01:53.980 --> 02:00.470
They are typically going to give you better more thoughtful responses to your project briefs.

02:00.730 --> 02:05.180
Now like the other three it doesn't cost any money to post the differences here.

02:05.200 --> 02:11.980
You'll notice that most people that bid have read your project and will actually respond with detail

02:11.980 --> 02:16.430
and with thoughts on it that obviously comes with the downside.

02:16.460 --> 02:22.250
You'll notice that in Elance the prices are usually a bit higher if you were to take the same application

02:22.250 --> 02:25.300
in the same brief and post them across these three systems.

02:25.460 --> 02:30.890
Elance you'll notice on average is going to have the highest price and also the timeline probably is

02:30.890 --> 02:32.230
going to be longer.

02:32.450 --> 02:38.000
And obviously the reason is because the people who are bidding have more experience and they also probably

02:38.000 --> 02:44.060
have more clientele themselves so they're not going to lie and say that they're going to rush the project

02:44.090 --> 02:48.590
and they're also not going to be taking kind of a loss leader position meaning that they're not going

02:48.600 --> 02:53.870
pricing so low that they're actually losing money just to get your business.

02:53.900 --> 03:00.260
The second one is oDesk oDesk and Elance I believe are a merged company but these two different products

03:00.830 --> 03:03.200
oDesk is a little bit different.

03:03.200 --> 03:09.320
It's not like Elance in the sense that everybody who bids is going to be a high quality oDesk differentiate

03:09.530 --> 03:16.280
themselves by what they use called the team the New and they have the thing called a team room how the

03:16.280 --> 03:17.680
team room works.

03:17.930 --> 03:23.630
It's a web application with an ode ask that when you hire someone they get added to your team room and

03:23.720 --> 03:29.810
then they use this screen capture software on the freelancer's Web site so that you can maintain how

03:29.810 --> 03:34.010
much they've been working and what their productivity looks like and you can kind of notice if they're

03:34.010 --> 03:35.240
not working.

03:35.240 --> 03:41.390
And if they try to bill you you can look back at their time logs also you can use that way to combine

03:41.390 --> 03:46.230
other freelancers into the same room so that they can communicate to each other and coordinate.

03:46.280 --> 03:53.450
It's good if you're trying to put together a team from multiple freelancers or multiple development

03:53.450 --> 03:57.350
teams which is sometimes that is the case sometimes you need someone to do data entry.

03:57.380 --> 04:00.800
You need one person to program and you need one person to do graphic design.

04:00.800 --> 04:06.230
And that makes it quite convenient however because that is the focal point of their product and what

04:06.440 --> 04:08.030
they're selling point.

04:08.150 --> 04:13.940
It means that people typically go to oDesk if they're looking for per hour labor and it means that they're

04:13.940 --> 04:17.080
skewed more towards things like virtual assistants.

04:17.150 --> 04:20.350
Most of the projects you see on oDesk will skew towards.

04:20.360 --> 04:28.100
I need someone to do this manual task and do it in perpetuity and do it for a set amount of time people

04:28.100 --> 04:32.030
do obviously post web projects and mobile projects on there.

04:32.030 --> 04:38.510
It's just better if you're looking for an individual who can just work towards your project and essentially

04:38.570 --> 04:43.240
until it's done and it's not a great place if you're trying to find a fixed price because of them.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.960
The team room benefit.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.900
It doesn't really help you in any way.

04:46.970 --> 04:53.450
ODesk is in terms of quality engineering it's a little bit below Elance but it's above freelancer freelancer

04:53.460 --> 04:55.100
dot com is the last one.

04:55.160 --> 05:02.900
Pre-cancer used to be a big deal back in 2001 2002 came out of the Internet bubble but it stuck around.

05:02.900 --> 05:07.040
It is probably the least polished of the theory.

05:07.130 --> 05:13.250
You go and you use it it is kind of confusing the way that they use a credit system you will for instance

05:13.280 --> 05:19.020
when you pay freelancers you will upload money into your account and then you can pay them and freelance

05:19.020 --> 05:22.830
freelancer automatically will deduct certain amounts of money out of your account.

05:22.850 --> 05:27.590
So it always keeps a certain baseline amount of money in your account and that can be kind of annoying

05:27.590 --> 05:31.180
if you're trying to do small tasks but freelancer.

05:31.430 --> 05:35.180
It's kind of the Wild West of the freelancing Web sites.

05:35.210 --> 05:41.990
I use it all the time but that's because I'm skilled at managing outsourced teams and knowing what I

05:41.990 --> 05:47.370
want and I can tell very easily if a freelancer is being unrealistic.

05:47.580 --> 05:54.200
Freelancers the place you go if you want pretty much a heavy skew in terms of your bidding group from

05:54.230 --> 05:55.470
outsourced countries.

05:55.520 --> 06:01.430
When you post an freelancer you may get some people from western countries but the real predominantly

06:01.420 --> 06:08.190
get people from you know Eastern Europe India Indonesia Vietnam places like that.

06:08.210 --> 06:12.670
Now freelancer's great if you're trying to get something done extremely cheaply.

06:12.770 --> 06:15.730
The people who bid on their bid very very low.

06:15.860 --> 06:21.140
And if you have the experience and you have the time to oversee what they're doing then you can have

06:21.140 --> 06:23.750
some pretty huge cost savings.

06:24.260 --> 06:29.630
But I always say kind of stay away unless you have experience doing this because you can get burned

06:29.630 --> 06:30.780
very easily.

06:30.800 --> 06:35.930
Often what happens on freelancer you will see that if you post say you want to make a web site and say

06:35.930 --> 06:40.760
your web site is something similar to another Web site you very often will find people who will create

06:40.760 --> 06:42.550
clones of Web sites for you.

06:42.590 --> 06:46.490
Watch out for people who are going to build your web site using a script.

06:46.490 --> 06:50.870
You don't know what the intellectual property rules are on that script are you don't know where they

06:50.870 --> 06:51.990
got the script.

06:52.010 --> 06:53.470
Who owns the licensing.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.740
But that happens quite often in freelancer and that's another reason why your rates are so cheap.

06:57.770 --> 07:02.320
I notice that a lot of freelancers start off on that Web site because it is kind of the Wild West.

07:02.390 --> 07:06.570
They can get some shady air projects to get reviews.

07:06.590 --> 07:11.930
You also notice on freelance at dotcom they started listing the completion rate for each project for

07:11.930 --> 07:14.780
each freelancer because that's a big concern on freelancer.

07:14.780 --> 07:17.640
A lot of times people will bid and they'll be way too low.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.490
Get into the project and then abandon it.

07:19.490 --> 07:24.560
So I would say that freelancer is something you want to dive into if you have some experience.

07:24.610 --> 07:28.940
It's where you get the best cost savings and it's a place you'd go if you are some really kind of sketchy

07:28.970 --> 07:37.930
deed or task you need to get done.
