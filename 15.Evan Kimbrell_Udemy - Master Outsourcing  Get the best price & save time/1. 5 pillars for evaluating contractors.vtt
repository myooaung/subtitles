00:06.510 --> 00:13.620
So at this point in the course you have come up with the idea you posted it online and now you're sifting

00:13.620 --> 00:20.720
through the masses of people that have responded to your ad hopefully you've posted it.

00:20.760 --> 00:23.440
ODesk Lance and freelancer.

00:23.440 --> 00:23.810
That's it.

00:23.820 --> 00:29.520
I suggest that's the best way of casting your net as wide as possible depending on how specific your

00:29.580 --> 00:33.500
application is or how well you've described your application.

00:33.540 --> 00:41.060
I would imagine you probably if you've waited about 24 hours have anywhere between 20 and 50 bids.

00:41.250 --> 00:47.940
I think the bulk of them will probably come from freelancer because that is where the people follow

00:48.030 --> 00:54.810
the quantity over quality creedo Elance are going to a lot fewer but the quality they're going to be

00:54.810 --> 00:55.660
much higher.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.440
Those are going to be the developers are probably going to put on your shortlist picking a freelancer

01:01.440 --> 01:07.230
is crucial later in this course we're going to do this in real life in application.

01:07.230 --> 01:11.600
If you're new to the course you probably won't see that because at the very beginning of the Course

01:11.670 --> 01:19.380
I'm going to start off by taking ideas and then starting the process of recruiting developers to build

01:19.380 --> 01:19.890
the idea.

01:19.890 --> 01:21.300
So if you're too early.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.050
Just be patient it'll come out in a week or so.

01:24.060 --> 01:28.890
Right now we're just going to talk over in general how do you pick a good freelancer.

01:29.370 --> 01:34.150
And this is a scale that I've developed over the last five years in the last hundred some applications.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.070
I'm going to teach you how I do it how I rank my freelancers.

01:38.160 --> 01:42.890
There could be other ways of doing it out there and I'm not saying those are wrong.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.790
I'm saying this is what's worked for me.

01:44.910 --> 01:49.700
I can walk you through my logic and my rationale for why I do it this way.

01:50.130 --> 01:52.170
I rate them on five things.

01:52.170 --> 01:54.720
Number one is relevancy.

01:54.720 --> 02:00.630
Relevancy means that when you're looking at a freelancer look at their portfolio how many applications

02:00.630 --> 02:07.770
have they done that are similar to what you're building not only similar in subject similar and industry

02:07.800 --> 02:09.430
and similar in size.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.150
Does it three dimensions that I look at.

02:12.150 --> 02:15.910
So one of my projects was a taxi management app.

02:15.930 --> 02:21.450
Now I'm going to look for someone who one hopefully has worked in some kind of logistics application

02:21.720 --> 02:28.980
Hopefully someone who's worked in cars or taxis or transportation sub that to look for someone who has

02:28.980 --> 02:36.030
built any type of application that I think controls moving parts and controls actual employees.

02:36.360 --> 02:42.310
If they don't have that that's Cobley a strike against them then I'm going to look for applications

02:42.310 --> 02:44.420
they've built that have similar features.

02:44.580 --> 02:50.070
My application and text messaging it also had an online screen or they can pick their shifts and pick

02:50.070 --> 02:51.130
their hours.

02:51.180 --> 02:57.180
It also had a system where they could communicate the root text message and that text message system

02:57.180 --> 03:00.570
was essentially like a robot that would talk back to them.

03:00.570 --> 03:04.830
That's a little obscure so I'm going to look for but I'm going to look for somebody who's maybe built

03:04.830 --> 03:08.780
text message apps before really anything along those lines.

03:08.940 --> 03:14.670
I might look for someone who's done online scheduling that could be something if they have neither one

03:14.670 --> 03:16.080
of those then.

03:16.180 --> 03:19.310
It's probably a strike in my book as well for the term relevancy.

03:20.970 --> 03:24.910
The last sub dimension under relevancy is going to be scope.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.940
Look at the application they've built.

03:26.940 --> 03:31.030
If you're proposing to build an application that you think will take a month to build.

03:31.140 --> 03:35.790
See how many other applications they've built that also took them roughly a month.

03:35.790 --> 03:41.060
Most of the freelancing applications will show you how long their projects lasted.

03:41.070 --> 03:45.170
ODesk will tell you how many hours they build on a particular project.

03:45.210 --> 03:52.460
Elance I believe you can just go and look at the job posting freelancer is similar in that regard.

03:52.830 --> 03:58.110
So if you're looking for a big project look to see that they have big project experience of you doing

03:58.110 --> 04:04.440
a smaller project then maybe you want to make sure that they can pull off a quick job as well.

04:04.470 --> 04:10.020
They're not going to disappear because the application that they signed on to build is only going to

04:10.020 --> 04:10.980
take them a week.

04:11.960 --> 04:19.170
If you have the case where they have either all small project experience or all big project experience

04:19.260 --> 04:22.480
I always err in favor of big project experience.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.110
I never really hold that against them and that's the only thing they do.

04:25.110 --> 04:31.230
That just means that they like larger projects but in my experience developers who work on larger applications

04:31.440 --> 04:36.450
have a larger breadth of skill and also they're just more responsible in general.

04:36.450 --> 04:40.730
So that's not necessarily a knock against them if they only have short projects.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.860
That means that they could be a less mature freelancer.

04:43.860 --> 04:45.900
That could mean that they're not nearly as committed.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.040
That could mean that they have other commitments that can actually get in the way.

04:50.910 --> 04:53.680
The second criteria I use is experience.

04:53.700 --> 04:58.920
This is probably the most obvious one and I think that honestly when you look at a freelancer and you

04:58.920 --> 05:04.320
want to determine how you rate them on experience just click on their profile and just take a quick

05:04.320 --> 05:10.050
gander at it shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to get a general idea of how experienced they

05:10.050 --> 05:15.750
are the way that you do this is you just simply look at the freelancer see how many projects they have

05:16.050 --> 05:18.590
specifically how long they've been doing this.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.870
That's another big one.

05:19.890 --> 05:23.200
They've only been on the application for a year.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.240
I mean six months.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.010
That could be a red flag.

05:26.390 --> 05:31.410
If that's the case that they've only been using that platform for a short period of time you can always

05:31.470 --> 05:37.320
ask them once you get to your shortlist say how long have you been making web applications and they

05:37.320 --> 05:42.990
will tell you often within their resumes or their profile descriptions it'll say I've been a developer

05:43.000 --> 05:44.090
four and a half years.

05:45.100 --> 05:51.840
Use that as a general gauge of how mature they are and how comfortable you are with them.

05:51.850 --> 05:55.330
The biggest thing is what's going to happen when they run into a problem.

05:55.450 --> 06:01.780
People who are more experienced are less likely to run away and they're less likely to have an incomplete

06:01.870 --> 06:04.890
project more experience is better.

06:04.930 --> 06:10.450
But keep in mind obviously that if you're trying to cut costs you might have to forego a little bit

06:10.450 --> 06:11.890
of experience.

06:11.980 --> 06:17.330
Also look at your application and have a deep think about how complicated this really is.

06:17.440 --> 06:22.900
You can reach out to the freelancers and ask them how complicated is this and they will generally give

06:22.900 --> 06:24.390
you a good idea.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.110
And that's a good way of engaging.

06:26.110 --> 06:32.370
OK this is a medium difficulty project or this is a low difficulty project if that's the case then experience

06:32.370 --> 06:34.990
is not nearly as important of a criteria.

06:35.780 --> 06:37.190
Criteria number three.

06:37.190 --> 06:44.930
And this is the biggest one for me it is interest every time you've heard someone who is a hiring or

06:44.990 --> 06:50.660
H.R. guru one of they always tell you is really really important about hiring someone.

06:50.810 --> 06:56.960
They always tell you that that person needs to show interest in your company and that is kind of a startup

06:56.960 --> 07:02.690
motto as well that people who are interested but lack the skills can learn the skills that people with

07:02.720 --> 07:07.030
the skills who lack the interest are just going to be kind of dead in the water.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.290
I believe that works for freelancers as well.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.720
And in this case look for interest.

07:12.860 --> 07:15.110
How do you tell if they're interested.

07:15.110 --> 07:21.680
Typically you'll see a range of responses to your project that range could be on one end of the spectrum

07:21.770 --> 07:25.220
which is that they sent you a copy and pasted message.

07:25.250 --> 07:29.220
And in that copy and pasted message you can notice that nothing has been modified.

07:29.240 --> 07:36.310
How do you tell if something's modified in their copy paste message the way I tell is if I post a project

07:36.310 --> 07:40.130
with specifics to it say I posted my Twilley taxi application.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.400
Did they mention anything about Twilio in their application.

07:43.690 --> 07:46.450
That's generally a dead giveaway for me.

07:46.470 --> 07:53.770
Did they mention any of the skills that I listed as prerequisites or desired skills on my job posting.

07:53.830 --> 07:57.490
There's no mention wow they didn't even read it at all.

07:57.490 --> 08:02.350
Now the other end of the spectrum in terms of interest will be that someone will just send you a message

08:02.620 --> 08:06.150
and they're commenting directly to you about the project.

08:06.160 --> 08:13.660
Maybe they're responding with a question that is a better sign a better sign them saying I like this

08:13.660 --> 08:18.490
project I'm interested in this project or a way that they're illustrating that they've thought about

08:18.490 --> 08:19.430
your project.

08:19.510 --> 08:24.970
They're spending time on your bed and they are showing that when they read your bed they're thinking

08:25.030 --> 08:25.840
about it.

08:26.830 --> 08:32.050
That's a good way of just of telling how interested and how committed they are to it.

08:32.110 --> 08:37.990
There are freelancers who are good at hiding that what they do is they have templates that they can

08:37.990 --> 08:44.710
modify very quickly and it's very hard for you to tell whether or not it's been written by hand or it's

08:44.710 --> 08:50.980
just a copy and paste message the way that you can easily get through this is just by messaging them

08:51.370 --> 08:55.580
and I'll show you this and we actually go through and do this for real.

08:55.720 --> 08:59.500
What you can do is just message them really quickly send them a sentence saying what do you think about

08:59.500 --> 09:00.530
the project.

09:00.580 --> 09:02.850
How long do you think it'll take now.

09:02.890 --> 09:05.800
What that will do is a lot of people who don't even check their accounts.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.790
They just won't respond.

09:06.790 --> 09:09.220
So there you go you save yourself some time.

09:09.250 --> 09:14.230
Some people respond to that give an inadequate answer and some people will respond and blow you away.

09:14.230 --> 09:17.890
They'll say you know I think these are the hard parts about it here the easy parts about it.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.170
This is my best guess of time.

09:20.170 --> 09:21.890
And then they'll ask you questions.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.780
That means that the person's engaged.

09:23.860 --> 09:26.510
And that is generally a positive sign.

09:26.530 --> 09:31.660
Another positive sign is when they verbally say they're interested in it or they mention that they built

09:31.660 --> 09:32.890
something in the past.

09:32.920 --> 09:39.370
Those are always good interests will keep their focus on the application an interest will make it such

09:39.370 --> 09:44.020
that they're more willing to put an extra work and they're less along to charge you for that extra work

09:44.020 --> 09:45.860
because it just comes naturally to them.

09:45.940 --> 09:52.210
If this is drudge work for them you're probably going to run into more issues then if it's someone who's

09:52.210 --> 10:01.400
really committed the fourth criteria that I use is availability availability is pretty easy to tell.

10:01.490 --> 10:06.850
You just simply ask them if you don't trust their responses what you can do is you can look at their

10:06.850 --> 10:08.380
profiles.

10:08.470 --> 10:14.260
Most of these freelancing Web sites they will tell you what other projects they are working on.

10:14.260 --> 10:21.110
A lot of times it's hard when a studio responds It's like a firm or an agency responds.

10:21.250 --> 10:26.740
You know that they have other projects and you know that they're not going to be realistic when you

10:26.740 --> 10:30.370
ask them hey what's your bandwidth going forward.

10:30.370 --> 10:32.640
How many people can you devote to this project.

10:32.650 --> 10:38.410
They always apply or they always exaggerate because they don't want to lose the sale and they always

10:38.410 --> 10:41.760
overestimate their ability to shift resources around.

10:41.830 --> 10:48.700
That is something I've known just from being in the studio game for so long that is inevitable and the

10:48.700 --> 10:50.780
best people do it regardless.

10:51.810 --> 10:57.770
Have a look for yourself look at their profile see how many active projects there are.

10:57.900 --> 11:01.820
You can tell that some are active and some of them look like they're abandoned.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.060
That's a red flag.

11:03.070 --> 11:07.740
It looks like there's a small project that started six months ago and it's not wrapped up.

11:07.740 --> 11:12.150
It's not necessarily their fault but it's something that you should keep in mind if you're not looking

11:12.150 --> 11:13.540
at an agency or a studio.

11:13.540 --> 11:17.610
Again IRA go back to what I said originally which is that you can just ask them what's your availability

11:17.610 --> 11:18.200
like.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.820
And for the most part they will be honest.

11:20.910 --> 11:26.010
If it's the case of a freelancer I think that your tolerance for how many other projects they have should

11:26.010 --> 11:27.160
be lower.

11:27.210 --> 11:33.330
I say this because say of a freelancer he might think he's extremely productive and they might be extremely

11:33.330 --> 11:34.380
doctor if he or she.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.760
However there are certain things they cannot predict.

11:36.780 --> 11:40.110
They don't know when a bug might hit one of their projects.

11:40.110 --> 11:46.050
They don't know when the scope of a project changes or when someone that they're working with changes

11:46.140 --> 11:49.330
the specifications for the project or if someone disappears.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.690
Things happen.

11:50.700 --> 11:55.410
So what can happen is if they're if they're billing your application and they're building three other

11:55.410 --> 12:03.330
things it is likely that one of the other projects can balloon and every well-intentioned thing developer

12:03.330 --> 12:05.760
I've met still makes this mistake.

12:05.760 --> 12:11.160
They always think that they can quantify how long and how much how much time they're going to spend

12:11.490 --> 12:13.340
on their other projects.

12:13.350 --> 12:14.340
And that always changes.

12:14.340 --> 12:16.080
It is too variable.

12:16.080 --> 12:21.150
Now if the freelancer says they had other job and we talked about this previously about how fighting

12:21.180 --> 12:27.090
off hours freelancers is fantastic that they didn't have another job that I think is an exception.

12:27.240 --> 12:33.000
Why do I say that because their job is typically nine to five if they've been with that job for a long

12:33.000 --> 12:37.590
period of time they're more realistic about how often they have to have over time.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.360
How often do their projects at work balloon.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.650
If it's one job that's one job it's not.

12:42.650 --> 12:46.080
Two other projects that they have limited familiarity with.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.820
So if they have another job that seems fine.

12:48.840 --> 12:52.070
Typically I look for people that have a lot of availability.

12:52.080 --> 12:56.730
There's one other thing that I think you should keep in mind if they have a wide open schedule that's

12:56.730 --> 12:57.340
a good thing.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.470
And it's a bad thing.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.820
They have a wide open schedule.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.420
Ask them are you going to be taking on other projects while you do this.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.440
That's a crucial thing that you should ask them.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.720
Criteria number five is responsiveness.

13:09.720 --> 13:15.930
A lot of people think that I read too much into responsiveness and I think I read too little into it.

13:15.930 --> 13:18.240
I think this is huge.

13:18.490 --> 13:23.610
When I message them how fast do they respond when I message them and I ask them two questions.

13:23.610 --> 13:28.950
They respond to both questions or do they only respond to one or are they even more open to one and

13:28.950 --> 13:32.940
it's not even the correct response responsiveness for me is huge.

13:33.060 --> 13:38.880
Because the more I ping them and the more they respond in the shorter period of time that shows me that

13:38.880 --> 13:40.810
they're active shows me that they're engage.

13:40.810 --> 13:44.760
It shows me that they're interested remember previously on the oDesk lecture.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.780
It shows you how often they respond to their contacts.

13:47.790 --> 13:49.200
That's a great sign.

13:49.200 --> 13:54.960
Now someone who only responds sometimes or they get around to it every 48 hours is not someone that

13:54.960 --> 14:00.420
you want to go into a project with because what happens when your servers crash and you have to message

14:00.420 --> 14:00.830
them.

14:00.870 --> 14:03.400
How responsive are they.

14:03.510 --> 14:10.830
You should try to talk to them outside of these systems see if they have Skype they have Skype then

14:10.860 --> 14:16.720
you can call to them directly and with minimal back and forth time.

14:16.860 --> 14:19.270
I'll talk about that in a little bit more in the next lecture.

14:19.410 --> 14:22.210
Why not having Skype is actually a really bad thing.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.180
Look for responsiveness.

14:24.220 --> 14:25.830
How do you know if they're responsive.

14:25.960 --> 14:26.920
Really simple.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.060
I call it the ping test.

14:29.140 --> 14:34.240
What I do is I will message them a quick question see how fast they respond how fast.

14:34.330 --> 14:35.110
Within an hour.

14:35.120 --> 14:35.910
Super fast.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.960
Within two hours that's quite fast.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.400
Are they in another country.

14:39.460 --> 14:43.210
Well if they're known in the country take what I just said and multiply it quite a bit.

14:43.210 --> 14:48.250
I think if they respond within five or six hours considering this is a freelancer Web site and you're

14:48.250 --> 14:54.670
not necessarily a client yet and then you have time zones you can take that into consideration if they're

14:54.670 --> 14:58.080
in your country and they're not responding within a couple hours.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.150
I don't generally like that.

15:00.170 --> 15:04.350
This is also depends on how many people we have bidding on your project and how choosy you want to be.

15:04.360 --> 15:08.650
Personally I do not like people who do not respond and ask them questions and I don't like people who

15:08.650 --> 15:10.190
take a day to respond.

15:10.270 --> 15:11.970
That makes me anxious.

15:12.040 --> 15:17.000
If you want to go a little bit hardcore about it like me I send them a ping message at midnight.

15:17.140 --> 15:18.410
See how they respond.

15:18.430 --> 15:23.030
I'll send them something kind of at the range of when they should be awake or when they should be asleep.

15:23.050 --> 15:25.110
I just want to see how connected they are to their phone.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.410
For me this is huge.

15:26.410 --> 15:31.990
Someone who's interested in my project who has a decent amount of experience who is very responsive

15:31.990 --> 15:34.440
is a very good candidate for me.

15:34.480 --> 15:38.980
I think that when we go ahead and do a real live version of this you guys will get a lot more out of

15:38.980 --> 15:41.650
it if you have questions at this point in the lecture.

15:41.650 --> 15:45.120
Feel free to post it in the group discussion and we can talk about it.

15:45.130 --> 15:50.920
There are other criteria I'm leaving out and I admit that these are the five that I care about and they're

15:50.920 --> 15:52.550
not really in any order.

15:52.570 --> 15:55.350
I think that you kind of rate them on all five.

15:55.540 --> 16:00.880
And I think what I'll do is probably attach a tech sheet that you can actually do some kind of visualization

16:00.880 --> 16:06.310
that will help you rate them in your head after a while you get really good at this and you'll be able

16:06.310 --> 16:11.860
to rattle it off very quickly after a while you also kind of get a gut feeling for is this a good applicant

16:11.860 --> 16:13.150
or is this a bad argument.

16:13.650 --> 16:19.600
In the next lecture I'm going to talk about the five things I've recognized that are red flags that

16:19.600 --> 16:21.490
you probably didn't realize were red flags.
