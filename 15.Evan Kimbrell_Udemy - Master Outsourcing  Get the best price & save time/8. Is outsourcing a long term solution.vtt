00:06.210 --> 00:13.320
Let's talk a little bit about the question of our contractors a long term solution I bring this up because

00:13.320 --> 00:19.590
a lot of you are taking this course and I'm promoting the benefits of contracting out your first version

00:19.590 --> 00:24.570
of your product and I'm kind of presenting it as if it's this obvious choice.

00:24.570 --> 00:29.910
I believe that at the beginning of your business it is the obvious choice it has so many benefits to

00:29.910 --> 00:30.210
you.

00:30.210 --> 00:35.760
The founder from equity from the leverage going to have and you go to recruit technical founders to

00:35.760 --> 00:41.430
the terms you get an investment even the amount of time and effort you're going to put up front and

00:41.580 --> 00:44.660
essentially the efficiency of your time at the very beginning.

00:45.090 --> 00:49.690
But then there's the question of Is this something that that essentially stays ripe forever.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.140
Should you always stick with contractors.

00:52.140 --> 00:55.110
The answer to this is it depends.

00:55.110 --> 00:56.500
That's the short answer.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.540
It depends on a lot of things.

00:57.540 --> 01:00.310
It depends how serious you are about your company.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.260
It depends how big your company is growing.

01:04.260 --> 01:09.780
Let's imagine someone who is building a lifestyle business you want to make a basic web application

01:09.780 --> 01:12.680
that's going to bring you $5000 a month.

01:13.110 --> 01:19.620
In that case do you even need to bring on someone to your team five dollars a month is not a huge hurdle

01:19.620 --> 01:24.150
to hit especially if you're devoting a lot of time and effort towards it.

01:24.240 --> 01:29.700
In that case then honestly this is that business is something that could be run by contractors essentially

01:29.700 --> 01:31.210
in perpetuity forever.

01:31.440 --> 01:36.210
If that's the case you want to build a small business you don't plan to turn it into a Google.

01:36.210 --> 01:41.240
I definitely think that as long as you establish good ongoing relationships with your contractors there's

01:41.250 --> 01:45.800
absolutely no reason why you would need to switch to in-house development.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.400
If you're trying to build a company that is going to grow and grow and grow and you're trying to take

01:51.400 --> 01:53.620
this rocket ship to the moon so to speak.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.330
It's a different question.

01:55.480 --> 02:00.490
And typically when I was giving advice to start ups when I was in venture capital what I would tell

02:00.490 --> 02:06.040
them is the most effective way of starting your business is you start with contracting as the company

02:06.040 --> 02:14.530
starts accelerating your needs will start to change contacting has an inherent cost advantage to it.

02:14.670 --> 02:19.820
But it also has an inherent efficiency disadvantage to it when you're contracting out.

02:19.830 --> 02:24.360
That means that that person is not integrated into your core unit.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.820
The turnaround time for example when you make changes or make additions is much slower.

02:28.950 --> 02:33.270
Now at the beginning when you're testing out an idea and you're trying to gain kind of minimal traction

02:33.270 --> 02:39.060
to take your business and the next step is not going to matter how much time you spend writing requirements

02:39.120 --> 02:43.130
and what the turnaround time is on a new feature.

02:43.230 --> 02:49.230
The turnaround time on a bug is still important but it's not nearly as important when you have 200 users

02:49.320 --> 02:52.940
versus when you have 2 million users as the company grows.

02:52.950 --> 02:59.370
This kind of dynamic changes all of a sudden the time it takes to do things like that becomes much more

02:59.370 --> 03:03.840
valuable and the cost advantage of contracting goes down significantly.

03:03.930 --> 03:11.160
And that's why I generally suggest as your company progresses you do shift from contracting into in-house

03:11.160 --> 03:18.170
development and that's the best way of taking advantage of the upfront cost advantages of contracting.

03:18.270 --> 03:21.570
And then later taking advantage of once money is not a huge issue.

03:21.630 --> 03:27.060
The advantages of having an in-house team someone you want sitting next to you someone who 2:00 in the

03:27.060 --> 03:31.390
morning when something goes down you are a phone call away and they'll do it immediately.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.850
Once your company is big you don't really want to deal with writing contracts constantly for new sections

03:38.060 --> 03:38.950
of development.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.570
You don't want to have to constantly deal with billing and recording time.

03:43.580 --> 03:49.640
It's much easier to for instance an in-house developer to use them for over time or use them as an an

03:49.670 --> 03:55.550
on an as needed basis or as a contractor probably is going to adhere more to the 9:00 to 5:00 schedule.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.800
Hopefully I explained this decently well.

03:57.800 --> 04:03.590
Bigger companies they need different things and so eventually your needs will evolve and problems that

04:03.590 --> 04:08.270
you thought were big previously will no longer be huge issues anymore.

04:08.270 --> 04:13.760
For instance you know paying an extra 50 percent per hour for your developer work it's not going to

04:13.760 --> 04:20.720
be as big of a deal when you know you have a much bigger user base and a lot more money in funding and

04:20.720 --> 04:24.250
a lot more collective effort going towards your product.

04:24.260 --> 04:27.770
This is not completely to say that you can't go the distance with contractors.

04:27.770 --> 04:32.110
There are a lot of big companies that keep contractors on their roster.

04:32.240 --> 04:37.400
But typically what you'll see is it's more of a hybrid situation where they stick with contractors for

04:37.400 --> 04:44.930
the first two years and then gradually bring in more in-house developers but they retain outside contractors

04:44.960 --> 04:48.560
because they don't want to use what we call internal velocity.

04:48.580 --> 04:55.320
What that basically means is your company's ability to produce new product new code make changes further

04:55.410 --> 05:00.620
your product they don't want to take a dip in that as they switch completely from contract to in-house

05:00.620 --> 05:06.020
developer and so they retain both and a lot of companies actually I'd say the vast majority of companies

05:06.020 --> 05:10.140
will utilize contractors as well as in-house developers.

05:10.520 --> 05:15.290
And if you follow this strategy in the course by using contractors at first that will actually set you

05:15.350 --> 05:19.760
up to have a much stronger ongoing relationship with your contractor.

05:19.790 --> 05:24.500
So you're not in the future trying to find efficient contractors that you have a rapport with and then

05:24.500 --> 05:29.960
you have very strong working efficiency with the guys have any other questions just post them.

05:29.960 --> 05:36.350
Dislikers really just kind of a reflection I want you guys to be as realistic as possible going forward.

05:36.350 --> 05:42.800
Just knowing that the most effective startups I've seen shift from contractor to in-house or shift from

05:42.800 --> 05:44.150
contractor to hybrid.
