All right now that you've finished the lecture on how to use balsamic I can show you a real life example

00:13.030 --> 00:22.150
of a balsamic wireframe we use to launch a separate sub page for our our main Sprint kicked up com home

00:22.150 --> 00:23.240
page.

00:23.350 --> 00:27.700
So I bought this in balsamic and you can see that has a lot of the same features or it just kind of

00:27.700 --> 00:33.340
went over and I can show you this is kind of you know the level of difficulty and the level of detail

00:33.700 --> 00:36.690
that I would expect someone to build.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.420
We're building something on balsamic would would kind of go for.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.110
As you can see this is not particularly detailed.

00:45.130 --> 00:51.410
We wanted to make a long landing page something that you could scroll down one of those long the called

00:51.430 --> 00:58.310
long pages and we wanted to make sure that we could have one separate logo.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.200
So we kind of threw something together on balsamic.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.520
This is the idea behind it we wanted to do sprint kayak developer on demand.

01:06.370 --> 01:15.340
And this service was service we started about a year ago helping people staff their companies with contracted

01:15.340 --> 01:16.340
labor.

01:16.450 --> 01:21.300
And so basically what I just did is I took a picture of the art Hetter bar at Sprint Qik.

01:21.310 --> 01:28.600
I copied that inspirited as an image into balsamic so that you could see our top bar and then I changed

01:28.610 --> 01:33.880
out just with a little X marks and Wolf shapes that I would use as a scratch out.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.190
And then I changed to what I wanted it to say at the top and then pretty much everything down here it's

01:39.190 --> 01:41.290
all just kind of chicken scratch together.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.490
This is roughly the text that I wanted to put.

01:43.540 --> 01:48.750
This is roughly kind of the idea of icon design that I wanted to put together.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.930
Let's say we design pretty much each section out.

01:52.270 --> 02:00.240
And so as you can see it was super quick and easy put in pretty much every section.

02:00.430 --> 02:04.030
I thought I'd want you noticed that I kind of scratched it together.

02:04.030 --> 02:07.240
It's very much a loose mock up.

02:07.600 --> 02:13.060
And then I just kind of give you an idea like you know put a picture of a human for a start up and three

02:13.060 --> 02:17.470
humans for a mid-sized company and then multiple ones for enterprise and I locked it up with the graphic

02:17.470 --> 02:21.840
designer then kind of come up with an image that would match all of that.

02:22.090 --> 02:26.380
And then even like when you and Efik you don't need to write out every single piece of text I can just

02:26.380 --> 02:30.290
put loosely what the format should look like and I'll show you what it ends up looking like at the end

02:31.620 --> 02:38.020
of the page and it up looking like I see that's that custom logo that we got done as the new header.

02:38.140 --> 02:45.670
This is that icon set that I previously talked about and everything kind of worked out pretty well this

02:45.760 --> 02:50.480
entire thing cost us about $500.

02:50.620 --> 02:59.350
That includes the programming that includes the design includes even little inserting like old javascript

02:59.950 --> 03:04.140
plugins make it such that I can do all things like this.

03:04.150 --> 03:07.330
And so not too shabby.

03:07.360 --> 03:14.800
You don't really have to break the bank to get things done.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.010
Do.
