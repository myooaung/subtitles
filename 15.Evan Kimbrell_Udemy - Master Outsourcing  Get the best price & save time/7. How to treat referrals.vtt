Let's talk about getting referrals for contractors and something that happens quite often someone will

00:11.490 --> 00:17.060
say hey I worked with a great team or a or to the great freelancer which you'd like the referral all

00:17.070 --> 00:17.980
and so that for you.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.970
Yes you do want the referral.

00:20.220 --> 00:24.550
The only things that you want to be careful with with regard to her finals are one.

00:24.630 --> 00:26.370
Think about the person who's repairing them.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.120
Do you trust that person.

00:28.230 --> 00:32.620
Do you trust that person's idea of quality too.

00:32.810 --> 00:36.130
Do you like the Web site that the contractor made.

00:36.170 --> 00:40.580
So if your friend has a Web site that you've been thinking to back your head how ugly that is and you

00:40.580 --> 00:41.730
just don't want to tell them.

00:41.870 --> 00:46.160
Then you probably don't want to take a referral for the contractor that built it seems a little obvious

00:46.190 --> 00:51.410
but you'd be surprised by how many people end up with contractors regardless of what they think of the

00:51.500 --> 00:52.860
website they've seen them build.

00:52.880 --> 00:53.570
It's weird.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.600
But past that why do I think about referrals referrals.

00:58.630 --> 00:59.880
They are awesome.

00:59.890 --> 01:00.540
Why.

01:00.670 --> 01:01.950
Well there's two big reasons.

01:01.990 --> 01:08.920
One previously we talked about the qualification stage of picking a freelancer or a team.

01:08.920 --> 01:14.350
What I suggested doing was taking a very small test and giving them a project has to see how they work

01:14.350 --> 01:20.980
how you interact What's the responsiveness you can skip that entire section and you can skip the entire

01:20.980 --> 01:24.360
section that's associated with finding them to begin with.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.620
So that saves you a lot of time a lot of money.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.780
You might not have the familiarity with them but they come pre-vetted you've already seen what they

01:31.780 --> 01:32.600
can build.

01:32.620 --> 01:36.280
You already have a recommendation from someone saying to communicate well that's all you need.

01:36.490 --> 01:44.290
And to the freelancer or the team they're going to be a lot more inclined to work harder for you.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.810
The reason why it's just basic psychology.

01:46.880 --> 01:52.010
If I work for a client and that client thinks so well of me that your first me to a second client and

01:52.010 --> 01:56.870
I take on that second client I now have two clients and I know that they communicate.

01:56.870 --> 02:01.730
So if I do a poor job with the second client that could affect my relationship with the first client

02:02.030 --> 02:03.850
it ups the stakes for the contractor.

02:04.010 --> 02:09.230
So and I've seen this time and time again when I get referrals and that person who is referring them

02:09.320 --> 02:14.090
is an active client or they're likely to bring back a project to that contractor.

02:14.090 --> 02:19.110
I see a significant increase in the effort shown by the contractor.

02:19.160 --> 02:27.070
I've seen them go beyond what I expect out of a usual fix price project or a per hour project so if

02:27.130 --> 02:29.540
you have the option of referrals It's fantastic.

02:29.540 --> 02:34.190
Very quick thing you could easily do if you are stuck and you don't know who to pick if you're Elance

02:34.220 --> 02:39.000
submission or Yoda's submission or whatever it is a very quick way of doing this.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.240
Ask your friends.

02:40.240 --> 02:45.800
That's Super-Duper simple you'd be surprised how many people have outsourced poor or contracted out.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.990
You can get a referral from somebody.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.350
I mean you can even private message me and I'll give you referrals.

02:51.410 --> 02:55.250
Ahmadis you not going to refer you to my company I will give you referrals from people we have worked

02:55.250 --> 03:03.840
with so share pass it a lot around saves everybody a lot of time and it almost always has a better outcome.
