00:10.530 --> 00:12.720
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:12.720 --> 00:18.450
We're going to talk about another one of the best practices for contracting and outsourcing and it's

00:18.450 --> 00:21.520
called dividing by specialisations.

00:21.510 --> 00:29.550
Now what have you guys who are not totally familiar with web work or mobile work or just in general

00:29.560 --> 00:31.480
digital work design work.

00:31.890 --> 00:35.370
Probably not familiar with every single piece that goes into your project.

00:35.370 --> 00:41.100
So let's say that you're building a web project your project has separate sections to it.

00:41.190 --> 00:44.710
So it's not just that you have one person make you a Web site.

00:44.730 --> 00:48.330
You need someone to do the design and you need someone to do the development.

00:48.360 --> 00:53.370
Now even within the development side there's different sections and within the design side there are

00:53.370 --> 00:54.730
different sections.

00:54.750 --> 00:59.880
Now when I say separate out the specializations what I mean by that is first you need to recognize that

00:59.880 --> 01:06.870
there are separate sections in your project timeline or in your project scope and then you just divide

01:06.900 --> 01:14.190
by that you look for one person for each section as opposed to one person who does the entire thing.

01:14.190 --> 01:16.440
Now what's the benefit to doing this.

01:16.440 --> 01:21.660
So let's say in one scenario you have someone who says I'm going to make your web application including

01:21.720 --> 01:26.400
everything I'm going to help you with the strategy I'm helping with the design I'm going to develop

01:26.400 --> 01:27.540
it I'm going to market it.

01:27.540 --> 01:32.820
And then the Allt alternate option is that you get four different people one person helps you with consulting

01:32.820 --> 01:37.620
the idea one person designs that one person develops it and then one person helps you with the launch

01:37.620 --> 01:38.430
and the marketing.

01:38.430 --> 01:43.710
The difference is is that when you have one person do all of those things they're typically on average

01:43.740 --> 01:45.660
as a whole much more expensive.

01:45.660 --> 01:45.960
Why.

01:45.960 --> 01:50.260
Because it's a much rarer thing to find someone who can do all of those things.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.530
And so their time is much much much more valuable.

01:53.550 --> 01:57.730
Also when you have one person do all of those things that can't possibly be an expert.

01:57.780 --> 02:04.500
Every single one of them typically they're going to be good at one or two things but they can't possibly

02:04.500 --> 02:05.400
be a master.

02:05.460 --> 02:07.210
Every single section.

02:07.230 --> 02:12.210
Now the other scenario where you have four different people doing every single session you can pick

02:12.210 --> 02:17.370
people who are good at that one thing and because they're specialists.

02:17.370 --> 02:21.600
That means that that is their craft they're not good at other things but they're also not attempting

02:21.600 --> 02:24.660
to work on other sections of your application.

02:24.660 --> 02:30.870
Now a specialist you usually end up saving quite a bit of money because it's a question of scale.

02:30.870 --> 02:34.190
Almost one person works on the same thing over and over and over again.

02:34.200 --> 02:39.630
They get really good at that one thing they're faster at it and they can end up charging you less.

02:39.640 --> 02:42.060
And now this can apply in many different scenarios.

02:42.060 --> 02:43.330
Here's a great example.

02:43.500 --> 02:48.780
If you're building a web site or a web application and you get someone to design it and then you get

02:48.780 --> 02:52.080
someone who says I'm going to take that design and I'm going to develop it.

02:52.110 --> 02:55.630
Well you can actually add another step in that process.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.840
When you have a design typically it'll come to you in like a photoshop file or an Illustrator file or

03:00.930 --> 03:03.000
whatever A-P and GPDA.

03:03.810 --> 03:08.550
And then what ends up happening is the developer has to convert that into something that the browser

03:08.580 --> 03:10.150
can actually understand.

03:10.170 --> 03:16.530
They take the images out by a technique called slicing and they do all of the layouts for the actual

03:16.590 --> 03:19.610
application so that it displays correctly on the browser.

03:19.710 --> 03:23.380
Then they do the heavy lifting of actually making the buttons work.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.340
The functionality work the pages load correctly.

03:26.340 --> 03:32.760
So what you can do is you can actually find a specialist to do that in-between job which is taking design

03:32.790 --> 03:38.430
and turning it into each team mount CSSA which is the preliminary work the developer would have been

03:38.430 --> 03:39.100
doing.

03:39.140 --> 03:45.240
Now typically a developer is good at either back into work or they're really good at taking designs

03:45.240 --> 03:47.180
and making them into HVM else.

03:47.190 --> 03:53.880
SS So in the case that you have someone doing both just generic development typically that means that

03:53.880 --> 03:59.670
they're probably not as good at both sides and they're probably charging you more because they actually

03:59.670 --> 04:01.680
it takes them a lot more time to do it.

04:01.680 --> 04:07.980
Now if I specialized in just taking a design and turning it into something a browser could read of just

04:08.040 --> 04:12.150
images and HMO I'd probably be pretty good at that.

04:12.150 --> 04:17.030
I'd also probably do it in half the time as someone who does not spend a lot of time doing that.

04:17.130 --> 04:18.690
And this is a great real life example.

04:18.690 --> 04:26.490
So if you had to design what you can do is you can go to a studio that specializes in taking webs taking

04:26.490 --> 04:28.870
design and turning them into an age team LCS us.

04:28.980 --> 04:34.230
And they cost a fraction of what someone else would charge your developer probably will charge you $40

04:34.230 --> 04:36.520
an hour and probably tell you take them 20 hours.

04:36.570 --> 04:41.360
That's eight hundred bucks but you can go to a company like pixel crayons site slinger.

04:41.370 --> 04:47.940
There's a lot of other ones out there or even just a studio you found on e Lance that specializes in

04:47.940 --> 04:54.240
this and they're going to charge you probably $100 $150 because they're very good at it.

04:54.240 --> 05:00.660
So think about specializing The only downside to specializing is that it requires more management on

05:00.660 --> 05:01.540
your side.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.860
It requires a little more coordination.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.890
You need to make sure that the people who are helping you in each segment of your application or your

05:07.890 --> 05:10.190
project are in sync with the other.

05:10.400 --> 05:16.010
Now pay attention to the Project Management section of this course that could help you communicate between

05:16.010 --> 05:17.810
them much more easily.

05:17.990 --> 05:21.260
But in general Siskind required that your a bit more on the ball.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.290
You make sure everybody's on the same page everyone understands the same look and feel.

05:25.430 --> 05:29.870
It's really helpful to brief everyone on the same information even if it's not necessarily related to

05:29.870 --> 05:34.880
what they're doing just so they can know what to expect and know what their final product should be.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.710
So if they can handed it off to the next person.

05:36.740 --> 05:38.240
So this is a best practice.

05:38.270 --> 05:43.730
I think it's great if you're an advanced outsource or or contractor if you've worked with web projects

05:43.730 --> 05:44.430
before.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.890
If you're brand new to it you might be tempted just to use one person to do the entire thing which is

05:48.890 --> 05:49.780
perfectly fine.

05:49.790 --> 05:54.130
Obviously pay attention to their portfolio but expect to pay a little bit more money and expect it's

05:54.130 --> 05:55.970
going to take a little bit more time.

05:55.970 --> 06:01.430
So if you're up for it and you think you can do it try to find someone who can do individual segments

06:01.430 --> 06:02.690
of your project.

06:02.780 --> 06:07.640
You save money you save a lot of time and usually the product ends up coming out better.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.530
If you guys have any questions post in the group discussion love to discuss it.

06:11.690 --> 06:13.250
Any experiences you've had.

06:13.250 --> 06:24.150
Just let me know otherwise we'll see in the next lecture.
