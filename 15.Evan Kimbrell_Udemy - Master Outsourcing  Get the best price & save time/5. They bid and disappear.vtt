Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:10.450 --> 00:17.320
We're going to talk about a very common kind of phenomenon you'll see on these freelancing platforms.

00:17.470 --> 00:19.460
And that's the big and disappear.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.500
So this is a question I get all the time.

00:21.550 --> 00:27.010
Someone bid looks like a great bid even what they describe might be spot on or you might be interested

00:27.010 --> 00:29.640
in their price range but then they disappear immediately.

00:29.650 --> 00:35.890
Honestly what you have to understand is this is this is the case in a lot of projects in the vast majority

00:35.890 --> 00:37.900
of projects I've ever run.

00:37.900 --> 00:40.460
There have been at least one or two people who have done this.

00:40.480 --> 00:46.630
This is why it's important that in any project you run the vetting process with multiple people don't

00:46.630 --> 00:48.700
put all of your eggs in one basket.

00:48.850 --> 00:55.660
If you do a project you get 18 bids and you only pick one person to actually go into in-depth process

00:55.660 --> 00:59.560
of discussing the project and doing some vetting with them.

00:59.650 --> 01:04.700
You're going to set yourself up for failure because a lot of times that person will disappear.

01:04.810 --> 01:07.470
Now it doesn't happen with every single person you've met.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.250
But when it does happen it makes it such that you just wasted a lot of time.

01:11.260 --> 01:15.050
So make sure you do this with lots of different people.

01:15.250 --> 01:19.360
In general the reason why this happens is one of two things.

01:19.420 --> 01:25.750
One the person who bid on your project is also bidding on other projects and what probably happened

01:25.750 --> 01:31.240
is they probably got selected for a different project and all of a sudden their entire free time is

01:31.240 --> 01:32.250
now gone.

01:32.260 --> 01:37.050
Freelancers in general will bid for 10 20 projects at a time.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.800
Just knowing that it's not realistic that they take on more than one or two of them but they're not

01:41.800 --> 01:45.230
going to win 90 percent of the projects.

01:45.250 --> 01:50.170
This is just how most freelancers work and it's something you have to accept because they need to make

01:50.170 --> 01:50.850
a living.

01:50.890 --> 01:57.100
And so many people bidding on so many projects means it's it's kind of a roll of the dice whether or

01:57.100 --> 01:58.440
not they get selected.

01:58.450 --> 02:03.730
So that's the most likely scenario is that they disappear because another project sucked up their time.

02:03.730 --> 02:06.720
The more polite freelancers will tell you that.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.860
And if that's the case they'll tell you that.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.480
Ask them for a referral.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.240
Move on to the next candidate.

02:12.250 --> 02:18.750
The other scenario of them disappearing is simply that they change their mind about your project.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.000
This is less likely but it does happen.

02:21.310 --> 02:24.140
So what will happen is you know they see the project description.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.800
They bid once and start having a discussion with you.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.850
They realize that they don't want to work with you or the project is different than what they thought.

02:31.150 --> 02:34.320
If that's the case a lot of them just cut ties and disappear.

02:34.330 --> 02:36.150
They don't explain that it's confusing you.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.800
Explain what is confusing.

02:37.930 --> 02:40.970
But you need to understand that's essentially what they're signaling towards you.

02:41.050 --> 02:46.300
If this is happening to you repeatedly once or twice or three times in the same project you need to

02:46.300 --> 02:50.160
stop and understand what exactly is making them disappear.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.970
Is your project too confusing.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.300
Are you presenting your project as smaller than it really is.

02:55.310 --> 02:59.290
Are you presenting it as simpler than it really is and then once you start actually talking to people

02:59.290 --> 03:01.200
they realize it's a lot more complex.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.010
If that's the case you need to go back and assess what it is that you're misrepresenting about your

03:06.010 --> 03:06.720
project.

03:06.790 --> 03:08.250
Think of it as a good thing.

03:08.260 --> 03:13.120
It's a signal to you that there is a mismatch between what you're saying about your project and what

03:13.120 --> 03:17.720
the person who's actually going to build it kind of realizes about it.

03:17.770 --> 03:22.430
Now if they'd realize later once you started the project you'd have a serious problem with the fact

03:22.430 --> 03:25.270
that realizing upfront that's a good thing.

03:25.270 --> 03:30.640
Follow the other lecture when we talk about rapid cycling posts and what you can do is you can slowly

03:30.640 --> 03:37.420
modify over time adding more information as freelancers ask more questions that'll make it more realistic

03:37.550 --> 03:42.120
upfront so that every time you post a new job posting it has more information.

03:42.130 --> 03:48.040
It'll slow down your vetting process but also catch you kind of up to speed with what the real expectations

03:48.040 --> 03:49.150
of your project should be.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.920
So if it happens don't worry.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.610
Happens all the time.

03:52.660 --> 03:58.420
You just need to understand why it happened and understand it's never anything personal but it could

03:58.420 --> 04:03.070
be something wrong with your project if that's the case then you need to take a hard look back at it

04:03.070 --> 04:04.720
and you need to ask them for feedback.

04:04.720 --> 04:04.960
All right.

04:04.960 --> 04:11.610
So in the next lecture.
