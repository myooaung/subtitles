00:10.650 --> 00:14.810
You guys will come back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about your subcontracting

00:14.820 --> 00:19.370
strategy and we're going to talk a little bit about what's the best path for you.

00:19.440 --> 00:25.710
So before you start your journey of putting together a killer team and finally signing your first multimillion

00:25.710 --> 00:30.210
dollar contract you need to sit down and have a little bit of a think about what you're subcontracting

00:30.210 --> 00:31.260
strategy is going to be.

00:31.260 --> 00:38.130
So let me give you a little bit of transparency about how freelancers and contractors are typically

00:38.130 --> 00:38.900
divided up.

00:38.910 --> 00:44.010
Now it's really helpful before you go and look for a subcontractor to know what you're going to expect

00:44.280 --> 00:46.290
and don't know exactly what you're looking for.

00:46.290 --> 00:50.130
Now first off you're going to need to make a decision about price and language.

00:50.130 --> 00:55.710
Now the reason why I say those together is because they're almost always related to each other.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.080
There are some exceptions of course.

00:57.090 --> 01:01.260
Now some contractors are going to be from countries you've never heard of and some contractors they're

01:01.260 --> 01:03.170
going to be from probably down the street.

01:03.180 --> 01:09.540
There's a big gap when we're talking about distance now the same time some of them will be able to effectively

01:09.600 --> 01:15.600
communicate and communicate fluidly and other ones are going to sound probably like drunk robots really

01:15.600 --> 01:20.940
hard to understand sometimes they speak like you remember Max speak that old software program you would

01:20.940 --> 01:22.370
use in elementary school.

01:22.380 --> 01:28.380
Now a contractor with bad communication skills and an inconvenient time zone they're probably going

01:28.380 --> 01:29.700
to be a lot cheaper.

01:29.730 --> 01:31.590
Now obviously there's exceptions to this.

01:31.590 --> 01:36.650
There are still expensive areas that have terrible language skills and terrible time zones.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.050
But this is just a generalization.

01:38.070 --> 01:43.830
Now a fluent English speaker who lives in the same exact time zone as you almost sometimes the same

01:43.830 --> 01:46.240
city they're obviously going to be a lot more expensive.

01:46.290 --> 01:53.640
Now how this relates to your business is that each type of contractor can dramatically change the dynamic

01:53.940 --> 01:58.170
of how you deliver projects how you pitch your projects and how you find clients.

01:58.170 --> 02:04.380
Now expensive articulate contractor they're probably going to deliver much higher quality work but they're

02:04.380 --> 02:06.350
also going to be considerably more expensive.

02:06.360 --> 02:12.210
Now that for you means that you're going have to push higher prices to your clients and because your

02:12.210 --> 02:13.520
rates are higher.

02:13.650 --> 02:19.700
Now all of a sudden your clients are going to expect a considerably higher standard of project quality.

02:19.710 --> 02:22.910
So in a lot of cases it can actually cancel itself out.

02:23.010 --> 02:27.750
You charge more but the same time your clients ask for a lot more.

02:27.790 --> 02:33.100
Now in this scenario you might have to cut your margins especially at the very beginning.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.480
So if you go this route.

02:34.530 --> 02:40.620
The key here is going to be your ability to land higher paying contracts that are also probably longer

02:40.620 --> 02:47.730
term or you need to plan on having a strategy of using higher paying contractors but also having access

02:47.730 --> 02:53.910
to other experts that you can bring in to really put that top polish on your products.

02:53.910 --> 03:00.120
Now a cheaper lower cost contractor with poor English skills that means you're going to have to compensate

03:00.180 --> 03:02.720
upfront with more effort from your end.

03:02.850 --> 03:08.730
And also you might have to deal with lower product quality but in this scenario your margins are always

03:08.730 --> 03:10.060
going to be a lot healthier.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.260
And that allows you the option to undercut other providers.

03:13.260 --> 03:19.080
So the key to this scenario is if you pick a lower cost option someone who is not as great at communicating

03:19.110 --> 03:22.800
or explaining what they're doing or what needs to be done.

03:22.830 --> 03:29.070
The key here is going to be whether or not you can manage them effectively enough to get a good product

03:29.340 --> 03:33.860
because if you can do that then you're price to quality ratio is going to be fantastic.

03:33.870 --> 03:40.050
Now in the scenario of a more articulate more qualified contractor is more expensive you're not going

03:40.050 --> 03:43.950
to have to spend as much time with them which means you can spend more time on other things.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.690
Now a low cost contractor it's going to be the opposite.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.320
You're going to spend more time on project management.

03:49.320 --> 03:55.110
So which one you want to go if you want to focus more on sales and then just knowing that your project

03:55.110 --> 04:00.360
is more or less covered or you want to spend more time on project management knowing that at the end

04:00.360 --> 04:02.730
of the day you make more money per project.

04:02.730 --> 04:07.410
Now here's the key distinction for me and this is what I always use when making the decision or consulting

04:07.410 --> 04:09.130
someone on how to make this decision.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.670
Think about yourself and think about your experience.

04:11.670 --> 04:14.280
Do you have a lot of experience working with contractors.

04:14.310 --> 04:17.580
Do you have a lot of experience working with distributed teams.

04:17.670 --> 04:20.100
Do you speak another language potentially.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.670
Do you have any experience being a project manager.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.420
How much experience do you have in web development and web development projects.

04:27.420 --> 04:31.920
If you have a lot of experience and you answered yes to a lot of the questions I just asked you then

04:31.920 --> 04:36.330
you're a very good candidate for someone who can use the low cost high margin option.

04:36.330 --> 04:41.760
Now if you're under developed in this kind of area then it might make more sense for you to focus on

04:41.760 --> 04:48.450
higher paid contractors who can deal with more have more autonomy and you focus more on sales.

04:48.450 --> 04:52.590
So now one other division that you need to be aware of and you need to make a decision about is whether

04:52.590 --> 04:56.820
or not you hire a freelancer or a firm an individual or a company.

04:56.820 --> 05:01.770
Now if you're coming from my outsourcing course you know that we covered this like to death but for

05:01.770 --> 05:03.280
this course I'm just to simplify it.

05:03.300 --> 05:07.340
So one firms come with what are called management layers.

05:07.350 --> 05:13.020
This provides transparency and this provides a counter guilty for your project it also offloads the

05:13.020 --> 05:19.050
work from you onto them when it comes to day to day management because of this they're much less likely

05:19.050 --> 05:20.540
to disappear.

05:20.850 --> 05:26.130
They're much less likely to run into problems and if they do run into problems they're more capable

05:26.130 --> 05:29.300
of solving it on their own before pulling you into the project.

05:29.310 --> 05:34.020
Now on the flip side they come with a much higher price tag because they're not just paying for your

05:34.020 --> 05:39.210
developer you're also paying for the project manager or whoever ends up managing them and also firms

05:39.210 --> 05:40.500
always have a profit line.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.050
Also keep in mind that firms are slower to move.

05:43.050 --> 05:45.750
They have a lot more people in the organization.

05:45.780 --> 05:50.110
They can't just drop everything and pick up whatever you need at this moment that you want it now.

05:50.130 --> 05:55.200
Individuals are going to be considerably cheaper and considerably more flexible.

05:55.260 --> 06:00.000
However you are the last line of defense in case anything goes wrong.

06:00.090 --> 06:03.800
They get sick or any problem arises.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.110
They're going to require a lot more management time from you.

06:07.110 --> 06:11.650
So again when considering this division it really just comes down to experience.

06:11.670 --> 06:17.790
Now if you're confident you can turn a low cost freelancer a contractor into high quality work and you

06:17.790 --> 06:23.250
know you have experience and you know you kind of had your stripes in this field then you definitely

06:23.250 --> 06:25.630
can go for an outsourced freelancer.

06:25.650 --> 06:31.140
Now if you're new to this and you want to focus a little bit more on the sales the branding the marketing

06:31.580 --> 06:35.820
the promotion pretty much everything else that's involved in running a web development business then

06:35.820 --> 06:42.240
you might want to choose higher paid more capable better communicating freelancers.

06:42.240 --> 06:47.130
You also probably want to lean towards a firm because you will benefit the most and having that management

06:47.130 --> 06:51.540
layer that we talked about you might want to also focus on someone who has similar time zones to you

06:51.570 --> 06:57.060
that's going to allow you to communicate more effectively and not have this like in-between time where

06:57.060 --> 06:58.990
you can't communicate with your contractor.

06:58.990 --> 07:03.330
Now you don't always have to stay this way over time as you get more experience working with your web

07:03.330 --> 07:03.900
projects.

07:03.900 --> 07:09.150
You can transition into working with individuals and working with people who are in different time zones

07:09.150 --> 07:12.620
in different countries and then you can kind of get the best of both worlds.

07:12.630 --> 07:17.220
But at the beginning it's really helpful to know which one you should go for now.

07:17.220 --> 07:20.740
And obviously there are in-between options you just need to understand.

07:20.790 --> 07:22.980
It's kind of like a spectrum right.

07:22.980 --> 07:26.650
Certain people are better for using firm certain people are better for freelancers.

07:26.790 --> 07:32.040
Certain people are better for outsource labor and certain people are better for in in country near the

07:32.040 --> 07:33.990
same time zone types of contractors.

07:33.990 --> 07:38.760
Obviously the place where you create the most value for your client is when you're picking subcontractors

07:38.760 --> 07:41.730
and you look for what other people call like the diamond in the rough.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.650
And what that basically means is you look for and this is gets much easier as you have more experience.

07:46.650 --> 07:51.420
You look for people where they're price compared to their communication abilities compared to their

07:51.420 --> 07:53.000
capabilities.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.260
Something's just off.

07:54.270 --> 07:57.380
And so a lot of times you look for people who are undervalued.

07:57.540 --> 08:02.190
They're cheaper compared to how good they are or they're really good compared to how cheap they are

08:02.370 --> 08:04.260
over time with enough experience.

08:04.260 --> 08:09.840
You can start to mix and match and you can create whatever funky configuration you can at the beginning

08:09.840 --> 08:12.540
though it's easy to think of it kind of in this one two solution.

08:12.570 --> 08:22.720
All right guys I'll see you the next lecture.
