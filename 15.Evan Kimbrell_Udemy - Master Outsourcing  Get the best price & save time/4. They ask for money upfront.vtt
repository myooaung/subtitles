Hey guys.

00:10.120 --> 00:15.460
Welcome back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about a common scenario with contracting

00:15.850 --> 00:22.630
where the freelancer asks for money up front so you might have run into this problem where you found

00:22.630 --> 00:26.050
a couple of people that you like or maybe you've whittled it down to the one person you want to work

00:26.050 --> 00:31.600
with and that person is first kind of response to you before they start the project is I need X amount

00:31.600 --> 00:33.220
of money up front.

00:33.220 --> 00:40.690
Now there's a wide range of ways at looking at this in general asking for some money upfront is not

00:40.820 --> 00:41.980
unrealistic.

00:41.980 --> 00:43.180
Why.

00:43.180 --> 00:49.660
Because if you're doing a milestone system or you're doing a project it makes sense that you put some

00:49.660 --> 00:52.720
money down to make sure that you're serious about the project.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.480
If you have zero dollars upfront there's nothing stopping you as the employer from just deciding halfway

00:58.480 --> 01:01.990
through that you don't like the person you're working with and giving it to someone else.

01:01.990 --> 01:07.350
So realistically they're looking for protection from that exact scenario.

01:07.420 --> 01:09.620
Now how much money they ask up front.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.740
That's where we get kind of into the details what's realistic and what's not.

01:14.890 --> 01:19.210
The biggest thing to look at when determining how realistic the money they're looking they're asking

01:19.210 --> 01:25.240
for upfront is how popular is this freelancer you're working with a firm or a studio.

01:25.240 --> 01:29.920
It's not uncommon at all that they ask for a significant chunk of the money upfront.

01:29.920 --> 01:30.460
Why.

01:30.460 --> 01:34.390
Well because they have to schedule a lot of time with their workers with their freelancers.

01:34.510 --> 01:40.300
They probably have expenses up front and they allocate a lot of their management time towards you.

01:40.300 --> 01:45.160
A freelancer doesn't have overhead costs so they're probably going to ask for less.

01:45.160 --> 01:50.980
They should still be asking for some money up front but it's never going to be as much as what a studio

01:50.980 --> 01:52.510
or a company would ask for.

01:52.510 --> 01:54.880
So the biggest thing to look for is how popular are they.

01:54.880 --> 02:01.700
They have extensive experience working with clientele they have very positive remarks on their profiles.

02:01.810 --> 02:06.220
It might be acceptable that they ask for all the way up to 50 percent up front.

02:06.220 --> 02:12.370
Now if they do not have much of a track record they have fewer views and they haven't been freelancing

02:12.370 --> 02:13.270
as long.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.100
I would never expect to pay them 50 percent up front.

02:16.390 --> 02:22.960
I might expect to pay them 10 percent or 20 percent or however you desire design your milestone payments.

02:22.960 --> 02:28.450
Maybe they just ask for one milestone payment upfront and again never send that milestone to them.

02:28.450 --> 02:29.930
Use an escrow service.

02:29.970 --> 02:33.850
Now I think 50 percent is the maximum you should ever pay upfront.

02:33.850 --> 02:34.550
Why.

02:34.690 --> 02:39.430
Well because a lot of times you have a project that is so short and duration that it doesn't make sense

02:39.430 --> 02:41.300
to break up into milestones.

02:41.450 --> 02:47.950
And also as such the case that a lot of different expertise and people with certain skill sets are just

02:47.950 --> 02:49.450
used to that format.

02:49.450 --> 02:54.580
Graphic Designers typically will ask for 50 percent up front 50 percent at the end.

02:54.760 --> 03:01.570
It makes a lot of sense in scenarios where its really hard to segment the work up like a designer can't

03:01.570 --> 03:04.240
say I'm halfway done with this button.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.630
That's a milestone too.

03:05.650 --> 03:08.810
I'm halfway done with this page it's a milestone 3.

03:08.930 --> 03:12.150
It just that's not really how that works in graphic design.

03:12.160 --> 03:17.620
It's kind of more of a push where everything kind of develops all at once and then they get to a point

03:17.620 --> 03:20.320
where they're finished and then they go through iterations of editing.

03:20.320 --> 03:25.550
So if you're working with the designer 50/50 that's totally normal working with the development firm.

03:25.550 --> 03:26.370
That's big.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.820
50/50 it makes sense if they're a popular firm if they're less popular.

03:30.850 --> 03:33.220
Never heard of them don't have a big track record.

03:33.430 --> 03:38.260
You might want to negotiate something lower but you should always expect to pay something up front.

03:38.260 --> 03:42.370
Another thing to take into consideration is a lot of these freelancers have upfront costs.

03:42.430 --> 03:46.870
So if you're building out something that requires them to pay money for something upfront it might be

03:46.870 --> 03:49.570
realistic that they ask for some money upfront.

03:49.660 --> 03:54.640
Say you are building a web site and they're going to use a paid tool and integrate it into your service

03:54.670 --> 03:57.310
while they don't have to pay for it and then put it in.

03:57.310 --> 04:03.190
So realistically you should probably give them some funds to put it in for the licensing for the subscription

04:03.400 --> 04:07.390
or whatever it is that they need to actually complete your project past that.

04:07.390 --> 04:08.410
That's really all it is.

04:08.410 --> 04:11.100
Take a guess at how popular they are.

04:11.350 --> 04:17.110
How realistic it is that they might need cash upfront and kind of formulate that into what you'd expect

04:17.110 --> 04:18.190
to pay upfront.

04:18.190 --> 04:23.530
Remember it's always negotiable but be prepared to pay 50 percent upfront if you really really like

04:23.650 --> 04:25.470
the freelancer that you're about to work with.

04:25.570 --> 04:26.310
Pass that.

04:26.350 --> 04:31.450
If someone asks you for 100 percent up front obviously never do that.

04:31.630 --> 04:38.140
I mean that is just doesn't make sense in any scenario ever if anyone ever asked for that or more than

04:38.140 --> 04:40.710
50 percent upfront just say no.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.090
That person is just not realistic.

04:43.090 --> 04:47.890
They don't have experience freelancing or it is their intention to probably scam you in some way.

04:47.890 --> 04:53.200
So just don't ever do that if you're ever going over 50 percent makes absolutely no sense and always

04:53.200 --> 04:54.700
use an escrow service.

04:54.700 --> 04:55.090
All right guys.

04:55.090 --> 05:00.040
Any other questions any weird scenarios you've had just post in the group discussion.

05:00.070 --> 05:02.350
Love to hear it loved actually talk about it.

05:02.350 --> 05:03.140
Help you guys through.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.900
So seeing the next.
