Hey guys welcome back to the course.

00:11.190 --> 00:17.820
So in this lecture I'm going to cover one of my favorite strategies for getting more out of freelancer

00:17.850 --> 00:19.610
and outsourcing platforms.

00:19.620 --> 00:26.460
So the strategy that it's often used by people who outsource all the time or are looking for freelancers

00:26.460 --> 00:27.150
all the time.

00:27.300 --> 00:31.240
Something that I use constantly when I'm looking for freelancers.

00:31.290 --> 00:37.410
What are the biggest issues you'll have is that when you post on freelancer or up work or Elance you'll

00:37.410 --> 00:44.520
notice a big spurt of activity usually within the first hour to two hours you'll get four to five bids

00:44.520 --> 00:47.880
within the first day you might get 25 30 40.

00:48.060 --> 00:52.860
Usually what then happens is that in the next day you might only get two to three.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.680
The next day you might only get one the next day.

00:54.690 --> 00:57.030
You only get one and then the next day you get zero.

00:57.030 --> 00:58.290
Now why does that happen.

00:58.290 --> 01:05.070
The reason why that happens is because when you post a project they give you a lot of exposure really

01:05.070 --> 01:05.880
quickly.

01:06.030 --> 01:10.410
And what's ended up happening is that a lot of freelancers and a lot of freelance firms have adapted

01:10.440 --> 01:11.370
to that.

01:11.370 --> 01:17.520
So what they do is they actually build bots or they hire people who literally just look in the new section

01:17.790 --> 01:23.250
for projects that are popped up very quickly and that's all they do is they just troll those areas.

01:23.310 --> 01:29.400
Now one pretty much unavoidable problem of posting on some of these platforms especially on freelancer

01:30.090 --> 01:33.920
is that a lot of times people just post template responses.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.110
Now that's a reaction to a lot of different things.

01:37.140 --> 01:42.780
If you have a project that is very run of the mill If you're posting in a section that has a lot of

01:42.780 --> 01:47.610
competition and not a lot of supply you're going to get a lot of people posting template answers.

01:47.670 --> 01:53.640
As I've explained elsewhere in the course looking for a freelancer who actually responds specifically

01:53.640 --> 01:58.930
to your project and appears to be dynamic and thoughtful is incredibly important.

01:59.010 --> 02:01.920
So much more important than the price they pitch you.

02:02.100 --> 02:08.460
But what ends up happening a lot of times is you post a project and you get 25 bids and only one person

02:08.460 --> 02:12.920
maybe gives you a actually thoughtful unique response.

02:12.930 --> 02:19.140
So the way you get around that is a technique we just called rapid cycling posts and this is something

02:19.140 --> 02:25.080
that we do on freelancer a lot of the time on freelancer you get Honestly you'll probably get all of

02:25.080 --> 02:28.110
your bids within a couple hours and then nothing after that.

02:28.110 --> 02:34.890
So what you can do is you can post a listing post it see the batch you get if you do not find someone

02:34.920 --> 02:37.820
immediately who clicks you repost it.

02:37.890 --> 02:38.210
OK.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.180
How does that work.

02:39.180 --> 02:45.540
Well the way it works is pretty simple freelancers are only going to look at the content of your post

02:46.440 --> 02:50.910
and not necessarily any of the other unique identifiers in what you're putting up.

02:50.910 --> 02:56.430
So really all you have to do is slightly change the titles slightly change the description maybe delete

02:56.430 --> 02:57.700
a paragraph.

02:57.790 --> 03:04.140
What we often will do is do an attachment and on the attachment have all the actual information about

03:04.140 --> 03:05.150
the project.

03:05.190 --> 03:09.720
Also a good strategy because you want to make sure people open it and spend time reading it and we just

03:09.720 --> 03:13.830
move information in there and move some of it back into the project posting.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.620
That's all you really have to do.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.960
You do not need to pay to get featured.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.520
If you pay $25.

03:19.530 --> 03:26.310
Yes you might get 100 bids and that might be helpful but you can also do as you can just a rapid cycle

03:26.310 --> 03:32.010
your post post one way and our posts another way and our posts another and you get a hundred for $0.

03:32.010 --> 03:37.650
Now the biggest advantage to doing this is that when you actually are posting a project or you posted

03:37.680 --> 03:43.950
projects in the past you'll notice is that there's almost always an obvious answer to your freelancer

03:43.950 --> 03:47.210
especially if you've actually put some thought into the post.

03:47.220 --> 03:50.240
You know exactly what you're looking for and you're responsive.

03:50.290 --> 03:54.450
Now what I mean my response of I mean when you post it and people give you a bid you may immediately

03:54.450 --> 03:58.710
respond and ask questions to make sure that they're engaged and make sure that this isn't just a robot

03:58.920 --> 04:03.750
or a template response but what you can do is very quickly sniff out who are the good freelancers and

04:03.750 --> 04:07.890
who the ones are going to fit and a lot of times you just will not get a winner.

04:07.890 --> 04:10.250
You might get someone you're not totally sure about.

04:10.380 --> 04:16.080
When in doubt read it all you have to do is change the title ever so slightly repost it.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.000
You don't need to pay for upgrades.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.610
This is especially helpful if you're trying to hire someone right now and you post and no one says they

04:22.610 --> 04:23.530
are available right now.

04:23.550 --> 04:24.360
Repost it.

04:24.360 --> 04:29.820
You'll notice that you'll get maybe 20 30 percent of the same people bidding but you'll get another

04:29.820 --> 04:32.340
fresh batch of 80 percent different.

04:32.470 --> 04:33.850
OK that's an advance tip.

04:33.870 --> 04:39.120
An advanced strategy you guys can try it out if it doesn't work for you or you thinking have a strategy

04:39.130 --> 04:39.870
it's a little bit better.

04:39.870 --> 04:52.520
Just post in the group discussion private message me otherwise guys I'll see the next lecture.
