00:05.780 --> 00:06.110
Hey guys.

00:06.110 --> 00:08.240
Welcome back to the course in this lecture.

00:08.230 --> 00:12.480
We're going to go over what makes a great job description.

00:12.500 --> 00:17.780
Now your job description is going to be different than say documentation's or specification sheets you

00:17.780 --> 00:23.630
make these I like to think of them kind of like a description of your project from 10000 feet.

00:23.630 --> 00:27.560
There are certain things you want to absolutely put in here and certain things you definitely want to

00:27.560 --> 00:28.720
leave out.

00:28.760 --> 00:33.290
Now there's a lot of different things we've noticed over our experience that contractors and freelancers

00:33.290 --> 00:35.230
really like and they really respond to.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.790
So we're going to go over those.

00:36.810 --> 00:40.240
Going to go over some of the mistakes that you might make if you did this on your own.

00:40.310 --> 00:42.190
So let's go to screencast.

00:42.560 --> 00:42.980
All right.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.820
So we are back.

00:45.010 --> 00:52.480
So now we're going to talk about writing the perfect description for these posting platforms.

00:52.550 --> 00:56.960
Now there's one thing that I need to point out which is that all of these posting pop forums have their

00:56.960 --> 00:59.030
own kind of personality.

00:59.090 --> 01:03.530
They have their own freelancer base and each one's freelancer base is a little bit different than the

01:03.530 --> 01:04.430
other ones.

01:04.460 --> 01:09.170
Now does that bleed over into the description you're about to write.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.810
No actually it really doesn't.

01:10.910 --> 01:16.700
And I know a lot of people find that a little surprising but in my experience there really is no difference.

01:16.700 --> 01:24.980
I think that what you should be aware of is that freelancer in general is best for short term projects

01:24.980 --> 01:29.750
things that can be done very quickly are not nearly as complicated.

01:29.780 --> 01:37.350
They have a lot of ways specifically or people that are really really trying to work for cheap.

01:37.640 --> 01:44.300
If you write a description for your job post and you write it for Elance which is more detail more thoughtful

01:44.300 --> 01:48.830
more professional and you person freelance or just be aware that they're probably not going to read

01:48.830 --> 01:50.500
the entirety of the post.

01:50.690 --> 01:57.350
But it's not really a loss to you just be aware that typically freelancer posts are shorter.

01:57.350 --> 02:04.000
There's really no way to optimize in a way that you can make it fit for every single platform.

02:04.190 --> 02:08.460
So what I say is just optimize for Elance they're the best.

02:08.480 --> 02:14.900
They're the ones you're going to get the best bids from and then just post them to the other Web sites.

02:14.900 --> 02:15.260
OK.

02:15.320 --> 02:20.110
So in the last lecture we talked about how to build the perfect title.

02:20.120 --> 02:26.870
We talked about using perks making sure that you list out specific skills making sure that you set a

02:26.870 --> 02:33.930
barrier to certain freelancers who you don't want bidding and how to attract the ones that you do want.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.780
So really the description is kind of an extension of that.

02:38.120 --> 02:41.380
We are going to focus more on depth.

02:41.450 --> 02:47.810
We're going to focus a little bit more on elaborating what we mean by the perks above.

02:47.840 --> 02:51.830
But there's one thing that you do need to be aware of when you're writing your scription descriptions

02:51.920 --> 02:55.140
are the high level description.

02:55.310 --> 02:57.000
OK what I mean by that.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.960
Now if say you're building an iOS mobile app so you're building a web site some internal application

03:02.960 --> 03:03.920
whatever it is.

03:03.920 --> 03:09.410
These things can be very very complex and there's a lot of detail to describe them with.

03:09.410 --> 03:14.380
If you were trying to be true to the idea you would try to describe them as much detail as possible.

03:14.390 --> 03:17.790
This is not the place to do that when you write a description.

03:17.840 --> 03:25.550
You are writing to just give the thought like what they call that the 10000 foot description you're

03:25.550 --> 03:30.920
trying to give the summation of what it is and not get into the nitty gritty because people are not

03:30.920 --> 03:32.270
going to read it.

03:32.660 --> 03:32.930
OK.

03:32.930 --> 03:39.110
So the way that I write these in the way that we sprint cake write these in the way that we've been

03:39.200 --> 03:45.650
very very effective at getting quality freelancers in a lot of them is that we follow a very simple

03:45.710 --> 03:49.670
framework and this is how we have it set up.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.770
It's what why how specs works.

03:53.090 --> 03:56.370
So this is what works for us in our experience.

03:56.390 --> 04:02.660
When you write a description you want to write something that's anywhere from say a half page to a page.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.100
You can go shorter.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.180
However what happens when you write a very short description is you're kind of setting the tone for

04:08.180 --> 04:09.170
the project.

04:09.290 --> 04:14.930
People who see that this is a professional project see that you're taking it seriously see that you

04:14.930 --> 04:21.380
put thought into it well subconsciously or consciously return the favor and they'll put more effort

04:21.380 --> 04:23.120
into it as well.

04:24.110 --> 04:28.970
So shoot for a minimum of say 250 words to 500 words.

04:28.970 --> 04:32.750
I wouldn't necessarily go over that because I need to don't run out of things to say and I wouldn't

04:32.750 --> 04:35.190
go under that because you're definitely leaving something out.

04:35.420 --> 04:40.430
So the way that this framework works is very simple what exactly you think we're going to ascribe what

04:40.430 --> 04:45.460
it is that we are doing just as simple as possible someone to ask you what it is.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.950
What are you building.

04:46.970 --> 04:48.710
How would you describe it to them.

04:48.890 --> 04:52.750
So let's say that we are building that dating iOS app.

04:52.880 --> 05:01.070
I would say we're building a dating application that works on your iPhone and the way that it works

05:01.100 --> 05:02.490
is this.

05:02.750 --> 05:07.910
And when I describe how X I just give the high level how and I sum this up in two to three sentences

05:08.180 --> 05:13.310
it's kind of like the elevator description if you're not familiar with an elevator pitch what that means

05:13.310 --> 05:17.750
is if you are standing in an elevator with someone and you had to describe something in 30 seconds how

05:17.750 --> 05:19.150
would you describe it.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.350
So that's what the what is.

05:20.350 --> 05:21.590
It's very technical.

05:21.590 --> 05:26.190
No sales nothing you're not really trying to motivate anyone to understand what it is.

05:26.210 --> 05:29.470
Moving on to why this is something that you can leave out.

05:29.480 --> 05:33.830
But this is something that I prefer to put into it because I like contractors who have some kind of

05:33.830 --> 05:36.180
a connection to the project.

05:36.200 --> 05:41.840
I like people who understand the reason why we're building something.

05:41.840 --> 05:47.210
I like people who can connect with it on a different level other than hey I need to pay rent this month.

05:47.210 --> 05:49.880
So what I do is I do Y and I don't pay a lot of time in this.

05:49.910 --> 05:52.330
I just put a sentence or two sentences.

05:52.430 --> 05:58.240
Help people understand that is a good idea or help them understand why this is a problem.

05:58.250 --> 06:05.690
Typically when someone is looking at a project and they have a connection to why it makes sense and

06:06.020 --> 06:11.300
they have a feeling that this is going to be a successful project you'll get more quality responses

06:11.540 --> 06:16.370
you'll get people who are more interested in it in an intrinsic way and not just for the money.

06:16.370 --> 06:22.850
And that is quite important to getting high quality contractors moving on to how the way that Howe works

06:22.880 --> 06:24.800
is you just kind of list out.

06:25.010 --> 06:29.090
I usually just list off how it works now not from a technical perspective.

06:29.090 --> 06:35.780
I don't say that I want you to make this in Reno write it in Java in X code or you know this is how

06:35.780 --> 06:37.520
the back end works.

06:37.540 --> 06:43.000
The other database functions you're basic going to say from a user perspective this is how it works.

06:43.010 --> 06:49.940
If I were to describe a dating application I could say you know user logs in and sees this.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.230
They see my page.

06:51.230 --> 06:56.510
They create a profile they log in with Facebook once they've logged in with Facebook they can type in

06:56.510 --> 07:05.330
their criteria see a list of two to three people per day and receive an e-mail notification of you know

07:05.330 --> 07:06.830
their matches for the day.

07:07.150 --> 07:07.450
OK.

07:07.490 --> 07:13.160
That is sufficient for the how anyone who a developer or anyone who's even a designer is going to want

07:13.160 --> 07:19.070
to know in the first you know two to three minutes of them hearing this idea or reading about this idea

07:19.310 --> 07:24.800
how exactly you envision it working now then pass that I put in specs and what I mean by specifications

07:24.800 --> 07:29.500
is what specifically I should actually call this specifics.

07:29.510 --> 07:36.900
But I put specs to be sure not to be confused with specs that you're going to attach to your project.

07:37.130 --> 07:43.160
But I mean specifics so what is specific about the project and what do you specifically need from contractors.

07:43.160 --> 07:48.590
Now remember in the previous lecture we talked about maybe I specifically need an Iowa developer Maybe

07:48.590 --> 07:53.450
I specifically need someone who works for this framework maybe I specifically need someone who works

07:53.450 --> 07:56.640
with a certain language or a certain technology.

07:56.690 --> 08:00.710
So in specifics I would list those out what you can do is.

08:00.740 --> 08:06.710
I also sometimes will call a suction parameters and parameters means that this is where I'm going to

08:06.710 --> 08:09.440
put in specific requirements for it.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.870
So specifically you need to use this language specifically.

08:12.950 --> 08:19.540
It needs to output this you know say like certain X amount of matches per day.

08:19.730 --> 08:22.930
Specifically it needs to load quickly.

08:22.940 --> 08:27.760
Specifically these are things that I'm very particular about and I'll show you one.

08:27.770 --> 08:33.110
All right description for this theoretical idea and I will show you what some examples of those would

08:33.110 --> 08:33.680
be.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.680
Now the last one are perks now.

08:35.690 --> 08:38.290
Perks are written at the very end.

08:38.540 --> 08:41.460
Perks are exactly what we talked about before.

08:41.480 --> 08:46.070
Now we're going to Labrie where we take every single perk that we listed and now we put a sentence about

08:46.070 --> 08:46.320
it.

08:46.370 --> 08:46.910
Right.

08:46.940 --> 08:52.830
So if it says Simple well explain why it is simple why do you know that it's simple.

08:52.830 --> 08:59.090
And if you said something like right now well you need to describe why is it that you need this to be

08:59.090 --> 09:00.480
done right now.

09:00.560 --> 09:05.700
What kind of bonus or what kind of incentive is there to getting it done right now.

09:05.870 --> 09:11.720
If he said that this is a long term project or you said this has repeat work please explain in this

09:11.720 --> 09:14.600
section why does it have repeat work.

09:14.760 --> 09:18.160
What does that mean what do they mean by that.

09:18.170 --> 09:23.090
This is where people kind of go from so say they read in your title Long-Term position or so they say

09:23.090 --> 09:23.800
repeat work.

09:23.810 --> 09:28.310
They go ooh I'd like to have a client that gives me repeat work that's great right because I had to

09:28.310 --> 09:30.900
spend less time finding clients and more time working.

09:30.920 --> 09:35.370
Then they go into the project description and they want to read about what do you mean.

09:35.390 --> 09:37.340
I mean how often do you have these projects.

09:37.340 --> 09:44.030
How big are the projects what kind of a bar do I have to jump over for you to be you know to approve

09:44.030 --> 09:46.090
me and to give me lots of projects.

09:46.090 --> 09:48.420
This is where you're going to elaborate on that.

09:48.450 --> 09:51.980
And then the last thing that's listed in this but it's not included in the framework because this is

09:51.980 --> 09:57.860
just something that you should do regardless is put instructions of the variant instructions are things

09:57.860 --> 10:06.790
like Please respond with this information please let me know if you're available please message me if

10:06.790 --> 10:08.250
you have any questions.

10:08.380 --> 10:14.590
Things like this and we're going to cover this later in the course why we use these directives in job

10:14.590 --> 10:20.560
descriptions because what it does is it essentially isolates the people who are paying attention the

10:20.560 --> 10:25.780
ones who are responsive against the people who are just auto bidding just bidding all day long they're

10:25.780 --> 10:27.770
not even thinking about the projects.

10:27.940 --> 10:34.090
So we want to separate out the good ones from the bad ones and directives are a very easy way of doing

10:34.090 --> 10:38.680
that but I'm not going to I'm not going to touch on that too much because in later lecture we're going

10:38.680 --> 10:44.690
to talk in-depth about directives why they work what do I mean by them what are some examples of them.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.380
There are techniques that not every single person uses.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.870
And it's really up to use We're going to cover those later.

10:50.110 --> 10:53.770
But this is the basic framework what why how specs and perks.
