00:06.660 --> 00:13.560
All right let's get acquainted with oDesk I would ask was the second freelancing site that I mentioned

00:14.160 --> 00:22.410
I mentioned them second because they are second in size and also I think second in terms of priority

00:22.620 --> 00:26.130
at least for me when I go and I start my search for a freelancer.

00:27.210 --> 00:31.450
They are different than plants but not by much.

00:31.950 --> 00:40.110
If you follow tech news you will know that the oDesk and Elance actually had emerged relatively recently.

00:40.140 --> 00:43.220
However they still operate to different products.

00:43.220 --> 00:47.210
You can still go to CNN.com and you can still go to oDesk dot com.

00:47.220 --> 00:50.000
So why would they merge and then keep to Web sites.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.920
Well it might have to do with just a user base that they have.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.260
But also I think it's that people go to oDesk for a different reason and they go to Elance oDesk focuses

00:58.320 --> 01:03.000
a lot on per hour freelancing.

01:03.030 --> 01:10.500
So they try to target businesses that are looking to hire someone indefinitely or so or to hire someone

01:10.500 --> 01:17.490
say for a week or two weeks or three weeks or something like that oDesk similarly to a freelancer was

01:17.490 --> 01:20.160
a big venture capital company.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.400
They raise something like 44 million dollars.

01:23.430 --> 01:27.180
This is different than L.A. who raised in the 70s.

01:27.270 --> 01:30.230
They have about 3.1 million freelancers on it.

01:30.270 --> 01:33.830
So they're the second largest they're larger than you glance in that regard.

01:33.930 --> 01:40.390
And every year they post about 3.6 million jobs which is number two is oil.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.780
They're a little bit different than the land.

01:41.790 --> 01:47.460
They charge 10 percent of plants was eight point seventy five if you remember from the last lecture

01:47.760 --> 01:50.730
10 percent just comes from the freelancer.

01:51.070 --> 01:59.490
They also make money off of future postings and additional kind of things you can purchase to increase

01:59.490 --> 02:01.950
the visibility of your posting.

02:01.980 --> 02:06.270
But once we actually get into it you'll notice that that's not exactly.

02:06.270 --> 02:09.530
It's not really the case that they make a ton of money off of that.

02:09.630 --> 02:14.670
They really only offer a couple things that you can upgrade for your listing appliances a little bit

02:14.670 --> 02:15.260
more.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.610
Once you get to freelancers you'll notice they have an entirely different business model.

02:18.870 --> 02:21.690
Otis by far though is the most profitable.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.690
They make close to a billion dollars a year.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.660
The reason why they're so profitable is because they focus on per hour of labor.

02:29.820 --> 02:37.520
And typically when you do per hour labor freelancers are going to bill a lot more money and oDesk is

02:37.520 --> 02:39.890
going to collect a lot more in their fees.

02:40.560 --> 02:45.720
So you will log in and I'll show you what the user interface looks like.

02:45.720 --> 02:53.250
It is not wildly different than the other Web sites but you'll notice it has some eccentricity to it.

02:53.310 --> 02:56.220
It's probably the simplest in terms of a user interface.

02:56.220 --> 03:02.190
However they really do put a focus on their team environment and I'll get to that in a second to show

03:02.190 --> 03:02.870
you.

03:02.910 --> 03:07.200
So as you can tell I don't particularly use oDesk very often.

03:07.890 --> 03:08.900
I like to focus more.

03:09.040 --> 03:15.870
Lance and I like to focus more on freelancer but oDesk It's always nice to use because you know if you're

03:15.870 --> 03:20.160
posting in L.A. or posting in freelancer you can always just copy and paste the job posting you use

03:20.160 --> 03:23.780
to get to oDesk it's never They don't ask any questions.

03:23.790 --> 03:25.310
The other two don't.

03:25.410 --> 03:31.360
You can see that it's a.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.580
You can view all your job postings.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.950
I have to go back in time to look at them because I don't have any open jobs right now.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.280
But you can kind of see what this typically will look like.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.690
Not really any different.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.930
I use oDesk mainly for virtual assistance.

03:46.950 --> 03:51.060
You can tell that or use it for things like bug control.

03:51.130 --> 03:56.870
If I'm looking for a developer to come in to fix something and I don't know how long it's going to take.

03:56.980 --> 04:01.930
Whenever you have bugs that's just the way it kind of goes you're not going to say fix this bug for

04:01.930 --> 04:02.610
$200.

04:02.600 --> 04:07.150
They have no idea if it's gonna take 2 hours or 14 hours.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.140
So look at the posting user interface

04:13.040 --> 04:16.740
so like Lance it's pretty much the same.

04:16.760 --> 04:23.360
You'll notice that you can take previous jobs and repopulate for you if you want to.

04:23.480 --> 04:30.020
As you notice these are mostly V.A virtual assistant tasks that I did that's pretty helpful.

04:30.020 --> 04:35.600
They don't give you the templating versions that Elance gives you but at the same time I would typically

04:35.600 --> 04:38.540
say that's not for me that's a big feature.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.960
I always write my job descriptions custom.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.580
I don't really need the extra help.

04:43.580 --> 04:47.530
Maybe you do but regardless they don't give you that kind of structural support.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.450
Same kind of system you're going to pick.

04:50.450 --> 04:55.280
Generally the type of person you're looking for oDesk does have a very rich community in terms of they

04:55.280 --> 04:59.930
have all sorts of different people doing different things you can get video specialist audio specialist

04:59.960 --> 05:05.890
you can get legal you can get marketing companies that will charge on a per hour basis.

05:06.380 --> 05:13.790
You really can do the whole comprehensive suite in terms of outsourcing on oDesk job titles very similar.

05:13.790 --> 05:19.230
They actually limit the job posting your title a bit more than the others.

05:19.250 --> 05:25.460
You can write a little bit more in the description but again like we said before doesn't really matter

05:25.460 --> 05:30.220
because your specifications are going to put in a separate sheet outside of the job posting.

05:30.230 --> 05:36.450
This is nice because you can just list out the skills you need works very similar to Elance day.

05:36.900 --> 05:41.120
Yeah I mean they just limit you to how many times you can how many different things you can list out.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.070
Nothing particularly new here.

05:43.070 --> 05:48.970
You'll notice that the default option is hourly you pay by the hour this is verified with the work diary.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.080
The reason why say default is again because oDesk really really focuses on that.

05:53.120 --> 05:58.880
They focus on the hourly wage worker and fix price is really kind of a secondary thing that they they

05:58.880 --> 06:00.160
use hourly.

06:00.170 --> 06:05.940
You'll notice where it says pay by project for a fixed price and it says requires detailed specs.

06:05.990 --> 06:06.990
That is true.

06:07.010 --> 06:10.820
One of the things with hourly workers is that if you know you just have a rough budget and you know

06:10.820 --> 06:17.390
your specifications are not ready right now you can effectively hire someone per hour and then fill

06:17.390 --> 06:18.520
them in as a go.

06:18.530 --> 06:23.350
I don't think it's a good strategy because I think writing the specifications out front will get you

06:23.360 --> 06:27.550
more accurate estimates and it also get you more acquainted with your project.

06:27.710 --> 06:34.100
But if for whatever reason you want to do it the other way you can do it but you can notice here that

06:34.370 --> 06:36.410
it kind of reminds you you don't have detailed specs.

06:36.410 --> 06:38.030
Probably not going to work for a fixed price.

06:38.390 --> 06:40.280
So we'll keep it at hourly.

06:40.330 --> 06:43.070
You notice here this is essencia NSA Trinity with oDesk.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.230
They ask what your estimated duration.

06:45.230 --> 06:49.620
And you'll notice here that less than one week is the smallest.

06:49.730 --> 06:53.030
Typically people on oDesk are hiring people for a couple weeks.

06:53.060 --> 06:59.330
They really don't have people that do a lot of one off jobs where they work one day or two days or three

06:59.330 --> 07:00.350
days.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.510
It's usually something that goes on for quite a while.

07:02.510 --> 07:07.080
The people that I've hired an oDesk they worked for a month or two months or something like that.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.270
More than six months.

07:08.270 --> 07:10.120
That's actually quite common you see job.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.310
And this is effectively a job.

07:12.410 --> 07:17.750
A lot of times and oDesk people post the six month contract jobs after the six months actually end up

07:17.750 --> 07:18.740
hiring the person.

07:18.740 --> 07:24.080
So I know quite a few people who've gotten their developers from oDesk by using a long term kind of

07:24.080 --> 07:26.990
contract system estimated workload.

07:27.140 --> 07:34.700
And then you know this is pretty obvious full time meaning 40 hours a week part time meeting Tony 15

07:34.700 --> 07:38.490
25 hours a week as needed just means it just depends.

07:38.610 --> 07:40.400
It's not really a set workload.

07:40.640 --> 07:46.430
Maybe you need someone to just take to respond to customer e-mails in an e-mail account or something

07:46.430 --> 07:47.290
like that.

07:47.480 --> 07:52.310
You don't want emails and or comments you say as needed desired experience level.

07:52.340 --> 07:58.430
This is actually quite helpful because you can say I'm looking for an entry level intermediate or expert

07:58.860 --> 08:04.580
and depending on how complicated your application is you could pick you know expert or intermedia if

08:04.580 --> 08:10.480
you're trying to save money by giving more detailed specs and keeping the actual development simple.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.060
You can go at the entry level if you wanted to.

08:13.220 --> 08:17.210
That's automatically going to filter out people that charge too much.

08:17.210 --> 08:22.400
You're getting a lot of outsourcing offers where they charge five dollars an hour six dollars an hour

08:22.790 --> 08:28.430
and you get an intermediate you're going to get outsourcing mixed with people who are junior developers

08:28.430 --> 08:29.630
in your own country.

08:29.780 --> 08:34.940
And you know again the outsourcers going are probably going to be like $10 $15.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.710
Where are the junior developers in your country.

08:36.710 --> 08:40.820
Probably like $20 $30 or 20 expert.

08:41.270 --> 08:46.430
Then you can really get into people who are charging $100 an hour $60 an hour.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.850
Those people really know their stuff.

08:49.430 --> 08:54.190
Similar to L.A. You can choose your job exposure.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.180
This is actually interesting and Odense oDesk.

08:56.210 --> 08:59.890
They have a setting called only oDesk users can find this job.

08:59.900 --> 09:05.750
This is interesting meeting that if I come to your Web site and I'm not signed up as a freelancer I

09:05.750 --> 09:06.940
cannot find your job.

09:06.980 --> 09:11.170
So it's not going to show up on google it's not going to show up on the browsing section of the Web

09:11.170 --> 09:13.950
site if someone just goes the Web site and browse it.

09:13.950 --> 09:20.250
That might be something you want to do if you want to keep the put the lid on kind of the promotion

09:20.250 --> 09:21.750
of your application.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.710
You don't want too many people reading it.

09:23.950 --> 09:28.350
That's something you can put my personal opinion is you want more people looking at your application

09:28.350 --> 09:32.950
regardless unless you have some super secret that you really need to hide.

09:33.090 --> 09:37.620
This only means that you're going to reduce the amount of bids you get by probably 60 percent.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.540
Again here's another oDesk thing that's quite specific to them.

09:41.630 --> 09:46.370
I want to hire one freelancer I want to I need to hire more than one on L.A. when you do this you would

09:46.380 --> 09:51.520
hire one freelancer and then what you would say is I want to keep hiring and then you can add more here

09:51.520 --> 09:52.200
or you can stay.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.810
You can specify up front.

09:53.940 --> 09:57.490
Typically when you say I need to hire more than one freelancer are you going to get more bids.

09:57.690 --> 10:00.240
That's just basic bidding psychology.

10:00.240 --> 10:05.780
People are going to bid more because they think the likelihood of getting hired is much higher.

10:06.270 --> 10:13.290
ODesk you'll notice that people who end up bidding they don't give the best kind of responses or bidding

10:13.380 --> 10:19.980
details a lot of them will copy and paste which I think is kind of a shame considering that oDesk is

10:19.980 --> 10:27.510
so focused on hourly wages that it seems like they should put more effort into you know being specific

10:27.510 --> 10:33.660
as to why they're good at whatever job you're looking for or position or trying to fill because the

10:33.660 --> 10:38.190
potential to make money on it is much larger.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.610
Here you can see preferred qualifications.

10:41.730 --> 10:48.240
You know this is something that if you you can get into this this is where you kind of drill down on

10:48.240 --> 10:55.170
the ratings for freelancers you set a minimum feedback score or you can say to freelance or type here's

10:55.170 --> 10:59.180
interesting you can say independent or agency maybe you really do want an agency.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.070
There are a lot of benefits to working with an agency and there's a lot of benefits to working with

11:02.070 --> 11:03.210
an independent.

11:03.210 --> 11:08.820
You might have a specific idea of what you want and you can actually say that one of the problems in

11:08.820 --> 11:13.710
Odessa is if I say independent Trust me I'll get a lot of agencies and if I say Agency I'll still get

11:13.710 --> 11:14.580
a lot of independents.

11:14.580 --> 11:19.550
So you still need to read the bids when people bid this one.

11:19.890 --> 11:21.010
Minimum feedback score.

11:21.030 --> 11:25.740
I mean the thing is that if they have below whatever that feedback score is you can self-select and

11:25.740 --> 11:26.790
remove them.

11:26.790 --> 11:36.240
I typically don't put this also because if I say minimum feedback score for someone can bid with a feedback

11:36.240 --> 11:37.390
score of five.

11:37.440 --> 11:41.350
And the reason they bid five is because they've only had one job and they got five stars.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.120
That job was for 20 bucks.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.360
So it doesn't really help me.

11:45.450 --> 11:54.310
This is another thing on oDesk because they track hours and not fixed price projects as much or what

11:54.310 --> 11:58.160
they'll do is on a fixed price project they'll convert that to hours.

11:58.390 --> 12:05.110
You can actually say I want someone who has build on oDesk before and that just means that they're familiar

12:05.110 --> 12:10.450
with oDesk they're responsible primarily you'll notice on the other web sites people kind of flake.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.200
So if I said I wanted at least 100 hours billing that means that the people who are going to bid are

12:14.200 --> 12:20.200
quite skilled or quite familiar with the service they use this quite often.

12:20.500 --> 12:24.760
That means that they're not just someone who fishes on oDesk doesn't spend a lot of time on it.

12:24.850 --> 12:30.460
I don't usually use this again because most freelancers bid on all three Web sites so I don't want to

12:30.460 --> 12:37.840
limit limit it to the people who are primarily working at oDesk location very similar.

12:37.840 --> 12:44.950
I'll show you later though you can when you search for freelancers you can search for much more specific

12:44.950 --> 12:45.910
details.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.530
English level this is kind of goofy because it's self-assigned.

12:49.810 --> 12:56.300
So if you know anyone who's bilingual a lot of times they exaggerate how fluent they are.

12:56.800 --> 13:03.600
But if it's especially if it's self-assigned in this case but you can say basic conversational fluent

13:03.620 --> 13:04.300
native.

13:04.300 --> 13:08.950
And it's you know I don't usually Again do that one.

13:08.950 --> 13:14.440
You can tell very quickly in the bidding and I prefer to have more people bid on my project because

13:14.440 --> 13:18.000
then that makes the project look like it's popular which brings in more bids.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.010
So don't try to get too specific up front.

13:21.010 --> 13:23.760
You run the risk of just getting no bids whatsoever.

13:24.190 --> 13:25.090
Cover letters.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.030
This is a feature of oDesk.

13:27.040 --> 13:31.840
When you post a job oDesk treats this like it is a actual position.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.500
So they call things interviews they call it cover letters.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.910
You can add screening questions.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.890
I do like this quite a bit.

13:39.370 --> 13:47.360
Typically what I like to add I like to add basic questions like you know so why did you apply those

13:47.410 --> 13:53.940
particular job search experience to you with.

13:54.740 --> 14:00.250
And that's really helpful because there they have to actually answer that question if they're going

14:00.250 --> 14:01.680
to bid they're going to have to answer it.

14:01.690 --> 14:07.390
They can't just give you some copy and paste a description on their bids so they can't avoid kind of

14:07.390 --> 14:09.670
the crucial questions that you have.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.290
That's really helpful.

14:11.290 --> 14:15.520
Cover letter is not helpful at least in my experience because they're in a cover letter basically means

14:15.520 --> 14:19.330
that they have to write a little bit saying why they're interested in what you do what you're asking

14:19.330 --> 14:22.660
for and what their qualifications are.

14:22.870 --> 14:27.190
Ninety nine point nine percent the time is just copy and pasted and it's just not useful so you just

14:27.190 --> 14:33.280
have to end up reading more bulk and wasting more time and that's typically why I don't like it.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.470
You can preview your posting.

14:35.470 --> 14:40.820
I don't really know why because it's not like you're worried about the design of your job posting.

14:42.770 --> 14:46.860
Similarly you can save a draft if you want to.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.940
Pretty much every system has that.

14:49.940 --> 14:54.590
Drafts are helpful if you want to get all your thoughts out and come back later.

14:54.590 --> 15:00.710
The thing is that primarily your job posting is is what your main description body is.

15:00.830 --> 15:03.890
So that's what you should work on in a separate word document.

15:03.890 --> 15:07.640
I don't see the point in saving a draft.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.570
The biggest thing on oDesk is their team feature.

15:11.840 --> 15:21.440
And yes I like to even page the team feature is quite helpful if you're hiring someone who's per hour

15:22.280 --> 15:28.240
because it will kind of keep them honest in terms of how much they're billing you how much they work.

15:28.250 --> 15:35.150
So as you can see here I had hired two freelancers previously to do translations

15:38.900 --> 15:47.300
this was quite a while ago and as you can tell I focus oDesk on virtual assistant tasks things like

15:47.300 --> 15:49.410
for instance a translation I would need.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.080
I don't want to charge per word per letter.

15:52.490 --> 15:59.990
So I focused on just doing hourly but typically the way that these work is they have a work diary and

15:59.990 --> 16:09.080
the work diary will show you snapshots or screenshots of how they've worked over time since it's so

16:09.080 --> 16:10.330
all they can't really bring it up.

16:10.340 --> 16:20.570
But the best way of describing it is they do screen shots of the person's screen every like I believe

16:20.570 --> 16:25.940
it's every minute and you can set it to do separate intervals like every five minutes.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.290
So when someone works on oDesk they have to agree to work on through the team management system that

16:33.290 --> 16:37.000
they have that's different than elides that's different than freelancer.

16:37.370 --> 16:38.880
They have to use that system.

16:39.080 --> 16:43.070
You can elect for them not to use it but you might as well since everyone is pretty much acquainted

16:43.070 --> 16:44.230
with it anyway.

16:44.390 --> 16:49.760
The biggest difference is oDesk though is that they're going to screen shot every single interval of

16:49.760 --> 16:55.640
time what they're going to screen shot the person's computer screen and that's mandatory.

16:55.640 --> 17:01.700
Whereas Elance the work diary they entertain in themselves and it kind of tracks more like every time

17:01.700 --> 17:08.960
they message you and every time they upload information oDesk really tracks it down to some really significant

17:08.960 --> 17:14.540
details like how many clicks they make one the the words per minute when they type.

17:14.540 --> 17:21.440
So a lot of times you have typing or a data entry and they'll literally record how fast they're typing

17:21.440 --> 17:25.000
on their keyboard and send that to you so you can see if there's a dip.

17:25.090 --> 17:28.970
And you can see if there are 10 of taking breaks or that's something you might want to take out of your

17:29.000 --> 17:29.870
price.

17:29.900 --> 17:33.000
It sounds a little micro-manager.

17:33.180 --> 17:40.620
It can be and I don't necessarily use it every time but it's nice having that available.

17:40.810 --> 17:51.070
If if it is something that you can consider useful you will notice see contracts like Lance oDesk will

17:51.130 --> 17:53.500
manage your contracts for you.

17:54.020 --> 18:00.800
But you can upload contracts if you want and they don't use it the same way Elance does in that sense

18:00.800 --> 18:03.980
you could upload your own contract and have as an attachment.

18:03.980 --> 18:08.660
Here you have to include it and like your messages are included in your job posting.

18:09.730 --> 18:13.470
But it basically shows that people you sign contracts where you can download it.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.600
That's pretty nice if you use this quite a bit.

18:15.620 --> 18:22.510
Again oDesk is really focused towards having an army of freelancer doing freelancers doing some menial

18:22.510 --> 18:23.890
task.

18:24.490 --> 18:30.700
And it's less focused on having a web developer say I'm going to build this web app for X amount of

18:30.700 --> 18:31.790
money.

18:31.810 --> 18:39.370
It's more like you'll find a web developer says I'll build this app and pay me $50 an hour reporting.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.870
Not particularly helpful.

18:43.120 --> 18:50.950
If you have a company and you are operating and you do have outsourcing needs quite a bit this can be

18:50.950 --> 18:55.720
helpful because they don't keep track of how many hours a week you're paying how many payments you're

18:55.720 --> 18:57.100
giving out each week.

18:57.100 --> 19:02.560
So you kind of keep track of your costs so you can kind of think of this as a way to manage your outsourced

19:02.560 --> 19:06.040
employees and that's kind of the way I think of it.

19:06.040 --> 19:12.460
So if I'm earning a marketing campaign and I need to hire some people to gather e-mail addresses or

19:12.460 --> 19:19.540
something or web sites or find some blogs in my space I'll hire three or four people to go out at five

19:19.540 --> 19:24.850
hours a day and I'll track through this how much I'm paying per day in over a week and that's how I

19:24.850 --> 19:34.870
can kind of keep to keep the lid on my costs.
