00:10.580 --> 00:16.370
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about determining whether

00:16.370 --> 00:20.290
or not you should work with an individual freelancer or a firm.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.910
It's probably something you hadn't actually thought about.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.740
What difference does it make right especially if you're new to this.

00:25.760 --> 00:31.430
But let me tell you it actually makes quite a big difference and it really kind of depends on your type

00:31.430 --> 00:36.560
of situation your experience with outsourcing and what exactly you are outsourcing.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.760
So the reason why I bring this up at this point in the course is because probably at this point you

00:40.760 --> 00:47.240
might've been following along and building out your project and listing it and soliciting some people

00:47.240 --> 00:53.450
to build or do whatever it is you're doing and you might have run into a problem which is that you're

00:53.450 --> 00:58.640
looking at bids say you're using up work or e Lanson into platforms or any of the other sources that

00:58.640 --> 01:00.930
we covered for or finding contractors.

01:01.100 --> 01:05.930
You might notice that some people speak a little bit differently sometimes they say we and sometimes

01:05.930 --> 01:12.140
they say I might have also noticed that some people in their profile picture might be a logo or it might

01:12.140 --> 01:13.190
be a person.

01:13.270 --> 01:17.240
So determining whether or not it's a company or a freelancer that's generally pretty easy.

01:17.420 --> 01:18.900
If they send you a logo.

01:19.010 --> 01:24.020
Typically a company now that's not a hundred percent true all the time but 99 percent of the time they're

01:24.020 --> 01:24.890
sending you a logo.

01:24.950 --> 01:26.060
They're a group of people.

01:26.210 --> 01:29.780
If they send you a profile picture then they're probably a freelancer.

01:29.840 --> 01:37.040
As a side note to getting a picture of a person as a freelancer one thing that you should always avoid

01:37.040 --> 01:42.200
is if you have a contractor who is probably on the other side of the world and they send you a photo

01:42.200 --> 01:46.850
of someone that doesn't match what you would assume is their ethnic profile or it looks like it's a

01:46.850 --> 01:53.740
stock photo looks like way too perfect or too planned.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.910
Please avoid that person it's a very strange thing that contractors often do.

01:58.940 --> 02:03.380
I've had contractors on the other side of the world send me stock photos of people and it turns out

02:03.380 --> 02:05.370
that they're celebrities and they didn't even realize.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.860
So avoid that.

02:06.900 --> 02:11.360
But another way you can obviously tell whether or not it's a firm or freelancer look at their language.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.040
They say we or do they really say I.

02:14.120 --> 02:19.730
Now if you used another way of sourcing this then look for whether or not they say attached a resume.

02:19.730 --> 02:22.270
Typically a freelancer is going attach a resume.

02:22.280 --> 02:28.300
A company is probably not going to do that both on a list of portfolio.

02:28.400 --> 02:34.660
And honestly if there's no other way you can tell try to go to if they have a personal web site.

02:34.730 --> 02:36.800
You go there you can tell very quickly.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.680
So let's talk about the pros and cons of using a firm.

02:41.690 --> 02:47.270
So let's talk about why you would use a firm and what are situations and scenarios where you really

02:47.270 --> 02:48.830
wouldn't want to use a firm.

02:48.830 --> 02:52.890
First off what's the first pro when it comes to hiring a firm.

02:53.070 --> 02:59.900
Well one pro that I think a lot of people don't actually realize is that groups and firms are typically

02:59.900 --> 03:01.670
more capable.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.850
So now you might think to yourself what does it matter.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.950
I'm only hiring one or two people at that firm that actually matters quite a bit.

03:07.970 --> 03:13.610
In most cases where you're contracting out work whether it's a mobile application or whatever typically

03:13.610 --> 03:16.670
it's going to involve multiple expertise.

03:16.670 --> 03:21.590
And what I mean by that is like say you're building on a mobile application you might need someone who

03:21.590 --> 03:28.760
understands how to work with swift or Java so they can program it for say IRS but you also might need

03:28.760 --> 03:33.590
someone who can deal with the graphic interface of the actual application itself.

03:33.590 --> 03:35.660
Now often that someone can do both.

03:35.660 --> 03:40.830
That is true but it's also often the case that those are two separate expertise.

03:40.850 --> 03:49.790
So now our group is more likely to have both those expertise within their actual staff and that actually

03:49.790 --> 03:51.290
is an important distinction.

03:51.290 --> 03:56.870
So outsprint correct we get asked to do projects all the time that have multiple expertise lets say

03:56.870 --> 04:03.250
an application that incorporates some other specific or obscure framework or technology.

04:03.290 --> 04:07.940
We're actually in a better position than a freelancer because we have other people who work for the

04:07.940 --> 04:14.240
company that have expertise in some of those other sections so when we run into a problem we can always

04:14.270 --> 04:18.480
access that other person and get a quick on the spot consultation.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.780
Groups have that advantage now.

04:20.910 --> 04:24.800
Rarely is the case that you have something that only has a single expertise.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.690
But it is possible it is possible that what you're doing is small enough that that person probably has

04:29.690 --> 04:35.990
all the skills you need and so you don't benefit from this from a group but in most cases this is helpful.

04:35.990 --> 04:41.240
The biggest thing is it makes it such that your project will go faster because when they run into a

04:41.240 --> 04:46.940
roadblock they can get past it faster and they're more likely to figure it out where a lot of times

04:47.000 --> 04:51.470
the freelancer they might not actually know how to solve it or another pro about groups is that they

04:51.470 --> 04:55.460
can actually shift the load of work as they're working on your project.

04:55.460 --> 04:59.460
So say that you hire them to build out something for you.

04:59.540 --> 05:04.410
Now they might assume or assign a one person as your lead developer.

05:04.490 --> 05:08.560
That person is dedicated to your project much like a freelancer would.

05:08.600 --> 05:16.480
But what happens if person say get sick well with a group there's a very good chance they can offload

05:16.500 --> 05:19.710
work they can shift the load if anything comes up.

05:19.710 --> 05:26.490
So let's say the person working on their project gets sick gets you know injured anything just doesn't

05:26.490 --> 05:28.450
show up there's a problem.

05:28.440 --> 05:33.020
There's a very good chance that someone else is ready who can pick up the load.

05:33.060 --> 05:37.970
That's just a thing with groups especially with development groups web development design groups.

05:38.160 --> 05:43.770
There's always someone who has some extra time because projects don't fit together perfectly with the

05:43.770 --> 05:49.330
40 hour week schedule someone is always available to pick up slack if it's the case.

05:49.380 --> 05:57.310
Now the biggest pro for working with the firm is actually what's called a management law here.

05:57.450 --> 06:02.610
I'm sure you might be familiar with what I'm talking about what I mean is that when you hire a firm

06:02.750 --> 06:07.770
there's going to be some sort of a project manager or a business manager.

06:07.980 --> 06:12.360
Typically the person you reached out to you probably wasn't the person who actually going to be doing

06:12.360 --> 06:12.820
the work.

06:12.820 --> 06:17.360
It's the person who's in charge of customer client satisfaction.

06:17.580 --> 06:22.590
It's the person that probably deals with finding leads and processing the accounts.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.940
Now what does that mean for you and your project that means that when you work with the firm There's

06:26.940 --> 06:32.880
always going to be someone that is looking over the project keeping tabs on where it is.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.980
It means that there's someone there who's probably in charge of keeping the quality high and making

06:37.980 --> 06:41.670
sure that your deadlines get done on time if something goes wrong.

06:41.730 --> 06:44.980
Say one of your workers is just behind schedule.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.710
You have recourse for that.

06:46.710 --> 06:51.390
You could always point that information towards the person who's in charge of the project or the business

06:51.390 --> 06:57.090
manager and that's a way that you can apply pressure to speed things along or kind of voice any concerns

06:57.090 --> 06:57.970
that you're having.

06:57.990 --> 07:04.230
Management layers also provide quite a bit of guidance a lot of them will give you insight and expertise

07:04.230 --> 07:08.250
that you wouldn't necessarily have if you're just working with the individual person that's doing your

07:08.250 --> 07:09.020
work.

07:09.030 --> 07:13.630
They also allow you to spend less time on your project.

07:13.680 --> 07:19.260
You hire a freelancer you're going to need to do your check ups yourself you're going to need to work

07:19.260 --> 07:24.600
with them to make sure that they hit deadlines make sure that the quality is high and check in with

07:24.600 --> 07:26.890
them from time to time and that falls on you.

07:26.910 --> 07:32.520
But with a group that has a management layer you have to do less and less so if you're more comfortable

07:32.520 --> 07:33.830
doing less work.

07:34.020 --> 07:39.280
I would say that probably going with a firm is is is a more advantageous situation for you.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.300
Now let's talk about the cons of working with a firm.

07:42.450 --> 07:47.010
Now the cons of working in the firm are actually it's kind of the flip side of the pros that I just

07:47.040 --> 07:52.620
introduce So we talked about how they can offload work in times of need.

07:52.620 --> 07:57.540
Well often what happens with the firm is that they will do that and you will not be aware of that it's

07:57.540 --> 07:58.590
happening.

07:58.590 --> 08:05.040
There's a certain temptation with groups to shift the load around to wherever it's convenient to make

08:05.190 --> 08:10.760
room for more important clients or make room so that they can close sales with other clients.

08:10.770 --> 08:15.900
Now that is usually a detriment to your project and you might not be aware of it happening now if you're

08:15.900 --> 08:20.670
doing a web or mobile application typically you're going to have what's called a lead developer a lead

08:20.670 --> 08:23.130
developer is going to be the person who owns your project.

08:23.130 --> 08:24.150
They know everything about it.

08:24.150 --> 08:27.460
They understand every single piece of your codebase.

08:27.480 --> 08:33.300
Now if a firm is tempted to offload work they might switch that person off to another project and have

08:33.300 --> 08:34.490
someone fill their shoes.

08:34.530 --> 08:40.500
That is almost always a problem for your code quality and your project quality because the person coming

08:40.500 --> 08:47.340
in cannot possibly know the project as well as the person who just left because firms and projects typically

08:47.340 --> 08:53.490
will work with some kind of a specialist model where someone is the specialist on your project or the

08:53.490 --> 08:55.940
lead on your project.

08:55.980 --> 09:01.620
Then when they offload or they shift work between employees or staff members that can actually be a

09:01.620 --> 09:02.430
problem.

09:02.510 --> 09:07.170
So obviously the way that you remedy this is you look for your people are thorough.

09:07.170 --> 09:12.630
When you look through their portfolio and you look at the final kind of in PS So he's obviously helpful

09:12.630 --> 09:17.460
to talk to people directly to talk to the clients that these firms have worked with.

09:17.460 --> 09:20.010
But it's something to keep in mind that this could happen.

09:20.010 --> 09:24.720
Now another con of working with a firm is that you might not get the individualized attention that you

09:24.780 --> 09:26.740
need for your project.

09:26.760 --> 09:31.290
You might also kind of have an issue where the people that you talk with directly probably the project

09:31.290 --> 09:37.110
manager or the business manager might not understand your project on a technical level as well as they

09:37.110 --> 09:37.650
should.

09:37.650 --> 09:43.350
Now keep in mind project managers business managers they have to spread their time between you and probably

09:43.350 --> 09:48.390
a ton of other projects that have to keep the lights on at their firms so they can't be an expert in

09:48.480 --> 09:53.970
everything that you're talking about and they can't necessarily give you a large amount of their attention

09:54.000 --> 09:56.930
and time like you would usually expect from a freelancer.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.480
Now also it's kind of a difficult thing in the sense that because a project manager they might not be

10:03.510 --> 10:08.490
technical you could be the case that you might have some communication issues where you can't get the

10:08.490 --> 10:11.190
answers that you want from a business manager.

10:11.190 --> 10:14.970
But he didn't speak to the directly to the person that's doing the work.

10:14.980 --> 10:19.050
Another con with working in the firm is that when you look at their portfolio it can be a little bit

10:19.050 --> 10:25.290
tricky because when you go and hire them for a project you're not a hundred percent guaranteed to the

10:25.290 --> 10:31.830
employee that you saw are associated with one of their portfolio items so say there is a Web site they

10:31.830 --> 10:36.360
built that thing is just beautiful and you make your decision to use them based off of that portfolio

10:36.360 --> 10:36.770
item.

10:36.780 --> 10:41.230
Now the person who made that it's very possible that they're not even at the firm anymore.

10:41.250 --> 10:45.630
They could be long gone or they could be there and you might not get access to them.

10:45.630 --> 10:51.810
Now keep in mind firms have to on board new users new designers developers whatever it is that you're

10:51.810 --> 10:52.830
using.

10:52.830 --> 10:59.130
So there's a varying degree of veterans sea and expertise in the groups you don't always know exactly

10:59.130 --> 11:00.120
what you're going to get.

11:00.120 --> 11:05.320
Now here's the biggest con of them all firms are more expensive.

11:05.320 --> 11:10.170
They're inherently more expensive because of the biggest pro that we mentioned they have a management

11:10.170 --> 11:10.800
layer.

11:11.100 --> 11:17.170
Those people you deal with project managers business managers they have their own salaries.

11:17.190 --> 11:23.370
So when you get a project estimate or even a per hour estimate baked into that costs will include some

11:23.370 --> 11:25.860
management cost labor.

11:26.010 --> 11:31.110
But also you need to keep in mind that since it's a business they are doing it for some reason and there's

11:31.110 --> 11:33.890
probably a profit margin included in that.

11:33.900 --> 11:39.840
Now it's impossible to tell how much of your estimate is a profit margin but safe to say that at least

11:39.840 --> 11:41.730
some of it is actually their margin.

11:41.730 --> 11:47.000
Firms have to advertise themselves firms often have very large marketing budgets.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.520
Those things get paid for by raising the price of the actual work they end up doing.

11:51.570 --> 11:57.330
So inherently firms are going to be more expensive and like any contract relationship there's going

11:57.330 --> 12:02.100
to be a negative incentive where the contractor is going to want to cut costs.

12:02.100 --> 12:07.170
The biggest difference between a freelancer cutting costs and a firm cutting costs is that firms can

12:07.170 --> 12:12.480
cut costs in many different ways that you would not even be aware of because you don't even know exactly

12:12.480 --> 12:14.890
what goes into the price that you're giving you.

12:14.910 --> 12:18.660
So they could very easily cut costs in areas that you are not even aware of.

12:18.660 --> 12:21.020
So that could be an issue.

12:21.060 --> 12:26.160
Typically transparency is harder with a firm now freelancers on the flip side of this.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.940
There are totally different beast.

12:28.020 --> 12:32.170
A freelancer really is as good as your relationship with them.

12:32.340 --> 12:37.380
Now finding someone who's capable is just as important as finding someone that you can communicate with

12:37.650 --> 12:38.520
effectively.

12:38.570 --> 12:40.630
But the pros are a freelancer.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.690
They're probably what you think with a little bit of surprises.

12:44.700 --> 12:49.410
Now the pros of working with a freelancer they're very similar to the opposite of what you'd expect

12:49.410 --> 12:51.510
with a firm now with freelancers.

12:51.510 --> 12:53.110
They are inherently cheaper.

12:53.130 --> 12:55.120
You are only paying for them.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.600
And what exactly they think their time is worth.

12:57.690 --> 13:02.460
The Perros also are that if you look at their portfolio you know exactly who made that.

13:02.460 --> 13:05.300
So when you hire them you know exactly what you're getting.

13:05.310 --> 13:08.790
Another pro is that freelancers are easier to haggle with.

13:08.940 --> 13:12.030
Firms have kind of a set in stone way that they work.

13:12.030 --> 13:16.830
They usually just have a price that they charge and it's very hard to get them to move because they

13:16.830 --> 13:18.320
have to pay for so many different things.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.240
But a freelancer you really can work with them.

13:21.270 --> 13:27.990
And typically if a freelancer I'd say had 40 hours a week of work they would charge a lot less than

13:27.990 --> 13:33.600
what they're quoting you but they quote you that because they simply do not work 40 hours or work 40

13:33.600 --> 13:37.370
hours a week with billable hours they might be working 40 hours a week.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.280
But it's not always going to be paid.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.680
Now obviously that's a generalization.

13:40.680 --> 13:46.730
Some freelancers are very popular and very well established and so maybe they're overflowing with work.

13:46.740 --> 13:52.980
But it's typically the case that they like to compensate for the time they are not getting paid by raising

13:52.980 --> 13:55.550
the price during the times in which they are getting paid.

13:55.560 --> 14:02.430
So there's always a little room to wiggle because for them it's not worth spending time closing deals

14:02.820 --> 14:05.610
talking about contracts talking about money.

14:05.730 --> 14:10.620
They don't make money when they're trying to fish in contracts and really make money when they're actually

14:10.620 --> 14:12.510
doing them and getting paid for them.

14:12.510 --> 14:18.360
Another pro is that in general they're less busy just in general and that's simply because someone is

14:18.360 --> 14:23.970
a freelancer they spend most of their time and they try to spend most of their time working on whatever

14:23.970 --> 14:27.470
it is there an expert at whatever it is that they do freelance work for.

14:27.480 --> 14:32.330
Now a firm again could have someone that's literally dedicated to finding projects.

14:32.430 --> 14:35.670
So in general a freelancer just getting a lot more flexible.

14:35.730 --> 14:39.680
They generally have pockets of hours that are available all the time.

14:39.720 --> 14:44.480
That means that if you have more of a loose project timeline much easier to work with a freelancer.

14:44.520 --> 14:48.080
Now the cons are obviously related to what we said kind of previously in the firm section.

14:48.090 --> 14:52.110
Now a freelancer one of the biggest cons is what happens if they get sick.

14:52.290 --> 14:56.790
What happens if they disappear what happens if they lose motivation they're only one person so if that

14:56.790 --> 14:59.370
happened your project could literally come to a standstill.

14:59.370 --> 15:05.370
Another con is kind of related to what we talked about as a benefit to a firm in that a freelancer could

15:05.370 --> 15:08.250
run into a problem that they cannot solve.

15:08.280 --> 15:11.250
Freelancers do not always have extensive networks.

15:11.380 --> 15:16.350
People that they can get consulting from and people they can ask for help when they hit a snag.

15:16.450 --> 15:22.960
Again a lot of projects require multiple expertise so a freelancer is more likely to run into something

15:22.960 --> 15:23.990
they do not know.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.310
Because again there are only one person that can mean for your project slower delivery times and potentially

15:30.640 --> 15:33.250
they could run into a problem that's completely unsolvable.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.830
So those are the pros and cons working with the firm working with a freelancer.

15:36.910 --> 15:39.220
They do actually end up making quite a big of a difference.

15:39.220 --> 15:44.950
I think the biggest thing you should pay attention to freelancers are cheaper firms are more expensive

15:45.160 --> 15:48.180
freelancers going require a lot more time for you.

15:48.190 --> 15:51.130
Firms are going to require a lot less time for you.

15:51.170 --> 15:57.160
Typically this is not always true but if you had to go for an average firms do deliver better work on

15:57.160 --> 16:03.300
average because they have management layer and they also have more expertise spread than a freelancer.

16:03.340 --> 16:08.240
And that obviously is how they justify how much they charge it is usually more than a freelancer.

16:08.290 --> 16:12.750
There are some general questions that you should ask yourself when you're trying to determine what's

16:12.760 --> 16:14.780
a better fit for you firm or freelancer.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.850
So first off is your project time sensitive.

16:17.860 --> 16:23.110
Now you're listening before you can probably figure out which one is better for that because firms can

16:23.140 --> 16:29.770
shift load and because firms have larger reputations they're probably a better choice if you are very

16:29.770 --> 16:31.630
time sensitive project.

16:31.630 --> 16:35.770
What I mean by that is if you have a project and you need it by a certain date and it's not ready by

16:35.770 --> 16:41.460
a certain date how big of a pain or a pain event or problem are you going to have.

16:41.530 --> 16:45.790
Now if you have a looser timeline something you want to build but you don't need to launch it right

16:45.790 --> 16:47.880
this second or get it done right this second.

16:48.010 --> 16:51.280
Freelancers are going to be a much better option for you.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.840
The other question you should ask yourself.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.570
Have you contracted out work before.

16:55.570 --> 17:02.230
How experienced are you working with contracted firms that are outside of your core unit.

17:02.320 --> 17:08.770
If you have more experience you're probably going to be able to handle more of the management and deal

17:08.770 --> 17:12.640
with more of the issues that come up as you go along through the process.

17:12.670 --> 17:17.860
That means that you are probably more fit to work with the freelancer now if you're less experienced

17:17.860 --> 17:22.240
it is the first time you've ever contracted something out it might be the case that you want to work

17:22.240 --> 17:25.270
with the firm because of that management layer that we talked about.

17:25.270 --> 17:29.310
Another question you asked yourself how big is your budget if you have a healthy budget.

17:29.380 --> 17:35.950
You have a budget that is well over what some people have been estimating or ballpark for you then it

17:35.950 --> 17:39.090
might be the case that you can you have the luxury of working with the firm.

17:39.100 --> 17:44.230
Now if you're on a budget that's more tight or maybe you just don't want to spend as much than a freelancer

17:44.230 --> 17:46.330
is probably the better option for you.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.770
The other question you should ask yourself how complicated is your technology.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.580
Does it bring in multiple expertise talked about this previously.

17:53.580 --> 17:57.080
Firms are better at managing multiple expertise.

17:57.190 --> 18:02.500
A lot of times you might want to build something that has different pieces of it that are completely

18:02.500 --> 18:04.140
different technologies.

18:04.210 --> 18:07.830
That's typical of the case where a former are going to perform better.

18:07.870 --> 18:09.670
Now that's not to say a freelancer can't do it.

18:09.670 --> 18:14.000
It just means it might take them more time because they may have to learn something along the way.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.410
I'll give you an example.

18:15.430 --> 18:22.600
We've built a social networking app that's on your phone and it had a very large module where you could

18:22.600 --> 18:25.060
take photographs and apply filters to it.

18:25.060 --> 18:32.380
Now the standard expertise for building an iOS application it's not related to doing say core changes

18:32.410 --> 18:34.130
to your camera.

18:34.300 --> 18:39.550
That's actually something that's called core image core image is something that a developer might specialize

18:39.550 --> 18:43.790
in but it's not something you should expect that every single iOS developer should know.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.730
And the last thing I think you should ask yourself is how involved in the project you want to be.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.500
Do you want to have formal meetings or informal meetings.

18:51.520 --> 18:57.720
How often do you want to check in with your freelancer or your firm or whoever is doing your project.

18:57.820 --> 19:04.780
Freelancers are such the case that they are actually burdened by having constant formal updates.

19:04.820 --> 19:09.890
You check in with them three times a week you're going to see a significant slowdown in your project.

19:10.180 --> 19:15.450
Now firms of the other hand have people who are dedicated to keeping you up to date with what's happening

19:15.460 --> 19:19.160
so you can use as much time as you want from those people.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.670
Really it's up to you it's up to your comfort level.

19:21.670 --> 19:25.530
It's kind of actually up to what you expect to come out of the project.

19:25.540 --> 19:31.270
So hopefully now have some kind of an idea of why someone needs a firm and why someone who's a freelancer

19:31.270 --> 19:37.590
and you should have a decent indication of where your project lies within the kind of continuum and

19:37.660 --> 19:41.110
you should be able to make an educated decision as to who to go forward with.

19:41.110 --> 19:41.350
All right.

19:41.350 --> 19:50.850
I'll see you in the next lecture.
