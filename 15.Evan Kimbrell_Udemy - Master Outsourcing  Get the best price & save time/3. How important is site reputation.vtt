Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about one of the elements

00:14.540 --> 00:20.900
that's involved in using those outsourcing freelancing platforms that we cover and we're going to answer

00:20.900 --> 00:24.830
the question is your actual site reputation important.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.930
So if you don't ask this after you're done with a project with a freelancer they leave your review and

00:29.930 --> 00:31.700
you leave them a review.

00:31.730 --> 00:37.430
You rate them on a number of different things and it varies between the platforms.

00:37.550 --> 00:44.090
Several of them actually record how much money you've spent and how quickly you pay the freelancer.

00:44.090 --> 00:49.850
So obviously with most platforms out there whether or not you're renting a space on air B and B or picking

00:49.850 --> 00:56.680
up a ride on uber you probably would think that it's important that your ratings stays as high as possible.

00:56.690 --> 01:02.600
As you the consumer and you the person paying money so is your site reputation important and is not

01:02.690 --> 01:05.040
as important as you would think.

01:05.060 --> 01:11.590
I've seen over the years many many people who have posted jobs had terrible feedback and still got a

01:11.590 --> 01:11.960
kid.

01:12.010 --> 01:17.630
You know consistently got large amounts of bids and found great freelancers.

01:17.690 --> 01:19.190
Now why is that.

01:19.190 --> 01:23.930
Now there's a couple of reasons it might be the case that people with bad feedback still get a lot of

01:23.930 --> 01:25.660
bids and a lot of interest.

01:25.700 --> 01:31.580
I think one is because bids are not really indicative of whether or not a freelancer is paying attention

01:31.580 --> 01:33.530
to who the employer is.

01:33.530 --> 01:37.190
Typically if someone's bidding on their project they're spending most of their time looking at your

01:37.370 --> 01:41.510
actual project description your specs whatever you've attached to it.

01:41.510 --> 01:46.130
They rarely get to the point where they're checking out you your actual profile and making decision

01:46.130 --> 01:48.500
whether or not it's worth it to waste their time on it.

01:48.770 --> 01:53.480
That's not something they typically do up front unless it's a large project.

01:53.480 --> 01:58.940
Now the other reason is I think that a lot of freelancers are just you know if they're biased towards

01:58.940 --> 02:05.030
whether or not they fit a project if they fit a project and the employer is showing interest in them

02:05.270 --> 02:09.500
and it seems like a good fit they're obviously going to be more interested in that project.

02:09.620 --> 02:14.270
And typically they're going to throw away the fact that the other you know the employer has some negative

02:14.270 --> 02:17.040
reviews has some marks on their profile.

02:17.040 --> 02:24.110
Now the one scenario where having bad reviews can actually come and kind of bite you later when perhaps

02:24.110 --> 02:30.410
you're launching larger projects now larger projects because a freelancer can make more money off of

02:30.410 --> 02:33.930
it and can have more billable hours off of it.

02:34.070 --> 02:38.840
They're actually going to spend more time up front larger projects are going to require even you know

02:38.840 --> 02:41.420
30 minutes of time on their own.

02:41.540 --> 02:49.070
Putting together a thoughtful complete you know very is sometimes well-researched proposal and if that's

02:49.070 --> 02:54.650
the case they're much much more likely to look at the employer and if there's a lot of negative reviews

02:54.710 --> 02:59.420
they'll probably say that it's not worth the significant enough time it would take to actually bid on

02:59.420 --> 03:00.500
your project.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.670
Now the other scenario where this could become a problem is when you're doing some of the more advanced

03:04.670 --> 03:07.030
vetting techniques that we cover in this course.

03:07.250 --> 03:14.450
So if you're using things like screener questions if your doing the $50 test if you're asking them to

03:14.450 --> 03:18.750
do small bits of work send it to you to evaluate it.

03:18.830 --> 03:24.920
If you're doing the sample technique there's a good chance that the freelancer will not do it simply

03:24.920 --> 03:30.050
because they're looking at your profile and deciding whether or not they want to spend another 20 minutes

03:30.050 --> 03:30.890
on it.

03:30.920 --> 03:36.680
Obviously they're going to be inclined to work with you because they feel as if there's a better chance

03:36.680 --> 03:37.830
of being chosen.

03:37.940 --> 03:42.290
But it can become a significant problem especially if you use multiple vetting techniques.

03:42.380 --> 03:48.590
But the more important thing is that if you're getting repeatedly negative reviews there could be something

03:48.590 --> 03:51.540
wrong with the way that you are contracting out.

03:51.590 --> 03:57.170
There could be a lot of issues and don't waste the opportunity to find a way of improving what you're

03:57.170 --> 03:57.820
doing.

03:58.040 --> 04:02.810
So realistically if you have a bad review it's not the end of the world and actually doesn't really

04:02.810 --> 04:09.470
even matter unless you're doing large projects unless you're doing a lot of intensive vetting and you're

04:09.470 --> 04:13.430
looking for long term partners and so you're asking them do a lot more work up front.

04:13.430 --> 04:14.650
That's one of becomes a problem.

04:14.660 --> 04:19.930
But up until that point it's not really an issue you're still going to be able to find great freelancers.

04:20.150 --> 04:25.160
And once you do find a great freelancer the review from that is probably going to eventually reach you

04:25.460 --> 04:27.140
up to kind of a level point.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.970
If you're still getting bad feedback.

04:28.970 --> 04:35.100
Make sure to figure out what you're doing wrong and why it is that you're repeatedly having bad experiences.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.940
It's probably something wrong in the process that you're using and it's a great opportunity for improvement.

04:40.940 --> 04:50.270
So I will see in the next lecture.
