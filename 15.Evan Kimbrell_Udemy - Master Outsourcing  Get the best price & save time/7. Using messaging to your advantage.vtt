00:00.420 --> 00:05.400
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture just want to talk a little bit about a technique

00:05.490 --> 00:10.130
that is almost never used and it always drives me crazy.

00:10.170 --> 00:14.770
It's something that can really help you get a lot more bids for your projects.

00:14.910 --> 00:21.960
Every single system that we've covered in this course allows you the option to kind of turn this whole

00:21.960 --> 00:27.960
process upside down as opposed to posting a job profile and having someone find it and then send you

00:27.960 --> 00:28.910
a proposal.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.050
You can actually go and look for specific freelancers you think look interesting or look like a good

00:34.050 --> 00:36.110
fit and send them a message.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.640
So each one handles it a little bit differently.

00:39.660 --> 00:43.660
It's definitely something you should take advantage of.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.760
A lot of people don't do it because they think it's going to be onerous or it's going to take too much

00:47.760 --> 00:48.380
time.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.730
I'm telling you right now that's not really the case.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.100
Here's how I do it whenever I post a job.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.910
I'll just open up a separate document.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.160
And all right a quick message and I'll make this generic.

00:58.170 --> 01:00.720
This is what I'm going to send to the freelancer.

01:00.720 --> 01:13.900
I'd just generally say hey I was looking at your profile and you would be a good fit for my project.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.500
And then I can give some basic information about my project my project for

01:22.430 --> 01:23.340
you.

01:23.360 --> 01:30.640
And you have similar skills for you if you're interested.

01:32.870 --> 01:43.130
And just let me hope to see you in the project judge something along those lines really it just needs

01:43.130 --> 01:45.130
to be generic.

01:45.170 --> 01:49.700
The idea is that you going to look for people who have the same skill sets that you want and then say

01:49.700 --> 01:53.980
something that makes it appear as if you really looked in-depth at their profile.

01:53.990 --> 01:58.250
That's going to increase the chance chances are the likelihood that they're going to bid on your project.

01:58.250 --> 02:04.520
Really this is enough to get you know if you send 30 messages you'll get 20 bids Unless of course you're

02:04.520 --> 02:05.580
an freelancer.

02:05.660 --> 02:10.810
In that case maybe you only get 10 but that's a significant amount of interest.

02:10.820 --> 02:14.870
It's also going to increase the quality of your proposals because the people who get a message from

02:14.870 --> 02:19.670
you who come to your project and bid they think they already have a leg up so they're going to spend

02:19.670 --> 02:22.060
a little bit more time on your project.

02:22.070 --> 02:26.080
So the way that I just go about doing it is I just copy it.

02:26.780 --> 02:32.270
So each one of them is a little bit different on elance as you can see right here for a page we made

02:32.270 --> 02:36.890
before on a page we made before.

02:36.950 --> 02:42.320
Here is invited and you can see that I took advantage of this for a project that we were building before

02:43.130 --> 02:44.200
for a client.

02:44.270 --> 02:49.840
And as you can see over here I sent 28 invitations six accepted 14 declined.

02:49.850 --> 02:50.930
That's pretty good.

02:50.930 --> 02:53.650
That means I got six bids out of the Tony I sent.

02:53.900 --> 02:58.910
After you create a project on e Leonce what it does is it's automatically going to populate a list of

02:58.910 --> 03:02.280
people that have the skill sets that you set up in your project page.

03:02.420 --> 03:06.690
And then with one button you can invite Twenty four people or something like that.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.680
L.A. is going to limit you to messaging 30 people a day.

03:09.860 --> 03:15.020
So what you can do is just set an alarm and come back the next day 24 hours after you post it and just

03:15.020 --> 03:17.830
keep doing this until you get someone that you're really happy with.

03:17.840 --> 03:22.670
Now obviously keep in mind we have those other techniques for figuring out what's a good bid and what's

03:22.670 --> 03:23.510
not a good bid.

03:23.510 --> 03:27.620
So you can quickly get rid of the ones that are junk and move through them more quickly.

03:27.620 --> 03:32.680
Otherwise if you invite 100 people you might get 80 bids and that might be overwhelming.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.660
So really all you do is you hire search freelancers.

03:35.690 --> 03:38.650
So right off the bat it just gives you a generic one over here.

03:38.660 --> 03:42.130
This is where you need to get detailed though you need to pick exactly what you want.

03:42.140 --> 03:47.780
You know if I'm building an iOS application I might pick my category is I.T. programming then I can

03:47.780 --> 03:51.170
pick my country and I can pick my skills.

03:51.170 --> 03:55.670
David you also suffer here a number of reviews people who don't have enough reviews means they haven't

03:55.670 --> 03:58.340
been on the system long enough feedback same thing.

03:58.640 --> 04:03.530
You're going to go for people who are higher rated typically don't mess with these hourly rate is worth

04:03.530 --> 04:03.920
doing it.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.880
If you're very specific about that we can get very specific to what we think we need.

04:07.880 --> 04:13.030
Maybe I want only want an individual we want an individual who's an I.T. in programming.

04:13.040 --> 04:22.730
I only want them in or pick a region let's say Eastern Europe and then I can say with specific skills

04:22.790 --> 04:27.410
in Iowa us so we can just say is development.

04:27.410 --> 04:28.060
There we go.

04:28.280 --> 04:28.550
OK.

04:28.550 --> 04:31.770
Now I have a pretty good list of people.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.180
OK now I have a pretty good list of people.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.250
All I have to do is go through and click hire me.

04:37.430 --> 04:43.040
And then what will happen is if I have a job posting that's active I'll just it says you invite them

04:43.040 --> 04:43.890
to a job.

04:43.890 --> 04:48.220
You invite them to a job you continue and the next message will ask you to send them a private message.

04:48.230 --> 04:48.590
That's right.

04:48.590 --> 04:50.100
Copy and paste the message.

04:50.180 --> 04:54.650
You can actually get a virtual assistant do this for you every single day and only cost you 50 cents

04:54.650 --> 04:55.810
a day.

04:55.820 --> 05:01.310
It's funny you can actually use Elance or oDesk or up works or to actually go and hire someone to do

05:01.310 --> 05:02.650
this for you.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.930
So in freelancer it's a little bit different.

05:04.940 --> 05:10.000
You just go to hire freelancers and then you go to browse directory.

05:10.240 --> 05:15.500
It works in a very similar way because then after that we're going to look at the criteria they use

05:15.500 --> 05:17.310
to narrow down the list.

05:17.390 --> 05:22.880
Over here you can pick your country you can look for keywords you can pick exams they've passed things

05:22.880 --> 05:25.320
like that it doesn't let you get too much in depth.

05:25.340 --> 05:29.540
So then what you would do is instead of cooking hire me because this will ask you to create a private

05:29.540 --> 05:35.300
project you actually click their name once you're actually into their page over here instead of getting

05:35.300 --> 05:36.920
a higher mean you just drop this down.

05:37.010 --> 05:38.680
You say invite the project.

05:38.690 --> 05:42.790
So then I have a fake project I put up I can invite.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.000
So after you had invited asks you to send a message and you're all set.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.270
So just go through as many as you can.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.710
They're going to limit you again.

05:49.730 --> 05:52.990
I think it's to 50 a day which is more than you would ever need.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.920
All right on up work you just go to freelancers and you're going to find freelancers.

05:57.920 --> 06:03.620
And then here you can search for specific skills or countries or you can go through a broader category.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.680
So maybe I'm looking for again an Iowa developer.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.290
So we'll get a mobile development.

06:08.570 --> 06:08.940
Okay.

06:08.950 --> 06:14.660
And then right off the bat we can see here it populates the list and I can get more specific how much

06:14.660 --> 06:16.130
experience do I want.

06:16.130 --> 06:17.810
How much feedback do I want.

06:17.810 --> 06:24.230
I can also pick pretty much everything that we've seen in the other one so uses get very specific invite

06:24.230 --> 06:25.570
as many people as you can.

06:25.580 --> 06:32.750
If you're not getting a bids that you like keep inviting people there's no reason not to max out this

06:32.750 --> 06:35.030
option whenever you can.

06:35.030 --> 06:39.140
Honestly this is one of the better things that will help you throughout this entire process and you

06:39.140 --> 06:41.900
can use this with a lot of different platforms.

06:41.900 --> 06:42.990
They open this up to you.

06:43.010 --> 06:44.750
Not enough people take advantage of it.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.240
It's really really simple.

06:46.310 --> 06:52.160
If you just write a template message it'll dramatically increase your bid rate the total amount of bids

06:52.190 --> 06:55.940
and it'll dramatically increase the chance that you find someone that you really want to work with.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.500
So I will see you guys in the next lecture.
