00:09.620 --> 00:14.930
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about one of the worst nightmares

00:14.930 --> 00:18.790
associated with contracting or really with employees in general.

00:19.130 --> 00:24.360
It's what happens when you have a project you describe that project as well as you think you have.

00:24.620 --> 00:28.010
But the feeling is it just keeps coming back with substandard work.

00:28.020 --> 00:34.310
Now what do I mean by this I mean that maybe you asked a freelancer to design your website and everything

00:34.310 --> 00:40.490
they send back to you is just much lower quality than you thought it would be or you asked for an application

00:40.490 --> 00:45.440
development and they sent it back to you and an all the intangible things that you couldn't have described

00:45.440 --> 00:46.340
in your application.

00:46.340 --> 00:47.960
It's just not working well.

00:48.010 --> 00:51.220
The load times bad certain sections just function.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.320
Strangely certain things just don't look right.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.800
It doesn't have the general look and feel that you want.

00:57.810 --> 01:04.730
Those are often things that can be problems in a project that are much harder to specify at the beginning

01:04.730 --> 01:05.780
of the project.

01:05.810 --> 01:10.850
When you build specs sheets or overview sheets for your projects it's really easy to get the details

01:10.850 --> 01:11.930
and the facts.

01:11.930 --> 01:12.960
And this does this.

01:12.980 --> 01:13.440
Right.

01:13.450 --> 01:13.660
Right.

01:13.670 --> 01:18.440
Because it's just they're just facts but look and feel and the way that certain pages should load and

01:18.440 --> 01:24.530
transition and all that other stuff there's a lot of information and opportunity for problems that exist

01:24.560 --> 01:28.430
in between the cracks of essentially of what you're describing.

01:28.430 --> 01:33.110
So what happens when you have a freelancer keeps returning bad quality.

01:33.110 --> 01:40.220
Well and previously we talked about using milestones to protect yourself from freelancers and getting

01:40.220 --> 01:43.550
yourself in a situation where you're only paying for what you're proving.

01:43.550 --> 01:49.730
So the best case scenario is that you prevented this or at least prevented the damage from this by setting

01:49.730 --> 01:51.430
up a milestone system.

01:51.470 --> 01:56.180
So what you'd say is after this milestones don't pay you X amount to the next month in three the next

01:56.270 --> 02:04.180
money if there's a case where you're getting substandard work you can usually tell by the first milestone.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.650
Usually what'll happen is if you can tell it's substandard.

02:07.730 --> 02:13.250
You need to make sure that you look and try to identify what exactly is wrong and then you need to see

02:13.250 --> 02:18.470
whether or not you can make the freelancer or the contractor understand this is lower quality and this

02:18.470 --> 02:19.610
is what it should be.

02:19.700 --> 02:25.370
If you can get them to understand what it is they're doing wrong or why it's different then it's OK

02:25.370 --> 02:28.250
to authorize them for the next milestone.

02:28.250 --> 02:32.750
Now if you cannot even get them to recognize what they're doing wrong or they're becoming accusatory

02:32.750 --> 02:37.760
saying it's it's something wrong with your specification sheets or your instructions that might be the

02:37.760 --> 02:42.850
case that you probably need to consider cutting your losses and moving on to another freelancer.

02:42.860 --> 02:49.490
Typically this only happens when you haven't described your project in enough detail or you didn't actually

02:49.490 --> 02:54.820
put in the time or the effort to really take your time and vetting a freelancer.

02:54.890 --> 02:59.570
A lot of times you post a project you don't maybe get a lot of bids if you follow this course you should

02:59.570 --> 03:04.070
be getting a lot of bids but maybe you had to pick between two people that you weren't thrilled about.

03:04.260 --> 03:09.830
In-general picking a freelancer should be an obvious decision there's always someone who is just WAY

03:09.830 --> 03:14.730
above the other ones or at least considerably better than the other bids you have.

03:14.750 --> 03:19.970
But if it's a case where you had to pick between two people who don't have reviews or two people who

03:19.970 --> 03:25.250
don't have a huge amount of confidence in this could very often happen and you just understand that

03:25.250 --> 03:27.580
this is a big risk that you could be taking.

03:27.580 --> 03:32.930
So if you're having to pick between the lesser of two evils when it comes your freelancer you might

03:32.930 --> 03:34.980
need to reassess your project as a whole.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.160
You might need to go back rework on your wireframe where you work on your description or try some of

03:40.160 --> 03:45.910
the other platforms or keep rapid cycling your posts until you finally get someone who just clicks.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.800
But in general my best practice is that you always have them on a milestone situation.

03:50.990 --> 03:55.840
If you're lucky you didn't have to pay them up front and a lot of times that is negotiable.

03:55.850 --> 03:57.050
They don't have reviews.

03:57.050 --> 04:02.630
You could obviously say to them I'm going to pay this milestone after it's done and that you reserve

04:02.630 --> 04:06.410
the right to terminate the contract if they simply don't hold up their end of the bargain.

04:06.410 --> 04:11.870
Now you're going to be able to need to be able to describe what exactly is wrong and be OK with the

04:11.870 --> 04:14.560
fact that you might end up losing a little bit of money.

04:14.600 --> 04:20.990
But in the grand scheme of things you just saved a ton of money down the road and you probably learned

04:21.230 --> 04:22.970
a ton about your project.

04:22.970 --> 04:29.360
The point is not to get discouraged but to go back and reassess what exactly went wrong in the process.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.220
Did you jump in your project with out with the wrong freelance or did you jump on your project without

04:34.220 --> 04:37.220
enough bids did you not properly vet the person.

04:37.220 --> 04:42.800
Did you pick someone that didn't have comparable applications or comparable Web sites or projects that

04:42.800 --> 04:44.500
they've completed in the past.

04:44.510 --> 04:50.560
Did you pick someone who has a great profile except for one or two reviews that are glaringly negative

04:50.570 --> 04:51.980
with red flags.

04:51.980 --> 04:52.910
Is that the case.

04:52.910 --> 04:58.560
Go back try to pinpoint what exactly the problem is and honestly just start from scratch.

04:58.610 --> 05:04.460
If you followed my advice before about milestones and about minimizing the legal cost or the problems

05:04.950 --> 05:08.150
with the cash that you put up front then you should be fine.

05:08.180 --> 05:13.930
You might end up raping your knees just a little bit but it's only a problem that people who are new

05:13.930 --> 05:15.040
to this ever make.

05:15.070 --> 05:18.420
And it doesn't even necessarily happen to everyone.

05:18.430 --> 05:25.030
So try to take it in stride try to learn as much as you can in it and try your best to get the other

05:25.030 --> 05:29.250
person to understand what they're doing wrong and try to correct course if it's impossible.

05:29.250 --> 05:36.640
Make sure to cut your ties back out try this process over again and try to make the best logical detailed

05:36.640 --> 05:44.610
argument you can to get at least the reasonable portion of the amount of money you paid back to you.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.090
These are sticky situations.

05:46.090 --> 05:47.270
They're a little bit hard.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.890
There's not exactly a blueprint for going around this.

05:49.900 --> 05:55.060
This is just from my experience really you just need to understand whether or not there's a miscommunication

05:55.300 --> 05:57.760
and I understand whether or not it's something that can be remedied.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.750
Do you guys have any horror stories or any questions just post in the group discussion.

06:01.780 --> 06:10.140
Otherwise we'll see in the next lecture.
