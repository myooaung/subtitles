00:09.470 --> 00:14.690
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about what is outsourcing

00:14.780 --> 00:15.920
what is it not.

00:15.920 --> 00:21.020
We're going to try to dispel some myths and try to put a finger on what exactly is the definition that

00:21.020 --> 00:22.920
we're going to be working with throughout this course.

00:22.940 --> 00:27.500
Now I'm going to tell you this upfront I'm actually going to use the term outsourcing and a little bit

00:27.500 --> 00:31.230
of a different way than you used to it's not the most strict definition of outsourcing.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.620
But for this course it's going to make a lot more sense.

00:33.620 --> 00:38.900
So let me try to explain to you what exactly I mean when I say outsourcing and then what in general

00:38.900 --> 00:39.990
does outsourcing mean.

00:40.130 --> 00:47.090
So I'm I'm sure you've heard the term over and over and over again with the advent of the Internet outsourcing

00:47.090 --> 00:48.710
became a real thing.

00:48.890 --> 00:54.360
You know back in the 90s it was kind of a hot topic but now it's kind of a case that everyone does it.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.750
And still though when people think outsourcing they kind of think of what the first permutation of outsourcing

00:59.750 --> 01:05.840
was which was what do you think of right a call center in the Philippines or some like outsourced Human

01:05.840 --> 01:11.120
Resources Division in India that your company takes so much information to sends it to them and it comes

01:11.120 --> 01:12.240
back done.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.900
Well you know you're right in a sense right.

01:14.900 --> 01:20.230
So outsourcing does include those things like call centers and outsourced human resources.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.760
But it includes a lot more.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.380
The stereotype of outsourcing.

01:23.390 --> 01:23.680
Yeah.

01:23.690 --> 01:28.460
It's like low wages and poor English that's it everybody thinks of when they think of outsourcing.

01:28.640 --> 01:35.180
But in reality outsourcing is quite literally anything you contract out to someone who is not in the

01:35.180 --> 01:37.190
same country as yourself.

01:37.230 --> 01:41.270
Now if you were to give some work to say someone who lives down the street there in your country in

01:41.270 --> 01:46.850
your state city we wouldn't consider that outsourcing traditionally but if that person you gave that

01:46.850 --> 01:52.130
information to that job to sat across the border somewhere or on the other side of the world then we

01:52.130 --> 01:53.980
would consider that outsourcing.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.500
Now a lot of people use it incorrectly.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.980
They use outsourcing when they say something like oh you know I don't want to do this work I'm going

02:00.980 --> 02:02.080
to outsource it.

02:02.390 --> 02:09.130
But when I say outsourcing I specifically mean taking work and getting it done outside of your country.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.640
Now if you just did it to someone else in your country typically I'm to refer to that as just contracting

02:14.030 --> 02:15.460
now out of country.

02:15.470 --> 02:21.230
That's a very important distinction and it actually keeps you in kind of the reason why it was sent

02:21.750 --> 02:23.740
or offloaded in the first place.

02:23.750 --> 02:29.870
So now if you contracted it to someone in your country or say you did or a company did you probably

02:29.870 --> 02:33.950
think maybe they did it because the company didn't have the right expertise.

02:33.950 --> 02:36.140
Or maybe they did it because they at capacity.

02:36.140 --> 02:41.230
They couldn't find their own human resources to be able to do some task or some specialty.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.870
Now almost without a doubt.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.530
When you outsource it outside of your country.

02:46.610 --> 02:52.720
The main point is that you're trying to take advantage of cheap labor costs somewhere else.

02:52.730 --> 02:54.740
Now it's not just limited to labor costs.

02:54.740 --> 03:01.430
Other countries have cheap virtually everything and outsourcing is especially popular with web applications

03:01.430 --> 03:06.350
mobile applications because as long as they have an internet connection there's not a lot of other kind

03:06.350 --> 03:09.840
of fixed cost associated with them working from anywhere in the world.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.430
So now what are things that typically get outsourced.

03:12.460 --> 03:18.650
Well honestly tons and tons of stuff you know back in the 90s they started off with outsourcing smaller

03:18.650 --> 03:24.670
things things that are more easy to outsource like say a web site development or say something like

03:24.680 --> 03:25.550
accounting.

03:25.550 --> 03:28.350
But nowadays it's really expanded to almost anything.

03:28.520 --> 03:33.360
You know you can outsource a mobile application you can outsource a web application.

03:33.470 --> 03:39.170
You can outsource event promotion marketing social media management public relations.

03:39.260 --> 03:44.830
You can do human resources I've seen outsourcing for hiring and firing.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.510
I've seen outsourcing for consulting.

03:47.510 --> 03:49.290
I've seen outsourcing for.

03:49.610 --> 03:55.220
Yeah I mean strategies and even like large research projects will outsource quite a bit.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.740
I mean I've even seen recruiting being outsourced.

03:57.740 --> 04:03.320
I've seen people hiring Indian firms to help them recruit other people to hire locally.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.460
I've even seen people use outsourcing for trying to find a date.

04:07.460 --> 04:12.710
Now you need to kind of wrap your head around this is that every single company in the world.

04:12.710 --> 04:18.980
Virtually every single company in the world outsources something at some point in time in their company's

04:18.980 --> 04:19.680
lifespan.

04:19.820 --> 04:25.740
Virtually any large company probably has multiple outsourcing operations going on.

04:25.850 --> 04:32.070
There's even companies that have over 50 percent of their actual business processes outsource currently.

04:32.240 --> 04:38.540
So really the question isn't should I outsource it's a question of what do I have that's eligible for

04:38.540 --> 04:39.380
being outsourced.

04:39.410 --> 04:43.410
And what do I have that would be something that's a good idea to outsource.

04:43.430 --> 04:46.030
And lastly what are you comfortable outsourcing.

04:46.040 --> 04:51.460
Every single company has certain things that they'd be comfortable outsourcing and not comfortable outsourcing.

04:51.470 --> 04:53.840
So the question should you outsource.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.960
I'm obviously going to say yes it is extremely helpful.

04:57.980 --> 05:03.110
It's a fantastic way of not only saving money and getting your projects done on time but it's an easy

05:03.110 --> 05:07.460
way of reaching out and getting expertise that there's no way you would have had your self you couldn't

05:07.520 --> 05:12.440
build yourself and you couldn't possibly have recruited in-house.

05:12.450 --> 05:17.700
One of the biggest reasons why I all of outsourcing is you can be literally anyone you can be a broke

05:17.700 --> 05:24.270
college student or you can do some gigantic fortune 500 and you can outsource really anything you can

05:24.270 --> 05:24.920
think of.

05:24.930 --> 05:28.260
And the prices can be surprisingly cheap.

05:28.260 --> 05:32.990
You do not need a traditional budget to get large applications or large projects done.

05:33.190 --> 05:38.520
Okay so really the main takeaway from this lecture is that when I say outsourcing I mean that you're

05:38.520 --> 05:42.590
taking your work and you're trying to find someone in another country to get it done.

05:42.690 --> 05:47.640
And the reason why you're doing that is because the costs are going to be cheaper and it's going to

05:47.640 --> 05:53.610
allow you in some way to accelerate your growth either as an organization a freelancer or just an individual

05:53.610 --> 05:55.080
with a project idea.

05:55.110 --> 05:57.350
Now on the question of should you outsource.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.920
How should you and what should you.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.830
Well that's what the entirety of the Course is about.

06:01.830 --> 06:08.400
So by the end of the course you're going to be a master in getting your project done saving money saving

06:08.400 --> 06:13.980
time and making everybody else think you're a wizard because you can certainly just conjure up whatever

06:13.980 --> 06:17.480
you want to get built and it's done and you did it without breaking the bank.
