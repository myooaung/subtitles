00:10.780 --> 00:15.520
Hey guys welcome back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about a very common problem

00:15.520 --> 00:22.990
that pops up in web and mobile development projects and that is you have an outsourced firm or contracted

00:22.990 --> 00:24.370
firm or person.

00:24.580 --> 00:29.260
And when you get to the phase where it's finished and you're now evaluating and doing quality assurance

00:30.100 --> 00:34.540
there are bugs that are repeatedly there and are persistent.

00:34.540 --> 00:35.630
Now what do I mean by this.

00:35.650 --> 00:41.080
I mean this is when you first look at your finished project you probably notice a lot of bugs previous

00:41.080 --> 00:48.520
lectures we talked about ways of listing out those bugs and how to best document them and get your contractor

00:48.550 --> 00:50.820
to fix them in kind of a sequential order.

00:50.830 --> 00:56.230
But what'll happen a lot of times especially if you're working with outsourced labor in a country that

00:56.590 --> 01:02.710
might not have the same language skills you have is that you'll have persistent bugs so you say hey

01:02.710 --> 01:04.330
this button doesn't work.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.340
They say OK it's fixed.

01:06.340 --> 01:07.000
You go back.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.200
It's not fixed.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.320
So you go back again and you say fix it.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.490
It never gets fixed.

01:11.500 --> 01:17.100
This is a problem that happens really all too often and it really just kind of depends what the quality

01:17.100 --> 01:18.490
of the freelancer you picked.

01:18.610 --> 01:22.750
But what's primarily happening here is two different things.

01:22.750 --> 01:30.070
One they simply do not understand what exactly it is that you're talking about when you say that something

01:30.070 --> 01:32.580
should do this but it's not doing this.

01:32.710 --> 01:36.050
They need you to explain it in a more literal way.

01:36.070 --> 01:40.390
What ends up happening is they are not 100 percent sure of what you mean.

01:40.390 --> 01:46.630
The other thing is that you might have given them a situation where something doesn't work and they

01:46.630 --> 01:51.610
check that specific situation but not all of the other types of situations.

01:51.610 --> 01:55.270
So in the first case it's a misunderstanding.

01:55.330 --> 01:55.950
OK.

01:56.110 --> 02:02.620
The best way of tackling this is immediately find if you have a bug that's not being it's being persistent.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.600
And typically why this happens is because when you told them what the problem was you didn't go into

02:07.600 --> 02:08.510
enough detail.

02:08.530 --> 02:11.810
You simply said in a sentence this should be like this.

02:11.830 --> 02:12.820
It's like this.

02:12.820 --> 02:13.390
OK.

02:13.480 --> 02:18.380
Well they're not usually native English speakers so they might be confused exactly what you mean or

02:18.420 --> 02:20.250
remember projects get confusing.

02:20.250 --> 02:23.880
I mean a lot of different jargon you're not completely used to.

02:23.890 --> 02:26.120
You can't agree on the terms.

02:26.230 --> 02:32.220
A lot of times it's hard even to describe certain sections of your site or your application.

02:32.290 --> 02:35.430
How does you describe them concisely or in an accurate manner.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.060
We have problems labeling our projects all the time.

02:39.190 --> 02:44.020
You know we might call one section something or a function a certain something and someone else in the

02:44.020 --> 02:46.000
company might call it something completely different.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.560
It's there's a lot of opportunity for miscommunication.

02:48.640 --> 02:54.670
So if that's the case you need to cut out the language problem you need just stop relying on semantics

02:54.730 --> 03:00.130
and your English ability to describe the problem and start using a visual explanation.

03:00.130 --> 03:01.620
Now there's several ways you can do that.

03:01.620 --> 03:04.870
Screen shots are the best you can possibly do.

03:04.990 --> 03:08.080
Get in find the problem and document it.

03:08.080 --> 03:13.810
Take a photograph of a screen do a screen shot exactly what it should look like and what it does not

03:13.810 --> 03:14.500
look like.

03:14.530 --> 03:21.220
Put that in a Word document and describe every single image you can try to put as much specificity as

03:21.220 --> 03:23.510
you possibly can.

03:23.620 --> 03:28.090
And ninety nine percent of the time when you do that Bill understand finally what it is.

03:28.150 --> 03:32.470
Basically it just means that there there's probably an English barrier and you need to get around that

03:32.470 --> 03:37.630
by skipping the language requirement and just started using visual requirements.

03:37.630 --> 03:42.880
You could even go so far as using a screen share if you guys want some suggestions for a screen share

03:42.880 --> 03:43.510
software.

03:43.510 --> 03:45.230
Just post on the group discussion.

03:45.370 --> 03:47.650
Really easy there's a lot of free ones.

03:47.710 --> 03:53.040
All you can do is just thin film what exactly you're seeing on your computer or on your phone.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.570
And then just make a recording of it not working.

03:55.570 --> 03:58.000
That's one of the best ways of capturing bugs.

03:58.000 --> 04:06.280
Now the other scenario where you have persistent bugs is because they are only looking at one instance.

04:06.370 --> 04:11.980
So now like for instance in a web project that has you know the ability to log in and create an account

04:11.980 --> 04:19.590
save information to your profile things like that or what we call user settings in a scenario like that

04:19.600 --> 04:25.230
it could be the case that a bug only persists in one area for one type of user.

04:25.450 --> 04:32.530
So what happens a lot of times is I might say to a developer or a freelancer this is a problem I've

04:32.530 --> 04:33.740
noticed when I've logged in.

04:33.760 --> 04:34.330
OK.

04:34.330 --> 04:39.550
So what they do is they go look at my account they log in they find the bug and they fix it but they

04:39.550 --> 04:42.360
didn't fix it for everybody else is experiencing it.

04:42.370 --> 04:44.530
They didn't fix it for when you're not logged in.

04:44.530 --> 04:49.030
They didn't fix it for when the administrators logged in they didn't fix it for all the other users

04:49.030 --> 04:52.650
so they're only thinking a narrow space of time.

04:52.660 --> 04:57.420
This happens a lot with contractors remember they don't get paid extra to fix bugs.

04:57.490 --> 04:59.620
This is just something that's required in their contracts.

04:59.620 --> 05:03.590
They're not going to go above and beyond to look for every single scenario.

05:03.730 --> 05:09.040
If that's the case again you just need to put out a word document and try to capture that bug as many

05:09.040 --> 05:12.820
times as possible screen shares are great screen are great.

05:12.940 --> 05:18.700
Try to find every scenario where you find it and document it say what your browser was say the time

05:18.700 --> 05:24.310
you got it say what exactly the error message was or whatever the issue is where you saw what you were

05:24.310 --> 05:26.920
logged into etc etc..

05:26.980 --> 05:31.260
Try to add specificity to it and just understand.

05:31.270 --> 05:37.660
This happens a lot of times because applications are complicated and it can be very complicate especially

05:37.660 --> 05:42.880
when you're working with a contractor who needs to put his time elsewhere or is not incentivized to

05:43.330 --> 05:45.600
put extra effort into fixing this bug.

05:45.610 --> 05:50.560
So in both scenarios understand these are completely natural but the way you get around them is by adding

05:50.560 --> 05:56.350
more detail just take a little bit of time to document it and make sure they know exactly what's going

05:56.350 --> 05:56.650
on.

05:56.650 --> 05:59.110
Do a little bug hunting on your own and you should be fine.

05:59.110 --> 05:59.370
All right.

05:59.380 --> 06:00.160
So in the next lecture.
