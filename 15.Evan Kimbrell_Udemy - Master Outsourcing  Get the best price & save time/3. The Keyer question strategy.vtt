00:09.870 --> 00:14.650
You guys all come back to the course in this lecture we're going to talk about a strategy called adding

00:14.770 --> 00:21.930
keywords or what we call Chirs into your project descriptions and into your specifications.

00:21.980 --> 00:29.290
Now right off the bat I just kind of made up the word when I say tears I use this quite frequently.

00:29.290 --> 00:33.620
So it's much easier just to call it something so that's kind of the nickname I've given it.

00:33.620 --> 00:38.740
It doesn't necessarily have to be the words but it could be key phrases are key questions.

00:38.740 --> 00:42.880
Now one of the biggest problems that you'll have when you're going over a list of people and you're

00:42.880 --> 00:49.180
trying to determine who you should give the project to is that you have a mass of people that may or

00:49.180 --> 00:55.150
may not have written a template response and you don't know if they've read read the entirety of the

00:55.150 --> 00:56.270
project description.

00:56.320 --> 01:01.600
That's obviously a problem because you don't want them to be bidding on something that they haven't

01:01.600 --> 01:02.680
actually thought about.

01:02.860 --> 01:07.660
You also don't want them to be signing up saying they can do something if they haven't tried and actually

01:08.110 --> 01:13.000
comprehended every section of what needs to be done that's obviously going to set you up for problems

01:13.000 --> 01:13.600
down the road.

01:13.600 --> 01:20.290
A lot of times freelancers bid on 10 projects not realizing that they can't actually fulfill four of

01:20.290 --> 01:20.680
them.

01:20.680 --> 01:25.570
Similarly a lot of times freelancers just bid based on what other people say and if they ever win the

01:25.570 --> 01:30.730
project then one ends up happening is that they're trying to renegotiate the price or they might quit

01:30.730 --> 01:31.360
halfway.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.610
So that's a risk you want to avoid.

01:33.610 --> 01:39.010
So to get around that what you can do is you can add to your questions and they're very similar to like

01:39.010 --> 01:46.210
screener questions that we saw an up work an uptick we saw that they ask a question upfront and the

01:46.210 --> 01:47.970
person has to answer to even bid.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.650
But this is actually going a little bit farther than that.

01:50.650 --> 01:58.000
So a tier question is when you add a question or you add some kind of key instruction inside of the

01:58.000 --> 02:03.120
project description that only someone who read the project description would actually be able to see.

02:03.130 --> 02:10.810
So to give you an example you might say in your project description you know in your bid please say

02:10.810 --> 02:12.090
this phrase.

02:12.220 --> 02:18.160
That's a common one I've seen what they're basically trying to do is very quickly identify who has read

02:18.160 --> 02:19.560
and who has not.

02:19.580 --> 02:26.420
Now we don't use that technique because freelancers and freelance firms they can see each other's bids.

02:26.560 --> 02:30.850
And so if they put that at the top of their message ends up happening is a lot of people seeing that

02:31.120 --> 02:31.860
and posting it.

02:31.870 --> 02:37.510
And it's also gotten to a point where that technique has become so popular that groups actually kind

02:37.510 --> 02:42.210
of anticipate that so we'll look into other people's bids to see if they can steal that.

02:42.220 --> 02:48.780
So I'm going to give you some strategies for adding in key questions adding in these little snippets

02:48.790 --> 02:52.510
that basically test to see whether or not the freelancer has read the entire description.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.970
My favorite technique is probably the simplest.

02:55.120 --> 03:01.180
What I want you to do is basically take your project and divide it out into sections so it's pretty

03:01.180 --> 03:04.470
easy honestly if you have a description and your description is two pages long.

03:04.540 --> 03:11.290
Just figure out where you're shifting from one side of your application or one side of your work and

03:11.320 --> 03:12.290
just divide it out.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.320
Put a section to it and then what you want to do is put in every single section.

03:16.330 --> 03:22.780
Ask a question and ask them to say Give me an estimate for how long it'll take to get this section done.

03:22.780 --> 03:27.490
Now traditionally what you do is you put one big project description and then you ask them to give you

03:27.490 --> 03:28.950
an estimate based on that.

03:28.990 --> 03:34.780
But what you can do is just cut in half thirds or fourth and say Give me an estimate for each section.

03:34.780 --> 03:39.910
Now if the person is paying attention they should be able to do this very very easily it shouldn't be

03:39.910 --> 03:41.410
that hard.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.480
Some of them might struggle with it a little bit because sections can be interrelated but you just want

03:46.480 --> 03:49.640
to make sure that they at least give it an an attempt towards it.

03:49.660 --> 03:55.090
And as we talk about it in a separate lecture it's always a good idea to ask for time not money don't

03:55.090 --> 03:57.950
say estimate out the cost for a section.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.100
Ask them how many hours it will take and we'll explain later in the course why that's important.

04:03.100 --> 04:07.720
Another option what you can do is at the very beginning of your project description or within your specification

04:07.720 --> 04:10.810
sheet ask them to give you two pieces of information.

04:10.810 --> 04:15.270
So essentially what you're doing is emulating the screener questions that we saw.

04:15.280 --> 04:20.800
Up work and then kind of inputting that into your project description itself.

04:20.800 --> 04:26.560
So what you could do is you could just ask them say show me a portfolio item that is similar to this

04:26.560 --> 04:34.030
project tell me what your availability is something that is maybe specific maybe generic but it's something

04:34.030 --> 04:39.820
that if they don't respond with that information you know that they're not someone who's has like strong

04:39.820 --> 04:45.300
attention to detail and they clearly might have glossed over your project description.

04:45.310 --> 04:51.490
Another strategy is within your project description if you have a section that might be a little bit

04:51.490 --> 04:58.030
more difficult or could be done in multiple ways what you can do is you can say to the freelancer in

04:58.030 --> 05:01.360
the project description how would you address this.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.020
How would you build this.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.640
What thoughts do you have on this.

05:05.830 --> 05:11.850
And then what you can do is that you can look through the project easels and see who exactly actually

05:11.850 --> 05:16.290
answered the question and this is helpful because it's also a test to see how thoughtful and how experienced

05:16.320 --> 05:21.120
they are thoughtful people will actually give you multiple options or they'll just straight up tell

05:21.120 --> 05:25.590
you I'm not entirely sure but when I do do the project I'll research it and I'm confident I'll find

05:25.590 --> 05:26.340
an answer.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.940
That's a perfectly acceptable answer because you have to understand these people are bidding on lots

05:29.940 --> 05:30.790
of projects.

05:30.930 --> 05:35.570
They don't want to waste their time doing the research up front for a project they're not going to get.

05:35.580 --> 05:42.570
Of course that does have mixed results obviously don't pick a PR technique that is too obscure or too

05:42.570 --> 05:45.920
time intensive because it might be the case that no one does it.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.810
That didn't exactly help you then.

05:47.820 --> 05:51.900
So if you're doing a big project and people are going to spend more time upfront in their proposals

05:52.020 --> 05:53.310
you can try that technique.

05:53.310 --> 05:54.790
This is a short project.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.090
Low budget probably not worth doing.

05:57.090 --> 06:01.470
The last technique I like to use is a very generic easy one.

06:01.470 --> 06:06.900
What you can do at the very end of your project description is just ask them and say What do you think

06:06.900 --> 06:13.710
of the project that is it all that does is it ask them to step back a little bit not speak specifically

06:13.710 --> 06:18.540
about what they're building but actually give you a thought about it.

06:18.540 --> 06:22.360
Now do not expect that answer to be poetic.

06:22.410 --> 06:28.950
Don't exactly expect an answer that you would hear from a co-founder or a business partner or even like

06:28.950 --> 06:30.160
a consultant.

06:30.510 --> 06:34.670
There's a good chance that they'll just say there that whatever your idea is it's great.

06:34.770 --> 06:38.820
And obviously because they don't want insult you or make it sound like they're not interested in the

06:38.820 --> 06:42.600
project but a lot of times you can tell if people do have genuine interest.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.620
The point here is again just a test whether or not they're thinking about it whether or not they've

06:46.620 --> 06:53.760
read that and then to get some kind of an idea of how articulate how dynamic and again how thoughtful

06:53.760 --> 06:54.390
they are.

06:54.390 --> 06:58.350
So those are good techniques for putting in career questions.

06:58.350 --> 07:01.730
Remember key questions are the little snippets.

07:01.830 --> 07:06.780
Easter eggs you hide to see who exactly read your description.

07:06.870 --> 07:11.430
It's really helpful because then when you just glance over all your projects you can very easily figure

07:11.430 --> 07:14.990
out the ones you did not answer the question correctly didn't see it.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.360
And you can remove them from the list.

07:16.380 --> 07:22.230
That way you can start whittling it down from say you know 40 people down to eight or nine or something

07:22.230 --> 07:24.400
like that something where it's now manageable.

07:24.420 --> 07:28.710
All right guys try out these techniques in your own projects if you have some other suggestions for

07:28.710 --> 07:30.840
what's worked for you post in the group discussion.

07:30.840 --> 07:41.100
Otherwise we'll see the next lecture.
