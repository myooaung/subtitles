00:09.060 --> 00:14.220
Hey guys welcome back to the course so in this lecture we're going to talk about the relationship between

00:14.220 --> 00:16.470
price and autonomy.

00:16.470 --> 00:22.520
When you're hiring a contractor or an outsourced freelancer so this is actually just a quick video.

00:22.530 --> 00:28.500
I want to introduce a concept that once I kind of understood this it really helped me wrap my head around

00:28.500 --> 00:33.450
what's a good bid what should I expect and what's an efficient kind of route to take.

00:33.450 --> 00:39.120
When I look at the freelancers that are giving me proposals now you've probably noticed right off the

00:39.120 --> 00:45.630
bat there is going to be like a smorgasbord of different prices from different freelancers.

00:45.630 --> 00:50.310
Obviously the price depends on a lot of different things and you can obviously tell very quickly that

00:50.310 --> 00:55.890
place people who are bidding from say the United States are going to bid higher than someone who's bidding

00:55.890 --> 00:57.420
from say Sri Lanka.

00:57.420 --> 01:02.120
So it's obvious that the country of origin makes a big deal in price.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.980
There's also a lot of other factors that go into it.

01:05.010 --> 01:10.530
We're going to talk a little bit more in-depth in the next lecture about the factors that go into pricing

01:10.530 --> 01:12.310
and what you should kind of understand.

01:12.300 --> 01:18.570
So when someone says this is going to take me $20 an hour or you know $200 for your project there's

01:18.570 --> 01:23.460
a lot that's codify into that and you need to break it down to actually understand where you can find

01:23.460 --> 01:26.610
cost savings but also understand whether or not you're getting a good deal.

01:26.610 --> 01:30.920
Now the concept of autonomy is very important when it comes to freelancers.

01:31.290 --> 01:38.390
You want your freelancer to be as autonomous as possible know what I mean by that I mean that if you're

01:38.400 --> 01:44.960
freelancer or your firm runs into a problem how capable are they of solving that problem.

01:44.970 --> 01:50.430
Now you might think to yourself I have made my specification sheets of my instructions perfectly.

01:50.430 --> 01:52.980
There's no way they're going to run into issues.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.380
I have everything planned out.

01:54.440 --> 01:54.820
OK.

01:54.870 --> 01:57.390
That's just flat out not true.

01:57.480 --> 02:03.900
Even professionals even companies that have been outsourcing for 20 years they still run into issues

02:04.470 --> 02:10.260
and they still run into problems that they could not possibly have foreseen when they wrote their spec

02:10.260 --> 02:12.190
sheets or when they originally posted their job.

02:12.210 --> 02:16.050
Just a general rule of thumb is that you should expect issues.

02:16.050 --> 02:17.600
Any little technical bug.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.830
Any clarification issue.

02:19.830 --> 02:25.530
Any type of say even if you're outsourcing your marketing a response that you didn't expect from a potential

02:25.530 --> 02:33.630
customer or really kind of any issue infrastructure issues issues getting gaining access to the accounts

02:33.630 --> 02:34.620
you give them.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.870
There's a lot of different things that can go wrong.

02:36.870 --> 02:42.000
Now what you need to understand about autonomy and how this relates to price is that the more you pay

02:42.240 --> 02:48.060
the more likely you are freelancer is going to be capable of solving their own problems on their own

02:48.240 --> 02:49.370
without help from you.

02:49.440 --> 02:56.760
So let's take an Indian web developer as an example an Indian web developer that lives outside of a

02:56.760 --> 03:03.360
big city that has been working for let's say four to five years and they do primarily let's say javascript

03:03.430 --> 03:09.680
and that person could potentially charge you let's say eight to 12 dollars an hour.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.710
They could even be as cheap as five dollars an hour if they're less experienced.

03:13.710 --> 03:20.040
Now if you saw someone that was bidding $10 an hour it's pretty safe to assume that they're not going

03:20.040 --> 03:26.580
to be very autonomous if something goes wrong their ability to think on the fly to understand your project

03:26.610 --> 03:27.410
as a whole.

03:27.420 --> 03:33.560
Understand the bigger picture of your project and then to make pivots as they go is going to be limited.

03:33.570 --> 03:39.130
This is something that you need to understand when you're paying less money per hour or per project.

03:39.170 --> 03:44.460
They are not going to be able to figure out their own issues and they're going to be pinging you much

03:44.460 --> 03:45.540
much more often.

03:45.540 --> 03:51.000
So now let's use the same exact example let's assume though that these Indian web developers same skill

03:51.000 --> 03:54.900
set maybe they have had more time working with web development.

03:54.900 --> 04:00.210
Maybe they've had more Western clients maybe they live in a bigger city where they have access to better

04:00.210 --> 04:01.260
facilities.

04:01.260 --> 04:03.540
Maybe they have better English skills their price.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.990
Let's just say $20 an hour to $25 an hour.

04:06.990 --> 04:09.290
Now that's probably on the higher end.

04:09.660 --> 04:14.730
But what you need to understand in that situation is that there is an implied association with that

04:14.730 --> 04:19.080
price because $20 to $25 is very expensive for India.

04:19.110 --> 04:24.420
So you have to assume what they mean is that not only are they good at web development they're good

04:24.420 --> 04:28.860
at projects and they're good at freelancing in general they're probably a smart person and they can

04:28.860 --> 04:31.990
probably figure out their issues as they arise.

04:32.010 --> 04:38.460
Now a $10 an hour web developer is not going to be expected to understand who your customers are why

04:38.460 --> 04:42.680
you're selling why you know whatever you're building is a good idea.

04:42.690 --> 04:46.620
They don't need to understand the politics of time maybe even the organization you're running and how

04:46.620 --> 04:48.530
it's going to integrate with them.

04:48.570 --> 04:49.910
They don't need to understand all that.

04:49.910 --> 04:53.790
They probably won't even understand it whether or not this is expensive for you whether or not you have

04:53.790 --> 04:56.320
lots of money to continue the project.

04:56.340 --> 04:59.630
They are only going to be focused on what exactly you tell them to do.

04:59.640 --> 05:05.030
Now a person who's $20 to $25 an hour probably is going to understand a little bit more.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.580
They're going to ask you more questions about who you selling to.

05:07.590 --> 05:13.240
They might even come up suggestions but they might not understand as well as you do and most likely

05:13.240 --> 05:18.430
they won't understand as well as you do but they'll understand it to a much greater degree than if you

05:18.430 --> 05:20.390
had someone there was only $10 an hour.

05:20.390 --> 05:22.780
So what does this mean for you and your project.

05:22.780 --> 05:29.830
Well previously we had talked about what are kind of the prerequisites for outsourcing or contracting.

05:29.980 --> 05:36.550
And we talked a little bit about who the types of people are who outsource or contract and really how

05:36.550 --> 05:43.090
it kind of changes depending on how like how much exercise you have with contracting it really kind

05:43.090 --> 05:49.270
of depends on how many times obviously you've done this before but also how integrated in the process

05:49.270 --> 05:54.520
you want to be a lot of people who are outsourcing do not want to have to check in three times a week

05:54.730 --> 06:00.670
or have to do a significant amount of work on their side to say update requirements update the specification

06:00.670 --> 06:05.980
cheese change instructions provide information to the freelancer.

06:06.370 --> 06:10.690
So really you need to think about how involved you want to be in your process.

06:10.810 --> 06:15.550
If you really are OK with being there every step of the way and I typically suggest that you should

06:15.550 --> 06:17.490
be as involved as possible.

06:17.530 --> 06:20.350
In that case then you should expect to pay more.

06:20.410 --> 06:25.840
And if you end up taking the cheaper option who someone whose price is at the lower end of the range

06:25.840 --> 06:31.840
of what you'd expect well then you're going to have your expectations pretty much broken because that

06:31.840 --> 06:34.300
person is going to be asking you a lot of questions.

06:34.300 --> 06:38.310
That person is going to be constantly coming back to you with the information they need.

06:38.320 --> 06:41.560
There's a good chance they can screw up and build something incorrectly.

06:41.550 --> 06:42.980
You have to go back and fix it.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.790
So technically they are cheaper but if you calculate how much time you spend on it it's not as much

06:48.790 --> 06:50.600
of a bargain as you would think.

06:50.620 --> 06:56.050
So take a second think about your project think about your organization and think about how much time

06:56.050 --> 07:02.140
you're willing to spend on your project and whether or not you're comfortable with having a close kind

07:02.140 --> 07:07.000
of feedback loop with the person who's working on your project and then make a decision accordingly

07:07.000 --> 07:07.960
based on price.

07:08.020 --> 07:14.770
So the main takeaway here is every area every expertise every project is going to have a range and the

07:14.770 --> 07:20.740
more they charge the more autonomous they're going to be the projects and I go a lot more smoothly because

07:20.740 --> 07:24.430
these people are gonna understand more of the project and they're going to be able to make decisions

07:24.490 --> 07:26.290
on the fly that you're OK with.

07:26.290 --> 07:30.850
Whereas someone who is cheaper is either not going to make that decision or they're probably going to

07:30.850 --> 07:34.390
make that decision wrong which requires more effort from you.

07:34.450 --> 07:40.510
So don't obviously just go with the cheapest option go with the one that matches your expertise level

07:40.660 --> 07:42.370
and matches your commitment level.

07:42.430 --> 07:46.750
If you're someone who has lost expertise and you're really committed to this project then you can save

07:46.810 --> 07:47.720
a lot of money.

07:47.740 --> 07:52.060
But if you're in the middle make sure that you work with someone who's a little bit more capable and

07:52.060 --> 07:55.120
a little bit more dynamic than say the cheapest option.

07:55.120 --> 08:02.610
All right I'll see in the next lecture.
