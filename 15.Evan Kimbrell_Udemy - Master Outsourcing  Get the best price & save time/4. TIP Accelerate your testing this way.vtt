A quick tip for those of you who do not want to spend the rest of your natural lives bug testing you

00:11.430 --> 00:17.400
can outsource this freelancer is a great Web site for finding people who can do software testing.

00:17.460 --> 00:22.760
Don't break the bank when you hire a software tester but don't get someone who doesn't understand what

00:22.770 --> 00:24.090
your application does.

00:24.090 --> 00:28.000
Use the same kind of pre qualification skills we talked about in the earlier lectures.

00:28.050 --> 00:32.010
Make sure they understand primarily what your is that you're doing.

00:32.040 --> 00:36.390
Otherwise they're not going to really know where to check and what things they should test with.

00:36.390 --> 00:38.550
If that makes sense you use somebody else's time.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.560
I think it's a great investment.
