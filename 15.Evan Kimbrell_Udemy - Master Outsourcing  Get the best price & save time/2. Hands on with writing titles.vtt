00:05.710 --> 00:10.200
So use the right perks and the right adjectives to get the right people.

00:10.320 --> 00:14.170
If you're building something it's very simple or it's a task that's very simple.

00:14.190 --> 00:16.100
I like putting simple.

00:16.530 --> 00:22.350
That's a very helpful word because people see that and they immediately think Oh this is just something

00:22.350 --> 00:25.100
I can I can do very quickly I can turn my brain off.

00:25.110 --> 00:27.430
Also what happens when you say it's a simple task.

00:27.430 --> 00:30.550
What that kind of means is that you're not looking for the cream of the crop.

00:30.660 --> 00:35.850
That means that you're just looking for someone who's reliable who's fast who you want it done relatively

00:35.850 --> 00:38.100
soon and cheaply.

00:38.130 --> 00:42.870
So that would be something that you don't put if you want to do a line yourself with those types of

00:42.870 --> 00:43.650
contractors.

00:43.650 --> 00:48.990
Now if you're trying to build something that's a little complex the contractor needs some kind of autonomy

00:48.990 --> 00:53.550
and they need the ability to rationalize and think their way through it then it's not an adjective that

00:53.550 --> 00:54.860
I would use.

00:55.050 --> 01:01.750
Now one of my favorite perks to put onto this is long term.

01:01.810 --> 01:08.920
Now that's one thing that I found that is very very powerful in these posting applications long term

01:08.920 --> 01:16.090
positions are very attractive and in many cases if it's a long term position they will be more flexible

01:16.090 --> 01:19.570
on what they give you in terms of rates and in terms of timeline.

01:19.570 --> 01:22.800
Now if I told someone that hey I've never worked the before.

01:22.870 --> 01:28.350
I've an hour long task and you say your advertised rate is $10 an hour.

01:28.510 --> 01:35.560
What leverage do I have to get them to lower that $10 an hour average or to get them to say produce

01:35.620 --> 01:40.280
more or to give me the benefit of doubt when something goes wrong in the project.

01:40.660 --> 01:44.790
Well there's actually not much but if you say it's a long term project.

01:44.980 --> 01:50.880
Well there they have an incentive to kind of give you some leeway because they want this to continue.

01:50.890 --> 01:56.830
Now also think about a contractor bidding on projects what ends up happening with a lot of contractors

01:56.830 --> 02:00.970
especially ones that are not particularly successful is that they're constantly bidding and they end

02:00.970 --> 02:06.910
up spending like 40 percent of their time bidding and finding projects and then 60 percent of time working

02:06.910 --> 02:07.810
on them.

02:07.840 --> 02:16.090
So when they see a long term project that kind of signals to them hey I can focus more on my craft more

02:16.090 --> 02:22.840
on what I do and more and making money and less on this procurement process this advertising process.

02:22.840 --> 02:29.500
Now that's not a long term project personally and I'll talk about this later when we talk about writing

02:29.540 --> 02:30.360
scription.

02:30.370 --> 02:35.770
I always like to say that it has potential for long term a long term arrangement or long term relationship

02:35.800 --> 02:38.210
even if you're not really sure if it does.

02:38.470 --> 02:43.690
But if you like for instance if it's not this project itself is not a long term project what you can

02:43.690 --> 02:49.460
sue is you can say things like follow up projects you can say long term relationship.

02:49.570 --> 02:55.110
You can say looking at repeat business is another one repeat projects.

02:55.210 --> 02:59.890
That's something that kind of conveys the same thing but it doesn't necessarily mean that the application

02:59.890 --> 03:05.520
you're building right now is in itself something that's going to take a very long period of time.

03:05.530 --> 03:09.320
When I say repeat projects or repeat work.

03:09.340 --> 03:14.170
If you want to save some characters what that means that a freelancer is that hey once this is done

03:14.230 --> 03:21.010
I have other ones that might be similar or I'm looking for a freelancer who's multi-verse toll someone

03:21.040 --> 03:24.880
who if they do this well I have many other jobs for them.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.960
We'll cover this when we talk about your description because that's something that you're going to want

03:28.960 --> 03:30.880
to harp on over and over again.

03:31.150 --> 03:35.200
But in your title it's something that can be very effective and it's not something that I see people

03:35.200 --> 03:36.790
utilize very often.

03:36.810 --> 03:39.280
OK so that really is the core of it.

03:39.280 --> 03:39.550
Right.

03:39.550 --> 03:45.550
So describe what you're doing at in some detail make sure that if there is a specific technology or

03:45.910 --> 03:51.130
specific skill set make sure that it is blatantly obvious in the post.

03:51.130 --> 03:55.920
If you have a comparable application make sure to have that up if you don't use a theme.

03:55.930 --> 04:01.510
Give some kind of flavor some kind of detail to it and then make sure that you list out any perks you

04:01.510 --> 04:03.680
can think you want to pay them extra.

04:03.700 --> 04:07.700
Make sure that you put that in there if it's a long term project make sure you put that up there.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.460
If it's simple or can be done very quickly make sure to put that up there.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.930
Now perks are not really a two way street.

04:15.930 --> 04:23.500
It doesn't really make sense to say complex or difficult or the opposite or one time job that's those

04:23.500 --> 04:28.000
don't ever work because those don't actually align themselves with what contractors want.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.770
So personally I like to focus on the simple ones like again simple long term repeat projects.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.890
There are other things you can focus on.

04:40.090 --> 04:43.930
This actually depends on the platform but some of them don't really like this.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.490
You could say Five-Star feedback.

04:46.630 --> 04:47.370
That's another one.

04:47.380 --> 04:52.240
All that really says is hey I give five star feedback I would only use that if you're using that with

04:52.240 --> 04:56.770
a simple short term project something that's easy.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.980
Easy's another one.

04:59.260 --> 05:03.520
That's something that you know it kind of just depends if you're doing something very simple very quick.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.120
That's great.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.880
People are concerned with building out their portfolio.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.050
They'll put an extra effort into what you're doing.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.850
One thing you can also put is say hourly.

05:12.850 --> 05:18.400
Now if you're trying to hire someone hourly That is something that is attractive to freelancers and

05:18.400 --> 05:22.700
contractors hourly is great because they get paid no matter what.

05:22.750 --> 05:27.940
If you're doing a fixed price project they just know that it's a big payday at the end assuming they

05:27.940 --> 05:32.170
hit all of their milestones and they hit all of their requirements and assuming you don't run out of

05:32.170 --> 05:33.150
money halfway through.

05:33.150 --> 05:38.510
So hourly signals less risk to the contractor to the freelancer.

05:38.560 --> 05:45.310
So if you are doing an hourly task make sure that you put hourly and I always like to try to add some

05:45.310 --> 05:47.780
kind of a character so it sticks out a little bit.

05:47.830 --> 05:52.100
You can use plus signs you can use stars you can use caps or whatever it is.

05:52.150 --> 05:56.660
Just make sure that all of the perks are easily readable or illegible.

05:57.160 --> 06:03.700
So those are the positive words that I use frequently don't over think but if you have a simple hourly

06:03.880 --> 06:07.260
long term project make sure that you get those in the title.

06:07.270 --> 06:12.040
Those are things that statistically will get you more bids over time.

06:12.040 --> 06:16.630
There are things that I've used and we've used repeatedly to get a lot more bids.

06:16.630 --> 06:21.050
You always see our projects because we have like 45 bids or other.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.930
The average for any other project is like 10 or 11 or 12 now.

06:25.990 --> 06:30.660
Negative words are ones that I would typically avoid.

06:30.940 --> 06:38.090
I probably would avoid saying like problem or need fixed now.

06:38.170 --> 06:41.980
Those probably have more to do with the project themselves.

06:41.980 --> 06:48.550
But typically a developer or a designer or any type of a contractor freelancer They're more they're

06:48.550 --> 06:53.950
going to be more inclined to bid on projects that are from scratch and not something where they're taking

06:53.950 --> 06:56.260
over someone else's project.

06:56.260 --> 07:02.020
Now there's better ways of phrasing that but I typically do not like to signal that right out of the

07:02.020 --> 07:06.690
gate at the very beginning and that's typically what that means when I say fix a problem.

07:06.700 --> 07:12.520
Well it kind of means that I had a problem probably from a different application or whatever it is that

07:12.520 --> 07:18.690
I got made done and that I want you do to come in and fix the last person's mistakes.

07:18.730 --> 07:23.890
No one really wants to do that so I prefer to leave those out.

07:23.890 --> 07:33.100
One other thing that I will mention is that if you want this done right now make sure that you put that

07:33.310 --> 07:34.680
right now.

07:34.690 --> 07:42.780
That is something that's really kind of important saying you can put it here you can see it ASAP.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.640
You can put right now.

07:44.860 --> 07:52.060
Basically what this means is I'm looking for people who are sitting at their desk right this second

07:52.420 --> 07:56.000
and I want them to start immediately.

07:56.050 --> 08:00.910
Now if you don't put that and you this is a task you want to get started right now say it's like a data

08:00.940 --> 08:07.870
entry task or say it's a mass mailing or an advertising or an organization task or something that you

08:07.870 --> 08:12.550
give like a V.A. what will happen is if you don't put that you'll have a lot of people come in.

08:12.580 --> 08:18.390
Did you like their bid you contact them and they don't come and check for the next 14 hours.

08:18.400 --> 08:23.740
A lot of people especially because of time zones are going to be bidding as they're about to go to sleep

08:23.740 --> 08:25.920
like at the end of the day or the end of the night or.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.710
Or right before they start something or leave for lunch or whatever.

08:29.710 --> 08:34.360
Now if you say right now people are going to know that that's probably not something they should do.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.710
They're looking to start immediately.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.750
And so they want to lock in this job or lock in this project.

08:40.750 --> 08:44.400
They should be at their desk and they should be responsive.

08:44.410 --> 08:49.930
So that's something that's also very important to put in if you're building an application or a Web

08:49.930 --> 08:53.040
site and you're not like crunched for time.

08:53.110 --> 08:57.580
I wouldn't obviously put that especially if you're building a large project you should never be saying

08:57.580 --> 09:02.150
I want to build it right now because you need time to vet these people and we're going to cover that

09:02.170 --> 09:03.470
and the rest of the course.

09:03.520 --> 09:09.490
Techniques for choosing the best person techniques for figuring out who's competent who's not reading

09:09.490 --> 09:11.350
in between the lines and et cetera et cetera.

09:11.470 --> 09:17.650
But you need to give yourself time to do that so don't ever look for an immediate start for a large

09:17.650 --> 09:19.810
project or a large application.

09:20.110 --> 09:20.530
OK.

09:20.530 --> 09:25.800
And so that is basically the simple structure that you should follow.

09:25.810 --> 09:35.430
It's really just what it is you need plus some description plus perks.

09:36.340 --> 09:38.720
And obviously then you would need.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.600
That's right.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.680
Plus plus specific skills.

09:44.230 --> 09:49.750
Civic's OK that's the way I always use it.

09:49.780 --> 09:54.430
That's the most effective way that will make your project stick out and that's going to get you a lot

09:54.430 --> 09:55.520
more bids.

09:56.200 --> 10:04.330
And if you just take a glance at some of the other Web sites like freelancer or some on e Lancer up

10:04.330 --> 10:10.120
work or anything like that you'll notice very quickly people who make problems when they're actually

10:10.120 --> 10:15.340
describing something like vague titles like this just calling it work.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.030
What is that.

10:16.030 --> 10:19.240
It's not really a surprise that they have zero proposals.

10:19.240 --> 10:24.880
People who do things like putting it in all caps putting something in all caps not only looks bad but

10:24.880 --> 10:28.740
it also just blends in with the rest of whatever someone else is writing.

10:28.900 --> 10:33.280
There's a lot of missed opportunities too like we can see writing my kids book.

10:33.670 --> 10:36.000
OK well they got the first section done.

10:36.010 --> 10:41.520
I don't know why my kid's book is important but I should really add more description what is it about

10:41.530 --> 10:42.670
what's the theme.

10:42.670 --> 10:47.650
What exactly are you looking for or are you looking for an illustrator or a writer or someone who's

10:47.650 --> 10:50.660
going to sign the book cover or what is this.

10:50.660 --> 10:53.000
And then there's some other ones that are good easy.

10:53.070 --> 10:59.260
They use easy which is helpful copy paste job but they do need more descriptions and chances are they

10:59.260 --> 11:02.720
have some kind of perk that they're not taking advantage of.

11:03.100 --> 11:07.930
And there's got to be something else you can put in here to make it stick out.

11:07.930 --> 11:13.310
So anyway if you need help writing a title always just post in the group discussion.

11:13.330 --> 11:14.630
I can help you out.

11:14.920 --> 11:19.900
It's also very helpful if you just go and look through some of the titles of what other people have

11:19.900 --> 11:20.730
posted.

11:21.100 --> 11:27.790
So the way that you find it on up work is quite literally you just want to go to ireport.com Sless jobs

11:28.060 --> 11:29.300
on Elance.

11:29.320 --> 11:35.560
You literally just go to find work search jobs browse search you just use criteria.

11:35.560 --> 11:40.880
It's always helpful to look at titles of tasks or projects that are similar to what you're doing.

11:40.900 --> 11:46.090
So when you search for jobs you can type in some keywords you might find applications or projects that

11:46.090 --> 11:46.960
are similar.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.780
We're not really looking for competitors.

11:48.850 --> 11:54.010
We're just looking for other words other people use that might be helpful so that you don't miss anything.

11:54.010 --> 11:59.410
And then when you're on freelance or dot com it's also very simple you just go to work browse all projects

11:59.410 --> 12:02.290
projects my skills so you guys have any questions.

12:02.290 --> 12:07.000
Make sure to just post in the group discussion in the next lecture or we're going to go over how to

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
write a good description.

12:09.130 --> 12:14.690
What you need to include how to elaborate on some of these perks that I put in the title.

12:14.920 --> 12:20.290
But now that we've got them into our page now we need to get them the right information and to make

12:20.290 --> 12:25.930
sure that we explain it correctly and also that we get the bids from the right contractors.

12:25.930 --> 12:34.340
All right I'll see in the next lecture.
