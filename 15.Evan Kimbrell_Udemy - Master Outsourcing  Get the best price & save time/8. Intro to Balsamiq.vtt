WEBVTT

00:06.360 --> 00:07.280
Welcome back.

00:07.530 --> 00:14.610
I am going to intro you to balsamic which is a wire framing tool that we at Sprint kicky use all the

00:14.610 --> 00:15.220
time.

00:15.420 --> 00:21.820
Bosonic is by far my favorite tool for wireframe NG and it's my favorite for two reasons.

00:21.900 --> 00:25.430
One is that it's very simple to use.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.330
You can pick it up very quickly.

00:27.330 --> 00:32.160
I really don't think you need to spend hours and hours with it you can really learn it over the course

00:32.160 --> 00:34.770
of 15 20 minutes.

00:34.770 --> 00:38.970
There are a lot of tools out there that help you wireframe but there they try to make their systems

00:38.970 --> 00:40.230
way too advanced.

00:40.230 --> 00:44.890
My experience you don't end up using 90 percent of the features that you try to give you.

00:45.030 --> 00:49.410
And again you really don't want to have to spend a large amount of time trying to figure out just how

00:49.410 --> 00:50.700
to wire frame.

00:50.700 --> 00:56.820
The second reason why I like balsamic is that they have a sketch kind of design to their system and

00:56.820 --> 00:58.300
you'll see this in just a second.

00:58.650 --> 01:02.990
So when you're designing wireframe it looks kind of like you sketched it out on a piece of paper.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.100
I really like that.

01:04.110 --> 01:06.260
And our clients really like that.

01:06.570 --> 01:12.190
It just kind of looks quirky and cool and it kind of does look like you made it on a scratch pad.

01:12.210 --> 01:19.560
I also like how this sketch kind of look to it makes it kind of feel like you know this is a wireframe.

01:19.560 --> 01:24.960
We don't need to take it too seriously and it kind of conveys that the developer or your designer should

01:24.960 --> 01:26.940
really kind of give you the benefit the doubt.

01:26.940 --> 01:34.050
This is not an exact design of what you want and I kind of like that one downside of balsamic called

01:34.050 --> 01:42.540
MIT is that they do cost money and I believe one user license is $79 which is kind of expensive for

01:42.540 --> 01:44.760
a wireframe tool.

01:44.820 --> 01:50.550
There are other services out there that are cheaper but unfortunately I'm not aware of any that are

01:50.550 --> 01:51.840
free right now.

01:51.840 --> 01:57.900
It used to be the case that Mockingbird was a free wireframe tool that was available and I originally

01:57.900 --> 02:05.670
planned on making a lecture on that if you guys really do want me to do a lecture on another wire framing

02:05.670 --> 02:08.310
tool that I'm not unaware of.

02:08.310 --> 02:12.390
Just make sure the message me and let me know and I'll put it out there because I prefer if you guys

02:12.390 --> 02:16.580
have a free version but currently I just simply don't know of version.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.690
So let's just dive right into it.

02:19.710 --> 02:20.390
All right.

02:20.550 --> 02:22.810
This is what balsamic looks like.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.490
Pretty simple.

02:24.750 --> 02:33.630
You have essentially designs up at the top and these represent kind of all of the common elements that

02:33.630 --> 02:39.720
you'll be using in a web site or a mobile application wireframe you want to do mobile with a section

02:39.720 --> 02:40.810
for iPhone.

02:40.980 --> 02:42.810
You want to do.

02:42.890 --> 02:47.420
Let's see if you want to make a form go to forms and have everything right here that you need.

02:47.700 --> 02:52.400
Now what you simply do is you would drag and drop it into the canvas down here.

02:52.470 --> 02:54.630
And this is the canvas.

02:54.950 --> 02:55.490
So here we go.

02:55.490 --> 03:01.530
He's a button you can scale it just like any other type of design application to make the button look

03:01.650 --> 03:03.880
like whatever you want.

03:04.470 --> 03:11.280
So one of the things about bosonic that I will admit is negative is that they put everything into sections

03:12.120 --> 03:15.240
and sometimes it's actually kind of difficult to find things.

03:15.450 --> 03:19.950
That's something that I've kind of experienced so what the remedy for this is I get better at learning

03:19.950 --> 03:21.370
the names of everything.

03:21.480 --> 03:29.550
So you can search for it like for instance if you wanted to make say a Facebook share button.

03:29.670 --> 03:29.970
OK.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.530
How would you do that.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.220
So do you have a button.

03:33.330 --> 03:38.310
But there's no way that this really could represent a Facebook share button the way you actually have

03:38.310 --> 03:40.820
to do it as you have to look for an icon.

03:41.030 --> 03:44.920
So just look for icon an icon and text label or just go with Icon.

03:44.920 --> 03:50.860
We go with the text label so here you go it gives you a blank space and a name.

03:51.430 --> 03:57.790
And now if you want to bring an icon at this little user interface chip pops up and you can search for

03:57.790 --> 04:02.640
it or you can click this button to open their icon library.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.510
Now this loads.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.460
This is what their icon library looks like.

04:06.460 --> 04:09.950
They have tons and tons of things in here.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.320
Let's see there's the Reddit icon on YouTube.

04:15.940 --> 04:17.950
Pretty much anything you could think of.

04:17.950 --> 04:22.600
And they're all kind of in this quirky kind of sketch style which is very popular.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.040
So if I want to do Facebook and you couldn't find it you could either just go to social or you could

04:27.040 --> 04:32.430
search it down here it is Facebook all right.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.020
And then you can change the name but just double tapping.

04:35.280 --> 04:43.210
And we'll just say now we can just share whatever doesn't look exactly like what it would look like

04:43.300 --> 04:44.340
on an actual application.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.480
But that's not the point.

04:45.520 --> 04:50.140
You just want to convey to your designer conveyed to a developer what exactly you want in the area.

04:50.260 --> 04:51.940
They'll deal with the rest of it.

04:51.940 --> 04:52.240
All right.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.720
Now if you wanted to add text is another tricky part.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.990
This is one kind of tackling this up front.

04:58.100 --> 05:04.690
I wanted to add tax there is a section called text can also search for text search for tax though you

05:04.690 --> 05:06.220
know this is a little confusing.

05:06.220 --> 05:13.560
I just want to make a line I just want to type something you notice over here a section called tax.

05:13.690 --> 05:18.630
You just need to know this it's actually string label or string of text.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.780
Drag and drop it in.

05:19.860 --> 05:25.330
Now you have some text I can type whatever I want some text now with some text.

05:25.330 --> 05:27.360
This is how you would modify it.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.470
And this goes for pretty much any element you put on your canvas.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.990
Your button can pop up and to be able to edit it over here.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.460
Same with our icon.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.630
Same with the virtual the same features.

05:38.650 --> 05:44.840
Well pop up over here if you want to copy whatever you made Here's a duplicate Here's a cut.

05:45.670 --> 05:49.120
And here is your copy paste and you can trash it.

05:49.270 --> 05:51.390
We'll get to grouping here in a second.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.690
Now I've created some text.

05:53.840 --> 05:58.900
And what I want to do with it I can change the orientation here.

05:59.110 --> 06:04.780
I can use this state in state just means that if I know normal disabled if I disable it.

06:04.840 --> 06:11.470
Well that basically means is that when I go and save my boss because a PTF or PFG or JPEG or whatever

06:11.920 --> 06:13.040
it's not going to show up.

06:13.060 --> 06:20.020
And so this can be helpful sometimes if you're copying large bits of wireframe over and using them over

06:20.020 --> 06:23.890
and over again and sometimes you just want to disable it or sometimes you want to disable something

06:23.890 --> 06:28.050
just so it helps you see something else that it might be covering.

06:28.060 --> 06:30.360
But if you want it to happen you want it to be there.

06:30.370 --> 06:36.250
Make sure that it's checked as normal link you can link to another link to a web page.

06:36.430 --> 06:41.380
You can turn this into a link so that when you save it as a PDA person it hasn't clicked it and it can

06:41.380 --> 06:43.130
take them somewhere here.

06:43.150 --> 06:47.890
Regular text editing features you can make it bold italic underline etc. that set or here's where you

06:47.890 --> 06:49.180
change the size.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.340
You can also change your size over here.

06:51.670 --> 06:55.780
I prefer not to play with this but this is a much more exact.

06:55.840 --> 07:03.300
This will resize it in a way that you kind of can't really get when you're picking just these increments.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.500
So I would typically stick to this.

07:07.170 --> 07:12.080
What will happen oftentimes is see how it went from some text to some because I went to large.

07:12.080 --> 07:19.180
I can open the container the container large enough to show what the actual content in the element is.

07:19.300 --> 07:27.730
If you want to duplicate items you will do as you can duplicate or creates a copy of it when you move

07:27.730 --> 07:34.660
things around it will show you grid lines relative relative to whatever else is on your canvas.

07:34.720 --> 07:46.590
Now if I wanted to say Copy two things you could hit the key and select both.

07:47.540 --> 07:55.670
Now if I had duplicate it's going to duplicate both the interesting one thing that what will happen

07:55.670 --> 08:03.000
also is if I am duplicating an item and it's notice it's a pattern and there are online duplicate this

08:03.020 --> 08:04.940
it should show below it.

08:06.530 --> 08:06.800
All right.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.960
Well sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't.

08:10.070 --> 08:10.330
OK.

08:10.370 --> 08:11.550
There you go.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.720
And you keep doing that all day.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.580
System isn't totally foolproof.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.520
You'll notice that it has some quirks to it.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.510
But the point is it's still very simple and easy to use.

08:24.550 --> 08:32.440
Do you include links to text show link makes something look like a link type in your link.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.410
I can show you some of these other things.

08:34.670 --> 08:39.890
This is called bread crumbs bread crumbs of the things you expect to see at the top of a Web site that

08:39.890 --> 08:43.850
shows you you know where in the sub page of the website you are.

08:43.850 --> 08:49.790
I don't usually include those unless I'm trying to be really specific with my wireframe if you want

08:49.790 --> 08:56.280
to make a point to make a wireframe for a mobile application.

08:56.390 --> 08:57.490
You just start right here.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.320
Go to iPhone and iPhone.

09:00.320 --> 09:06.930
You have right here an actual iPhone again and has that kind of goofy sketch style to it.

09:07.310 --> 09:14.560
So on the iPhone you'll notice that you can expand it make it larger but it has a minimum should have

09:14.560 --> 09:15.300
a go.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.340
So I can't make a guinea iPhone.

09:18.370 --> 09:20.800
It will always be proportional.

09:20.920 --> 09:25.770
But regardless and there's also a maximum size that you'll hit something like.

09:26.180 --> 09:30.980
And then what you can do is you can kind of make screens of your mobile application if you want.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.470
There's some easy to use things that pop these in here like there's an iPhone keyboard and I can put

09:36.470 --> 09:42.200
together a quick alert screen and then whenever you're trying to edit something with balsamic it might

09:42.200 --> 09:44.160
look like it's not particularly polished.

09:44.150 --> 09:48.020
That's kind of the design they're going for but you'll notice that like for instance how do I change.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.330
Alert alert Texaco's here.

09:49.340 --> 09:50.370
No and Yes.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.970
And notice that there's three lines.

09:52.990 --> 09:58.400
And so anything I do on the second line is going to modify the subtitle of the letter and then I modify

09:58.400 --> 10:02.990
in the top line is going to modify the talk line and you get the point.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.840
Third the third one will change the buttons.

10:05.840 --> 10:15.320
Now if I wanted to go ahead and make multiple screens of this there's two ways of doing it I could go

10:15.320 --> 10:19.110
to the bottom and create a new mockup.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.320
So you do as you click.

10:21.500 --> 10:27.320
So that'll create a new screen and I can go go and create a new screen where you can also do is go up

10:27.320 --> 10:34.670
to file and then do new clone of current markup.

10:34.910 --> 10:38.800
OK so now you see that we've moved to a new page with the exact same thing.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.140
So that's one way of doing.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.920
Showing incremental changes.

10:42.150 --> 10:48.740
Sometimes you can do is you can show one screen write some text over here explaining it and maybe you

10:48.740 --> 10:52.530
want to have multiple screens of the same kind of design with tacks next to it.

10:52.550 --> 10:55.290
There's a lot of ways you can use this.

10:55.730 --> 11:00.220
You can also just so I will not say that because I don't want it.

11:00.710 --> 11:02.770
Well you can also do is if I want to copy this.

11:02.930 --> 11:08.000
And typically when I make wire frames I'll be honest I actually make a lot of them all within the same

11:08.000 --> 11:08.990
canvas.

11:08.990 --> 11:13.190
And the way that you would just do it is you just build out to one side or build down because it's an

11:13.190 --> 11:15.350
infinite canvas.

11:15.410 --> 11:20.780
So what I could do is if I wanted to copy everything here we're going to select everything with shift

11:20.780 --> 11:24.220
key Okay.

11:24.490 --> 11:27.910
And then I can copy it just duplicate everything.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.930
Now I have another one.

11:31.420 --> 11:37.480
One thing that I think is quite useful is this thing called the group where you can use in group and

11:37.510 --> 11:38.190
ungroup.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.150
So say I want all three of these things.

11:42.150 --> 11:46.400
I made the iPhone the alert message and the keyboard to be associated together.

11:46.780 --> 11:52.510
What I might do is just lock them together so that I don't have to constantly hit shift and click every

11:52.510 --> 11:57.060
single thing I can just group them together and see how the color change happens.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.330
So now I can exit out.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.190
I don't need to select it.

12:01.370 --> 12:05.110
Oh sorry.

12:06.010 --> 12:09.240
Out clicking outside the canvas click it.

12:09.370 --> 12:12.720
And look now I can move the whole thing as it was here.

12:12.790 --> 12:15.510
I can only move one thing.

12:16.330 --> 12:17.910
One thing that you can do.

12:17.920 --> 12:24.190
And guys keep in mind you really don't need to make this look to the TV purrfect when you make a balsamic

12:25.050 --> 12:26.230
wireframe.

12:26.500 --> 12:32.390
What I like to do is I'll make arrows and we typically with arrow you call it a shape.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.810
It use a geometric shape.

12:34.810 --> 12:39.060
So it starts out as a circle.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.950
Here again is one way to do it.

12:43.890 --> 12:48.860
All I can do like that and I think that looks kind of cool because what you do is you can look at it

12:48.860 --> 12:49.820
and go oh.

12:49.820 --> 12:53.480
First screen second screen right.

12:54.080 --> 13:04.030
Or obviously you can just do it with an icon an icon over and let's make an arrow out of it.

13:05.650 --> 13:13.180
Search for arrow shows any direction or direction or what you want to make the larger Go sell on it

13:13.810 --> 13:14.360
go.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.980
Now you can't miss it.

13:16.690 --> 13:17.870
OK.

13:18.460 --> 13:25.840
That is I mean Bosnak is like saying very simple so there's not a ton of explanation that needs to go

13:25.840 --> 13:26.570
with this.

13:26.740 --> 13:32.200
And you might be looking at this and saying wow it is really basic How am I supposed to make a web site.

13:32.270 --> 13:37.000
And you know at first it is a little bit complicated but you'll notice the more and more you play with

13:37.000 --> 13:37.120
it.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.040
It really does have everything you want covered.

13:40.240 --> 13:46.440
So to prove my point I can go ahead and make a web site.

13:46.600 --> 13:53.710
I'm going to make a copy of YouTube and YouTube and I speak out for utrum I'm not talking on the home

13:53.710 --> 13:58.300
page and talking about what the screen looks like when you're actually viewing a sub page.

13:58.300 --> 14:06.070
So I would go to all the browser window in the browser window I can type in you too.

14:07.320 --> 14:07.850
And there you go.

14:07.850 --> 14:10.260
See that shows it up in YouTube.

14:10.730 --> 14:16.310
It's expand the sun's.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.780
OK.

14:17.830 --> 14:21.910
Now let's make something like where you'd watch the videos.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.230
Is the media player in the media.

14:24.520 --> 14:29.350
Now media is where you're going to insert pretty much anything you want like that be associated with

14:29.350 --> 14:30.360
images.

14:30.480 --> 14:34.380
A progress bar has a street map so pull this out seeing see it.

14:34.390 --> 14:37.000
That's like a Google Maps street map.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.480
Here's a video player.

14:41.930 --> 14:48.040
To say that this is you know where you watch videos.

14:48.410 --> 14:51.680
So let's say we got to put a search bar at the top.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.150
You can use the search bar.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.030
That's what's called a search box.

14:55.410 --> 15:01.420
At the top where you would be searching for your videos.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.460
Let's see.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.960
I love this about bosonic.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.550
You can just use icons and they have a lot of the logos that you would commonly use like they have the

15:14.550 --> 15:21.810
Twitter logo and the Instagram logo and pretty much everything you'd want for the most common social

15:22.500 --> 15:27.910
platforms that like now am or logo YouTube.

15:28.110 --> 15:33.060
It's like that little section over here where it shows you suggested videos.

15:33.060 --> 15:39.750
Now what I would do for that sensor thumbnails I use an image images just like boxes which is perfect

15:39.750 --> 15:46.270
for what we want to just call of videos that are developer graphic designer knows what that is.

15:46.650 --> 15:56.310
Now with Image placeholders what you can do is you can add borders and you can actually upload images

15:56.370 --> 16:03.620
and insert them into balsamic So you do as you just double tap it or browse for a file.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.770
Everybody loves cats.

16:04.890 --> 16:05.840
So we use cats.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.210
This is a cool feature I like.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.810
You can just sketch it.

16:08.850 --> 16:13.200
So if I don't get it it's an insert this image with all color is going to look kind of weird the whole

16:13.200 --> 16:14.700
black and white thing going on.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.880
So I'll just say sketch it.

16:16.870 --> 16:18.800
So I say load now.

16:18.870 --> 16:19.710
There goes.

16:19.730 --> 16:25.370
Now let's try to put it back into the size that you'd expect.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.810
So it looks weird.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.310
Now we're going to put let's put a border on it and it'll look better.

16:30.310 --> 16:31.120
There you go.

16:31.380 --> 16:34.660
Now looks kind of like one of those videos you'd have suggested to you.

16:34.710 --> 16:38.420
Now it's out the text that you would go next to it.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.930
So again this is how I do it.

16:40.960 --> 16:44.480
String string attacks.

16:44.700 --> 16:45.990
Put it as the title

16:50.250 --> 16:51.160
Cananea.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.390
Super super original.

16:53.860 --> 17:00.130
And since it's the title I want to make it bold it's increased the size of it.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.040
Now you can use your keyboard to move things around.

17:07.040 --> 17:15.210
So if I just go left to do one pixel left right up down point and then right below that.

17:15.330 --> 17:18.890
See now I want a tax right below it I want to do it duplicate.

17:19.340 --> 17:24.620
Put it right below it this change it.

17:24.650 --> 17:34.660
It's called By just call it the cat person the person because everybody knows a cat person but nobody

17:34.660 --> 17:37.370
knows a cat person person.

17:37.580 --> 17:48.440
The animal make it smaller from the bolding and you go and lets put a view counter.

17:51.570 --> 17:52.980
That's usually just a number.

17:52.990 --> 18:00.250
So let's say a million people watch this video and that is a little bit smaller.

18:03.130 --> 18:04.290
I think it's pretty believable.

18:04.330 --> 18:08.770
So what I'm going to do is I want to create this little grouping and I want to make it go all the way

18:08.770 --> 18:12.740
down the screen which is typically what you see in YouTube.

18:12.910 --> 18:21.000
We do it in a group these together and how we do group we that group.

18:21.070 --> 18:26.380
Now they're together now now when I copy my group and even exit out it doesn't really matter.

18:26.410 --> 18:36.730
Coffee my group La you smashed the grids up and you lose their suggested videos.

18:36.930 --> 18:43.200
Now maybe I wanted to put a container around that something light and just go to shape again.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.220
How a shape.

18:46.220 --> 18:51.450
I am just going to pick a rectangle right here right here.

18:54.010 --> 18:57.960
I want to expand it over to notice I it covered it.

18:57.960 --> 19:02.920
Now the bosonic has a layering kind of like Photoshop.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.480
You use Photoshop for it has layers.

19:05.580 --> 19:12.620
The way that you would want this to fade to the back is you would use this little subgroup.

19:12.690 --> 19:14.500
This will send it back one.

19:14.510 --> 19:18.040
This will send it all the way to the back so this will be the bottom of your.

19:18.050 --> 19:20.600
Imagine this is kind of like paper laying on top of each other.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.810
This would be the bottom piece of paper you could test if you could.

19:23.820 --> 19:27.350
This is going to bring it all the way to the top so it's going to cover anything behind it.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.810
I just wanna send it back.

19:28.850 --> 19:31.910
Intel it's behind the cat videos.

19:33.740 --> 19:39.640
But it's in front of the actual background that we established.
