Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.790
And today we're talking about types of joins now joins our operations that are performed on tables in

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.280
relational databases.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:22.890
So you would perform them in as well Microsoft as well and Oracle and Maya skill in many different platforms

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.850
where the data is stored in a structured format.

6
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.340
So let's have a look at some Joines and understand how exactly they work to start off with.

7
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.570
Let's assume that we have two tables table A and Table B.

8
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.170
And in our example table A will have the following rows.

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.780
It's got three columns.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.840
Customer gender and age.

11
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.330
And it's basically a table that is describing our customers.

12
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.760
So we've got five customers.

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.990
Adam Benjamin Jack Nick and Susan we've got their genders listed and their ages.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.160
Now if we go to Table B it's a table of employees of a certain store of our store basically.

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.650
So it's got the employee name the title and the wage.

16
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.290
And so what are we going to try and do.

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.870
And we're going to try and find out which of our customers are also our employees so basically where

18
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.860
where do we have matching rows in these two tables and how are we going to do that.

19
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.450
Well basically if we look at the tables we can see right away that Jack and Susan both appear in the

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.060
customer and in the employee tables.

21
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.780
So how do we do this from an skill perspective for basically from a jointing perspective.

22
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.160
Well if we start off with an inner join then let's have a look at how it will work.

23
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.180
An inner join will take the two tables and we'll look at only their intersect so basically if we're

24
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.100
joining our tables on customer equals employee then and it's an intern join then the remaining rows

25
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.990
will only be the matching rows.

26
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.740
So in this case Jack is matched with Jack and Susan is matched with Susan because we're just looking

27
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.390
at the customer column in the left table and at the employee column the right table.

28
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.810
So once that matching is done the rest of the rows which haven't matched are discarded and the remaining

29
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.890
table looks like this.

30
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.070
So it only has those rows that match and kind of glues them together and that's it.

31
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.180
That's what's the result of an inner join on these two tables would look like.

32
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.090
Now let's have a look at the left join.

33
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.840
So there's a few different types of joins.

34
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.060
Now we're going to proceed to the next one we call the left outer join.

35
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.370
And in short it can also be called the left join.

36
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.100
So Elif joined basically says that the primary table is the one on the left.

37
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.800
Once again we're joining on the first column of the first table customer equals to the first column

38
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.570
or the second table which is in play.

39
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.390
And since the Left table is the primary one rows cannot be discarded from the left table rows will only

40
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.910
be discarded from the non-primary table so here Jack is matched with Jack.

41
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.670
Susan is matched with Susan again.

42
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.000
And then the rest of the rows in the second table are discarded because they didn't have a match and

43
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.200
so the resulting table will look like this where there was a match.

44
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.700
The rows are glued together.

45
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.760
And where there was no match the associated columns left blank or some in scale basically those columns

46
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.040
will be Nolt.

47
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.540
So let's just keep them blank for now.

48
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.490
That's whole left join works.

49
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.060
And basically the main idea here is that the table in the left of the join is considered to be the primary

50
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.520
table and therefore rows cannot be discarded from the table.

51
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.450
Now let's have a look at a right join a right join works in a very similar way but on this in this case

52
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.910
the table on the right is the primary table.

53
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.690
So once again Jack has much to Jack's isn't as much as Susan and the rest of the rows in the left table

54
00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.010
are discarded because it is the secondary table it's not the primary rows in the primary table.

55
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.130
On the other hand cannot be discarded.

56
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.750
So the final result here is a table which looks like this.

57
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.480
Once again the two sets of columns have been glued together and where there was no match on the left.

58
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.860
The values in the columns are left blank or Lord.

59
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.540
And finally let's have a look at a full outer join.

60
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.280
So in a full outer join we'll looking at the union of the two tables or below probably unions not the

61
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.850
right word.

62
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.390
We're looking at all of the rows in the two tables and that's why you see those those two circles in

63
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:37.410
the Venn diagram up at the top of full the yellow and that means that we cannot discard or the join

64
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.440
will not discard any of the rows in any of the two tables.

65
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.490
Once again we're looking for matches So Jack is matched with Jack.

66
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.150
Susan is Masche with Susan.

67
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.500
And then what happens is no rows are discarded and the tables are glued together.

68
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.640
And that is what the final result looks like.

69
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.070
So on the right there is blank spaces where there was no match to the table on the left and on the left

70
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.310
there is blank spaces where there was no match to the table on the right.

71
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.990
So once again I'll just go back to the a slide and here you will see the two tables separately and now

72
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.120
off to the join.

73
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.280
This is what the final table will look like.

74
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.360
So that's how a full outer join works.

75
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.440
And just quickly recap on the types of drawings that we discussed.

76
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.650
So we had a look at four different joins the inner join which only looks at the matching rows.

77
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.340
The Left join which keeps the left of the table on the left as the primary table the right join which

78
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.490
keeps the table in the right as the primary table and the full join or the full outer join which does

79
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.150
not discard.

80
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.160
And euros from any of the tables.

81
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.210
So in your work you're probably going to be using inner joins and left joins mostly and that is because

82
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.840
right joins are rarely used simply because are-I join is the same as a left join just the tables you

83
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.150
just have to switch the tables around.

84
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.750
So put the one on the right on the left and the one that was on the left on the right and you'll get

85
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.620
a left join.

86
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.910
Again so most of the time and personally I use inner joins and left joins.

87
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.260
Sometimes you'll rarely find that people do require full joins for the task at hand.

88
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.290
So those were the type of joins and that brings us to the conclusion of today's tutorial and I'll see

89
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.830
you next time.
