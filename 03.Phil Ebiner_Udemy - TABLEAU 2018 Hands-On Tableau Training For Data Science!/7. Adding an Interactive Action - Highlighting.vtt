00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.320
Hello welcome back to the course on Tablo and the previous tutorial we looked at action filters in dashboards

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.560
and today we will look at how we can apply highlighting to dashboards and also we will discuss why highlighting

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.830
is actually different to filtering.

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.180
So let's get straight to it.

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.840
Here we've got the dashboard that we're using last time and still we've got the filter on the actual

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.050
filter is still applied.

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.510
So when we click on different states as you can see the scatterplot is adjusting automatically to to

8
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.240
just show the customers that reside in that specific state.

9
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.060
So now what we will do is we will go to dashboard actions and we will remove this action that we created.

10
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.360
So we just click Remove.

11
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.900
OK.

12
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.690
Now if we select the different states nothing happens to the scatterplot.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.050
No the goal today is we want this sort of filtering this scatterplot we actually want to see the customers

14
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.560
highlighted so we want all of the dots to remain but only the relevant dots to stand out so that we

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.480
know how they compare to the rest of the customers on the scatterplot.

16
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.350
And so the first thing that you might want to do is you go to dashboard actions and you go to action

17
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.340
and you click highlight and here naturally you select map of Europe select and the target sheets or

18
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.460
customers kind of world map of Europe and pretty much the same thing as we did with filtering.

19
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.550
You click OK you click OK and then you click on a state and nothing happens and they go another step.

20
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.910
Nothing happened and so on.

21
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.620
So how come did filtering work but highlighting doesn't work.

22
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.440
What is the difference.

23
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.140
And this is an important point which a lot of people kind of don't will disregard.

24
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.920
Basically they don't see the difference and therefore sometimes can fall into this trap assuming that

25
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.920
highlighting works just as filtering but it doesn't filter the worksheet it actually just highlights

26
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.850
the values.

27
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.150
In reality it's not as simple as that.

28
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.350
There there's one main difference between the two and that is that filtering actually filters your data

29
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.300
set and therefore allows you to reconstruct the scatterplot.

30
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.410
So when I have filtering on and I select this state what happens in the background is Tablo selects

31
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.560
all the rows of the data that are relevant to this state in France which is ILDA France and it only

32
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.990
leaves them and then it removes all the rest of the rows in our data set that have nothing to do field

33
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.860
of France.

34
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.870
And so then the scatterplot is only working with the IL de France rose.

35
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.750
And it is able to create a scatterplot based on the information.

36
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.210
Now what happens with highlighting is that the data set is actually not filtered.

37
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.660
So that process is not running in the background you're not deleting any or temporary deleting any rows

38
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.220
from the data set which you're asking dashboard to do is plot everything.

39
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.190
And at the same time highlight the customers that are relevant or related to difference and that is

40
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.710
where the problem occurs and why is that.

41
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.820
Well that is because some of our customers and our daughter said are actually from many different regions

42
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.650
so they are customers that are ordering products both in France and in the U.K. and so on.

43
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:49.570
So one customer in this particular data set is not attached to one particular state or even country.

44
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.660
If you look through the data set you will find cases when customers are in different states countries

45
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.050
and even cities states and even countries.

46
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.730
So let's have a look at that quickly.

47
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.360
So here's our data set.

48
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.610
Let's quickly add a filter so Data Filter and order the data by the customer name.

49
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.190
So here you can see that right away Aaron for instance has ordered from Italy from the U.K. from Germany

50
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.340
from Netherlands from France.

51
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.860
And then let's say Adam here has order from Italy U.K. France and so on.

52
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.910
So there are multiple customers that have ordered from multiple different regions and that is what is

53
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.460
confusing or highlighting.

54
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.820
So where do we ask the dashboard to highlight everybody who has ordered from France.

55
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:50.080
It cannot just highlight for instance if we go look at Erran should should Tablo highlight Aaron or

56
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.430
should Tablo not highlight Aaron he has ordered from France.

57
00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.010
But in that case if Tablo does highlight Aaron in this in the scatterplot what will happen is that we

58
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.860
will see his total profit so here you can see that we've got profits listed sales and the profit margin.

59
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.900
This is Max Llodra.

60
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.330
But for Erran it will be the same thing what will happen is we will see the profit the sales and the

61
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.900
profit margin for all of his orders that he did from all the regions and that is because once again

62
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.420
our daughter is not going to be filtered so the rose not relevant to Ildefonso are not going to be removed

63
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.000
from the DOD.

64
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.560
There's still going to be scatterplot.

65
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:35.960
And that is confusing Tablo So how can we highlight Aaron with his two French orders or maybe there

66
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.800
is two.

67
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.110
So this is Aron and he's made two orders from France.

68
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.670
But at the same time he's had a lot of orders from other places so if we highlight him then we will

69
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.950
be giving the user the wrong information.

70
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:54.340
We will be telling him that Arron's made this many orders altogether but in reality only two of them

71
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.200
are from France.

72
00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.320
So that's why Tablo chooses not to highlight our own all in order not to mislead the user.

73
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.560
So what we can do in this case is we can actually change the granularity of our scatterplot in order

74
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.190
to include the state and that way Tablo will be able to easily operate at that level.

75
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.280
So let's go to the customers kind of pluck.

76
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.650
You can simply go to the worksheet here or you can click this button over here which is go to a worksheet

77
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.260
or you can click this button over here which also says go to a worksheet.

78
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.610
So once we're at the worksheet for the customer scatterplot what are we going to do is we're going to

79
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.680
change the granularity of the daughter.

80
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.440
Right now if you look at the bottom there's 617 marks.

81
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.420
Now what we're going to add is the state.

82
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:49.270
So we'll just drag state into detail and right away you can see there's more marks in fact if we go

83
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:57.610
down here now there is 1067 marks and that is because customers can be duplicated here if they are present

84
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.890
in multiple states.

85
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:07.330
So now when we go back to the dashboard we can see that once again there's more data here but also when

86
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:14.980
we click you can see that Tablo is easily highlighting the right data points here because it knows that

87
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:22.330
it needs to highlight all of the customers that purchased from this region or let you know made their

88
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.560
orders from this region.

89
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:30.370
And if they are customers that had orders from multiple regions it will only take those data points

90
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.860
that are relevant for those customers for these regions.

91
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.760
And so now Tablo is doing a great job in highlighting.

92
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:43.000
If we go to dashboard and we go to actions highlight and we click Edit you will see here that you can

93
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.670
actually select the target highlighting and you can select the different field.

94
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.530
So in this case we want what is happening is tabloid's highlighting by state.

95
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.820
So if we click OK that will basically be the same result as what we saw just now.

96
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:08.080
Probably one more thing is that you can adjust this highlighting so you can specify the rules here so

97
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.190
you can say Don't halide by state by how I by country.

98
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:16.540
And that way wherever you click in the country it will be highlighting the same customers that once

99
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.420
again is misleading because you kind of the users thinking that is highlighting the trouble is highlighting

100
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:29.450
the specific state although the states are all highlighted on this part of the map.

101
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.520
But I would probably stay away from that.

102
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.890
Just you do have that level of control.

103
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.680
In my case I'm just going to keep it all fields.

104
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.890
So there you go that's how highlighting works and that's how it is different to actions.

105
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.350
I mean two filters in trouble action filters and trouble.

106
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.110
So be careful of that action filters.

107
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.800
Just to recap action filters work at the data level.

108
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.800
They filter out the data and then that data is supplied to the rest of the work.

109
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.480
It's a..

110
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.310
And in your Tablo dashboard whereas filters are highlighting.

111
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.530
They don't.

112
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:12.940
Highlighting does not take rose out of the data and therefore it is still working the whole data set.

113
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.880
And so you have to be careful with the level of granularity of your different worksheets in your dashboard.

114
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.200
So there you go.

115
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.720
That is how highlighting works in Tablo.

116
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.270
I look for it see you next time.

117
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.070
And until then happy analyzing.
