Hello and welcome back so of course in Tablo in the Bruce tutorial we learn how to pivot our daughter.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,230
And today we will look at a feature which was introduced in tablet 9 which is called split.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,140
So this split feature allows you to split one column into multiple calls and to be frank it's not very

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,540
applicable in our specific case because our columns look as they should.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:33,540
But I would just want to show you this feature because I think it can be very handy when you have certain

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,170
types of data.

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,350
For instance if you have customer data then you might have a column which has their full name but you

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,750
want to split it into first name and last name and so that can be easily done.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,760
And we'll just have a look at an example with this call and we'll be using the regions call to perform

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,390
this example even though we don't really we actually don't need to do this in this specific data set.

11
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,520
But nevertheless just for argument's sake we'll pretend that this is a name and surname and we will

12
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,210
do what we want to split out the surname out of this data.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,080
So let's assume that the last word so that comes after a space.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,360
In this case America is a surname and everything before that is the first name.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,730
And you just want to split out the last o the surname so in this case would be East.

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,310
In this case are Americans on.

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,140
So you can really easily do that.

18
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,010
All you have to do is once again click this dropdown select split and then say what.

19
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,760
What's a word you want to split off.

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:40,140
So you want to split off the last one word into a column and use a separator which is in our case is

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,140
going to be a space.

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,140
Click OK and there you go.

23
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,260
So you got you got the last words separate separated its own into its own column.

24
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,540
So here you've got oh once again if there's only one word you'll take that word.

25
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,480
But in this case has got America.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,030
This case has got East and so on.

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:06,960
So let's one on one more or you can split or you can split what you can do is you can split all words

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,550
but find all the words are separated by spaces and you'll find all the words.

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,450
So here it is it Europe new members into Europe new members Russia Turkey and other Europe Russia Turkey

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,070
and other Europe.

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,660
So as you can see that's a very powerful feature.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,930
If your daughter is not prepared in the sense that it's got a name and surname for example in one column

33
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,330
and that can be very useful as well not only will excel files like with Excel it's not that hard to

34
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,530
actually go into Excel and perform that split yourself here but sometimes you might be getting data

35
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,910
from a database or from other locations where you cannot make adjustments so before you if you do want

36
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,440
to make adjustments before you send it into Tablo you would have to exported into Excel or some other

37
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,820
software make the adjustments and then then taken a tablet.

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,080
While you don't have to do that anymore now you can just do all of this in Tablo.

39
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,330
So there you go that's how to use the Split function.

40
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,210
And next time we will look at metadata I look forward to seeing you on that tutorial.

41
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,300
And until then happy analyzing.
