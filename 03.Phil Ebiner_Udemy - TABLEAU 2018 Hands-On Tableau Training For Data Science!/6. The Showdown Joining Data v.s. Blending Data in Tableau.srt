00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,560
Hello and welcome back to the Course I'm Tablo.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,500
And in today's tutorial we will be talking about the differences between daughter joining and daughter

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,110
blending to get that topic out of the way once and for all.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,260
And also we will look at when it is appropriate to do a door to blend in Tablo.

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,330
So let's get straight to it.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,930
For today we will need our data set.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,190
We need to go to superdog assigns dot com slash Tablo.

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,490
If you scroll down here to Section 5 joining in blending data you will need the second dhaba set which

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,050
is amazing Mart EU.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,220
Now I won't download it because I already have it.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,970
It's basically the same one that we worked with in Section 4.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,870
So let's open that up and have a look at it.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,430
There it is.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:55,410
So here you can see here you can see that this Stata said has three tabs.

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,800
He talked about it but we'll just quickly recap so the list of orders tells us give us a list of orders

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,520
that had been conducted for the store the date when the order was placed.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:14,050
Customer Name the city country region whether it was a home office that the daughter was placed for

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,860
or it was a consumer or a corporate office.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,560
Different types of customers basically shipping day shipping mode.

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:31,480
And the State of the country order breakdown gives us a breakdown of each order by the product that

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,060
was contained within that order.

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:41,850
So basically this field order idea is not unique in this because sometimes orders have multiple items

23
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,360
within them so here you can see an example that this order had both posted markers and Eldin folders.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,360
And then the discount on the order of the sales the profit not not on the order action on the product

25
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:58,450
the discount on the product the sales and the product profit on the product quantity category.

26
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,640
So whether it was office supplies furniture or technology and subcategory.

27
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,750
So what we will be interested in today is actually this field category it will be important for us.

28
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:17,470
And also we've got the sales target tab which gives us a target for the three different departments

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:26,150
which are furniture office supplies and technology and it gives us the targets for the different months

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,380
of the data set so what the dollar value targets were for each of these departments for a certain month.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:43,640
So that's how data set and what we will be looking to do today is we will want to compare how the departments

32
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,910
are meeting or not meeting their targets.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,920
But the caveat here is that that is not the only thing that we want to visualize So it is only part

34
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,740
of a greater dashboard that we're creating So remember that dashboard that we created previously with

35
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:04,100
the map was showing us different items so I'll just bring it up actually just to so we remember what

36
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,100
we're talking about.

37
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:13,010
So I'll open up Tablo And remember this dashboard here in Section 4 that we created which had the different

38
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,410
maps of the different regions and then how the customers were which customers were profitable which

39
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,230
were profitable and so on.

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:29,060
So we still want to be able to create all of this information but at the same time we want to be able

41
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,180
to analyze how the departments are performing how the different departments are performing.

42
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,500
So let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to close this workbook and we'll start a new one and that's

43
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,670
just because I want every section to be independent so you can just pick up from any section and start

44
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,580
working on it.

45
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,120
So we're going to create a new connection.

46
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:58,020
We're going to create a connection to our excel file and the excel file is amazing aren't you.

47
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,390
And here we've got all three tabs.

48
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,030
So we will recreate the join that we created previously.

49
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:13,220
So basically we obviously we want order breakdown because here it's got the sales and those are the

50
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:21,320
values of the sales and we need to compare the sales to the targets but the order breakdown tab does

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,920
not have information on the date.

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,390
It does have the category which is good but doesn't have the date of the order so we need the list of

53
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,670
orders file so we'll take a list of orders we'll connected to order breakdown that creates an inner

54
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,300
join.

55
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:44,030
And now we have the order date then we have the sale that was generated on that item and we have the

56
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,520
category under which the item falls which is perfect and we still have all this other information that

57
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,990
we need for the rest of the dashboard which we just looked at.

58
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,060
Now the question is how do we add sales targets into here.

59
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,960
And the thing is that we can just simply drag it in and create another join here.

60
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,790
Well it does work but we're actually doing a very incorrect thing by doing that.

61
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,940
And I have created a few slides a few PowerPoint slides just to explain exactly what's going on so let's

62
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,470
have a look.

63
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,930
Here we've got two tables everyone to join so the table A-plus B that we've already created through

64
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:29,160
a join and the table see which is our sales targets table A-plus B has information on order ID has the

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,660
date has some more information has the item within that order has the category within which the item

66
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,980
falls and it has the sales that was generated on the item.

67
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,010
And also of course there's lots and lots of other columns in there.

68
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,720
And as you can see here there are rare instances where the order IDs have duplicated because it might

69
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,670
consist of many items.

70
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,170
So that's how our table looks in the table that we've created.

71
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,250
Table A plus.

72
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,970
Now we've also got Table C which we want to connect or somehow we want to link these two so that we

73
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,210
can compare the sales to the targets.

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,270
But the thing is that the tables see has a very different level of granularity level of granularity

75
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,550
here is not item.

76
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,980
So here the level of granularity is actually at an item level for each individual order.

77
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:27,550
Whereas here the table is much less granular it's it's got a month.

78
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,060
It's got category and has got the target.

79
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:38,700
So what that means is that if we do want to connect these two tables then what will happen is we will

80
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,480
have to roll this table up.

81
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,830
We'll have to roll it up by date and category in order to match this level of granularity.

82
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,890
So basically we will lose information on order ID and we will lose information on an item we will lose

83
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,620
all of the information except for date and category and then we'll be able take the some of the sales

84
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,170
for that specific month for that specific category and compared to target.

85
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,790
And basically that was what it means we're losing all the other information if we're going to roll this

86
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,610
table up and that would have been fine if that is what we were looking for if that is the only thing

87
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,150
that we wanted to compare the total sales for a certain month for certain category to their target.

88
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,390
That would have been fine.

89
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,700
But we can't do that because we still need to create the rest of the dashboard.

90
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,390
Remember that caveat that we need to be able to create the rest of the dashboard so we need the rest

91
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:39,850
of this information so that way we can just roll up the table and join it to this table.

92
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,070
And moreover just going to end this so.

93
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,380
Moreover in Tablo if we were to drug sales targets here it doesn't actually roll the daughter up for

94
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,500
us what it does is just performs an inner join.

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,920
And as you recall when there are many fields suits joining here you can see is joining on category equals

96
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,520
characters on even including month.

97
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,630
And when when that happens it is duplicating lots of rows.

98
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,090
So basically this what just happened here is a whole another mess.

99
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,760
And if we wanted to even perform that rolled up join we would have to work on this a little bit.

100
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:21,150
But the good news is we don't have to do that because we can use a blend and that's exactly what we're

101
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,860
going to do.

102
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:29,520
We're going to see how we can use data blending in order to connect these these two data sources so

103
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,770
now right now we have one data source which is called list of orders plus.

104
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,070
So I'm just going to rename this list of orders plus order breakdown

105
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,440
that's good.

106
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:47,400
And now we're going to create another data source excel and the same file.

107
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,650
But this time only the sales targets.

108
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,880
And now if we go to our sheet you'll see we have two data sources list of orders plus order breakdown

109
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,830
and sales targets.

110
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,070
So remember we talked about blending in the previous tutorial.

111
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,910
Well now we know that blending is a very smart join that can happen on the fly and we're going to take

112
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:15,260
advantage of that we're going to create the visualization that is required through blending rather than

113
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,130
joining.

114
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,470
And we're going to do that in the next tutorial.

115
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,460
And today we're going to finish up on this on the reason why we won't be doing unjoin but rather be

116
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,130
we're going to be doing and blend.

117
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:35,480
And just to recap the reason is that in this particular case we would have had to aggregate our data

118
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,050
set.

119
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,470
We would have had to aggregate our data set and we would lose information.

120
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,930
So basically the level of granularity of the two data sets is different and therefore we cannot perform

121
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,920
a joint.

122
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,240
And so that's one of the reason why you would ever want to do a blend rather enjoyed.

123
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:57,080
And there's also a second reason why you would want to do a join and that is actually a bit more straightforward.

124
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,740
When you are not able to do a join because the data sources are different.

125
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,850
So if for example your other data source is not an X is not the same Excel file but as rather say a

126
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:15,590
CACP file or a tablet or a file or a Microsoft to secure all database or something that if the data

127
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,250
sources are different than Tablo won't let you do it.

128
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,310
And you will have to be blending the data.

129
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,030
So just keep that in mind that there's two reasons why you would want to do a blend.

130
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,960
One is a different level of granularity of the data sets.

131
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:37,940
And number two is the data sets are just basically different types of data sources.

132
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,020
So that's all for today.

133
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:46,280
Hope you enjoy the Tauriel and next time we will create this blend it'll be quite an exciting and very

134
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,390
visual tutorial so I'll look for it and then and until next I'm happy analyzing.
