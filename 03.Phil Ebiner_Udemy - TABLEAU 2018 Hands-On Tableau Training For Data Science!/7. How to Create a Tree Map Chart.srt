Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,560
And today's going to be a very quick tutorial.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,430
We're just going to create one more charge for our segmentation dashboard and this chart will be a trauma.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,850
This tree map will be working with the job classification variable in our data.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,680
So let's go ahead and create a new tab.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,040
We will call this tab job classification.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,870
And now we will start creating our team.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's take a job classification drag it into our workspace and let's take a number of records and

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,310
drag it into workspace.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,860
Now if we use the Show Me functionality we can select tree map from here and once we do that you can

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,220
see a tree map has appeared.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,390
It is funny how it's called the tree map.

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,410
I know it's it's actually boxes.

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,490
There's no trees here.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,880
But nevertheless it's a tree map.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:01,700
So what we want to do now is get rid of this color that's been determined by the total number of records

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,080
in each box.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,880
And instead of that will take jobless classification hold control and drag it into color.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,270
So that's our trauma.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,160
Let's just make it look good now to start off with we're right click some way here and we'll click Format

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,430
change just to bowl to 12.

22
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,340
And bold.

23
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:29,840
And now I also would like to change the colors that go into colors and change them up a bit.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,430
So blue color can stay blue either.

25
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,780
Let's make other green and white collarless make it gray.

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,660
We can really make it white because our background is white but let's make it gray.

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,910
So there's our tree map.

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,630
And now we'll just save all those worksheets.

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,340
And that's pretty much it.

30
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,050
That's how you create trim up there.

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,720
Pretty easy to create.

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,630
What else you could do you could drag this into labels as well.

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:04,880
If you wanted to but we're not going to do that at this stage so we're done with all of all worksheets

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,600
which is great in the next tutorial we will finally start creating our superpowerful dashboard.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,640
I look forward to seeing you then.

36
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,450
And until next I'm happy analyzing.
