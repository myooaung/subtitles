00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,350
Hello and welcome back to the course in Tablo.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,890
And in today's tutorial we're going to install Tablo onto our computer.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,660
So what do we need to install tablet Well the only thing that it will need is a browser so let's go

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,270
ahead and bring that up and where you'll need to proceed to is.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,230
W w w dot Tablo dot com.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,040
Now you have two options here.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,550
You can install Tablo and get a demo version of Tablo.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,530
That's of course if you don't have a full license of tabel already if you have full Les's of Tablo ready

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,580
then you can proceed with the first option and then use your license.

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,810
Otherwise if you don't have a full lessons you can either use a trial version of Tablo.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,410
They provide a 40 day trial or you can use Tablo public which you can get at public dot Tablo dot com.

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,370
So we're going to start with option number one and then I'll explain a bit more about Tablo public.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,380
Now what we need to click is the try and now button up at the top.

14
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:08,480
Once we click that here we can download our free trial and in order to do that we're going to need to

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,600
enter our e-mail.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:19,340
And let's for argument's sake put an e-mail test 2:59 add G-mail dot com and click download free trial

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,510
and now as you can see your Tablo installation has started downloading.

18
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,850
So we're going to cancel this one because I already have Tablo installed on my computer.

19
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:35,630
And also you will notice that there are a couple of versions so the version has been downloaded is the

20
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,440
one that has been recognized for my computer that's a 64 bit Windows version if you need a 32 bit origin

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,810
for when is it going to get here.

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,540
Or if you need the Mac version you can get it here as well but normally the website will recognize the

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,430
correct version that you need and download that one right away.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,480
So there you go and once you have downloaded the installation package just in Seoul Tablo.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,690
So like the 14 day free trial and proceed with the prompt.

26
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,270
After that you will get an icon on your desktop.

27
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,720
Now if you want to proceed with the Tablo public version then you'll need to go to public dot tablet

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:17,480
dot com and tell the public is absolutely free so it doesn't have any limitations in terms of the amount

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,200
of days you can use it for it's a completely free software.

30
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,150
It does have a few slight restrictions for example you cannot create extracts and you cannot save files

31
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,820
directly onto your computer or you'll have to save them onto the public of public server.

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,670
But that is not a big hurdle in terms of completing this course you will be able to totally complete

33
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,160
the scores.

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,230
I've done it myself.

35
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,930
I've created the most complex visualizations in this course using Tablo public.

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,710
And you can totally do that as well.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,980
The public is a very convenient tool.

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,880
It is free and it is often used by people like journalists and professions where they're not facing

39
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,770
any sensitive data where they just want to create some really interesting results that they want to

40
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,720
share of the world.

41
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,680
So the public is a great option.

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,670
I often get asked what is the best way to take this course.

43
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:15,320
If the Tablo trial has expired or if somebody decides that the trial is not long enough Tebbel public

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,860
is a great option to complete this course so I select one of those to either select Tablo I'll be using

45
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,620
Tablo the full version throughout the course or if you like to follow along exactly then.

46
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:34,010
So like the tablet full version if your trial has expired or you just want something that doesn't have

47
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,640
a time limitation go public and you'll be able to follow along with 99 percent of this course as well.

48
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:46,340
And once you've installed Tablo you'll get a desktop I can just like this one so if you double click

49
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,920
it that will bring up Tablo.

50
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,730
And this is what it looks like inside.

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,810
And this is where we'll get to the fun stuff and we'll proceed with that in the further tutorials of

52
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,770
this course.

53
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,120
I can't wait to see it next time.

54
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
And until then happy analyzing.
