00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.660
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo and the various tutorial we combined two data sets using

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.650
a cross database join the first or I said came from an excel file.

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.850
The second one came from CCSB file and now we've got a new data set for the population column available

4
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.650
to us.

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.200
So let's go ahead and proceed back to our cluster analysis and refine it and see if this population

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.020
column can make a difference.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.120
So there we go that's our cluster analysis which Richard duplicate this sheet.

8
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.680
And now we're going to see how we can refine this analysis.

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.820
Now all we need to do is we need to right click Klosters and select Edit clauses so we don't even have

10
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.420
to add this new column population in charge of isolation we don't need to actually see it for it to

11
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.340
be included in the cluster analysis.

12
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.850
Oh to do is drag population into the list of variables for all clusters.

13
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.800
Click here.

14
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.670
And as you can see right away now we have a different picture now based on these three variables.

15
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.630
If you think about it's like a three dimensional modeling exercise that's happening in the background

16
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.910
where Tablo is taking these three variables marking a spin around your population and it's looking at

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700
those three variables.

18
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.780
It's understanding how to best group these observations into clusters based on their proximity.

19
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.000
And then is just translating the result into colors on our two dimensional chart so basically we could

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.040
keep putting in more variables in here.

21
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.350
Same would happen Tablo would group them in a multidimensional space of three or five dimensional ten

22
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.460
dimensional space.

23
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.770
So just basically performing some mathematical calculations to understand what's the best way to create

24
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.420
groups of proximity of these observations and then painting them for us here in colors on our two dimensional

25
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.030
dashboard resolution.

26
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.630
So it's just easier for us to assess.

27
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.240
So that's what's happening in the background.

28
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.520
And now let's have a look at that and the lyrics.

29
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.880
Now we can perform as you can see a very different picture.

30
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.910
Before we had two groups and these elements were part of this bottom group we're here now is Boerum

31
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.440
group is on its own.

32
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.530
Then you've got this yellow group which kind of overlaps of the blue.

33
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.440
So even though for us they overlap these two groups they overlap in some of the orange yellow dots are

34
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.590
above the blue and lose some of the blue are below the yellow inreality.

35
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.980
This is because we don't see that third variable the population and then we'll have a look at a couple

36
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.110
of examples just now of that.

37
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.230
So before we do that what we need to change is the actual representation of visualization So let's go

38
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.550
to shape and change this from a circle to a field a circle and let's increase the size.

39
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.880
Maybe something like that.

40
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.950
And now when collarless said some transparency.

41
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.520
So somewhere like that so we can actually better see what's going on.

42
00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.130
And now let's take population and we'll just put it into detail so that it can.

43
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.680
It comes up when we look at the pop up.

44
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.320
So let's start off is this this bottom set of observations.

45
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.550
So here you'll see that population has about 100000 102 170000 hundred and eight hundred and six hundred

46
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.120
three thousand five hundred nine hundred 9000 so around those numbers have a look at these here.

47
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.930
Hundred twenty six thousand thirty two hundred forty seven hundred twenty eight hundred forty and so

48
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:34.050
on.

49
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.080
So in these or is it also population is higher.

50
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.970
Now let's look at the blue dots blue dots.

51
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.740
Population is 200 171 here 197 200 here 213.

52
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.960
So as you can see the population in the blue dots is even higher than orange and that is how they're

53
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.380
distinct So even though they're close here they're quite proximity high so they're close to each other.

54
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.130
But at the same time they differ in a variable there we don't see on this realisation which is population

55
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.790
and that is how Tablo has assessed that there is actually three groups here.

56
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.070
So the blue the yellow and the red and that is a great great step for us.

57
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.380
So first of all this the fact that this group is separate kind of confirms our thinking that population

58
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.500
does affect revenue so all of these cities they have a population of about 100 or so under a hundred

59
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.330
and ten thousand people and therefore maybe the marketing efforts are not yielding any additional results

60
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.600
whereas these cities they have greater populations and therefore the marketing efforts are actually

61
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.460
maybe there is a correlation.

62
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.810
That is why the marketing efforts are giving us results.

63
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.300
So now that we have these separate groups how do we enhance our analysis.

64
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.490
So yes that's a that's a great start.

65
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.770
But apart from especially seeing that the groups are different what are the differences in the trends.

66
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.100
And in order to look at the trends we're going to try and explain again and again we haven't spoken

67
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.530
about lines in this course this is a more advanced topic it's something for the advanced course and

68
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.690
tabel and if you want to learn more about trendlines you're definitely welcome to check on my advanced

69
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.100
course.

70
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.320
But we'll have a quick sneak peek into trendlines right now.

71
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.070
So all we need to do is take the trend line and just drag it onto the chart.

72
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.090
We're going to take oh we're going to lean a trend line so we can just drag on to chart it will still

73
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.960
create a linear trend line for us and what we can see here are the three trend lines for these three

74
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.850
clusters.

75
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.900
So what you can see for the red line for instance if you Hoeber over it you'll see that the revenue

76
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.420
so the former is at the very top it says that the revenue is zero point ninety four times marketing

77
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.270
spend plus sixteen thousand forty three.

78
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.350
So basically what we're interested in here is this first bit.

79
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.310
So the slope and here it's 94 0.19 for us.

80
00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.660
What that means is that for every dollar of marketing spend their revenue goes up by 94 cents.

81
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.350
So that's even less than by $1.

82
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.400
So basically you're losing money.

83
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.820
This is it.

84
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.330
Don't forget that this is revenue this is not profit.

85
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.470
So basically a marketing spend is going to come out as an expense from revenue if we talk about financial

86
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.040
terms.

87
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.360
But the main point here is that this coefficient is less than one meaning that for every dollar that

88
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.180
you invest into marketing we're in this cluster you're only according to this model you're only getting

89
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:32.190
back what is it 90 What was it 94 cents of revenue whereas for the orange cluster you're getting back

90
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:39.210
seven dollars 32 cents for every dollar invested into marketing the revenue predicted revenue input

91
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.430
or increase in revenue Sandal's 32 for the blue cluster.

92
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.060
Every dollar spent on marketing increases our revenue by $3 and 17 cents.

93
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.090
So that is a very very powerful insight.

94
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.050
And I'll explain exactly why right now.

95
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:05.970
So the the this insight is so useful to us because let's have a look at these expansions that will have

96
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:06.420
been created.

97
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.840
So if I select new here first of all you can see that so many lines are being drawn right now.

98
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.940
And that is simply because tableaus recreating these trend lines for the highlighted features.

99
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.440
So to switch it off we'll just click on one of these trendlines will click EDID trend lines and at the

100
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.110
bottom while just uncheck Shorey Kalka line highlighted or selected data points click OK.

101
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.620
And now it won't recreate the trend lines for the highlighted data points.

102
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:38.010
So now from the dropdown just select new and there you can see our points so you can see that we have

103
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:44.460
one of the new stores was opened and it is in terms of proximity and similarity.

104
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.280
It is very similar to all these red ones that we already have.

105
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.650
So it's been operating for a bit where you know what's the marketing spend is what revenue it generates

106
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.810
and we can see that.

107
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.970
And based on population it kind of falls in this category.

108
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.480
So from that we can drive that there is a high likelihood that if we keep investing into marketing if

109
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.000
we add another thousand dollars or another thousand dollars then not much is going to change because

110
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.360
this trend line is predicting that per every dollar that you add into marketing for this cluster you're

111
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:23.730
only getting 94 cents of revenue and increase in revenue at the same time we've got 5 stores or five

112
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.300
cities were opened that are very similar to the blue cluster.

113
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.820
And for that are similar to the yellow cluster.

114
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:37.530
So the question is out of these 10 which ones would you recommend the CEO to invest money in marketing.

115
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:43.830
So that's that's the question to you maybe pose this video and think about us based on the analysis

116
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.710
that we've performed.

117
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.660
Which ones would you choose.

118
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.140
Obviously it's not the red one right.

119
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.980
Not the red one because it's in a very bad situation.

120
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.150
Would you choose the blue ones or would you choose the yellow ones let's say for example you can only

121
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:59.550
choose three cities which three cities would you choose would be orange ones would they be blue ones

122
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.310
and that's a wonderful attrition of the power of clustering and trend lines when you put them together.

123
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.890
So if we just forget about the Klosters or you and forget about just the trend lines.

124
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.110
Right.

125
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.020
So if you forget about the clusters to start with.

126
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.260
So let's say for instance this remove the trend line and so on are unclick trend line and then Leslee

127
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.960
of the cluster.

128
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.680
So just from here you would perhaps pick one two three.

129
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.070
The top three right because they are generating the most revenue.

130
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.910
These stores or you may say these three because they're generating a lot of revenue but at the same

131
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.250
time they're marking spent isn't that high.

132
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.680
Now if your return the clusters you would probably look at these and you'd say all right so the blue

133
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.050
Klosters obviously higher.

134
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:48.970
So I would still pick stories from more cities from the blue cluster but then if you return to trendlines

135
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.000
Now you can see that even though these are great cities great location.

136
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.590
So if ice like this again you'll see that these are great locations.

137
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.800
They're generating a lot of revenue at the same time.

138
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.980
The trend line is for costing that per every dollar that you add into marketing you're only getting

139
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.550
three dollars of revenue increase.

140
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.530
Whereas with the orange ones even though they're right now they're a bit lower than the blue ones.

141
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.580
They're kind of a lower revenue generating area.

142
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.920
At the same time the trend line what is it for is forecasting is that for every single dollar that you

143
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.820
invest into marketing you getting back seven dollars and 32 cents of revenue.

144
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:38.270
So obviously from this analysis it is pretty evident that the best stores are the cities out of these

145
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.450
halide wants to look at other orange ones.

146
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.430
So if you had to pick three stores or you had to prioritize them in a way that you invest your funds

147
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.610
into them then you would put the orange ones in the first place of course there's the four orange ones

148
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.580
if you have to pick three.

149
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.880
Then you have to do some additional analysis or the CEO might have some additional knowledge about it.

150
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.170
But basically all of these orange ones they're in a great position in terms of what the clusters are

151
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.680
telling us.

152
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.620
And in terms of what the trend lines are telling us.

153
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:13.160
So there we go this is a very powerful analysis that we can perform as you can see we find our clusters

154
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.710
using an external data set which we came up with using just domain knowledge and thinking about how

155
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:26.330
this company operates and based on this we can make a conclusion for analysis that the CRN stores the

156
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:32.630
stores that you would want to invest further in our stores in this orange cluster simply because the

157
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:38.140
