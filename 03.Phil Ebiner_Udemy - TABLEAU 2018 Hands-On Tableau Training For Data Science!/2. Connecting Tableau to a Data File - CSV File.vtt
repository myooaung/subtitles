00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.730
This is Carol and welcome back to the coarsen tablet.

2
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.450
And today will be connecting our data source to Tablo so I'll bring up Tablo.

3
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.300
And this is the data source we're talking about office supplies so we downloaded it in the previous

4
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.970
lecture.

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.770
And normally throughout this course I won't be spending a lot of time on connecting 2.0 so because as

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.770
you'll see it will become kind of a quick thing for us.

7
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.950
We'll be doing it pretty much on the fly.

8
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.060
But today I thought I'd stop on it specifically because we did rush through it kind of last night and

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.150
I didn't have a chance to show you around the connection manager interface so let's go ahead and do

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.840
that as soon as you open Tablo here on the left you have a column called connect and it's got different

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.900
types of files that you can connect to.

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.260
So last time we did an Excel file.

13
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.630
But this time if you have downloaded the cxxviii file see SFE files actually considered a text file

14
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.280
because it's basically text delimited by commers.

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.810
That's why it's called history comma separate values.

16
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.860
So let's click on text file and now we will select our file here office supplies those GSV and we'll

17
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.510
open it up and right away we're redirected to the connection manager for this data source and let's

18
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.320
have a look around here.

19
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.450
So on the left here you've got a directory where the files are located and at the bottom here you've

20
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660
got only one file currently.

21
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.570
That's because we only have one file in that directory.

22
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.370
Later on through the course you'll notice that when we have more files of the same type there will be

23
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.210
more.

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.470
They will all be listed here and you'll be able to select from them.

25
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.770
So here you've got a window where all the files you have selected are located.

26
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.730
So what does that mean.

27
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.610
Well that basically means that you can select many files so I can show example now I can drag another

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.570
one of these into here and right away something happens.

29
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.760
Tablo is trying to find a way to connect these two files and basically join them but we won't do that

30
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.950
now so just click click the red cross here and cancel that.

31
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.210
We will talk about joining data further down in the course.

32
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.420
But just bear in mind that your daughter that you're working with in Tablo doesn't all have to come

33
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.750
from one file it can come from many files or can come from many tabs in a file or it can come from different

34
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.590
types of files.

35
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.750
But once again we will talk about that later on at the bottom here you've got a preview of your file

36
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.830
so certain rows and columns of the files just so that you can have a look and see what you're dealing

37
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.790
with.

38
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.210
And in our case we do have the order date which correctly here has been identified as a date.

39
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.790
So you can see this I can that's a date you can then these are have been identified as text and these

40
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.760
have been identified as numbers.

41
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.060
And here are some more controls which we will talk about in further sections of this course and up top

42
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.410
here.

43
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.580
Also an important part of the connection manager alive or extract connection.

44
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.850
Once again we will have a separate lecture on that and we will understand what the difference is.

45
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.140
And when you would prefer to use an extract.

46
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.900
For now let's just leave it at life.

47
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.260
So everything looks good over here and now we can proceed onto the dashboard so we just have to go here

48
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.740
and we'll talk about all of this in the next section.

49
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.080
I just want to show you here that we have a daughter column.

50
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.150
And here we've got our data source so this little icon is an item that is used to illustrate a database

51
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.290
if we right click on it and click view data you will see our daughter just as we saw in the previous

52
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.140
window the columns can be rearranged here that that is how that happens.

53
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.850
That's that's totally normal.

54
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.490
But this is like a preview of the doors just as we had before.

55
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.450
So that's pretty much it.

56
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.740
That's as easy as it gets to connect to a source.

57
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.560
And before we finish up this lecture I just wanted to show you one more thing so if I want to connect

58
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.140
to more data sources I can always go here.

59
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.730
This is a new feature in Table 9 that you can click just go back to the data source connections over

60
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.370
here or you can just go data new data source and connect from here.

61
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.100
So if you want to connect to another data source you just click this icon over here.

62
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.860
But what we are looking at now is the types of data sources that Tablo can work with.

63
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.710
So as we discussed there's there there's a text file which includes GSV files.

64
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.850
There's access databases.

65
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.190
There's now statistical files so this is a new feature of tabel 9.

66
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.350
You are able to connect to statistical files and as you can see here these are SAS files SPSS files

67
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.550
and even our files.

68
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.060
For those of you who are interested in statistical modeling with our let's have a look what else we

69
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.560
have.

70
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.160
We've got Tablo server files.

71
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.940
We've got Microsoft Microsoft us Asgill server so we will have all of this in the course there's Maia's

72
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.490
Kjeld databases for online use and is Oracle and there's lots of other different types of servers here.

73
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:21.350
So if you are doing for instance Hadoop and big data analytics then you've got pivotal Greenplum databases

74
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.720
postgresql and even have some Sabahan here so as you can see Tablo guys are constantly introducing new

75
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.880
connection to connections to Tablo and trying to keep up to date with the technical trends.

76
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.210
So just even if you don't use any of this just good thing to have you know kind of in mind to know that

77
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.400
tabbouleh is not this too little become obsolete one day it's always changing and it's always adapting

78
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.000
to the market and what's happening.

79
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.470
All right so that's it for today's lecture.

80
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.330
We did connect very quickly we just had a lot of discussions about other things going forward in the

81
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.860
course connection's 2.0 will be much faster.

82
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.110
So there you go and I look forward to seeing you next time.

83
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.700
Until then happy analyzing.
