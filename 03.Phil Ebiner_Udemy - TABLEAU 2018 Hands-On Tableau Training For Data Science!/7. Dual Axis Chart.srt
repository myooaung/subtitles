00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:09,500
Hello welcome back to the course on Tablo in the previous tutorial we did all the ground work in connecting

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,890
to our data sources.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,860
And today we get to do the fun part.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,700
We get to create the visual Zeshan.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,510
So what will we be talking about today.

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,530
Well first of all of course we'll be talking about blending and more advanced blending so you'll see

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,440
a real life example of how to apply blending and get results.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,250
And also you will learn how to do a dual axis chart so well we'll show you how to create a dual axis

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:41,540
charge today which is quite a valuable skill to have in terms of your Tablo dash boarding and creating

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,830
cool visuals.

11
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,900
So let's get straight to it here.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,240
As you recall we have two daughters sets more doors sources list of orders plus order breakdown which

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:58,160
will tell us the dates when certain items were sold or when orders were made and how those orders are

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,370
broken down and of two different items and what's the sales on those items were.

15
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:09,860
And also we have the sales targets data set which gives us the targets for our sales for the different

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,930
departments for the separate months.

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:19,820
So as you recall the level of granularity for these two data sources different sales targets are at

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:28,100
the level of detail of a category and list of orders plus order breakdown are actually at a much more

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,870
granular level.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,780
They are at the level of items which constitute orders.

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:39,260
So let's go ahead and start creating our visual to start off with we're going to want to visualize by

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,290
a month.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,160
So we're going to track the order date into columns and we're going to convert this into month.

24
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,020
So we're already used to that we know what's going on here.

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,240
Next we're going to look for sales so we've got the sales here in the measures and we're going to put

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,820
sales on Charlie Rose And right now that gives us automatically a line chart.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:05,120
But we're going to change that to a bar chart because that is a bit more presented in our case a better

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,720
representation.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
So there we go.

30
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:13,930
It might be a bit in this particular instance about me a bit too cluttered so will make it the reduce

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,790
the size and give some room between the bars.

32
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,170
OK.

33
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,350
So that's our sales for that for every single month.

34
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,890
The total sales for all of the departments.

35
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:34,150
So what else we can do now is we can take the category and drag the category into let's say we can drag

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:41,420
it into color which will give us these bars like the bars in our coloreds into three colors because

37
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,310
of the different categories but we want to visualize the categories separately so we can take categories

38
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:54,310
again and we're going to drag them into rows and this gives us categories separately here.

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,300
Now this is a bit too big to fit in so we'll reduce the size and there you go.

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,820
So there you have how the categories or the different departments furniture office supplies and technology

41
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,290
have been performing since the start of 2011 all the way up to 2015.

42
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:16,550
So what we want to do now is we want to add in the sales targets for these departments and see how they

43
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,490
have or have not been meeting those sales targets.

44
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,320
So where is that data located.

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,910
Well it's located in our second data source cell starting this week on that here right away you can

46
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:33,700
see that familiar Orange Line on the left meaning that this is a potential secondary data source to

47
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,700
us viz. where we have a primary data source.

48
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:44,600
I is Mark here with a blue little checkmark and right away Tablo has already recognized that category

49
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:51,920
is a potential field that it can join these two data sets on because once again the name of the field

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,760
is the same in both data says we have category here and we have category here.

51
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,840
And the reason why this link is already orange not gray is because as you recall category is already

52
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,180
part of our vessels.

53
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,450
So if category weren't in viz. this link would be great.

54
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,850
So we can have a look at that if we just whoops if we just take category out momentarily you can see

55
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:20,720
that the link is great because Tablo recognizes that this field is not a part of the visit Zeshan so

56
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,210
they might not be a need to join in this field.

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,790
So we're going to put category back by pressing controls that.

58
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:28,690
Okay.

59
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:37,170
So how do we get our dates into this or sorry no dates how do we get our targets into this position.

60
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,030
Well first things first we know that our joint has to be performed not only on category but also on

61
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,590
month of order date.

62
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:52,850
And that is because as you recall Sometimes we have to join in many fields and in this particular case

63
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:00,170
the sales targets are set at the month level so they said four categories or for the different departments

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,520
but they're set at the month level.

65
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,430
So let's go back to the data source and have a look here you can see that for every single month for

66
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,720
the category furniture there's a separate sales target for every single month.

67
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:19,090
So therefore when we are joining two or blending to our existing data we have to blend not just a rolled

68
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,900
up category level but also we have to include the month of order date granularity.

69
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:33,160
If we just blend right now with only category as our field that tablet will be blending on what will

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,090
happen is Tablo will as you remember Tablo sends separate queries to each data set.

71
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,460
It aggregates to the required level of granularity and then it brings the data back and blends it.

72
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,010
So in this case what would happen is Tablo would go back.

73
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,390
It would take all of these roles for furniture.

74
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,980
It would roll them up so to take some of the target it would disregard month and would bring back some

75
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,100
of the target for furniture and it would blend into every single row here.

76
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,580
So that's not what we want we can have a look at that.

77
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,510
So if we take target and we're dragged into in here you will see.

78
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,920
And let's just make it.

79
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,280
So if we open up the target control panel we'll just take out the category from color and we'll just

80
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,310
drag it into detail so that it doesn't affect the color.

81
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:28,480
Sure you can see that the target is always the same 620 1000 which is unreal it's not the right target

82
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,830
here it's also the same.

83
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,540
And here is also the same.

84
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,180
So it's not changing month to month.

85
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:40,000
And that is because we're not aggregating at month of order data has been aggregated it's not been considered

86
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,980
as a level of granularity for our chart.

87
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,740
So let's go ahead and fix that as you recall.

88
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:53,990
We can control the blend or the how the blend is being created through this control box here.

89
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:01,210
So we're going to go to data edit relationships and here you can see we've got the automatic field that

90
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,010
has been selected so now we're going to change it to a custom we'll keep category but also we'll add

91
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:14,330
in a new one here we want to use order date but we want to use month of order date and join on Also

92
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,980
month of order date.

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,550
That's good but also month is not just enough because as I remember these are categorical variables

94
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,130
we need to also take the one above month which is year so we have to make sure that the year is also

95
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,290
included.

96
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,300
Others all mix up different months from different years so we'll take your order date on this side and

97
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,660
here we'll also take your order date.

98
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,500
And if we click OK now as you can see there's a link and now the category or the targets have been adjusted

99
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,690
and as you can see they're reflecting what is the reality and we can easily check that.

100
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:56,480
So let's say January 2011 sales target for furniture was 5000 or 10000 dollars.

101
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,350
If we go to the data source sales target for furniture and generally in 2011 was $10000 and is gradually

102
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,140
increasing.

103
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,380
So that is great.

104
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,410
And now let's just quickly change this from a bar chart to an area chart because it looks better like

105
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:11,800
that.

106
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,980
And let's quickly have a look at the different targets that these different departments have set themselves.

107
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,140
So you can see that the furniture department has a very lean year growing target.

108
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,490
So it's basically got a coefficient that every month the sales should increase by a certain amount.

109
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,340
Then the office supplies Department has a quarterly target so every three months the target is different.

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,590
The monthly target is different so they basically review their targets every quarter and adjust them

111
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,540
according basically to Susya not seasonality or expect expected supplies and things like that.

112
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:54,610
And finally the technology department reviews their targets annually and sets them sets the same target

113
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,460
for the whole year so every month we'll have the same target.

114
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,410
So it's very interesting how the different departments have different targets and different ways of

115
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,020
setting them and you can see this right away through the data even without talking to management and

116
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,720
understanding their takes on it right away.

117
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,280
You already have this information.

118
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,450
So that's a very core part of data discovery that is.

119
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,810
The targets below the actuals.

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,610
What we want to do now is we want to combine these charts so we can actually visually compare them very

121
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,130
easily and seamlessly.

122
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,500
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a dual axis chart and it is actually much easier

123
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,400
than it sounds.

124
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,650
So it might be very hard to do in Excel in Tablo it is extremely simple and I'm going to show you right

125
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,580
now how to do it.

126
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,970
So all you have to do is you just right click on your target here and you click dual access and then

127
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,180
one more thing which a lot of people forget.

128
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,000
Very important second step in a dual access chart right away.

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,720
You're right click on this access on the right here and you click synchronize access.

130
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,950
That is very very important.

131
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,410
Because if you don't as you can see right now they're aligned.

132
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,190
So 40000 of the top 40000 at the top here.

133
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:15,430
But if you don't synchronize you like I press controls here so this is synchronized.

134
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,850
This is not synchronized.

135
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,190
You can see that they have separate accesses.

136
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:26,470
And that way you can get really confused and the people reading the chart can get the wrong insights.

137
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,400
So we're going to synchronize access.

138
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,870
Make sure you do that every time.

139
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,730
And that finalizes the process of creating a dual axis chart.

140
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,780
Of course you can make adjustments further down the track but this is pretty much what it looks like.

141
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:46,770
And from here you can get insights into each one of the departments so you can see when they're above

142
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:53,600
the above their target are meeting the target or exceeding it when they're below they're not.

143
00:10:53,610 --> 00:11:01,530
So here again you can see the same thing right now the gray area chart is in front of the Voller bar

144
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:01,770
chart.

145
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,270
We once put it if you want to put it behind we have to just take some target here and drag it to the

146
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,780
left and that'll switch places and as you can see it looks much better now.

147
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,720
The gray chart is behind and you can visually compare for every department to kind of see how they're

148
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,670
performing along the way.

149
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,530
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a bigger.

150
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,070
So the chart looks.

151
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:30,660
So we can see the chart a bit better with bigger bars and increase the size of the bars so go to sales

152
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:38,210
size increase so as you can see that it already looks really good starting to look very good.

153
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,820
That's how you create a dual axis chart and Tablo remember about synchronizing the axes.

154
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,080
It's very important.

155
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,870
And that brings us to the conclusion for today.

156
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:54,500
Next time we will take this chart one step further and we'll introduce a calculated field within the

157
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,730
blend which is a whole different whole separate topic and tabbouleh and it's important to know how to

158
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,360
do that and that will hopefully finalize this chart for us.

159
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,080
So I hope you enjoy today's tutorial.

160
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
I look forward See you next time.

161
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,270
And until then happy analyzing.
