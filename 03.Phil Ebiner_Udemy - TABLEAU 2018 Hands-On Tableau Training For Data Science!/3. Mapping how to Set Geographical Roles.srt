00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,900
And today we will create a map for our data set.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,380
But first things first let's go ahead and save our workbook.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,840
So just press control s and this one is going to be Section 6.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:29,810
So as we usually do what we look for where it map is that little globe I can that we can drag onto.

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:36,280
So the dimension that can drag onto our Tablo workspace and that way the map will be created for us.

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,060
But today we've got a bit of a conundrum.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,710
We don't have the globe icon.

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,330
Everything here is either a numeric value or a text field.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,930
And here as well so we can create a map and moreover we don't have those latitude and longitude measures

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,210
that are usually generated for us.

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,670
So how do we create a map in this case.

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:07,550
Well we know that region is our locational variable here and maybe Let's try dragging that into the

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,590
workbook but once we drag it in nothing happens just creates this table for us.

15
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,230
So how do we create a map in this case.

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:22,770
Well this is a good example of when Tablo doesn't automatically recognize Geographic roles and you have

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,000
to set them up for your workbook yourself.

18
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,410
So we're just going to take that out of our worksheet and now what are we what we need to do is we need

19
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,830
to right click on region and we need to set a geographic crawl so if we go down here this geographic

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,510
roll and we can select what geographic role we want region to play.

21
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,480
So in this case it's cold region in the data set.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,810
But what Tablo recognizes as region is different.

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:57,750
What we are implying on the region in the data set is actually cold state in Tablo because it's different

24
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:05,820
for UK Tablo deems what we call region in the data set it dimsum States so we're going to Slyke state

25
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,370
and now we have a global can and now we have latitude and longitude generated.

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,030
Okay good.

27
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,560
So now we can drag a region into a worksheet.

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,600
And what happens now.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:24,300
Well we see the whole map of the world for some reason and we don't see UK we don't see our customer

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,270
base we don't see anything like it did and just built a map of the world for us but didn't map any or

31
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,730
put anything onto this map.

32
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:38,310
So what else we can see here is on the bottom right there is an indicator showing us that there is four

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,610
unknown values in this geographic classification.

34
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,210
So let's go ahead and look at that.

35
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,420
If you click on the four unknowns and you click Edit locations what you'll find is that England Northern

36
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,740
Ireland Scotland and Wales have not been recognised.

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:02,220
Well this can easily be fixed if you tell Tablo which country there is supposed to be looking in.

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:11,010
The reason is that right now Tablo is looking in Namibia for an unknown unknown reason it's just looking

39
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,910
to maybe have to change that too.

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,640
Obviously to the UK so Tablo knows that these states or provinces are actually located in the U.K. And

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,050
that's where it should be looking.

42
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,230
So we're going to go and find the United Kingdom or here.

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:33,630
Click on that and right away you can see that tablet has now matched them up and click ok here and there

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,210
you go right away we're taken to the map of the U.K. and what we need to do now is we need to change

45
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,300
this from automatic to field map.

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,970
And there you go that's how we created a map of the UK.

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,290
So we will talk a bit more about the errors that can occur when you're creating maps in the next section

48
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,070
of the course and the section on data preparation.

49
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:05,400
But for now that was a good intro and now you know how you create your own geographic roles or assign

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:14,070
your own geographic roles in your data set what we're going to do now is what we want to justice or

51
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,590
add some information to this map.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:25,080
Well first of all we'll just assign random colors for now to our four states so we can see we can see

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,340
them separately.

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,270
So we're just going to take region and we're going to instead of keeping it in detail which is dragged

55
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,280
into color.

56
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:39,480
And now what we're going to do next is we're going to add information we want to see the total number

57
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,030
of customers in each of these regions that we're looking at.

58
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,130
And how do we do that.

59
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,340
How do we add the total number of customers.

60
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,570
Well we don't have a measure which corresponds to the total number of customers but we do have and what

61
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,780
is automatically added to every workbook and Tablo is a field a generated field that counts and a number

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,380
of barrels.

63
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,530
And it's cold number of records and that is a very very powerful tool because in our case we know that

64
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,010
the number of rows is exactly the number of customers.

65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,350
So we can use these generated feel to our advantage.

66
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,080
So we're going to take a number of records and we're going to drag it into label and right away you

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,110
can see the total number of custom has appeared on our map.

68
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,290
So all we have to do now is kind of format it a bit.

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:39,240
So let's go we have 12 and bold let's just kind of reposition these labels so that they're working well

70
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,240
and we can see them well OK.

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,080
And now we will probably prepare our map a little bit for the future.

72
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,720
So if you want to zoom moon you have to pull the out of control.

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,560
We want our map to be as compact as possible so there you go.

74
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,530
And that is pretty much it for the map.

75
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,260
Whoa.

76
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,400
Let's control that.

77
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,910
I just wanted to move this label.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,780
That's very much for the map for now.

79
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,910
So we did assign some random colors and they might not work well if our dashboard when we created so

80
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,890
we'll change those a bit later.

81
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,420
That's all for today.

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,740
In the next tutorial we will start looking at some charts to complement this map and you'll see how

83
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,750
all this is going to be coming together slowly into one amazing dashboard.

84
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,360
So that's all for today.

85
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,820
I look forward to seeing you next time.

86
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,670
And until then happy analyzing.
