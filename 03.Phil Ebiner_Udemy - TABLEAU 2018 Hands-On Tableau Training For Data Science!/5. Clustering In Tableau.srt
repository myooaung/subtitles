00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,290
Welcome back to the course and tell them today we're talking about clustering.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,030
So as we know we have our cities here visualize and we can see the revenue whether it's high whether

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,950
it's low.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,210
That's told by the color and the size.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,970
We can also you highlight the new ones these 10 new ones but we can really tell from here which ones

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,310
we should invest to in terms of marketing which is the best bets so we can probably say that this one

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,990
has a low revenue but at the same time this is not really a story it was Alsation.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,630
So let's proceed to creating a storytelling Weasel's action which create a new sheet.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,680
And here we're going to actually visualize revenue versus marketing spend.

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,650
So revenues are going to be are Y-axis and market spend is going to be our X-axis.

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,350
And as you can see we only have one dot here so we can either disaggregate these dots or their approach

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,880
is to actually use the store ID in detail to change the level of granularity.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,650
And we already know how all of that works in the background so that's always exciting to understand

14
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,850
what we're doing exactly.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:12,470
And as you can see here we've got some points on our scatterplot and in total we have 150 points so

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,320
you can confirm that if you check on the bottom left in the bottom left corner and what we are seeing

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,950
here is every single CD in our data set.

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,390
We're seeing the revenue versus the marketing spend.

19
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,490
So maybe we'll just make these a little bit bigger.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,730
That's a great start.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,860
That is awesome.

22
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,510
And already from here we can tell that there's at least there's there's two distinct groups there's

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,930
a group of cities over here which are kind of performing quite okay.

24
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,200
And then there's some cities here that are not performing as okay.

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,090
And why is that.

26
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,280
Well here we've got marking Spens So as you move from left to right you're increasing the marketing

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,820
spend you're spending more and more.

28
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,160
And here we've got the revenue.

29
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,670
So you would expect that the more you spend on marketing the more revenue you get so for instance for

30
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:06,120
to start with you if you take two cities for example you take this city or the store in the city has

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:13,710
got an idea of 48 or in city this location is 48 basically So working spend is $2000 revenue 16000.

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,310
If you take this city here marking spend 3000 nearly 4000 is $56000.

33
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,150
That makes sense right.

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,390
So when you increase your marketing spend you expect more revenue but then this city of for example

35
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,620
doesn't make sense.

36
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,700
Right so you have a city here which the marketing spend for is $1800 and the revenues 19000 and this

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,510
city market spend is $3900.

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,200
So more than twice as much.

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,860
So this was 1800 these 3900.

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,330
But there are still $19000.

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,820
So if we talk in terms of trends then these cities they might be sharing a certain characteristic that

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,330
they all kind of like.

43
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,470
They're all stuck at this $20000 revenue level and regardless of how much you invest into marketing

44
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,840
it doesn't really change anything.

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,870
So if you invest more you're not getting more return whereas these cities here you can see that there's

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,370
an obvious trend if you invest $2500 you'll get somewhere around 40000 revenue.

47
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,690
If you invest $3500 you invest you get somewhere on $60000 in revenue.

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,940
So as you can see there's two distinct groups and we can actually visually see them.

49
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,070
So that's always a good thing.

50
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,570
But how do we now identify them and politically from a statistical point of view.

51
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,500
And this is where clustering comes into play.

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,520
If we go to the analytics tab on the left here and we scroll down you'll find this option for under

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:47,790
models which is cluster and that will allow you to cluster or create clusters identify clusters in your

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
zeal zation.

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,540
So let's go ahead and try it out.

56
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,510
We'll drag it onto the chart and that's it.

57
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,050
So right away you can see that the variables used are a sum of marketing spend which we have over here.

58
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,110
Some new which is also we're here so the variables that are building obviously just by using them.

59
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,340
Tablo is applying an algorithm called K means clustering.

60
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:19,910
And it is right away building this visualization for us now it's a very quick way to derive very powerful

61
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,670
insights.

62
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,240
So from here we can tell right away so Tablo grouped all of these into one class and grouped all of

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,010
these into one.

64
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,720
So it's big it's quite intuitive right.

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,350
So exactly what we spoke about.

66
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:36,110
We just didn't think that these would fall into that closer but Tablo is using information that it has

67
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,070
on a marking spin.

68
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:44,750
So these variables to identify which are all alike which of these stores of cities are alike that they

69
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,870
can be put into one group and it turns out that these are all alike.

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,570
And these are all alike so they kind of like very close to each other in that sense just by looking

71
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,990
at this viz. in terms of distance.

72
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,990
Right so we can see that these if there is if you're going to identify two groups and this is how Tablo

73
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,850
suggests identify it.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,300
Now that's a great start.

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,730
And we can already derive some insights from here we can say which cities depending on which group you

76
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,830
fall into your city falls into.

77
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,810
You're either deriving a good return on marketing investment or not such a great return marketing investment.

78
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,240
And for instance we can check our cities that we have.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,230
So if we go back to Dora and we look at new expansion put into detail and then we show highlighter.

80
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,970
So now I'm just going to bring the Hayler to the left.

81
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,800
Now what we can do is we can just look at the new cities and you can see them being identified there

82
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,920
so you can see that we've got two cities in the lower group and we've got all these other cities in

83
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,960
the better group.

84
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,060
So this is some preliminary clustering analysis that we've performed and right away we can tell from

85
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,710
here that probably it's better to invest into these cities rather than into these cities because their

86
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,360
return regimen is better.

87
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:06,140
But at the same time what we can see is that this is probably not the final step in our clustering and

88
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,910
that is because we can see that these cities they don't look exactly that they belong to this group

89
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,790
more so they look like they belong to this group and in the future to Charles in the section we'll learn

90
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:23,390
how to refine our clustering analysis even more so that it is more sophisticated and it's telling an

91
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,800
even better story.

92
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,990
Now I wanted to mention as well that don't worry if this is so it looks a bit complicated right now

93
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,450
or something that you haven't encountered before.

94
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,340
That's totally expected.

95
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,620
Totally normal in coming to Tauriel.

96
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,570
We'll get more used to this concept of clustering and identify these groups We'll talk about some trends

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,540
and you'll see exactly how we'll derive the analysis for now what is important for us is just to understand

98
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,810
how to perform this clustering analysis how to create these clusters using analytics pain and going

99
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,680
forward will be much more comfortable get much more comfortable with this whole concept.

100
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,150
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I look forward to seeing you next time.

101
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,470
Until then I'd be analyzing.
