Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.300
And in today's tutorial we will learn how to create an area chart.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.020
And also I will show you a cool feature which you can use in your daughter discovery processes.

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.960
So we'll start off of the feature right away in front of us here we've got the chart that we created

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.590
last time.

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.020
And by no means is this a final product.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.830
It can go into any report and it's way too cluttered to present any insightful information.

8
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.840
But at the same time you might find yourself with a chart like this or something similar while you're

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.440
doing your daughter's discovery process while you're looking for those anomalies trends and patterns

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.470
you sometimes will find yourself in a very very cluttered chart which you are trying to interrogate

11
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.800
to find those answers.

12
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:59.030
So here what we have is the representation of unemployment long term unemployment in the U.S. between

13
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.830
2005 and 2015.

14
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.490
So we've got this time line here.

15
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.510
It is shown to us by month.

16
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.880
It is the median of the unemployment and the granularity level is gender plus age.

17
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.570
So that means for every month there is several age groups seven age groups times two genders so for

18
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.990
every month there's 14 observations that are present on this chart.

19
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.660
And as you can see from the college in here men are represented in blue circles and women are presented

20
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.300
with orange circles.

21
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.020
So what happens if you want to interrogate one of these genders more specifically and understand exactly

22
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.920
what's happening there.

23
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.750
Well one way is to restructure the chart and just leave that one gender.

24
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.170
But there is another great approach which is called highlighting which helps you achieve the same result

25
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.540
but much faster.

26
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.960
And all you have to do is go to your college and just click on the gender that you're interested in.

27
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.870
So if you're interested in looking at women you just click on women and they go so that is a representation

28
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.020
of female unemployment for that same period for those same age groups and also same thing you can do

29
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.980
with male.

30
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.610
Just click on men and you'll see that the circles associated with male and employment are highlighted

31
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.790
for you right away.

32
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.540
And a lot of people forget or don't even know about this feature and therefore they spend too much time

33
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.910
restructuring their charts.

34
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.030
But in reality if you're just doing data discovery and you just want those answers quickly and you want

35
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.590
to and decide exactly what's happening it's a very handy thing to know and to have.

36
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.360
So definitely look into that.

37
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.290
Well I'll just share another example now.

38
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.730
Let's look at age for instance we know that we have age in the chart as level of granularity.

39
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.340
And the way we got there is we get dragged into the detail shelf.

40
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.930
So it is increasing or making the charge more granular.

41
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.510
But at the same time it's not represented anywhere on the chart.

42
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.270
It's not a color it's not a shape it's nowhere.

43
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.900
So if we want to be able to highlight age we need to give it some sort of representation visual representation

44
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.630
or chart.

45
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.560
And so because colors are used Let's drag age into shape right away you can see that.

46
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.540
Now for every single age group that we have we've got a new shape and we would want to highlight say

47
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.370
35 to 44 years old and we would press here naturally but nothing happens.

48
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.990
So as we click around nothing happens nothing has been halted but that can be easily fixed.

49
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.300
You just have to go to this.

50
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.980
But I'm not here which says highlight selected items and if you click on that now it will allow you

51
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.810
to use this legend to highlight the items that you're interested in.

52
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.410
And as we click through you can see that we're focusing on the different unemployments of different

53
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.480
age groups.

54
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.920
So once again very handy feature to know about and to use in your data discovery.

55
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.640
Definitely take it into your data science arsenal.

56
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.960
All right.

57
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.450
So what are we going to do now is we're going to create an area chart.

58
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.540
Let's move back to just our original line chart so I'm going to take age and gender out can change this

59
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.600
two line and instead of median and employment we're going to look at the sum of unemployment.

60
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.890
So now we're seeing the total unemployment or long term unemployment for every single month in the U.S.

61
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.040
between 2005 and 2015.

62
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.230
So the chart ranges from 0 million to 7 million.

63
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.750
So now what we're going to do is we're going to take age.

64
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.990
So the age group will drag it into color.

65
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.510
And what that will do is it'll give us many line charts.

66
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:45.230
Now the charge ranges from zero to one point six million and every single line chart or line is here

67
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.340
is independent.

68
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:55.380
And so for instance like here you can see that for 35 to 44 years old people in April 2010.

69
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.420
That was one point thirty eight million.

70
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.320
And once again we can use the college to highlight the lives that we want to get.

71
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.240
So that's handy.

72
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.690
But at the same time this visual is not very useful.

73
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.810
You can it's not easy to understand.

74
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:19.760
And as we discussed it is our job as a scientists to make these visualizations very friendly and very

75
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.360
easy to interrogate.

76
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.410
For people who are looking at them so what are we going to do now is we going to change this facilitation

77
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.010
to a different type.

78
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.020
And one way of doing it is just trying to explore and finding out what visualization is going to work

79
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.350
in this particular case.

80
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.300
So for that you can use the Show Me function and you could just click around.

81
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.390
So for instance you look at a tree map is a tree map going to work and right away you can see that even

82
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.630
though it looks bright quite hypnotising is not going to work for a report.

83
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.320
You can't really tell much from this is.

84
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.540
How about a bubble chart.

85
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.000
Once again very beautiful in terms of art.

86
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.770
This is probably 10 out of 10 but in terms of insightfulness not really can really tell much from here.

87
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.140
Too much information being thrown at me.

88
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.140
So you can just click around and find the best one that you like but the one I suggest going with in

89
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.750
this case is an area chart so we're going to click on that and right away you can see how this area

90
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:32.730
chart has been created for us and it looks pretty incredible and very I think insightful and we'll learn

91
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.780
how to make it even better just now.

92
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.890
But before we do one I'm going to do that we're going to show you how to create it from scratch or your

93
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.970
photos show me button.

94
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.830
So I'm just going to kind of close that and I'm just going to cancel these steps and go back to a line

95
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.390
chart.

96
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:56.220
So what you want to do here is if you go to the drop down here instead of line just go to area and what

97
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:03.350
you'll see is now all of these unemployment rates have been stacked on top of each other.

98
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.160
So look at this axis here.

99
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.980
I'll just go back to the chart Sub-Zero click here.

100
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:15.660
You can see here that it only goes up to 1.6 million and that's because each one of these lines is independent.

101
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.370
Now if I go to area it goes all the way up to 7 million.

102
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:25.680
Now that's because they're been stacked up and they're stacked the total increases here as well.

103
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:33.660
So the actual unemployment for different groups different age groups is given by this pop up over here.

104
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:41.300
So for instance in this case it's 1.5 6 million unemployment in that month for 25 to 34 year olds so

105
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.990
that's how you create an area chart.

106
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.960
And once again you can still highlight with color.

107
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.450
So remember about that.

108
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.770
That's a very powerful feature.

109
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:58.880
And what else we can do here is we probably can add some labels to make it really critical So we're

110
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.320
going to take age press Kontrol and all drag it into label.

111
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:06.110
And now you can see that the label has been added and once again we can.

112
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:11.180
As we know already we can format these labels and maybe make it bold.

113
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.080
And as you can see this is already starting to look much much better.

114
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.480
There's no label for the top one.

115
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.230
That's because it probably just doesn't fit.

116
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:24.590
But it kind of makes sense they're all like a descending order going downwards.

117
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.330
And so that sums it up for us for today.

118
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.970
We learned how to create an area chart and we learned about highlighting in the next tutorial.

119
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.350
I will show you how to create a filter.

120
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:42.640
We will use gender as a filter and I will show you also will recap a little bit on the level of detail

121
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.150
and granularity and highlighting as well.

122
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.730
So I'll look for you next time.

123
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.370
Until then happy analyzing.
