00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.860
This is Carol and welcome back to the course some Tablo in the previous tutorial we had a play around

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.320
with colorist and we had a look at three different approaches that we could take to coloring our bartók.

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.860
And we also discussed that coloring has a lot to do with personal preference because I might find something

4
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.560
appealing but you might not find the same approach appealing and vice versa and therefore there is that

5
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.060
element of creativity.

6
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
And I do hope that you had a chance to play around with colors a bit more to kind of understand what

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.910
you're leaning towards what color palettes you prefer what styles and approaches to coloring them more.

8
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.330
But in any case don't worry because as we progress through this course you will naturally start developing

9
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:58.620
a unique approach to coloring to formatting and adding labels and you know creating your own unique

10
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.860
visualizations and developing this unique style of his causation.

11
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.090
And today let's move ahead and talk about labels and formatting.

12
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.920
So we've got this chart in front of us and as we discussed there is a very high likelihood that this

13
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.310
chart might be featured in a report or be posted somewhere in the wall.

14
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.050
So we want to make it look very Schmick And just very very appealing to the eye.

15
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.670
But that is not the only thing we're pursuing today.

16
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.820
There is one more thing that we are after and it might be it is definitely as important as making the

17
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.430
child look awesome and that is ease of understanding.

18
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.100
Let me demonstrate with an example what I mean.

19
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.050
So here on this chart we definitely have all the information that we need.

20
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.850
We've got the names of the people we've got the regions that they're working in.

21
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.460
We even have the total values of sales that they have performed.

22
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:06.140
And so the bars have this access and you can by looking at the bar cell how much approximately each

23
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.990
person has made in sales.

24
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.550
So let's see what happens if for instance I ask somebody to tell me how much sales has been made.

25
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.820
The person has to find Bill.

26
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.190
So look around and we find Bill here.

27
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.500
Then the person has to move their eyes up to the top of the chart.

28
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.250
And then the person has to.

29
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.490
Don't worry about this pop up on the right here.

30
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.230
It's just an Tablo.

31
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.800
So when you do produce this report you won't have this pop up window.

32
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.850
So once again the person has to find where Bill is moved their eyes to the top of the bar and then move

33
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.480
their eyes to the left to understand where the total sales sit.

34
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.050
And here they sit about at about maybe 1000 between 1500 and 2000 so maybe this at around 1000 750 or

35
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.330
1000 800 Let's do another one let's let's see how many sales James made.

36
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.750
So once again we find James we move our eyes to the top then we move our eyes to the left here and we

37
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.340
can see that James is somewhere between 1000 and 1500.

38
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.480
But because he's further away from the Axis there's a bit more room for error.

39
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.060
So maybe he's with this movement maybe sitting at 1600 or 1700.

40
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.240
You can't really tell.

41
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.150
And so that means that the person who's reading this chart has to put in some efforts to get the information

42
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.200
out of it.

43
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.880
And that's not the way it should be.

44
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.510
Tablo is a tool that allows you to very easily create visualizations but also it has the capacity to

45
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.610
make those visualizations to be very very easy to understand.

46
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.110
And that is an art form and its own that is a part of what scientists do.

47
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.330
We look for ways to communicate information in very simple forms so that people don't have to put an

48
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.890
effort to understand it and extract information visually from what we're presenting them.

49
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.620
So let's try to fix that.

50
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.150
What can we do let's try adding a label.

51
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.360
So here you can see this button over here label.

52
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.920
And what that does it adds textural information to the chart.

53
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.970
And what are we going to add is we're actually going to take the sum of total sales we're going to press.

54
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.500
Hold it.

55
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.970
Press Control and drag it onto label and as you can see here now the actual sum of total sales has appeared

56
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.780
on the chart.

57
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:39.160
Oh actually James was between 1000 1500 So that's definitely not 1600.

58
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.710
There you go.

59
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.550
Now we can actually see the exact number of sales that each of these people has made.

60
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.090
And that's really what makes analysis or reading this chart much much easier.

61
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.070
Now while we're on the topic of labels we can add more information to labels so let's say we want to

62
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.180
add representative.

63
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.920
Just drag them into label.

64
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.650
Now we have the name there as well.

65
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.360
We can also drag region but that's a bit excessive because we already have the representative name here

66
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.990
and we've got the region name here.

67
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.000
And moreover the region is the same for all these blue bars the same for orange and green.

68
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.500
So that's that is definitely excessive and which is going to remove those now.

69
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.470
So we'll take region out and representatives.

70
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.120
And now we're left with the total number of value of sales.

71
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.680
Now you can edit the label further if you go into to label and then you click this dot dot dot button

72
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.990
here you can add your own text if you like.

73
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.200
So you can say sales call on.

74
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.170
OK.

75
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.710
So here now you can see that your text has appeared in the label.

76
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.690
Also you can see that this label is not display any text because it is too big it would overlap this

77
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.100
label and you can fix that by right clicking and saying Mark label always show.

78
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.930
And that way it's always going to be displayed.

79
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.120
So now we're going to go back to label go to the dot dot dot.

80
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.360
We're going to take out the sales text and we're going to click OK.

81
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.920
So what you want to do now is we want to fix up the formatting of our chart.

82
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:21.940
And that is probably the last step to getting our chart to the ready for production level.

83
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.050
So let's start with the labels.

84
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:33.880
If you want to change the size of the labels you just go into label over here and you select size and

85
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.220
you select the size size that suits you.

86
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.390
So let's go with 12 and maybe you want to make them bold.

87
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.190
That looks pretty good.

88
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.330
Also if you go into dot dot dot you can do the same here.

89
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.360
So.

90
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.610
And the label size.

91
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.830
Also you can change the color.

92
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.880
You can do a lot of things but will keep it black for now.

93
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.580
So that's good.

94
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.530
That part's done.

95
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:03.940
Another thing that we want to do is we're going to change the type of label and I'll explain what I

96
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.120
mean.

97
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.870
Now in a second so we'll just right click on the labels here.

98
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.650
And so this is where you normally you go to format things.

99
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.900
Labels have their own formatting over here but all other things in Tablo how formatting through this

100
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:25.060
right click Format button which is pretty much the same as going here and selecting font or other things

101
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.460
like alignment and so on.

102
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.670
So here in.

103
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.070
When you're right click and you go to format.

104
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.530
Once again here you can change.

105
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.840
Let me close that again.

106
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.390
So right click Format.

107
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.270
So this is the access you've got to be careful here.

108
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.490
You've got to go to the pain because the label is in the pain not on the access.

109
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:54.310
And here you can change the type of labels so just to prove that this is label if I change this direction

110
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.160
you will see that the label is changing its direction.

111
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.940
Once again you can do the same thing from here.

112
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:07.030
You can change the alignment like that what you can do from this from here is the type of label and

113
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.940
the type of numerical label that we're using.

114
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:15.970
And in this case we're using numbers so let's go ahead and change that to currency.

115
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.030
Let's say we want dollars.

116
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.730
So we'll go.

117
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:24.790
Currency custom as you can see is automatically moved because it's not fitting but it will take out

118
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.330
two decimal points.

119
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:32.270
And now you can see that this is much more appealing it's got the dollar sign in it.

120
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:38.740
And now also let's say we want in units of 0 0 0.

121
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.660
So let's say OK and we'll add one decimal point back.

122
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.530
So that's even better.

123
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.860
So now we can see approximately how much sales each person has made.

124
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:54.840
It's very very easy to digest there's no numbers that you know that are unnecessary.

125
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.590
One thing you should be aware of is you can't really change the font size through this menu.

126
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.020
Here you see I'm trying to change the font size but it's not changing.

127
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:08.920
And that's just like a feature of Tabeau that hasn't been looked at.

128
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:15.160
That's because the label font size actually overrides the font size that you like here so be careful

129
00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:15.610
of that.

130
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.930
OK.

131
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.900
So we've formatted the label.

132
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.450
Now what else we're going to do is we're going to format the axes so we're going to right click on the

133
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.580
axis once again format.

134
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.420
We're going to go to access here and we're going to change this to 12.

135
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:36.050
So kind of it's best to keep the size consistent throughout.

136
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.760
Then we'll go to this access will also click Format and we'll change this to 12.

137
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.850
You can see that Matthew is not fitting in so maybe make this a little bit bigger.

138
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.490
Now Mathie fits in as well a format this access changes to 12.

139
00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.790
This is actually unnecessary because we know that central means region and we know that these people

140
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:07.300
are representative so we'll just right click and we will hide field labels and total sales.

141
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.990
One more thing.

142
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:20.080
So here we will Right-Click edit access will split the total sales by two thirds because that looks

143
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.100
better.

144
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:28.320
And also one more thing if we edit access or not at it sorry we format axis and we go to access here.

145
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.990
What we want to do is we want to make sure that these are also dollars.

146
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:39.330
So currency get rid of that make it OK and there we go.

147
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.470
So now it's it's consistent.

148
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:49.200
You've got kids here also you it would be better to probably put one decimal place back because there

149
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.990
is one decimal place throughout the chart and that's how we form my charts in the next tutorial we will

150
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.140
look at how do we how we can export this chart into other documents.

151
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.260
And see you next time.

152
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.770
Until then happy analyzing.
