00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,070
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo and in the Perras tutorial we created this dashboard.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:16,900
And what are we going to do today is we'll make it interactive and fix it up a little bit to make sure

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,760
that the colors look great.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,250
OK so now if I click around on the dashboard nothing happens which makes sense because it's not interactive

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,880
The only thing we can interact here with is the balance groups.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
And that's because we created all parameters and one of the previous tutorials.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,770
Well very quickly let's make it interactive we already know that we have a fast and efficient shortcut

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,580
to doing that.

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:48,460
If we click on the drop down here and we click users filter right away in our dashboard actions a filter

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,760
has been generated a select filter.

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,870
And if we click Edit it's using the map to affect all of the other elements of our dashboard.

12
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,430
So let's go back and see how this works.

13
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:09,250
If I click on Scotland now you can see the rest of the dashboard adjusts United or England Wales Northern

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:09,850
Ireland.

15
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,960
You can see that the dashboard is adjusting.

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:21,190
We can really gather insights for instance in Scotland our gender split is much more very different

17
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:29,740
to our overall split in the UK and 2 percent of male and in Northern Ireland 74 percent of our customers

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,490
are actually female.

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,780
Very interesting stuff.

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,810
OK so now let's do the same for the rest of them.

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,660
Use a filter uses filter if you don't want to use something as filtered and just don't use.

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,750
Don't do this for that Ellner dashboard but our kids were going to use all these filters and now we

23
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,360
can click on anything Saillant want to look at all of the female customers of the bank we just click

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,800
on that.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,240
And now we can see all of them or we want to look at all the male customers or we want to look at all

26
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,170
of the white collar workers that bank with us and we will also want to overlay white collar workers

27
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,600
with males that have a look where where they're situated you can see right away they're most in the

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:13,940
UK.

29
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,380
What about males and blue collar workers.

30
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,120
So most of them are actually in Scotland very powerful stuff.

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,140
And same thing with bouncers if you want to have a look at the highest balances say everybody above

32
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,180
100000 so you just select these.

33
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,410
And there you go.

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,080
You can see their age where exactly they're located and so on.

35
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,330
And to check under a filter you just click somewhere and then what else you can see right away is this

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,240
little annoying pop up.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,760
Sometimes it's useful but in this particular case not really because we can see everything from the

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,750
dashboard we don't need to have this pop up following all malls all the time and it can get in the way

39
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,410
so if I'm looking at these charts now this pop up is covering up my parameter control some other of

40
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,700
some other bars and so on and I put my mouse here it's covering up the number.

41
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:16,510
So let's go ahead and get rid of these pop up so you need to go to each of the worksheets and switch

42
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:16,810
it off.

43
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,170
So go to this sort with map.

44
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,530
And here if you go to a worksheet show tool tip and then just uncheck show tell to OK now if you go

45
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,040
back to the dashboard they see no more tilter still here and you have to for the other ones as well.

46
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:38,400
But sort of going to the sheet you can just click on it go to work sheet here tooltip and check this

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,190
same thing worksheet tool tip uncheck.

48
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:54,480
No there's none here so worksheet tool to uncheck and the last one worksheet to to uncheck voila.

49
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,530
So now whenever I put my mouse over something I don't see any tool tips which is great.

50
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,780
All that happens is I can select So that's how dashboard ready in the next tutorial will do some analysis.

51
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,300
And then in the tutorial after that we will start putting everything into a storyline.

52
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,640
I look forward to seeing you next.

53
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,300
And until then happy analyzing.
