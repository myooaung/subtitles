00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.340
This is Carol and welcome back to the course and Tablo in today's tutorial we will learn how to navigate

2
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.970
Tablo and you'll get to play around for that too.

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.030
So here you can see where we left off last time we had just connected to our office supplies that we

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.090
dossers.

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.360
So let's move on to the Tablo workspace.

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.100
Here you can see at the bottom a tab called sheet 1.

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.870
Let's work on that and right away we're presented with the Tablo working area and it may seem a bit

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.570
overwhelming at first but that's exactly why in the previous section we had this quick agile run through

9
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.930
where we very rapidly created a map and it was quite intuitive wasn't it.

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.240
So that's exactly what we'll talk about today how easy it is to navigate this workspace in front of

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.770
us.

12
00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.330
So the two main areas here are the data connection on the left or the Data tab on the left and the working

13
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.460
area on the right.

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.250
So this is where you will be creating things masterpieces.

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240
So let's talk about the Data tab on the left.

16
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.200
First the data is always broken down into two sections dimensions and measures.

17
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.480
And there's a very distinct difference between them and it's important to understand.

18
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.680
So dimensions and measures are roles different to different rules that any data element can take.

19
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.230
And normally what Tablo does is in mental measures it puts any kind of numerical values and in two dimensions

20
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.660
it puts all the categorical and kind of qualitative dot.

21
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.600
So that's the default setting for Tablo.

22
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.120
And you're easily able to drag them around.

23
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.430
So if you're not happy with something being a measure you want you can put in two dimensions like like

24
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.420
that for instance as easy as that.

25
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.060
But we won't do that right now so I just click contrails there to undo an action.

26
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.900
That's the standard Windows key to cancel something.

27
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.430
So the other way to think about dimensions and measures is dimensions are independent variables and

28
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.090
measures are dependent variables so for instance you have here we have unit units.

29
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.900
So how many units of a certain item were sold.

30
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.380
And here we have region.

31
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.080
So we can find out how many units in each region were sold so region will be the independent variable

32
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.620
and units will be the dependent variable because it will be grouped by region and based on that definition

33
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.440
which is the correct definition.

34
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.030
Things might be required to move things around from them inches into measures and measures I mentioned.

35
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.010
But we will focus on that right now because Tablo usually guesses it quite correctly.

36
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.270
OK so what do we have here as well at the top we've got the normal ribbon for Windows.

37
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.530
So file basically you can save your file open a new file data you can collect connect to new data sources

38
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.440
here worksheets.

39
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.010
So this is considered a worksheet.

40
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.220
What we're going to be creating now is going to be a worksheet and we will get to work with these elements

41
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.140
a bit more in the future dashboards.

42
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.720
We are not talking about dashboards right now it'll come further down in this course and dashboard is

43
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.380
a combination of worksheets story a story can be a combination of worksheets and dashboards and we will

44
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.910
get to our exclusive stories as well that's a relatively new feature for tablet analysis.

45
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.640
It just basically specifies how you want to do your analysis on the current sheet that you're working

46
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.880
with.

47
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.180
We will be working with this tab a little bit in the future map.

48
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.230
We'll work with this when we get to maps basically formats.

49
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.540
There are other ways to access formatting and we'll be doing that in the course server.

50
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.540
We won't be looking at server right now.

51
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.370
And window help.

52
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.800
These are just auxillary functions.

53
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:08.370
So then what are we going to look at now is basically we won't talk about this right away because we

54
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:16.710
will get to know this ribbon as we progress of course but right now I'd like to focus on the main working

55
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.420
area where we will be creating a worksheet.

56
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:30.040
So here the main elements are columns and rows so most of your worksheets will be created by deciding

57
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.950
what goes into columns what goes into rows and then what goes into these other elements like what decides

58
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.700
color what the size of your shapes what decides what text is attached to shapes the level of detail

59
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.690
we will talk about aggregation more than the course and any tool tips that you want to put by.

60
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.580
So the easiest way to explore is probably to explore by doing so let's drag a few things onto this worksheet.

61
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.970
I would assume let's start perhaps we're frigid.

62
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.200
So we just drag it into the middle here.

63
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:10.110
And so we've put one dimension in and let's put another dimension let's say units and right away you

64
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.070
can see that by dragging those two in a tableau has decided to put region automatically into rows and

65
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.320
your units into it some of them opposites aggregate them by region and it's put them into a label.

66
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.320
And so here you can see that now you can tell right away how many units were sold sold in each region.

67
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.950
So now we can we can just drag and drop here so if you're not happy with having units here we can put

68
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.190
them into calls and right away we have a bar chart.

69
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:49.770
And now we can expand this a bit and then reduces a bit now we can see by region we can also see how

70
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.030
many units have been sold.

71
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.870
And you can also see that there is a tool to popping up every time you hover over one of the bars.

72
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.250
Now there's a very handy tool in Tablo which is called Show me here.

73
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.130
So I encourage you to play around the foot.

74
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:11.460
I don't normally use it in my work because I already know what I want most of the time but it gives

75
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.890
you kind of suggestions and quick shortcuts to different things so let's look at a pie chart for instance

76
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.610
here.

77
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.280
Now we can see a pie chart instead of all bar charts and now if we want to increase the size it's a

78
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.300
bit smaller usually these pie charts so versal will drag like that.

79
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.090
And if we if we're still not happy with the size this is bottom Noye here size just click that and you'll

80
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.150
see how it grows.

81
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.230
Well that's a bit too much.

82
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:43.950
So what does this show us that shows us what region bicolor has what proportion of the total sales in

83
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.550
units.

84
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.080
Once again we're just playing around.

85
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.980
Now there's no intention of what for what we're doing.

86
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.520
We're just exploring taboo.

87
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.600
So here you can see Central East and West.

88
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.740
And yeah it's a pretty cool pie chart but let's see what else we have so we can do a bubble chart right

89
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.980
away.

90
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.680
Tablo puts everything in the right positions for us as you can see it is nothing and nothing and rows

91
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.140
everything has been put in here.

92
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.790
Tablo has selected circles for us from his drop down and created this bubble chart.

93
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.350
So what else.

94
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.680
Then we can look at a tree chart tree map.

95
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.040
That's what it's called treatment.

96
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:27.690
So here it's like a bubble chart but it's a bit different because it's got boxes instead of instead

97
00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.150
of circles.

98
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:37.740
And here once again the relative size of the box the area of the box is directly correlated to the number

99
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.570
of units sold in that region.

100
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.790
You can just keep clicking around and you'll see different versions of the dashboard that or the worksheet

101
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:53.400
that Tablo is suggesting for you and maybe you might be happy with one of them but we won't rely on

102
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.830
that and we will create our own version in the next tutorial.

103
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:06.000
So before we finish up I just want to show you that in THIS SHOW ME box some of the things are grayed

104
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:13.740
out and that's because you need certain elements of data to create these for instance to create an area

105
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:21.990
chart you need at least one date so zero or more dimensions one war measures and at least one that we

106
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.550
don't have a date in our work sheet right now.

107
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.140
Tablo concreate an area chart for us so if you want to add a day to just drag a date in here and now

108
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.830
it's highlighted and now we can create a area chart.

109
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:42.690
But once again we'll get to area charts line charts and all these other things further down the course.

110
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.580
Today we're just exploring tabbouleh.

111
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.120
So I look forward to seeing in the next tutorial and until then happy analyzing.
