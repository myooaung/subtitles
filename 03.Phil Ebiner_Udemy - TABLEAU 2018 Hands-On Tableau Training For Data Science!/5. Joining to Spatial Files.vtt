00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.450
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tobler in today's tutorial we will connect our special and PTF

2
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.350
data and also take care of some data integrity and data completeness.

3
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.300
Now in the previous tutorial we connected to each of the data sources individually but we need to join

4
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.700
them together to get the additional information relating to the crime statistics onto the map.

5
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.420
Really use adjoint for that.

6
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.150
Now we've already done most of the work on our crime stats on our PTF.

7
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.910
So it's the lead.

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.680
Everything else.

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.620
So we can delete this shit over here.

10
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.790
And if we go into our data source we can also just go to New York parks and public spaces and just close

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.350
the data so just to keep out work nice and tidy.

12
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.380
Now we can also go back again and just rename our data source as well and we can call those New York

13
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:03.350
crime stats with the geometry a nice long name but at least we know which one it is and what we can

14
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.380
do now I just follow or redo the steps from the previous lecture maybe connected to the special file.

15
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.300
Now this case we run go to data new data source we want to use the same data source and just add another

16
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.870
connection so we adding another connection by taking a special fall and selecting our shape file.

17
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.310
Now immediately Tablo will see that we want to join these two together and seeing as it can find a field

18
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.470
which to join on it allows us to select what we want to do.

19
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.490
So we're going to do and enjoy it because we want all the fields from both data sets that joined together

20
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.400
so.

21
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.070
And how will these do so we know we've got the Bok name on the PDAF side and now on the shortfall side

22
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.680
we know the name is called or the field name with your name in the name that you would want.

23
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.720
So once we've selected that Tablo populates it for us and we can just close our joint.

24
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.320
Now that seems that that was just way too easy.

25
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.930
But we've done all the hard work before.

26
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.770
But let's just quickly check the data integrity and data completeness and I cannot stress enough that

27
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.560
when working with open source data.

28
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.960
Just to make sure especially when combining two data sources on a net feel like a name that something

29
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.220
hasn't gone wrong we haven't created additional records or duplicate entries and some of the records

30
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.130
that you wanted to show especially when using the inner joy is actually you know from a PTF site is

31
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.230
actually in there.

32
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370
So first thing we'll check is just the number of records once again the number of incidents and we know

33
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.110
previously we had a hundred nine.

34
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.740
Now we have 104.

35
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.770
So something has gone wrong.

36
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.630
So what will be checked to do things we'll that we'll look for.

37
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.190
Firstly relook at duplicates if any duplicates have been created.

38
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.920
Even though the number of records is less it's always good to check the triplicates because if there

39
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.760
were records that were dropped that duplicates can actually make up for that.

40
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.680
And we also look with for records that didn't join properly.

41
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.180
So first how we start off with this is we can take the name 3:01 which is from our Special fall.

42
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.770
Put that into rows and take the pork name into the Rose as well.

43
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.610
And now we can see we've put the number of incidents which we don't want By the way we actually want

44
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.960
the number of records.

45
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.820
We want to see is for between the PTF and these right between the PTF on the site and the special fall

46
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.390
and that's not all they need to be could break so do we have records for.

47
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.070
Add to that is more than one and we can just actually sort on that and immediately we see and they are

48
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.050
quite a range of those.

49
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.670
So how do we go about this.

50
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.960
We need to deliver on this project and we don't have time now to investigate this.

51
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.770
So what we will do is we will look at how we can exclude these discussing with our client or look for

52
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.320
alternative data but for the purposes of this Tauriel we will just not exclude those because we don't

53
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.590
have access to change the spatial data.

54
00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.490
But what we can also look at is that some of these do not actually have a number of incidents so you

55
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.450
remember from our PDA fall that they were records that had zero incidence.

56
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.270
So what we could do is we can just take the incidents put that into filter and filter all of the zeros

57
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.040
out just to see you know in terms of what the actually the the problem is.

58
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.430
So if we do that we see there's only two records that had incidents that creates duplicate entries on

59
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.840
there.

60
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.890
So what we will do for now is we can just take these two just select both of them and we'll just so's

61
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.650
or select them up again.

62
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.470
Pest Control see and put them into an Excel document just to make sure that we keep track of what we

63
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.950
are.

64
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.190
And it just opened that up what we are executing or putting on the parking lot to take care of after

65
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.920
we finished the visualization.

66
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.940
And that will take care of our duplicate entries.

67
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.530
So now we are also concerned about anything that has enjoined.

68
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.100
So let's go back to our data source changed our joined type 2 live join now that would take all of the

69
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.690
entries.

70
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.790
If you remember correctly from the previous section or previous tutorials we will take one of the entries

71
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:13.210
from our fall and only the joining ones on the special fall and this will allow us to a look at any

72
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.060
entries in here that had actually incident's more than zero.

73
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.110
That did not doing too a fall correct.

74
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.530
And that could be due to a number of different reasons the spelling might be incorrect or a name change

75
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.630
could have taken place or any other inconsistencies but let's have a look at our sheet what sort of

76
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.810
game we want.

77
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.620
OK so we know we need to be filtering for incident zero.

78
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.900
We are counting the number of records in there.

79
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.260
And let's just actually again sort this now that we've made the change just sort it once again.

80
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.940
Now what do we see.

81
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.760
There are indeed talks and if you mean these box off from your PDA a fall and these parks do not have

82
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.690
a corresponding entry in your special file which means that these do actually have incidents connected

83
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:03.710
to them but they are not be able to show on the graph on the map which means then that all data will

84
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.300
not be complete just as well we take this.

85
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.390
And again we can just highlight these.

86
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.420
We can just highlight all of these.

87
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.090
I'll just copy them and put them in the Excel document because as we know we will we will just to for

88
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.330
now at least ignore these and keep them on the list to discuss with our client separately or look for

89
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.180
alternative solution.

90
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.020
And that's basically the ones they live in that we will be using.

91
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.540
So we'll just copy that.

92
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.930
And now if we go back into tabla we can go back to a data source change our joint to an in a joint once

93
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.220
again and now we just need to exclude those.

94
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.990
Now we know we will do this at the data source filter and we actually already excluded the data was

95
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.920
full to ball under that it was full to the total.

96
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.180
If you remember correctly from earlier and now we can just use this custom value list option over here

97
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.970
to paste what we have just copied into the list and it would exclude these ones.

98
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.450
In addition as well.

99
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.680
And then we just finished.

100
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.240
Okay.

101
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.530
And our number of entries are joined up.

102
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.690
And if we now look at any problems you can see all the nulls have disappeared and we only have one record

103
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.510
for each of them.

104
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.280
So this is exactly what we have done.

105
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.830
Not the best solution because we do want to show all of them but we'll put it on the parking lot for

106
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.550
now to investigate once we've completed the visualization.

107
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.260
Now we can just clean up our data source so we know this and only certain fields we want to keep so

108
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.390
we can hide the first three and we can rename this name to you on one to give it a more descriptive

109
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:39.130
name and we will just call this park name and we will continue in hiding more of these fields.

110
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.190
We really don't need to try now and we'll go up to borrow.

111
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.210
We want to keep borrowers and they will only give borrower a proper name and let's just call this the

112
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.100
city bar.

113
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:55.460
All right then continue hiding and I think the only field we still need is the geometry so we can just

114
00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:00.250
select all of them by holding down shift and click hide.

115
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.690
I guess this is really second nature to you so if I'm skipping a few steps Luckily you already looked

116
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.930
at the previous tutorials.

117
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.370
Right.

118
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.370
And that's in essence what we were looking for.

119
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:16.250
We've got the POC name from obviously from both data sources the city barrer the adjacent geometry which

120
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:23.160
we spoke about and to borrow from our PDA fault as well as the incidents in actual fact we can hide

121
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.310
Also the borrow from our PDA.

122
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.070
We will use it from the actual from the city generated information.

123
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.920
OK.

124
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.810
So that is then our data ready and prepped for our visualization.

125
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.920
So let's quickly clear that's what we've created and just put the geometry on there to see what we will

126
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.500
deal with.

127
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:46.200
And that is exactly it you can see we don't have central park Central Park wasn't in our crime statistics

128
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.120
are obviously doing a joint to remove them and it will remove all the problematic ones which we've identified.

129
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.290
But at least we know our data is complete for what our purposes are today.

130
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.520
Now in the next tutorial we will finally get to creating that awesome visualization and putting everything

131
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.240
together.

132
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.430
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

133
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.190
Until then happy analyzing.
