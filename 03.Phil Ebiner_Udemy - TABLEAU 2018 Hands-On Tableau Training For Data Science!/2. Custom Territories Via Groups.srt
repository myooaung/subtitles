00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,870
Hello welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,340
In today's tutorial are we going to solve the first part of the challenge and we'll identify which of

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,860
the two regions is outperforming the other.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,250
Specifically we will talk about measuring these three or assessing these three metrics and plotting

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,760
them on a map and in order to solve this challenge we're going to learn how to create custom geographical

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,480
regions or custom territories in Tablo.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,540
So it's gonna be a fun story.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,140
Let's get straight to it.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,590
All right.

10
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,470
Here is Tablo.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,030
And let's open up our dataset which is an excel file so there it is start up expansion.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:44,480
And if you have a look here you'll see that indeed this is our file at the bottom we've got 150 rows

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,800
and 10 of them are the new locations of the new cities where the company opened up recently.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,170
All right so let's proceed to solving this part a challenge.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,110
How are we going to visualize our different sales regions.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,220
Well first of all let's create a map will drag state onto the blank area and we will change this to

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,500
a field map as you can see here.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,420
Now we've got the states where the company does operate so you can see that they don't operate everywhere

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,700
in the U.S. but probably in the majority of states they are present.

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,100
Now how do we even for ourselves identify how these states are broken up into those two sales regions

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,510
so how do we know which states belong to sell region one and which states big sales are going to.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,140
Well the fastest way is to just sell the region and put it into color.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,350
And there we go we can see that there are our two sales regions which are kind of like competing for

24
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:46,370
performers which are trying to grow faster and always is it's a way to structure a company or a startup

25
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:52,640
to split it into two parts and then see kind of put them against each other so that they strive for

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,360
the better growth and things like that.

27
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,410
So that's great.

28
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,230
And now how do we assess those metrics.

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,710
So for example one of the metrics that we're assessing is the average revenue per city.

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,400
How do we how we measure that or how do we assess it.

31
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,820
Well let's give it a try.

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,240
We'll take revenue and put it onto label.

33
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,490
Now we will change this label very quickly so we'll click here click in side to form and the liberal

34
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,900
may break out of 14.

35
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,820
So now you can see the some of the revenue for every state.

36
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,650
Now we can quickly change it to measure some let's change it to average So now you can see the average

37
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,090
revenue per state.

38
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,920
So what does that mean.

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,250
Well for example in Texas you can see that it's thirty seven thousand six hundred eighty one so that's

40
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,170
the average of all the revenues in the state of Texas for all the cities in the state of Texas.

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:47,510
If you go to the top you'll see that in Texas we've got at least two cities so there's Midland as dentin

42
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,500
and probably some more cities in Texas.

43
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,490
And so they all have their revenue.

44
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,230
And what we see here is the average of all the cities in Texas.

45
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:02,240
But what we are actually after is the average revenue for all the cities in sales region 1 and the average

46
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,210
revenue for all the cities in sells region to.

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,630
So actually we don't want the grouping the aggregation that just occurred.

48
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,010
And even if we take the averages of these averages that's not exactly what we're after.

49
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:20,210
We just want Tablo to recognize this orange territory as a separate geographical object and then aggregate

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,280
in that object.

51
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,590
And then also recognize the blue territories or territory as one geographical object and group or aggregate

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,570
all the cities inside that territory and aggregate over them as well.

53
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,500
So we just want two numbers not that mean numbers.

54
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,510
So how would we go about doing this.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,440
Well this is where we are talking about creating our custom territories so basically we want table to

56
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,380
recognize a custom search and this is a custom target.

57
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,610
And in Tablo there are two ways for creating custom territories.

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,820
Today we'll look at approach number one.

59
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,090
All right.

60
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,430
So how would we do it.

61
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,080
Well it's actually pretty simple.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,560
We're going to need to use a group.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,960
Now I know we haven't spoken about groups in this course and groups are a topic that we cover often

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,100
the advanced Claassen on table but nevertheless we're going to need them now.

65
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,470
So I'm going to give you a quick preview of groups and you'll see how you can use them to solve this

66
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,860
challenge.

67
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,210
And if you're interested in further developing knowledge then you can always learn more about groups

68
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,300
in the advanced course.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,120
All right so what we're going to do is we're going to hold on control and select all of the states that

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,140
we want to put into one of these regions.

71
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,060
So there they are.

72
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,860
And now we're going to just hold our mouse over this.

73
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,560
And one of them and you'll see that we've got some options here and grouping is actually this option

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,190
here which looks like a a little staple or something like that.

75
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,280
And the other option is View right click and you slide group and you just in case we just disliked all

76
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,420
dimensions.

77
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,680
So now we've created a group you can see the group on the left there these sales regions and states

78
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,490
so that's how the group was created.

79
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,630
That's what's included.

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,500
And if you right click it and select added group you'll see that it has two parts to it.

81
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Now I'm not going to go into detail about groups not part of what we're focusing on right now.

82
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,850
We actually just want to understand the custom territories.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,780
So in order to create the custom territory from here there's just one more step left.

84
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,150
All you have to do is take state out of your resolution from here and voila.

85
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,620
As you can see now Tablo has created two custom territories which is going to move this over here and

86
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:33,260
you can see that this is one huge custom territory which is cels region number two.

87
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,400
And this is huge.

88
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,840
And once you can see that even it's not even those noncontiguous So it's like broken down into three

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,500
bits.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,510
Tablas recognizing it as a separate territory which is a very very powerful thing to have and the have

91
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,790
the average really has been calculated.

92
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,900
Now if you want to restore the previous callers very simple just click Edit color select here Orange

93
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,420
sightseer blue click OK.

94
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,470
There they are.

95
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,840
And so now you can see that that is our average revenue.

96
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,670
So right now are these two custom territories discussing chercher is performing better.

97
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,360
So region 1 is outperforming region 2.

98
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,500
Now we have to check the other two metrics as well.

99
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,780
So let's put marketing spend in here as well we'll see average by the way.

100
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,010
Here's a quick tip.

101
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:22,550
So instead of sort of doing this instead of dragging the label or the object the measure into the label

102
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,340
and then selecting from the drop down measure average which you can do to speed up the process is right

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,970
click when you're about to drag instead of left clicking right click drag it into label and right away

104
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,930
you're given this window where you can select is a pretty cool shortcut.

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,580
So it all allows you to save a bit of time on that one step and narrow it right away we've selected

106
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,420
the average marketing spend.

107
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,550
And finally.

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,960
So let's let's actually also put in the sales region into the label and what other thing are we wanted

109
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,190
the roaming right.

110
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,330
So we wanted the return on marketing investment which is revenue divided by marketing spend.

111
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,340
Let's create a calculated field.

112
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,410
It's going to be Roll Me and marketing spend revenue divided by marketing spend.

113
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,380
Click OK.

114
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,920
Romey put that into the label as well.

115
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,670
Or again this is a shortcut.

116
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,810
Right click putting the label average Romey And let's just tidy up this label a bit.

117
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:27,050
We're going to take sales region and put it at the top and then get rid of this and then it say average

118
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,270
revenue average marketing spend.

119
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,780
And finally average Romey and all of these should be centered.

120
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,250
OK.

121
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,810
So it's good.

122
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,650
OK.

123
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:49,370
So you can see right away we've got some stats already region to average revenue 38 region 1 average

124
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,880
revenue 40.

125
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,700
So a region or one is a head in that sense then in terms of marketing spend got two thousand in Region

126
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,300
2 and in Region 1 we got two thousand eight hundred eighty nine.

127
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,840
So in this sense Region 1 is ahead as well because average markets spend less it is the better.

128
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:15,350
And finally average Romey the more the better in Region 1 it's a bit better because it's $14 revenue

129
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,000
per dollar marketing spend in Region 2.

130
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,140
It's only thirteen point four.

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,720
All right so that is how we come up with these of course you can tidy these up a little bit.

132
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,270
So that sort of look a bit better.

133
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,800
So you can always change the font and size.

134
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:37,450
And for example let's just click on the label and if you can change this to let's say 12 probably will

135
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:43,840
be better and bold something that's all very really looks better than of course getting rid of the zeros.

136
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,060
You can also round your average marking Spens apply some calculations but when average folks are not

137
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,050
the main focus for today's Sterle was to how to create this custom tertiary.

138
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,270
And so we discussed the method for CASM territories through creating a group.

139
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,900
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and it is a very very powerful feature that she can use in your mapping

140
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,770
techniques.

141
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,820
So definitely keep it in mind and I'll look for you next time.

142
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,200
Until then happy coding.
