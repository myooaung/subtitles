00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:10,670
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo in the previous tutorial we learned how to combine cluster's

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,410
and trendlines and what powerful insights we can derive from such analysis.

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:21,050
And I hope that you had a chance to play around with that and really get that knowledge thinking because

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,980
indeed it is a very powerful tool that now you have in your arsenal and is just going to be very satisfying

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,410
when you find situations in your analytics when you'll be able to apply this kind of approach or something

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,180
similar.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,930
And today we're going to talk about saving this Klosters.

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:43,910
So now I have these clusters How do I actually save them to perform further analytics with them on other

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,370
sheets for example so if I want to create a new sheet How do I carry those clusters onto the sheet as

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,870
well.

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,330
Well one way of course would be to recreate the clusters again and in our new resolution but creating

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,450
the classes every time is going to be quite tedious.

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,250
So there's a fast way.

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,040
All we have to do is take Klosters from here hold on control and drag them into dimensions.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,370
And so what that creates is it creates a group.

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,650
Once again I know we haven't spoken about groups.

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,900
For now it's just a convenient tool for us to have.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,300
You can always learn more about groups if you decide to check out that one of course but otherwise just

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,690
right click and rename this group and we'll call it clusters all is just called our clusters just so

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,130
that we remember that we created this group ourselves.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,910
And if we go to sheet 6 Let's see how we can use this group.

22
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,450
Let's say I want to put it into color and then I want to put it into columns.

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,420
And now I want to look at the average population per cluster.

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,140
That'll be interesting something that we were curious about previously.

25
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:54,400
So that's right click drag population into label say average and maybe let's copy that into the rows.

26
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,530
So here you can see right away what the result looks like orange Schloesser indeed has the highest average

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,130
population.

28
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,960
Blue has a medium and red has the lowest average population.

29
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,370
So that's how quickly we can move our clusters to different sheets.

30
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,100
It's very easy and you wait to save them as groups like that.

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:22,610
And another example would be if we plot our cities or this plot or state on the map and then expand

32
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:29,180
it to cities and here if we want to quickly see which cities are from where we can just take our clusters

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,540
and put them into color and there we go right away we can see how these cities where they are located

34
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,060
and you can see lights so we can increase the size further or we can connect the size to something else.

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,340
For example we can put revenue on size and add some transparency and then you can move around the colors

36
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:54,200
so let's say we can put the red ones on top because they're there we know that they're small some revenue

37
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,930
and you can just maybe add a border so that they look nice.

38
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:58,940
So there we go.

39
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:06,170
Now we know how to not only create clusters but also use them in our analysis and use them across different

40
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,300
sheets and different visualizations that we're creating.

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,220
So hopefully this knowledge will come in a useful for you one day and you'll be able to perform closer

42
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,140
analytics on your daughter sets as well as you can see is a very powerful feature that is integrated

43
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,210
into a table and on that note we're going to complete this tutorial look for the next time.

44
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,640
And until then happy analyzing.
