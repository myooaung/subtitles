00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.950
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo.

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.490
And today we're talking about errors that you can get in maps and we're talking about some specific

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.750
areas which are related to data so let's have a look at that.

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.920
Here we've got the chart that we created last time and this is for the number of personal vehicles sold

5
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.210
in different regions.

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.010
Now we're going to go back to the data source and here you can see that we've got different regions

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:34.210
which are not recognized as a geographical location doesn't have this globe here because they are kind

8
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.880
of selected by us or by the person who was creating his daughters are so they're very specific.

9
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.910
But at the center of the countries are recognized as a geographical location because you can see this

10
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.790
globe here.

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.610
So we're going to take advantage of that and create a map.

12
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.790
So let's just create a new worksheet maybe this one will call something like relative

13
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.960
cars sold this what we will call map.

14
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.370
OK.

15
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.270
We'll get to take country and as we're used to we'll just drag it on to our work sheet and right away

16
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.590
we've got a map that came up and what we can do now is we will take vehicles sold and drag it into color.

17
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.680
And so now our map is colored based on number of vehicles.

18
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.960
And let's not forget right away with these time series not all the working with it we have to remember

19
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.940
that if we're not visualizing the time series we have to filter by it will take a year and put it into

20
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.260
a filter and maybe it'll just sit like 2005.

21
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.070
OK.

22
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.020
And we'll bring up a filter so Schalkwyk filter.

23
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.800
We obviously don't need all anymore and we'll just have a sliding scale so we can only select one year.

24
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.550
OK that's great but now have a look here at the bottom of the map you can see here.

25
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.520
Unknown.

26
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.030
What does that mean.

27
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.000
What does 6 unknown's mean.

28
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.700
Well let's click on it and click on it and it will come up.

29
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.690
Here it says that there are six values that have unknown geographic locations.

30
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.840
What do you want to do.

31
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.860
You can edit locations you can filter the data or you can show data at a default position so I don't

32
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.120
recommend data a default position or filter data.

33
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.960
That just means kind of exclude these values that are not recognized so we'll control that because we

34
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.760
don't want to exclude them right away.

35
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.430
We want to see if we can fix the error.

36
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.130
So here just go ahead and click Edit locations and right away at the top you can see the six locations

37
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.160
that have not been identified.

38
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.440
So let's go ahead and fix them up.

39
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.560
So Burkina Why has it not been identified.

40
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.310
Well let's try typing in Burkean and see what Tablo has several has Burkina Faso.

41
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.120
So let's click Burkina Faso and click OK.

42
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.470
And as you can see there somewhere there there are Burkean that has come up so it wasn't there so if

43
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.310
a person controls that it's not there because not recognized.

44
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.110
Now it has come out because Tablo knows where to put it.

45
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.460
It is displaying the name that we have in the Dahdah Burkina.

46
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:18.610
But he knows Taplin knows that this location is actually geocoder to the one we've selected.

47
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.460
All right so let's go for the next one.

48
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.360
Let's skip cango for now and let's go to Kazakhstan.

49
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.470
As you can see here it's kind of misspelled so it's actually Kazak stand ups.

50
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.080
So there's an H in there.

51
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.570
So we select that and you will see this bit over here.

52
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.900
Will come up so we'll click OK.

53
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.290
As you can see Kazakhstan has been recognized.

54
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.010
That's great.

55
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:50.860
So as we're slowly fixing up our map obviously Switzerland plus F.L. should be just Switzerland and

56
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.060
Tahiti in Tablo is French Polynesia.

57
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.980
And then Turkmenistan is an R in the word tour.

58
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.050
You see these are like Dahdah arrows that you might not pick up right away in your data preparation

59
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.710
phase.

60
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.290
So now you'll see all of these up here.

61
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.310
So there you go there's Turkmenistan's Switzerland appeared somewhere here and French Polynesia.

62
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.030
I'm not really sure where to find it right now.

63
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.010
But anyway so let's go back to the Unknowns.

64
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.770
Here you can see we've got Congo and it's unrecognized and if we start typing in Congo there's two types

65
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:40.080
of Congos Brazzaville and the other one can Shatha and we like right now I don't know which Congo this

66
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.660
Doughtery first so I can either investigate and find out where which Congo is the correct one.

67
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.390
Or if you don't have time or you don't really mind not having this element of dooring in his possession

68
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.200
you can just cancel that.

69
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.940
And this one unknown you can filter the data and just not have it at all.

70
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.360
So you know you can see that there's no Kongo illustrated on the map and yeah that's the other way of

71
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.680
doing it.

72
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.500
But I do encourage you to first check if you can fix up the data sometimes like we don't have an example

73
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.500
of this right now but sometimes you'll find that if you're dealing with cities and just say you're dealing

74
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.320
with cities in one country in the U.S. for instance and you drag them onto the map and you find that

75
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.540
nothing is shown on the map Well that's because you need to tell Tablo that you are dealing with the

76
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.030
U.S..

77
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.000
So if you have a field for us then you just create a hierarchy as we used to do.

78
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:47.180
That way everything we find or if there is no field for the US then map here you can when when you're

79
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:55.320
at a location you can just specify your actual country so you don't have to how you'll see how to do

80
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.060
that Tablo will actually prompt you here and allow you to specify the country you are working with.

81
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.310
So if you're working with us you just specify us and then Ill recognize the cities.

82
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.720
And that is because some some cities are duplicated in different countries so there is a mosque in Russia

83
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.340
and there's a mosque going in the U.S. and there's a Sydney in Australia and I think there's another

84
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.960
Sydney in the US and or Newcastle there's one in Australia and there's one in the UK so you need to

85
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.240
know which country it's dealing with if it can't only go by the city or the state.

86
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.900
So sometimes you have to supply that additional information of a slot in the door and the hierarchy

87
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.090
hasn't been created.

88
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.330
OK so that's what we've done.

89
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.790
What I wanted to show you here is that if you click through these years you can see how the number of

90
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:50.430
cars sold is changing through out our map and it'd be really cool to see this as a visual session.

91
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.190
So if if you're interested in.

92
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.280
I mean really cool to see this as an animation.

93
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.950
So I just wanted to give you a heads up.

94
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.030
I do have an advanced course on Tablo So if you're interested in things like animations and more advanced

95
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.010
topics and tabbouleh.

96
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.400
Make sure to check that out and that will help you take your tablet skills to a jet level.

97
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.090
But that's all for us for today.

98
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.620
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

99
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.710
And until then happy analyzing.
