1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello and welcome back to the course on Tablo in front of us we see the dashboard the beautiful customer

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,540
segmentation dashboard that we created in the previous tutorials of course.

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,650
And today we're going to be putting this dashboard into a storyline.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,490
So just to remind you what we have here is a map of the United Kingdom and how a certain bank how its

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,750
customers are distributed across the different regions of the UK.

6
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,210
Also we have a distribution of the same customers by different balance bands.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,700
So these are 10000 old bands or 10000 pound bands in this case the distribution of the customers by

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,230
age so five year bands then we can control the bands here if we like.

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,030
And as we click around they adjust and also we've got the gender distribution of our customers and the

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,710
job classifications.

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,350
And once again this dashboard is fully interactive we can click around we can see what's going on with

12
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,270
the different demographics and that's what's called the customer segmentation dashboard.

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,390
So what we're going to do today is as we discuss We're going to put this dashboard into a storyline

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,060
and provide some inside a story tell the readers or the viewers that people we're going to be presenting

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,440
to tell them a story about this bank and its customers and how they differ from region to region.

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,340
However before we proceed with today's tutorial of like to ask you for a quick favor I know you've already

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,650
brought this up before and if you have left to review.

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,150
Thank you.

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,500
Thank you so much.

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,520
However if you haven't I would really appreciate if you considered leaving a review for this course.

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,860
It's very easy to do you just have to click this button up at the top and then in this window you just

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,750
select the right number of stars you think the course deserves and perhaps type in some comments.

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,220
It would really help me understand how you rate the course and if it has met your expectations and also

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,690
it'll help other students who are considering taking this course to understand what to expect inside

25
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,320
and whether it's worth their while or not.

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,590
So I would really appreciate if you could do that for me today.

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,000
And now is get on.

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,310
Back with the show.

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,290
So how do we create a storyline.

30
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,160
Well the first thing we need to do is click this button at the bottom which says news story.

31
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,600
So we'll do that.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,040
And now you can see a new type of working space.

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,700
So it's not a worksheet it's our dashboard.

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,730
It's a storyline.

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,470
What you can do here you can create anything inside but you can drag elements in here and like a dashboard

36
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,990
you can drag worksheets and you can also drag dashboards and a storyline but the main difference is

37
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,710
that you can only drag one item you can combine items here souces you drag a second item.

38
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,790
It automatically replaces the previous one.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,050
And so here we can drag our dashboard in here.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,430
You got to pick what you want to drag into the storyline and then once you've added it.

41
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,020
So let's say if I want the map then I can add another point to my storyline.

42
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,260
The gender and then let's say I want the decision by balance that way I can create a story and talk

43
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,130
through these points one by one.

44
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,210
But in our case we will be working all the time with our segmentation dashboard and it will just be

45
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,740
showing different cuts of our member base.

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,750
In this storyline.

47
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,570
So let's go ahead and drag the segmentation dashboard in here and right away you can see it underneath

48
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,070
this storyline control panel.

49
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,430
So the first element or storyline will be the overall representation of all customers so it's kind of

50
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:42,870
our customer base line and we want the user or the viewer to be able to see what the bank looks overall

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,350
in the whole of the United Kingdom as here we need to add a caption.

52
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,340
And what are we going to type in is very go to prepare this bank's customer base line.

53
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,080
There we go.

54
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,480
That's done all we want to show our viewer at this stage.

55
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,280
Now we're going to create a new point and we're going to drag the segmentation dashboard in here as

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,150
well.

57
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,570
Now what we want to look at is the one of the regions of the U.K. and we're going to start with the

58
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,720
largest region or the region that has most customers for this bank.

59
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,160
It's is it's England.

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,540
So we'll just click on England here and as we discussed previously the insight that we want to convey

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:29,040
here is that there's a lot of white collar workers in this region Predominantly they are this region

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,910
the customers in this region are presented represented by white collar workers.

63
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,740
Perhaps that has something to do with London being the economic center of Europe.

64
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,610
So we're going to take a new caption and I'll copy it in here and it says England is mostly represented

65
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,550
by white collar workers.

66
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,230
70 percent.

67
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,690
That's all we wanted to show.

68
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:58,410
So when you do get to this point during a presentation what will happen is you can start drilling into

69
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,120
this dashboard.

70
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,500
If it is required so obviously you're talking about white collar workers who might want to click on

71
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,990
it and then see how the dashboard changes and perhaps look at what other male white collar workers up

72
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,320
to and look at their representation by age bands and then look at their representation by the higher

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,300
and balances and so on.

74
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,050
So it's up to you once you get to this point.

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,010
But to start with.

76
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,540
To get you started or to create a segue between the previous slide and this slide.

77
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,870
You just need this little caption over here.

78
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,630
So now we're going to update that.

79
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,350
So it's saved.

80
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,790
And instead of treating a blank point we're going to duplicate this chart and that will save us the

81
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,540
trouble of dragging the dashboard.

82
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,950
There we go so we've duplicated the tab and now we will look at Scotland and as we discussed here the

83
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,450
age demographic is completely different.

84
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,350
Much older customers the gender is also different predominantly males.

85
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:07,020
And the job classification blue collar and other very few white collar workers bank with this bank in

86
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,860
Scotland.

87
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,020
So let's copy the caption and see what it says.

88
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:18,790
The caption here is larger so if you move away you'll see this scroll box appear.

89
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,960
And now we can read the caption says customers in Scotland are predominantly males in their late 40s

90
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,610
and early 50s late 40s and early 50s representation of white collar workers is low.

91
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:38,880
OK so that gives us some conversational topics so you might want to click on blue collar workers once

92
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,810
you open up this dashboard you'll see that 95 percent of them are actually male.

93
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,000
And so the other 44 percent these are mostly represented by females.

94
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:56,070
You might also want to look at the older demographics and see how their balances are distributed like

95
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,070
and so on.

96
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,630
So that is how what are we going to convey for Scotland.

97
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,940
And at this point I'd like to show you another cool feature of Tablo and that is annotations.

98
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,730
Now it is a very simple feature and a lot of the time people get to learn it right away so you might

99
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,560
really know it.

100
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,560
But if you don't.

101
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,460
No not a worry.

102
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,290
We'll look at it now.

103
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,990
It's very easy to use let's say on this chart.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,710
I want to point out something specific that there is a lot of workers or customers in this region.

105
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,260
We're in the early 50s so between 50 and 55 years old.

106
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,680
What I want to do here is right click on this bar click annotate and add in Mark and we'll just keep

107
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,770
the default for now.

108
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,670
So I'll just change the size to 10 because that's a bit too big.

109
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,610
And what you'll see is this arrow up here and this box with text which you can move around and is basically

110
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,480
telling the reader some additional information.

111
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,700
So once you get to this picture to this slide you will see this annotation which I hadn't seen before

112
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,790
and that is very powerful because it attracts their attention and also gives you some cues talking cues

113
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,110
so what are we going to do.

114
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:19,480
Now we're going to change the text here and we'll say high representation of customers in early 50s

115
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,720
maybe center this.

116
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,150
So that's what we wanted maybe change it a bit so it would fit.

117
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:35,940
So that attracts attention and gets you can get to talking about this specific element of the customer

118
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,630
segmentation.

119
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:43,230
So that age groups you can definitely add them for other elements of your position so if you want to

120
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,570
talk about balances or gender or something else something that might not be obvious or something that

121
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,690
you really want to attract people's attention to then feel free free to add annotations.

122
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,560
So I'll just update that and we'll duplicate it again.

123
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,060
So now we're moving on to Wales and in Wales we obviously don't need this anymore so we can delete it.

124
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,020
And as you can see it's stayed here but it's deleted here now.

125
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:14,150
In Wales our main inside was the balances so here you can see something different to the overall baseline.

126
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,960
And we will see it even better if we change the balance group so we got a justice parameter and change

127
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,670
it to 15000 dollar or pound bands.

128
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,610
And here you can see that it actually increases first and then drops off.

129
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,220
So if unclick whales in the baseline you'll see that it always drops off like that for whales at first

130
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,120
increases.

131
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:41,700
And so let's type in our inside for whales the inside for whales is going to be daughter for Wales shows

132
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,480
an above average representation of mid-sized balances.

133
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:52,480
There we go so we can update that and perhaps you can add another caption here so on it and it said

134
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:06,340
Mark and we'll say above average representation and here will say size 10 and also centering it is a

135
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,460
good idea sometimes.

136
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,990
So that's how we will deal with this region.

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,890
And once you're in here you can start kicking around and understanding what else is going on.

138
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,180
If you need to.

139
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,090
So once you click these balances for instance you see that the distribution by age changes so you can

140
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:34,970
tell how these people were from abnormal or representational balances what they are who they are and

141
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,400
you see that they're mostly in the early thirties.

142
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,320
They're mostly female and the mostly white collar workers.

143
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,380
And finally let's move on to Northern Ireland.

144
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,620
So we're going to update that and we're going to duplicate.

145
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,440
And here we'll get rid of this caption and we will select Northern Ireland right away our inside here

146
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,900
was that early.

147
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,620
Younger age groups and predominantly female So let's copy that into our caption here we typed in Northern

148
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,770
Ireland is mostly presented by female customers in younger age groups.

149
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,990
Update that.

150
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,450
And there we go.

151
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,450
So that's all done.

152
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,350
We can add another annotation here but I will leave that up to you.

153
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,150
Another thing I want to show you is that here the parameters are independent.

154
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,440
So Tatel has thought this through very well.

155
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:30,920
If you change the parameter control on this element of the storyline then it won't change on this element

156
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:37,400
so even though it's the same dashboard we're dealing with Ultimately the actual parameter controls are

157
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:45,050
independent so feel free to change them around and show exactly what you want in every single part of

158
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,920
your of in every single region of the United Kingdom so you might want to show it like this.

159
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,400
In this particular case that is totally up to you.

160
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,210
So there we go.

161
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,370
Now what we see is a storyline.

162
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:05,030
So when you're presenting you can start with the UK then you can move on to England and Scotland then

163
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:12,310
Wales make some comments points or move on to Northern Ireland and conclude your presentation.

164
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:19,010
That is how to create storylines in Tablo very new powerful feature.

165
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,870
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial.

166
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,400
And just as a reminder AOD really appreciate if you could leave a review.

167
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,680
It's very simple to do it will take you 30 seconds and help me out a lot.

168
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,630
Thank you very much.

169
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,830
Alipore see you next time.

170
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,720
And until then happy analyzing.
