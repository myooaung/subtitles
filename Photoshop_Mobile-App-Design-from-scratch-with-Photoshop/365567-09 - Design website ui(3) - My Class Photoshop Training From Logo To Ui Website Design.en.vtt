00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.070
Actually,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.880
I forgot to change the color.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.970
All these part.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.110

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.230
Even you can set the capacity and reach your desirable color.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.760
So said the capacity to reach your desirable color.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.910
You can do it in this part.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.210
We should design the foot off these woman Onda.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.160
Actually,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.410
uh,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.540
it's the contact section off our website.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.350
As you know,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.850
we worked under I cones in the previous three years.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.170
Ah,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.230
they'd be bringing reason card.

Yes,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.950
Let me bring this project.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.500
Okay,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.350
I closed these.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.950
Okay,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.410
We can have assessed that these Aikens from Google or on that website,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.760
to if you select the icons from here,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.950
it will give you a nice result.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.090
See,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.430
let me a pendant Bruiser,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.550
See these swept site eyes really good.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.740
Uh,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.810
I suggest you Teoh,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.890
select your iPhones from here.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:58.980
That meted what to the cooler job will be more easier.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.350
So just use these iPhones to design this part.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:11.430
I should select a delayer off rectangle five and then I'll dragged icons to the sport.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.890
Very.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.210
But we can use white color to color it.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.930
As you know,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.920
we can use control G to make a group for them.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.970
You can resize them too.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.720
Actually,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.950
we can take a copia of these informations and paste them there.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.130
Let me zooming.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.050
Just know that the size of our phones should be for teen.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.300
She said the size of phone as 14.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.900
As I said these phone as my phone.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.800
Good.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.660
Are you good?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.060
Now I'm gonna fit that.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.140
I comes with the texts,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.750
I'm gonna align them with each other.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.700
I select,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.580
uh,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.750
this group.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.700
I mean,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.830
I select their group.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.200
I should magnified Aikens with control T we can resize our Aikens based under upper Aikens

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.200
,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.630
But other first,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.430
we should move up the group off bikers.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.880
I mean,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.650
move up this layer,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.750
Okay.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:44.280
Moving up till the up pissed layer.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.300
No,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.980
we should resize them.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:02.100
Based on these Aiken's you should unify them a little.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.090
Very good.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.690
No.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.560
Yes.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.780
Now click on in turkey,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.740
and,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.290
uh,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.650
I should set them into suitable layer.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.560
Yes,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.670
we should,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.510
uh,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.450
select a suitable layer for them.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.160
Okay,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:36.870
Now I should convert the Aikens too smart object in order to mask them in these layer.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.750
So let me do it.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.760
Yeah.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.650
Okay.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.300
Okay.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.070
We should musk the numbers in these layer to very it.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.480
Let's work on the size of them.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.290
Let's set the size.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.600
Let me aligned.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.270
Yes.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.350
Let me align them,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.530
buddy.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.230
Shorter.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.450
Excellent.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:31.850
Okay.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:42.350
We should use white color to color the phones Now.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.410
You should write.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.270
Contact us.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.560
You can activate caps.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.410
Look on.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.540
Right.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.710
Contact us or you can write it normally in the usual way and magnified.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:14.580
Really control t Now I can magnify it.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:23.550
Use control t to magnified and then open the paragraph panel to select these icon.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:35.280
These option converts all the small letters to kept the letters Very good.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:51.120
We can set italic murdered for it and now should rotate it with control T Yes.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:07:02.680
I must align it with these line and then Eileen searching everywhere that I like.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:20.620
We can use the previous icon which we used in the upper part to design to design the icon

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.160
off this part too.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:32.250
So select these two layers keep pressing on old key and drag it down and said it here.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.910
Very good.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:41.410
I get now.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.950
I can drank it down from here.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.580
Onda,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.190
uh,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.880
I'll insert it here.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.340
Good.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.910
It's time to change the color off.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.200
These part of the first we should select are shaped tool,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.830
and then we should use white collar on the field part,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:15.190
and we should use wide color on the stroke of these layer that you saw used white color to

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.500
color the stroke.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:23.010
You can,

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:23.750
uh,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.320
increased capacity to 100.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.780
Now we should mean if I in a circle,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.510
it's better to,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.640
um,

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:38.700
unifying both off them Should mean if I these circle based on the person to page I mean,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:47.630
based on this measure but the first click on the link option in these parts,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.240
we should decrease the number of it.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.220
I think 60% is suitable.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.560
Very good.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:07.190
As I said,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.440
60% is suitable.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.680
Now,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.700
I should click on the spawn and use control teeth.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.100
Uh,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.000
I slick on link on the first.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.020
You should click on link option and then said 60 person for this one.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.770
Okay,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:34.150
I click on in turkey and I move it right.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.240
Very good.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.550
now we must at the same age.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.250
We should insert it here.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.230
Actually,

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.630
I've cut it before.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.450
If you want to cut teenage,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:57.750
you should sit a mask for the image layer and then moving down as far as you want.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.250
OK,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.270
I repeated again.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.690
See if you want to caught image,

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:14.350
you should set a mask for the layer off in age and then moving down as far as you want.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:26.460
I inserted here to align it with these line.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:37.700
Now I should use polygonal lasso tool to insert at point here and I'll insert another one

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.800
here and,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.250
uh,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.270
I'll inside the other points freely.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.700
Then I'll double click here to close the selection part.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.360
I should use black color by color.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.320
Bucket very now should be selected.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.830
See,

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.290
the image has been caught and as you see,

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.340
the image has bean about it.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:09.650
With these line to we have to add another image to the sport.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.750
Okay,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.960
I click on in turkey.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.050
She I should drag it down to this sport.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.590
O t.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.550
I should drag the e major woman to the sport.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.450
Let me check it out.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.550
Bringing the layer down.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.990
Bring it down.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.790
Okay,

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.620
let me Check it out.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.360
Okay.

Okay.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.190
Okay.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.650
Let me check it out to gain.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.950
Okay?

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.350
No,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.850
I should mask them.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.550
Let me mask them in the layer.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.890
Very good.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.090
Now I can set it here.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:08.680
We can resize it with control T and no other.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.840
If the quality drops because we're going to blue it,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:22.890
select a gushing blue option from filter menu to open these panels and insert a suitable

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.390
number here fifties.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:25.990
Okay,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.950
moving up.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:35.360
We can meet the italic mood.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.950
Actually,

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.370
Onda,

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.850
we can set regular month for it,

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.220
but let me test.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.940
Um I feel that italic mint is better than a radial.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.380
Arm it.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.160
Now.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.550
I should check out the effects in the main project.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.610
As you see how they are.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:05.570
We used Graddy inthe and brightness contrast adjustments for these parts.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:11.100
Let me show the setting off these panel for you.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.930

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.210
Kale as 40%.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.950
We have to capacities here.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.950
One of them is 100 the other one is zero.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.050
You can change the opacity from here.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.230
See,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.880
from here.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.690
Ah,

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:44.260
I double click on the color palette to show the color could see its three F 0991 The color

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.510
could at least one.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.820
Uh,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:53.650
as you see these three F 0991 the color could of these.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.930
Funny is six p for two F zero C.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:58.790
Let me show you.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.850
Okay,

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.400
Andi,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.980
Sonny's zero.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:09.690
I dragged this lay here to the sport.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:14.640
Okay,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.880
I transfer it,

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.610
uh,

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.850
to lower levels.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.620
I bring it here.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.150
I should bring it the sport on.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.520
I set it above the cellphone,

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.210
layer the layer off cell phone.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.630
I mean,

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.150
we should decrease the opacity to 50.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.730
Or actually,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.100
we can increase it to dart.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.950
This layer,

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.810
as a matter of fact,

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.470
is desirable.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.450
I can increase it to 70.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:50.700
We can use brightness,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.650
contrast adjustment.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.210
Onda,

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:55.630
uh,

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.350
we can dark it a little.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.050
Very good.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:07.280
We can dark it a little.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.060
Yes,

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.590
it's good.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.440
Uh,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.880
now we can take a copy of rectangle layer.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.260
I mean,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:24.690
the layer off rectangle and use it here to create that purple part.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.850
Or we can design another rectangle.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.960
Okay,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.340
so let me design and rectangle for you to learn least heckling,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:34.790
too.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.530
Uh,

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.030
we should select rectangle five.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:46.310
I mean this layer and draw a rectangle with shape,

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.850
tool Okay.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.940
See,

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.680
uh,

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.250
should move it up to set it above the image layer.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:58.890
See,

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.670
now we can change the color to purple.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:07.250
We must move it up and set it above adjustment layers.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.330
Why did I do that?

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:09.980
See,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.650
uh,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.710
if you set it 100 adjustments,

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.160
adjustments will be applied on it.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.100
So don't do that.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.760
I said it on the image layer.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.640
I mean,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.480
uh,

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.150

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.820
we should select it and,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.250
uh,

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.960
use control.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.910
T then judios right click to select.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.550
It's que option.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.150
Now we should drag it up.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.490
Okay?

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:49.060

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.960
Very good.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.110
It's OK,

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.670
but we should move the texts and these elements.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.550
Okay,

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.850

Very,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:53.640

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.760
Okay,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.950
