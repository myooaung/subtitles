00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
Hello there,

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.610
guys.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.350
How are you?

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.420
Uh,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:03.620
well,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.100
come to the second part of our education,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.240
we could design a logo with illustrator software in the last part.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.410
Off course,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.850
That two dimensional.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.310
I mean,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.730
a two D and a black logo.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670
Ah,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.150
Now we're going to create these free D.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.860
I mean three dimensional logo.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:36.110
We'd finish up software the version off my footage of an illustrator software or both CC to

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.200
any 18.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.730
You can see the options on the screen,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.150
and you can update your software E if you want to use these version.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.790
Well,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.250
I don't want to talk a lot,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.010
uh,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.510
about the details,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.300
but,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.850
uh,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.830
let me tell you something,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.840
and then we'll start designing from eight.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.240
Was it?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.210
As you see,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.350
uh,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.250
these PS is three dimensional.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.910
See,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.450
this one actually is three dimensional,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.510
but this one is two dimensional.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.190
I mean,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.920
two d,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.450
and it has some styles and effects.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.810
Actually.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.390
Recall these features as a style.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.150
Yes.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.790
Ah,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.050
And,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.540
uh,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.230
there is a dish.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.580
I mean,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.830
a bubble.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.490
Kind of.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.680
It's a kind of style under the PS,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.310
and actually,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.540
it is a dish.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.910
Yeah,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.370
and we've got these type of coffee here.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.890
We're going to work on these effects.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.750
Uh,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.750
onda actually least dish under the PS.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.550
Okay,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.970
other first.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.410
We should bring it to 40 shops software.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.190
Okay.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.280
Do you bring it to finish up software from Illustrator?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.880
Softer.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.290
So we open illustrator software.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.820
Well,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.330
all right,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.000
well,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.700
we should open our project folder,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.480
uh,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.970
in the software.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.750
And then,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.860
yes,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.740
this one is completed for Yes.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:53.880
This one is completed for we need to create three layers off course for three dimensional

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.390
port.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.690
But for the sport,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.910
we need to create two layers.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.790
Okay,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.110
these PS on DA these diamond,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.150
which has a punched PS in it and you know how to do it.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.470
So I need these two layers to create it.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.950
We have to bring them one by one in 40 shops software.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:25.290
You should choose one of them and press command Seen Mac operating system or press control

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.290
.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.400
See in Windows operating system?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.140
Yes.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.340
Pressed him at the same time to cope.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.750
Eight.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:42.260
I create a new project here on this size of it is desirable.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:54.750
I set it up as 1000 and 280 these spoon 700 Turney I change it into RGB color and 72 peaks

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.750
.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.470
Cells in a change is,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.780
you know,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.850
for the resolution.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.140
Well,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.500
so this is our project.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.470
I use command.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.710
We or control V to appear and window,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.280
like please on this window asks us about the four of our object,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.430
which we're going to transfer from your illustrator,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.710
uh,

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.650
two for the shop software.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.480
It can be a smart object,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.190
Peak sale path or shape,

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.630
layer.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.700
And actually,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.700
uh,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.510
we need the last one I killing of these icon,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.330
and then I press on.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.800
Okay,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.280
Key.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.120
As you see,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.050
it has been transferred as a shape here,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.050
and I can edit it completely.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.690
We passed selection and direct selection tools.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.470
I mean,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.560
these two tools over here,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.450
look at them.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.850
And from now on,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.780
a cold them as white A and black eight,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.000
actually,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.430
because of their shirt card,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.950
which is a yes,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.510
uh,

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.730
white A ease,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.210
direct selection,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.160
and black A ease.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.000
A path selection.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.300
Okay.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.710
Sorry to speak so slowly.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.790
I just want you to understand it.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.100
You can use black and,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.870
uh,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.650
press.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.460
You can press shift on a at the same time to use these tools separated Lee.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.660
You can select these.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.480
I'd TEM and move it by black A.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.650
Uh,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.160
you can move the poor,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.960
separate lee or move the shape totally by these option.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.950
Yeah,

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:52.650
we can edit our object point by point with white A See,

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.650
actually,

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.170
As you see,

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:04.590
we can edit our object point by point with white a so justice.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.000
Now we go to illustrator software,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.290
actually two ko p two Diamond and pace it here and we select shape layer for eat.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.650
Okay,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.240
We can use,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.910
uh,

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.970
arrow keys to set it up.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.750
Here,

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.250
let me set it up.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.220
That me choose an effort create place for it.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.150
Very good.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:48.300
We can press control T or command t at the same time to magnify or,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.430
um,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.880
unify our object.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.550
Okay.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.270
Actually,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.990
we use command in Mac operating system and you can select both layers with controlled key

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.650
and the first select one of them and select three.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.640
Order one by pressing control key.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.990
When you do that,

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.390
you can praise control to your command.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.810
T to magnify these objects.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.920
Just be careful not to deform your object.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.740
Okay?

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.640
How can we avoid it?

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.090
We can press shift not to deform our object,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.150
Actually,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.050
when we want to magnify it.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.910
And as you see,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:32.990
uh,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.710
it is being magnified,

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.850
um,

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.510
unified by paying attention to peaks.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.420
And why measures?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.200
I mean,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.170
the length and width.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.140
Actually,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.290
it can help you to raise your speed in magnifying an unifying.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.550
If you pay attention,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.610
you can see that these object is being unified.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.260
It coolly from,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.020
uh,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.840
southeast side.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.600
I mean,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.580
right side from the lower pork.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.180
But if you wanna magnify it from northwest side on duh.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.060
Actually,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.550
southeast side equally at the same time.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.610
Uh,

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.620
you should keep pressing old key,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.860
which shift key and see it will be magnified from both sides.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.040
The first,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.050
uh,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.780
I I hand the click icon.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.130
I mean,

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:26.850
of the most.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.780
Then I I hand shift and old key.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.220
I mean,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.610
I stopped using them.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.190
Well,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.350
I close illustrator softer for now because I don't need it anymore.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.860
For now,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.750
I quit.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.150
Let me close.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:49.050
Email to close in essential software is to let my system work easily.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.510
Okay.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.300
Well,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.080
uh,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.220
we mentioned how can we magnify and magnify it?

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.660
Yes,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.750
how we can do that.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.650
I said it here because I don't need to magnify it For now,

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.170
we need these layers that you see.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.880
Here,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.200
let me transfer them to that poor toe work on them.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.290
So,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.450
yes,

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.410
they're too big.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.720
We can unify them by pressing shift and old key.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.340
They told you Well,

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.960
I want to blue my back around instead of white.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.750
Okay,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.210
we have several ways to do that.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:40.880
The old one is that to create a raw layer and we select blue color over here and then we

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.480
use,

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.200
uh,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:50.720
bucket are actually paint bucket tool to color blue here and by pressing Kilic icon on the

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.650
surround layer.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.050
Actually,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.470
it poos the desirable color on the work.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.980
It's an old way.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.190
And now we can use adjustments.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.090
If you don't know them.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:10.180
You should I learn about for the shops offer from the base of the world.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.880
I mean from a to visit.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.330
And you should be familiar with a just man.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.440
It's masks and all the necessary poor.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.370
So work easily and understand me bitter.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.380
So we should know the finish up from the base.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.080
Ok,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.890
well,

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.650
this is adjustment port.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.580
We have it in image.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.350
Poor toot,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.160
and actually,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.590
some of the sections of it or not in the sport.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:44.990
So we select solely adjustment and see it creates a layer for me at the same time when I

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.070
actually selected It's my desirable color.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.240
Actually,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.900
I can make it dark or light.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.790
It's up to me.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.340
After we choose our desirable color,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.800
we can click on OK t Uh,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.710
it created a layer for us and we can change the color by double click on it.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.120
I mean,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.250
click twice on it.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.250
Okay,

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.680
I press controls it.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.250
See,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.910
we created at least shave with several layers.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.670
Actually,

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.390
uh,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.570
this dish over here.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:16.930
I mean,

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.940
you can created easily.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.480
Okay.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:28.030
I closed the eyes off each layer one bite long to see how it will be when we can.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:36.030
Also 1st 1 we lose a depth off shape by closing the 2nd 1 it will be like this by closing

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.200
the third born,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.050
it will lose the edge of it.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.660
See,

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:50.980
it happens when you close the fourth long and the fifth phone and the 6th 1 Yes.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.770
See,

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.750
now we're going to work on it.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:59.750
We should move all the layers by choosing one layer impressing shift key.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.860
Gay.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.950
And we said it here.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.370
Uh huh.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.370
Yeah.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:08.980
Uh,

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.180
I should press you,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.630
which is a short kind of shape.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.390
Our to draw a circle,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.900
See,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.570
keep pressing left key off the most to choose the icon.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:28.260
Or you can press right key of it once to do that.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.250
So I create Alex.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.660
Here we the uprising Chief key.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.310
I created the first,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.070
Alex.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.020
Ah,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.660
closed the depth and you can see that these ellipse has,

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:43.980
ah,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.770
high diameter and and I do it for the swan.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.450
Okay.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.250
Uh uh,

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.010
now,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:00.650
Iommi at least want to see we have an l leaps here.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.950
So we should Kobe these Alex Here.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.930
Well,

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:12.240
now we should just work on the colder is.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.840
Actually,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.580
the colors are desirable.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.070
I want to set the exact color of the main model.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.880
OK,

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.310
but if you want to call her the layer,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.980
like as me.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.430
Uh,

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.610
no matter.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.070
We can use these coat to color.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.050
This one See?

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:43.070
It is ah 000 de to a Yeah.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.180
See,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.070
it's going okay.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.770
I dragged down the layer,

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.990
which I copied.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.740
See now,

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.810
uh,

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:58.300
changed the color of lower layer into blue.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.570
I blew it.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:06.350
Lease the code of these scholar is 00 26 79.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.730
Okay,

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:18.760
I dragged up this layer and magnify it.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.470
Actually,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:28.060
I magnify the diameter of these phone to make it real like these.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.580
We should take another copy of these shape to magnify,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.340
actually,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.050
to increase the height of it.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:41.130
If you don't take a copy and drag it down to magnify the shape,

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:46.770
the ages will be disappeared and your work will be ugly.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:47.890
Actually,

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.570
we want to create these shaving four ellipses,

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:56.540
and we should magnify the first Alex not to disappear.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.160
The ages as far as we can force.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:14:59.950
See.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.720
See,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.070
these two images should be taejin to get,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.590
or somehow so I take another Kobe off the ellipse.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.790
Because of that,

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:16.190
I can use control J or Command J or I can keep pressing on the old key.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.010
And,

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.850
uh,

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.700
I'll drag it down when these layer is activated.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.550
Okay,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:26.370
there is no difference speed in the ways to do that.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:26.870
Okay,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.180
uh,

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.500
both of them can give you the same result.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.320
So I did it.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.090
Now we need another l IPs to create the school in part.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.100
I take a co pay off these,

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.400
and then I'll bring it a little down.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.460
I change it into gold.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.520
The court of these color is 63.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.350
51 14.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.050
I could've gone.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.590
Okay.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.900
I need to put the layer down.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.500
I can drag it down,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.000
or I can use command.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.960
We left bracket or control of it left bracket to bring it down a step by step.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.520
See?

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.430
So just like these?

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.340
No,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.070
uh,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.870
should make it,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.780
like as the main model C.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.910
It is sharp here,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.660
but not in these one.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.720
I should deformity and use handles.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.410
Uh,

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:28.240
or I should keep pressing old key to make it on,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.330
actually to take it inside.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.100
When you use old key,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.300
it will go inside from both sides.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.760
See,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.880
uh,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.190
okay,

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:52.050
we could create an object like these as the upper wrong somehow.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.650
Now we should work on the shadow of these shape.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.630
We have several ways,

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.380
uh,

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.270
to insert the shadow or actually to create the shadow.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.690
Ah,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.270
and actually,

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:12.340
I want to show the best way to magnify and unify your object easily.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.600
I mean,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.910
I want I use a shape tool to shadow.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.320
You can draw a circle here to create a new layer,

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.360
and they use the old way,

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.860
which I told you and choose black caller to poor it.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.780
The the paint bucket tool on the Warrick.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.290
Okay,

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.260
uh,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.730
this this See,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:45.160
like these I de selected We've command or control D ah and I choose,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.800
uh,

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.260
Goche and blue form in blue Report in the fields of Romania.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.300
I can blue read as much as I like.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:00.540
This is a way to create it Any to lose its Colletti when you want to magnify or modified

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.240
For example,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.180
if you magnify it Sorry.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.010
If you me fight and click on inter or if you magnified,

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.210
uh,

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.030
without using controls there,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.950
it will lose its quality And it will be pixel by pixel.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.520
As you see yes,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.450
side elated.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.310
We have a new and useful way.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.290
And for the shop software,

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:22.780
see,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.950
you can on draw a shape or you can take a copia your last shape.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.540
I keep pressing on old key to take a copy of it.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.860
Uh,

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:40.200
I change it into black and even we can unify the lateral size with old key.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.830
Ah,

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.340
we should use control or command.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.820
We left bracket to bring it a one.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.420
Liar.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.260
Lower!

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.130
Now I go to properties part,

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:59.100
or you can step on the spot by clicking on Windows mania.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:05.450
And we should increase the if either in the mass port to fade our shape.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.480
Okay.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:19.450
So you can use it mean use if either handle in a mask to fade your shape.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.950
Okay?

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:27.170
I should me fight more from both sides.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.760
Okay?

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.300
And it's being created easily.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.850
If you want to make your shadow more darker or more lighter,

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.450
but not darker than these should decrease the opacity a little.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.710
Let me said it as a t.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.290
Okay,

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.160
let me said it.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.950
85 eighties better.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.200
Uh,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.850
now we have to work on the depth of these objects.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.770
What should we do to create it?

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.550
Do you know?

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.310
Actually,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.080
uh,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.100
let me get it out of the masked style,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.760
as you see.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.450
Actually,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:19.160
these are shape that will be like this by pressing this.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.460
Ah,

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.350
that I will talk about it later.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.600
See,

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.160
we have several masks in for the shop software.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.330
That clipping mask is one of them.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.330
You can right click on each layer to see and use.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.340
Create clipping mask option.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.520
Here it is.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.950
You can use it in your work to create the depths.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.100
Anything?

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.250
There is a bowel of water here.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.160
The battle is the lower layer and the water.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.650
Ease the upper one.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:49.550
Okay.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.850
Uh,

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.450
actually,

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:59.290
the water is pooed in the bowel.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.400
We should create a layer.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.760
Lively's over here.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.080
I select my last layer,

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.180
and then I press old key to bring it a little down.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.950
I should press shift at the same time not to move it left and right a lot.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.260
I said up here.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.860
Okay,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.180
I make it absolute dark.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:20.850
See,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.840
like these two guys,

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.300
the layer is,

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.280
uh this layer is water.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.350
And this Laurentiis bowel,

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:34.650
we should set them on each order in order to use clipping mask.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.550
Okay.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.000
I should use right click on these.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.550
I activate this layer,

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.150
I select a create clipping mask.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.180
Actually,

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.940
water will be poor into the bowel immediately.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.720
Be sure to set up these two layers on each order to use all.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.910
Keep Ethan them exactly on their boundary to appear to these icon in order to pool water

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:00.580
into the bottle.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.010
Actually,

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.350
Lee sees the short card,

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:08.980
and you can use old in the Windows operating system or old or option in Mac operating

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:09.410
system.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.960
If you pay attention,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.450
you can see that these distance is not equal released.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:18.830
We'll see.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:28.570
So the first I should select water layer and magnified from lateral sides to parallel.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.130
Lease two shapes.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.050
We can use Old Key to do that.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:34.450
Okay,

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.950
we created these objects easily.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.650
Now we should said these objects into the bowel.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.010
How can we select two layers at the same time?

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:52.550
We can keep pressing command or control and click on each layer we like.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.670
As you see in the right pork.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.970
It's showing us the layers.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.800
Select.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.680
See now,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.220
if you want,

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:10.780
select two layers at the same time at shift key when you use command or control key and

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.760
then click on the next Aiken.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.780
As you can see in the right side,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.420
it's selected shape one and shape,

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:16.950
too.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:22.540
We set it up here and we call a rate just for now.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.950
Uh,

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.010
I put it up on the office later.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.230
See,

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.740
guys,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.540
as I said,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.090
Guys,

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:37.050
you can use control or command with a right bracket key to operate the layers step by step

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.050
.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.210
But if you use left bracket instead,

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.690
it will bring them down.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.190
Step by step.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:50.680
Use shift key and control or command with right or left bracket.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.060
It will bring it to the office or to the loudest layer.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.420
Now I want to change the color of it.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.920
I should activate my white or black a tow.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.450
Why these object?

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.090
I do it toe boldly.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.120
Just for now.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.760
See this PS easing the bottle?

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.350
Like as this one.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.100
But this one is blue.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.050
Uh,

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.490
let me identify the code of it.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.560
We opened the sport,

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.130
and I'll,

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:20.730
uh,

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.240
talk about it later.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.150
Three.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.590
Mm.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.680
Okay,

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.640
I pick up that could from here.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.850
I will talk about it later.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:44.700
I select white or black A and then I click on these color to open my color picture in order

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.080
to paste the code All the color.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:47.900
Okay.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.350
See?

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.350
Uh huh.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.380
Okay.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:03.320
On and paste the coat by paying attention to the main model.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:11.740
Aiken dark my background to see how is the style of PS and to show off the ps.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.520
Well,

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.550
I don't need these upper battle anymore.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.760
Uh,

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:28.190
I select all of layers by pressing control key and dragging from outside into inside like

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.630
this.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.220
It crosses from a layer.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.880
It means it selects that it selects all the layers except the background.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.280
It's enough to press delete key on.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.090
I do the same work for this phone.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:47.210
I'm moving to the middle of the background.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.900
Okay,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.820
let me magnify to see it better.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.730
Well,

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.910
we created a PS and a bowel up to now.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.000
Now I transfer at least ps two.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.980
These part toe war cunning.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.560
Better actually to work on the project.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.600
Better let me show them completely.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.950
Ah,

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:17.450
okay.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.140
As you see,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.840
it has a golden last serious style.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.210
Ah,

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:31.210
we have these style around the PS.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.200
And to see these two layers are different from each order.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.200
They have F peaks and arrow,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.690
some eyes,

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.480
options and effects.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.690
Uh,

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.080
these differences will be appeared.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.870
When you want to create a style and effect for your layers,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.030
how can we appear them?

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:58.140
We can select our appears with right click to choose blending options.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.120
Actually,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.950
in order to open blending option panels or reaching,

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:10.280
click twice on the empty part off these bucks to upend layers.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.390
Tile panel.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.450
Just click on the empty part.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.710
Okay?

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.950
Not on the shape of it.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.800
Not on the name of it.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.260
Because if you click on the name,

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.340
it will bring up color picker panel.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.850
Ah,

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:33.260
we have different and various ports here and we'll talk about them later because these

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:38.160
education is actually based on the project C Uh,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.050
okay.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.850
Actually,

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.370
uh,

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:45.990
you see,

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.460
we have a stroke.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.170
I TEM here and color overlay.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:50.820
Actually,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:56.300
you can use a color overlay to set up the color of your shape from here.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.730
Actually on.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.520
We chose it before,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.350
so we don't click on it.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.050
Ah,

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:11.250
we got gradient and pattern icons and the others that will be used.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:14.960
They will be used on mansion in the next courses.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.550
We're going to war with Babel icon right now.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.050
As you see,

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:24.200
we have bevel struck and color or layup Shannon,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.820
the spark.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:27.170
See?

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.450
Ah,

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:32.230
we have,

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.950
uh,

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.570
these three icons over here.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.350
We checked it.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:39.160
Uh huh.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.310
But see,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.960
it was white from outside.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.990
You could change it into blue from outside,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.830
not to check color overlay.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.620
Option C.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.370
I could have gone okay.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.560
And then I'll click on the sport and see it gets that color.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.050
And no need to use carnaroli option anymore.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:04.230
Even we can delete it and say goodbye to color overlay twice.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.410
I mean,

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:11.800
I double click I zooming on these objects and no need to used that one anymore for now.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.500
And the fairs,

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:12.930
I mean,

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:13.380
a stroke.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.830
I can actually It creates a shadow on it.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.420
It creates a border or somehow a line here.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.060
I don't need it for now.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.240
I am it the tico bill to And as you see,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.620
these two objects are lucky each other now other first I checked the bill icon.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.740
Then I go to the setting part of it.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.320
See,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.230
In style section we have some options.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.520
Like as in herbal.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.670
I mean bevel uh,

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.180
sorry.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.520
Outer bevel and bus.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.250
And it's left.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.980
These options will set different effects on your work.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.400
See,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.060
when we set it up as outer bevel,

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.020
it will be like these When we said it was interviewed Military little Ivies.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:59.420
And it has these style when you set it up as in bus and see the stone.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.380
And the last one is through campus.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.020
If you activate your stroke,

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.640
I can.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.890
This suit m bus style will be shown by itself,

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.810
but if not,

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:10.930
it won't be shown.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.450
I said that lies in herbal.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.200
That has been choosing before.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.690
You can use different percentages to have a different project.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:18.590
It is desirable,

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.900
and it's up to you.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.700
Use different percentages.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.220
Guys,

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.680
this is the size of it.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.780
It's the depths of it,

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.500
actually.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.450
And,

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.100
uh,

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.210
I said it as 350.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.750
Actually,

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.270
it is desirable.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.970
Uh huh.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.260
Ah,

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.070
on my soft and handle,

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.730
you can identify the softness of your project.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.050
So I said it has zero.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:56.660
I said my angles as 90 and 30.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.940
And actually,

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.580
you can set your desire bill angle.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.600
You can,

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.100
uh,

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:08.250
rotate it like these or set the number to set up their angle.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:08.790
Actually,

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:18.010
and I set it up as 90 end 30 and you can choose a desirable type of the glass counters from

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.950
these part,

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.960
and you can use these defaults in 40 shops after,

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.840
and actually,

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.450
we choose this one,

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.640
and in fact,

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.180
each one will change your object separately.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.890
And we have ah,

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:36.560
highlight mode on the shadow mood on these lower report.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:43.890
And I set them as normal before actually for the shop software said them as multi pie or

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.310
lighten as a default.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.690
Actually,

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:47.340
I think I don't know.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.180
I don't remember.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:48.660
Exactly.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.880
And I said color for each one.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.830
See,

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.190
some sanctions are dark,

00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:01.680
golden color and some of them or light golden color.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.340
And you must show these differences.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.530
If you want to choose the color are used,

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:13.650
you should use these code FTE 07 a any issue.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:18.200
Use a six C 55 0 A for dark parts.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.390
Of course,

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:19.870
if you want.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.690
Actually,

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.490
you can use any color you like,

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.290
uh,

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:25.830
like these Pinkel up.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.360
It's a peon caller right now.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.700
Let me cancel it.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.560
See?

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.630
So Okay,

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.760
let me cancel it.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.670
What is Estrich?

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.360
Let me show it.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.660
See,

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.450
uh,

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:52.690
I said 14 pixel s a size and I chose insight as the position off the object.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.230
If I choose outside,

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.670
if you put it out.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.910
But if I choose center,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:02.120
it will put half of it inside and half of it outside.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.260
So I used inside option to set it insight.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.140
We said it,

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.120
I was normal.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.740
And I said,

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:15.810
the opacity as 57 we can change it into 60 to have a round number,

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.070
as you see,

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.220
uh,

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.950
we have three icons here.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.940
Caller Aiken gives us monochrome style.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:28.050
A granny in Aiken gives us a color to spectrum.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.950
Thes icon is desirable.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:39.770
Even you can create a special color with it and we'll talk about it in the next courses.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.950
Okay,

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.280
uh,

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:50.890
we can set up their scale handle to create dark or life bond ary,

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.570
and it has angle option to you.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:34:00.450
You can set it on patron option to give a pattern assigned to your shape,

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.990
and you can use default patterns in the sport.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:12.840
We just used color option now to call a rate with these code 00 15 3 e Well,

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:22.940
we should check the bevel and see it colors a shape Let me decrease the size of
