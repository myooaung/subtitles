00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.910

We were at quite a bit on the navigation.



2

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.760

Now when I work on the Welcome screen before we continue with the more complex training screens for



3

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.640

the welcome screen I got a little bit of code attached which you can find at Hetchy this video which



4

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.780

I'll just put into this.



5

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.640

Tim I'll follow the welcome component HVM I'll file here this.



6

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.550

Now this is some aged e-mail with some text some passwords as you commonly see it on such Starling's



7

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.450

pages.



8

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.410

And if we have a look at it it looks all right but especially on bigger screens.



9

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.290

It looks really ugly.



10

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.310

So we can improve the styling and I will do this entirely with flex layout.



11

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.410

We actually won't have to put too much work into that.



12

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.660

One thing that would be nice would be to center it I guess.



13

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.610

So we should set up the layout and my idea is that the items are sitting next to each other on bigger



14

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.570

screens and below each other on smaller ones.



15

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.800

So we could say the default set up is Cullin to well just as it is right now to position them beneath



16

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.930

each other.



17

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.730

Then I want to add F X.



18

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:21.140

Lay out a line and set this to center centered centered on both the cross and the main axis or other



19

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.460

way around main and cross.



20

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.320

So that this is all centered.



21

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.870

Finally we got this welcome class.



22

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390

So why don't we use it as is.



23

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.920

C S S class here and set text align to center so that the text is also centered and not sitting on the



24

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.500

left.



25

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560

Does looks good on small screens on bigger ones.



26

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.750

Why don't we position this next to each other though.



27

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.420

That is why we can use the responsive features of flex layout to change column to row on bigger screens.



28

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.360

And this is a little challenge or task for you.



29

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.010

You learned how to do that or at least alter where to look.



30

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.480

It's all about adding some notation to ethics layout.



31

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.470

You saw this earlier in the course and I want you to basically add a second eFax layout where you set



32

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.160

this to row four big or very big screens.



33

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.430

Try this on your own.



34

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.230

I'll show you my solution in a few seconds.



35

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.680

Where is accessible.



36

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.670

Let's try it together.



37

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.920

I'll add a second eFax lay out and set it to row.



38

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:37.290

Now if I do this and leave it like this then as you can see the second one wins on all devices.



39

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.060

However I only want this to be the case on very big screens not on small ones.



40

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:51.690

So what I'll do is all actually ethics lay out and I'll add G.T. LG here as notation.



41

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.270

This means four screens greater than large as to find by the break points by just peg edge you can find



42

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.670

the exact breakpoints in their documentation only for large or very large screens.



43

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.740

We'll switch to a Rollei and if I save this and go back you see everything is positioned beneath each



44

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.480

hover.



45

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.990

If I entry's the size here and I have to increase it even more than I have a whale here when I'm Sundin's



46

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.630

all quickly sumed out self-assumed out and a Danding Trista's then a chum's next to each other.



47

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.930

And actually since I have to surmount quite a bit I guess we can make the chomp a bit earlier.



48

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.060

So let me go back in here.



49

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.120

And let me make this jump already ofter medium sized screens so greater than medium sized will switch



50

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.180

to row then we still have everything we need over here.



51

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.080

But if I increase the size here it goes next to each other very close next to each other though.



52

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.650

So why don't we also add F X lay out Gap.



53

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.430

You're also only for a greater than medium sized screens of let's say 20 pixels.



54

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.360

If we do that then we got no gap here.



55

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.910

It's the same as before.



56

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.700

But for very big screens you see there's a little bit of spacing in between.



57

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.960

So I guess this is a setup with which we can live and which looks all right with that we can leave the



58

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.860

welcome component.



59

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.090

We had a little bit of more practice of the Flex layout classes which I guess are pretty straightforward



60

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.470

to use once you use them a little bit more.



61

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.390

And with that let's continue onto the training components.
