00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.390

Now with all the time spent on the welcome component and so on.



2

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.670

It's time to go on to the training component.



3

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.340

Let's close all our sections and open the training section and then we get current new and past trainings.



4

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.030

Now we'll work on past training Slater first.



5

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.290

We need a training.



6

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.010

And before we can see a current training we need to be able to set one up.



7

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.420

So why don't we start with the new training and now we all got that training component here right.



8

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.020

Is Paran components so to say of the whole section.



9

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.580

Now my idea is the following a one I use some tabs here that we get a tap's component where we can switch



10

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.160

between set up a new training or view past trainings.



11

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.630

So that is what I want to do implement some tabs year in the training component.



12

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.810

Let's go back to the official documentation and let's look for Tapps.



13

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.460

Here they are under layout.



14

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580

There we find the taps component.



15

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.450

We see an example of how this works and looks.



16

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.220

As always you can inspect the source code and you can read more about different use cases and different



17

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.600

adjustments you can make to that component.



18

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.780

In general there's one specific case which might be interesting to you and that's tap's navigation where



19

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.140

you should use this special syntax for setting up navigation at the taps.



20

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.030

Now if you're not planning on using tabs as navigation do you approach shown at the beginning as to



21

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.770

what you want to use with Matt tap room instead of is Neph element with Matt have nav bar in our project



22

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.030

you could actually use both.



23

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.620

We could set up some different routes for setting up a new training or doing past trainings.



24

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.610

I want to use a single route approach here though to show this first way of using it.



25

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.210

But it's ultimately of course up to you which one you want to use.



26

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.230

What we will do is since I want to use the first approach is that I will grab this set up cohered this



27

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.860

example code and then walk you through it.



28

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.090

So let's take that code here and put it into the training component like this.



29

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.460

Now as always the components here are not recognized because we haven't added them to our project yet.



30

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.910

Let's go back to the material module and simply add the mat tab module mat tab module excuse me added



31

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:37.270

like this and then add it here to imports and two exports and with that added We can go back to the



32

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.050

training component.



33

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.530

And in this component and the training component.



34

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.520

Now these will actually be recognized we can already see that if we go back to our application and we



35

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.550

switch to training.



36

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.330

Here are the taps and we can switch between them and I will actually leave the set up as this year spanning



37

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.430

the full width.



38

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.220

Of course you could restrict the width by assigning a with to match tab group or using flex layout in



39

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.430

some sort.



40

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.250

However I want to have that full screen look I won't name my taps Tab 1 and 2 instead I will have a



41

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.060

new training or new exercise maybe.



42

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.190

And here I will have past exercises.



43

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.500

Now the part between Matt's tab your content one and content two is not what's on the labels of the



44

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.090

tabs but actually what gets loaded when a tab is selected.



45

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.210

So if we go back we see content one here for the first tab and content to forward a second.



46

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.000

Of course I don't want to have Clinton one in Canton to hear I want to have my new training component



47

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.190

and my past trainings component.



48

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.730

So I will replace contemned one with new training.



49

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.150

This is the selector of this new training component.



50

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.410

So that's added as a component here and for content too.



51

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:11.580

I want to use the selector of past trainings which is at past tradings this one so I'll add this here



52

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.260

like that.



53

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.150

With that if we go back we can also still twitch.



54

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.060

But now between new training and past tradings.



55

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.720

So this is our tabs working.



56

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.920

Now the goal is to ensure that we actually well see more than just new training works here.



57

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.520

Let's start with the new training and let's start editing it.



58

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.620

Let's have a look at what we can add here in the next lecture.
