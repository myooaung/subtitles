00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.840

We finished installation and I now want to finally dive into adding some components so that we get a



2

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.150

feeling for how this works.



3

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.650

If you go to the components page on dangler material page you see there are loads of components you



4

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.060

can use and we will dive into quite a lot of them throughout the course.



5

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.400

Let's start with a Robert simple one just to see how it works.



6

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.100

Let's start with a normal button.



7

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.750

You can find it down there under buttons and indicators and if you click on it this is how you can dive



8

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.810

into components.



9

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.760

You got an article with an overview over component where the general usage is explained and how it works



10

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.390

what the idea behind it is.



11

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.180

You then have an API.



12

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.750

With the detailed instructions the detailed guidance about the different attributes or properties you



13

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.030

can bind events which are emitted and so on.



14

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.420

And one or more examples as you can see here for the button we got quite a lot of different ways of



15

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.330

using it.



16

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.940

Let's start using it in a very simple way.



17

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.280

And let's expand the source code of this example to see how it's used as can see for the button here



18

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.830

and that's different for the different material the signed components for the button.



19

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.480

We just use a regular button where we then add is Matt button attribute.



20

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.850

Now does attribute is actually the selector of the material button component behind the scenes.



21

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.670

We don't see that but I can tell you that this is the case and this will then turn a regular button



22

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.290

into a button that looks and behaves like a material designed button.



23

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.940

So with this ripple effect and so on.



24

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.400

And actually if you scroll down you can see that you can't just use matte button or you got more options



25

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.440

to be precise.



26

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.980

You could also add match rased but then so on for different styles.



27

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.760

Let's take a look.



28

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.390

Let's go to the app component HDMI file and delete everything there.



29

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.450

And let's add a new element which is just a regular button like this.



30

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.340

Click me the Judas button I'll add Matt button as we saw it like this.



31

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.380

And now let's save this and run ngi serve.



32

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.550

Now this will spin up the development server here in this project and will host and run our application



33

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.210

here or wherever I get an error and if we have a look at the error message it's telling me to the contrary



34

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.200

sold the prebuilt theme.



35

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.160

This might be a bug because actually the pop should be correct but turns out that you can fix this error



36

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.160

by removing this sign here.



37

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.200

Distilled at the beginning if you do this it compiles successfully so do that if you face the same error.



38

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.430

With that let's go back and let's open localhost 4200.



39

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.850

And you should see a button this button here can be clicked.



40

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.890

But be honest it's not looking dead material design like.



41

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.860

Now here we don't even get an error message but actually something is wrong in our project for every



42

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.940

material design component you want to use.



43

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.580

And we just don't get an error here because this one happens to be added as an attribute and not as



44

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.260

an element.



45

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.420

We have such components too.



46

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.250

So for every component that we want to use we have to add an import.



47

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.570

We have to import a module and I will do this in the material that Manahil file.



48

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.310

You could do it in the app module but I want to keep all my material component related imports in this



49

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.970

extra file.



50

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:42.090

So here I will add an import statement at top and import mat button module from at angular slash material



51

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.580

like this.



52

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.020

We don't have to add this module here to imports.



53

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:55.830

But module and to exports we have to add it to export so that we can use it in a number module where



54

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.980

we import this material module.



55

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.500

In our case that's Yapp module.



56

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.450

With that the button is unlocked.



57

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.030

Now we save that all of a sudden it looks differently.



58

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.990

And if I click this we got this ripple effect.



59

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.570

Now I can also show you dead.



60

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.160

We can use a different way of using this by adding Matt rased button here is like this.



61

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.410

And you can find Doesn't the documentation I show you a second ago now does all of a sudden looks like



62

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.680

a race button and we can also give this a special color.



63

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.650

Now this is special to the button here and you see under filming that you can set a color property.



64

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.430

This is not possible on every component but it is possible on this one so we can add a color property



65

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.580

and set this to accent for example all possible values can be found in the documentation you can access



66

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.570

that primary accent or worn.



67

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.350

Now if you go back you'll see it has this axent color all of a sudden this nice ripple effect.



68

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.090

And this is our first material design component used.



69

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.830

Now we get more components of course.



70

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.460

And another component which I want to add is the Iken component we did add Aikins after all.



71

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.530

Now kits are used in a really simple way.



72

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.660

We use the math I can component and now here you see an example for a component it's used like an h



73

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.500

tim l element and then the name of the can you want to use and you can find all available Aikins by



74

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.130

simply googling for material Aikins and opening the page that you find thereafter.



75

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.500

And on this page you can search but you can also scroll down and see the icons.



76

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.210

And if you click on one it's dys name here which you want to use as I can name a name with a space you



77

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.130

want to replace the space with an underscore.



78

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.780

Let's see this in action let's go back to the fitness tracker.



79

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.470

And let's actually add ikan to our button.



80

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.210

So for that I'll add Matt.



81

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:04.500

I can hear inside of the bottom and actually for this button if you go back to the button page you would



82

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:12.330

then also add the mad icon button selector here instead of match race button so that I can button color



83

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.810

X on this.



84

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.070

OK and let's add does home symbol here.



85

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:24.790

For example if you save this and you go back to your running application you should get an error window



86

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.800

because Mad I can this new selector I added this element here is unknown and you learn how to fix it.



87

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.130

So let's go ahead and fix it on your own case you don't know how it works.



88

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.860

We have to add an import to material module.



89

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.090

We have to import a mat ikan module and that's a general name how these modules are named.



90

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:54.080

They're basically de-select or just in this notation with us starting uppercase character and all Suppe



91

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.740

words starting with upper case characters and then we add this also to imports and exports.



92

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.970

So mad I can module is added to both.



93

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:09.960

And with that if we go back to Paris gone and we got a button that now is an icon cool.



94

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.010

And this is how we work with the material components.



95

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.200

Now of course we're not here to just lay around and use all these icons and all these components you



96

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.460

find in the official documentation.



97

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.220

This is a good source though for you to learn more about the components you need in your app.



98

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.720

But hey we wanted to build a project in this course so let's do so now.



99

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.690

And let's start building something more useful and start building a real angular app.
