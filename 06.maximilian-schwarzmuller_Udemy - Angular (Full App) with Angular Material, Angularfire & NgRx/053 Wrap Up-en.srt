00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,880
If we look around in our application we got a Sign-Up screen a log in screen and a training screen and

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,420
all of that.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,730
Of course also in our response.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,130
Let's lay out here.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:25,430
Now we can start a training do our dialogue here where we want to quit or not and never quit or continue.

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,180
So this is all working.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,500
Now one thing is missing.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,210
Obviously if we quit here we don't see past exercises.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,390
We got no content here.

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:45,070
Now before we add days where we will use a really cool and behind the scenes more complex to us not

11
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,240
really complex component.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,610
I wonder why are all these things up with real data and use less dummy data.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,620
Time to add some services and make sure that everything interacts smoothly once this is done we will

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:06,700
implement does table component and thereafter we'll all see how we can actually connect everything to

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,720
the Internet.

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,390
So the next module is time to wire everything up.
