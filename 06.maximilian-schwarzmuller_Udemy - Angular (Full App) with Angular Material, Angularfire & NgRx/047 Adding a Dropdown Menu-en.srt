1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:09,280
With our cart finished let's replace select type of training with a drop down where we can select which

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,860
kind of training we want to do.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,650
For this let's have a look at the official documentation again and we can find a dropdown under form

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,590
controls this select component.

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,080
It does this how it will look like.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,790
And this is exactly what I want to use now here again we got a lot of documentation about how you may

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:39,740
styli it and find a unit to your needs to make it fit perfectly into your form and do exactly what you

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,730
want to do.

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,260
For example you can also add multi-select for drop downs you are not limited to drop downs where you

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,550
can only select one.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,390
You can add groups as you can see here.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,620
And so on.

13
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,430
There are a lot of things you can do.

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,800
We will use a relatively simple window but later we will populated dynamically.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:05,410
So this a basic select and at its most basic form as you can see it just uses a map form field.

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,950
Then Matz is select which is interesting because it's never an input nor a text area.

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:18,650
But behind the scenes there's also a valid form element which is accepted by metaphor and field and

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,520
then we just have options in there.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,020
And this looks a lot like a normal HVM select element with the options inside of it just with the matte

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,030
prefix in the end.

21
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,120
So this is what we want to at last.

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,930
Copied over into our cart and walk through it.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,940
We got the math form field to be able to show errors or hints and get a floating label and to register

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,690
this correctly the angular forms then we get the math select and demand option component.

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:56,000
Both are unknown right now because we haven't added the appropriate module to our material module on

26
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:02,060
the so that we can specify the placeholder which will be a label that floats up when we start selecting

27
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,850
and mad option here and this example is actually already populated dynamically with the energy for loop.

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,180
We will do this later too.

29
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,420
But for now let's simply start by well hard coding this all in there.

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,050
So the first option I want to use is let's say crunches.

31
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,710
So here I'll assign a value of crunches for now.

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,290
This is the first exercise I want to support.

33
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:42,190
Then next option I want to add are touch toes also update the value.

34
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,120
And thereafter I want to add side lungis.

35
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,780
And of course feel free to add your favorites torturing mechanisms here.

36
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,530
The last one I'll add is a bird piece.

37
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,550
Certainly the worst of all of them.

38
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,100
So let's add them here.

39
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,540
And again this is something we will populate dynamically later.

40
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,990
We have one problem to fix though unlocking the select component.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,760
And you know how this works.

42
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:20,540
We go to material module in there we add a new import at the very top of Mat select module.

43
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,370
You don't need to import the options module or a component separately because it's part of the Select

44
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,990
module which makes sense I guess because the option belongs to the select and the other way around.

45
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,090
So we'll add to imports and exports.

46
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,350
Once that's done we can save it and look at our result.

47
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,450
So let's go back to our application.

48
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:50,590
We can already see this drop down where we can select different exercises.

49
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,240
Now in my opinion the card doesn't look that great though there's certainly there are certainly things

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,710
you can do.

51
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:06,350
I think it would make sense to center everything centered tidal center the button centered dropdown

52
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,960
and we can easily Centra everything with flex lay out of course.

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,000
Now we can simply add ethics lay out a line to match car title and set the center.

54
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,170
You can also add F X layout here first but actually you don't need to do that.

55
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,900
It will then automatically Turdus to a row orientated layout.

56
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,120
With that we see the title is centered.

57
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:39,990
Now we can clearly copy that and do the same for the Matt card content and the Matt card actions.

58
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,570
Now everything is centered in our card and looks much better.

59
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,060
One thing that's not looking good is on smaller screens.

60
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,290
The card is too white.

61
00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:00,310
So what we should actually do is we should give this card a width of 400 pixels only on big screens

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,490
or put a number words on small or very small screens to be precise.

63
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,780
I want to set this to 100 percent and not to 400 pixels by doing it like this.

64
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:19,090
The card spends the full width on small screens as you can see but only has 400 pixels on bigger screens.

65
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,550
And with that this card is now finished.

66
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,890
You can of course colored this button if you want.

67
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,520
You can choose different actions.

68
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:34,000
The only thing I want to adjust is I want to give this new training section here some styling in my

69
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,010
C Ss class for C-s is filed for new training.

70
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:44,170
I want to add some padding of 30 pixels from top and bottom so that this actually looks more like a

71
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,040
card.

72
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:52,090
And now we really got a nice look here where we got our card where we hit start and where we will soon

73
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,520
see our ongoing training.

74
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,930
Let's implement these ongoing training in the next lecture.
