00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.660

So in the last lecture we added the sign up and sign in the firebase way.



2

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.890

And now our app is kind of broken because we no longer store a user.



3

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.130

No I will no longer store one here.



4

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.390

I will instead store is off which is a boolean in which initially should be false.



5

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.440

Now is is all the method name.



6

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.290

Let's name it is authenticated to not have any conflicts here.



7

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.820

So is if any code is a boolean.



8

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.900

If we do log in successfully here off successfully is called.



9

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.760

So in all successfully here I want to set that this is often dictated to true.



10

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:49.530

And in log out I want to set it to false and this means I can remove this user assignment here and in



11

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.360

get user I can get rid of that.



12

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.990

That won't work is all on yabber hand hearable return.



13

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.570

This is authenticate it.



14

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.180

If we save this then we go back to our application.



15

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.130

Let's now try to log in again with valid credentials.



16

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.340

Now it works.



17

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.110

Now we can navigate around again.



18

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.210

This is one way of doing this and it's not necessarily the worst but we will face an issue if we actually



19

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.170

start working with protected resources on the server.



20

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.830

If we lock down our firebase database so the firestorm database then we will need to prove to dad back



21

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.780

and so to firebase that we are offending hated and sending a single Boulia and it's not enough because



22

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.410

anyone could do that.



23

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.170

Instead we will need to send a token debts issued to us by firebase.



24

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.050

Let's have a look at what I mean with that and how authentication and single page applications actually



25

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.740

works.
