00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.540

Where are you successful let's solve this together.



2

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.080

We got our training service and to use it in that new training component we need to inject that there.



3

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.790

Now what do we need to do to inject the service provided first.



4

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.910

So we should go to the app module and provide the service there.



5

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.690

So in there you will need to add Diom or at all.



6

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.270

Let my ID do that though so I will directly go to the providers array and provide the training service.



7

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.880

By the way if you're wondering whether this module is growing a bit too much I think it's still fine



8

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.920

but of course we can also split it.



9

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.350

This is something we can do at a later point when we optimize this app.



10

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.290

So for now I provide the training service and the provider's array of the app module and we also add



11

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.650

the import trading service from the training folder and then to training got service file with that



12

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.700

provided here.



13

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.010

We can go to the new training component and inject that there.



14

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.160

By the way I'm getting an error here and you surf should actually fix this.



15

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.090

Sometimes it just hangs up in the new training component.



16

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.650

I now want to inject this training service or bind that to a private property named training service



17

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.320

of type training service this type is of course important for angular as dependency injection and we



18

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.630

need to import this type at the top from detraining dot Certis file which we can find directly in the



19

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.920

training folder the file we created a second ago with that inject that we can now access the away label



20

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.780

trainings and use them in our training component.



21

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:50.120

For this I'm going to add a property trainings which will be of type or maybe exercises which will be



22

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.940

of type exercise.



23

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.780

Make sure to import this type 2 and of course not just the exercise but of exercise array.



24

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.580

Initially its an empty array an engine in it which is of course executed right at the start of the lifecycle



25

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.980

of this component.



26

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.350

All assigned this exercise is to this training service extra wearable exercises.



27

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.560

Now one thing we can improve is that in the training service available exercises is publicly accessible



28

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.280

and since its an array we could edit it from anywhere in the app so we could also turn this into a private



29

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:41.230

property and add a helper method get a way lable EXOR sizes where we return this available exercises



30

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.640

slice the slice method will create a real copy of that array for the same reason I mentioned earlier



31

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.740

with the reference type problematic for objects.



32

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.170

Its the same for arrays and by calling slice we create a new array which can be edited without affecting



33

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.880

the old one.



34

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.780

So with that back in training we should actually reach out to get a weight exercises execute these get



35

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.820

an array of exercises and store Dad and the exercises property.



36

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.310

Now Indee new training template we can use that to dynamically create our mad option components.



37

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.700

So Im going to get rid of all of them but one and that one component will be well used in conjunction



38

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:36.320

with and you for there I will execute this loop for all my exercises.



39

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.010

So lead exercise of exercises will loop through all them and now we got that local exercise variable



40

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.350

which I want to use here.



41

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:57.610

On the value there I will assign exercise ID and here I want to output exercise name.



42

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.590

Keep in mind our exercise model has both an ID and a name.



43

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.400

What that lets save all these files and go back to the running application let's quickly log in with



44

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.070

any data you want.



45

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.370

And now you can see here we get the same values as before but this now actually coming from our service.



46

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.440

Cool.



47

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:26.140

The next step is to take that information we select here over to the actually running exercise so that



48

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.100

we got the duration calculated on the duration of the exercise and so on.



49

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.760

Let's do this in the next lecture.
