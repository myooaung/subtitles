1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,080
So let's dive into angular material now.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:16,140
What is angular material angular material is a third party package which you can use in angular projects.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,670
It's developed by a team which is part of the official English team you could say.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,760
And in its core it's one thing and angular components.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,910
Now what does this mean.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,030
It means it's a collection of three built and styled angular components components as you could belt

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,560
them on your own in your project.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,800
You obviously build your entire angular app from components.

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:49,410
Well here you get a package of a lot of components you commonly need in angular abs or in any apps and

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:56,370
these components follow the material design spec which is the design spec created by Google a couple

11
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,700
of years ago which they use in their Android operating system and which is all really popular in the

12
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,430
web.

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,410
Now one important note using Engler material does not mean did you don't create any components on your

14
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,300
own anymore.

15
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,720
You will still build your application of your own components.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,520
But if you need something like let's say a tap's component or a button that follows the material design

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,240
spec enhanced is ripple effect when you click it or something like this.

18
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,260
Then there is a component in the angular material package which you can't just import into your project

19
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,780
and use it if you don't have to trade on your own because some of these components like for example

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,740
tabs where you can switch between different content to be displayed.

21
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,970
Of course are a bit more complex behind the scenes angle material also is something else or actually

22
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,010
can be thought of as two packages.

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:02,220
You got one package which focuses on let's call it component building utilities and we get a second

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,150
package which Dan has a concrete component implementations using that material the signed spec.

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:15,390
The first feature set is bundled in a package called angler's CDK CDK stands for component development

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,190
kit.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,490
Now this does not include any angular material styling.

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,590
This does not include the concrete component implementations.

29
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:31,440
This has a lot of utility and helper methods and classes for example for rendering overlays for positioning

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,660
elements and some raw.

31
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,840
Components like for example a data table which is a very complex component behind the scenes.

32
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,770
You will always use both when working with angular material though because the second package here which

33
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,780
has two concrete implementations is the one you import under angular material.

34
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,550
This is the package which gives you access to all these Angelyn material components which will have

35
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:04,020
a look at the second which are restyled and which behind the scenes build up on that CDK kit or on that

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,650
CDK package I should say.

37
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,160
Which is why you need that as a dependency.

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,940
Now let's take a closer look at what's in there or what the angle material package comprises.
