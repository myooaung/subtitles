1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,490
We added the data table in the last lecture.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,560
Now let's add sorting faltering and Page anation to it.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,650
Let's start with sorting so that we can conveniently sort by calories duration whatever we want to do

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:24,510
to add sorting we need to work both on D.H. female code of our data table as well as the types code.

5
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,870
Let's start with H.T. mail.

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,780
First of all we have to add the math sword directive to the math table.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:39,390
This makes it sortable so to say we don't have to define by which letters we can sort because by default

8
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,250
no header no column is sortable and that's a good thing.

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:51,620
Some columns don't make for good sorting columns so which columns do we want to sort by maybe the date.

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,630
Well then we add a special directive to the mat hetero's cell component and that directives the mat

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,420
Saward header.

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,020
Actually this is not a directive but a component selector to be precise.

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,960
So we added two matched headers cell.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,830
You add this header dis selector to all columns.

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:19,140
I want you want to sort so my case I also want to sort by name by calories and by duration and also

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,820
by state.

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,100
So for me it is all columns but this is not a must.

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,640
You can also just use some of the columns.

19
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,970
So with that we added this sorting logic here.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:39,890
Now we just need to do something in our typescript file for the past training component dare we need

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,990
to attach some special property of data source to our math or direct.

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,170
If we added in the component so to this directive you're now behind the scenes.

23
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,930
A lot of things are happening.

24
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,330
It's basically finding out which headers should be sortable and we'll connect everything and we do set

25
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,320
up this connection by getting a reference to our.

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:09,640
Matt Saward directive for this we can use view child which as you know gives you a way of getting access

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,370
to elements to find in your template in your types of file.

28
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,670
So here I will add at viewer child and I want to get access to Matt sort.

29
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,980
You need to import this from angular material.

30
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:32,440
This is referring to the math or directive which we added to the table here now by accessing it with

31
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,860
the future we don't get access to the entire table.

32
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,510
This directive is sitting on.

33
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:45,090
But really just the underlying sorting set up angular material in forwards for us due to this combination

34
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,010
of math or the math or whatever so of store days underlying configuration to put it like this are stored

35
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,390
in a sort property the name is totally up to you though which will be of type mapped sort.

36
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,620
So to type we're selecting here with you child.

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:09,330
Now we need to assign this to data source so that we can't do this NGO on it though because we're fetching

38
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,140
this from the template and the template is not done rendering at this point of time.

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,980
So I'll use a different lifecycle look after the you init.

40
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,960
This needs to be imported from an angle or a coworker.

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,610
So let's quickly add the import here off to review and Annette and this forces us to at end offer ofter

42
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,140
view in the method here which executes once that is done rendering and initializing.

43
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,500
So here I will then set this data source sort.

44
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,200
A property that data source object has equal to this sort.

45
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,270
So to this configuration we fetch from the template so to say and that is all.

46
00:03:53,270 --> 00:04:03,050
Now if we go back to the running application and again quickly log in and simply stop a couple of exercises

47
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:15,440
so that we have something to view we do that then we see we get to exercises and no sorting mechanism.

48
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:19,540
We also have no error what's going wrong.

49
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:27,290
This is something you can easily mess up or simply not not know the max table component which include

50
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:34,240
it by adding the math table module in the material module does not include sorting page anation and

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,190
filtering.

52
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,910
We simply have to add these imports separately and it's very deceiving.

53
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,630
We don't even get a warning if we don't do that.

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,640
So here we have to add the math source module.

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,900
And as with all the other modules we have to add it to imports.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,320
And of course all due to exports to make it available to Iran.

57
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:03,480
Now with that we can go back and do this thing again quickly log in with some dummy data and get an

58
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,660
error here.

59
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:13,660
The reason you know the reason is Matt sored header is incorrectly added to energy container here should

60
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,520
be to the Mad Hatter's sell a component in all cases of course.

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,760
So that was a weak error here.

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,690
Make sure to not make this error but now you see well there's this one thing that can go wrong.

63
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:33,050
But now with that fixed if we log in again now we should be able to run a bunch of crunches.

64
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,760
Stop this.

65
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,410
You don't need to wait for that.

66
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,630
Start with a piece and also stop that.

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:47,410
And now under past exercises we can actually sort by Callard a duration excuse me by calories by state

68
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,350
which is the same your name.

69
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,760
And of course the date and here to date looks the same but 10 minutes and so on are also saved.

70
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,520
That is why we can sort by that.

71
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:04,840
So DNA is sorting which works out the box with a few adjustments and additions in the next lecture.

72
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,340
We'll have a look at filtering.
