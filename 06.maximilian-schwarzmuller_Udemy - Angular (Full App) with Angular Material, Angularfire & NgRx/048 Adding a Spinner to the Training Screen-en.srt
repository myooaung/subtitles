1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,690
Knouted we are prepared to start a new training.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,160
I actually want to well do just that show some interface 40 running exercise and I want to show the

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,720
interface instead of does tap group here.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:25,850
So in the training component I want to add my app current training here below the tap grew and with

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,530
app current training I'm of course referring to this current training component.

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,510
Now there there isn't much right.

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,020
It's a pretty empty component.

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,830
And right now I'm always showing this if my saved as we always see it below.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,020
The new exercise repasts past exercise below the Tass.

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,830
This is something that should change and for dental.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:53,000
First of all add a property to the training component which will ne ongoing training and initially it's

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,550
false and it will be set to true whenever we chose a training so whenever we have a running training

13
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:06,440
and to be informed about this choice I'll add an event dimeter in new training that should fire.

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,580
Whenever this button is clicked and later we'll also turn this into a forum.

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,450
But for now I'll simply name was on start training like that.

16
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:23,020
And in new training I will now import U-bend emitter and output.

17
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,030
You saw this pattern already.

18
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,960
All named event training start and create a new event emitter.

19
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,700
There I will eventually also submit.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,830
Which kind of training was started but for now let's just emit nothing and start some dummy training

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:48,320
and then I'll add my ADD output decorator now and new training where we click on this button we call

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,890
on start training so let's implement this method and then this method all reach out to training start

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,390
and call emit.

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,750
With that the training is starting and the next step now is to react to the event in the training component

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,980
which is where we use the new training component.

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,610
There we can now implement our newly created training start event whenever it fires.

27
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:22,830
I want to set ongoing training to true so here that ongoing training to true.

28
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:30,110
I will then use ongoing training as an indicator to wherever I want to show this tap group or this component

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:38,320
group should be shown with NGF which I can of course also add to angle the material components.

30
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,940
This should only be shown if we have no ongoing training so if this is false then I want to show this

31
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,980
step through.

32
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,410
If we do have ongoing training then I want to.

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,980
Whoops that's the wrong place.

34
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,760
Then I want to show the current training component with this setup in place.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,380
We now don't see that current training component.

36
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,140
But if I click start then we do see it.

37
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,800
Now this is where I want to work on.

38
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,780
I want to work on this component so that here we have a nice little interface which basically has a

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,290
progress bar or something like that which counts down and finishes once it's done and which also gives

40
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,090
us a cancel button so that we can of course cancel the training whenever we want.

41
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:34,700
For that let's head over into current training and then I'll add a new section in this section.

42
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,860
I want to display a spinner and the current progress as well as some modal weighting phrase maybe.

43
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,900
I also want to add a button that allows me to stop the training.

44
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,110
Now let's have a look at the official docs and look for a fitting progress indicator.

45
00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:03,080
If we scroll down then we get there's progress Spener and all these spinners as well as the progress

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:10,010
bars are available indeterminate and indeterminate modes so indeterminate modes are of course the right

47
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:10,370
choice.

48
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,650
If you don't know how long something is going to take and you want to show some progress indicator the

49
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,810
determinant question is a good choice.

50
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,480
If you well do you know how long it will take.

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,230
In our case that's the case.

52
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,640
So I want to show such a spinner as you can see the code is pretty straight forward.

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:36,830
So in my current training component I will implement the mat spinner but well to be precise I want to

54
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,950
implement mat progress spinner because that's the one I can turn to be determinate.

55
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,840
So let's implement mat progress spinner and mode should be determinate.

56
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
That's important.

57
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:59,310
This also requires me to then set the values between 0 and 100 to basically tell the spinner what to

58
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,700
render which progress to render.

59
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,080
But before we can do anything of that kind we need to unlock it right.

60
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:17,500
So same procedure as every year we go to the material module and in there we at the mat progress Spetner

61
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,600
module.

62
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:27,060
This one and then added two imports and add it to exports.

63
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,430
With that we can go back to current training and we get to the mat progress spinner.

64
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,070
Now as I said if the mode is to terminate we all need to set a value.

65
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,960
This could be for example 20 for 20 percent.

66
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,590
Now we also have to close that spinner and with that if we have a look at our application and we start

67
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:53,160
this we see a progress Bynner dats 20 percent into well it's full round.

68
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,380
That's a good start.

69
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,840
It looks a bit ugly I'd say and I want to have more content of course.

70
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,700
Let's work on the ugly part.

71
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,400
We know how to fix this right.

72
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,560
We had eFax layout equals Cullom here to the section because I want to position elements from top to

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,940
bottom lets say F X.

74
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,430
Lay out a line is censures center so that everything is centered horizontally and vertically.

75
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,770
And with that this already looks a bit better.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,040
Would be nice to push this a bit further down though to do that all simply gift is a class of current

77
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,330
training and just as I added a padding of 30 pixels to new training.

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,720
I'll do the same for current trading with that if we have a look at is does looks know better.

79
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,330
Now of course it's not really counting up and a lot of information is missing.

80
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,330
So back to the HTL quote below the progress spinner.

81
00:06:52,410 --> 00:07:00,240
Let's add some text where we can say we're output the progress so we'll have to replace this with some

82
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,890
dynamic value as we will have to do with forward progress spinner.

83
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,410
Overall then I won't have a motivating phrase like keep on going.

84
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,900
You can do it and there after.

85
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,950
I want to have a button.

86
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:24,510
Maybe the match rased button with a color of X and which says stop so that we can stop this trading

87
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,580
if we absolutely can't continue.

88
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,450
So now it looks like this.

89
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,390
This interface is coming along quite nicely.

90
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,180
Now I want to ensure that we get some progress that's actually well progressing.

91
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:45,910
To ensure this will add a property cutis component and later this will be bound from outside.

92
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,630
Right now let's set it to Ciro initially and hardcoded in here and in NGO in it.

93
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,760
I want to kick off an intro will that increases that progress.

94
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:10,840
So in here I want to call said entrail well execute a method every let's say second and in that method

95
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,300
I want to set this progress to this progress.

96
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,410
Last fight.

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,480
So now we'll basically grow by 5 percent every second.

98
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,810
So overall it should take 20 seconds to complete.

99
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,260
Now you see something I need to go back to the HDMI the code and actually bind value of the mad progress

100
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,770
spinner to our newly created progress property and also output death here below the spinner.

101
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,510
So output progress percent year.

102
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:54,690
Now that we have a look we start this is see counting up every second.

103
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,360
It's increasing by 5.

104
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,120
Now this is nice.

105
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,260
Would be nice if we could all stop it though and would also be nice if it finishes when it reaches 100.

106
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,700
Because right now well see for yourself it continues growing.

107
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,560
So let's implement these two things in the next lecture.
