1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,060
So let's add a form to the new training component a technically a form wouldn't be required though.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,910
I just want to show that you can use it in conjunction with a card you could of course also add your

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,210
own click listener as we have it here and some passed the value of that select dropdown.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:29,840
I will use a foreign though so I will wrap my entire mat cart here with a form close it after and I

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:40,080
will use to template driven approach which is easily used by assigning Engy model to the math select

6
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,070
component not the option but to math select does how you use it in a form.

7
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:54,060
And since I'm using the template or of the protocols and to assign a name dessous the exercise you can

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,680
of course pick any name you want.

9
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:08,030
So if that were binding this now all that needs to be done is add and you submit to the forum and call

10
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:15,110
on start training here a method we already have and get access to the forum by storing it in a local

11
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,230
reference and assigning any form as a value.

12
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,980
This gives us access to the underlying automatically created foreign.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,260
Now I'm passing the form so does local reference to On-Star training and on the button.

14
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,880
This means that I can remove the click listener.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:38,590
Instead I'll add the disabled binding here and set the button to disabled if form is invalid.

16
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,100
To make sure that it can be invalid.

17
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,010
I will go to Matt select and add required so that I have to select a value before it works.

18
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,650
Now back in the new training component here we get the form which is of type Engy form actually we have

19
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,460
to import data type Angi form from at a singular forms.

20
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,910
And this forum will now give us access to de-selected ID.

21
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:17,970
So here I can simply pass for him Dot value dot and that it was an exercise.

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:27,190
That was the name of the input we used here the name we assigned to the math select component with this

23
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,920
we're passing this on to the service.

24
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,350
And this should now all lead to our application to work again.

25
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,160
Well let's try this all out.

26
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,070
Let's log in and if we don't like that thing I can click the button so this works.

27
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,060
Now if I click this button however or choose something I can start this works fine.

28
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:57,250
One thing I noticed is in your training it still says favorite food here on the Select dropdown it should

29
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,990
be choose exercise.

30
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,600
Now with that we get this set up we're using the service to start a new training.

31
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:13,180
We're not using one to stop the training and we're not using the data off the select service in our

32
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,500
current training component.

33
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,480
We still have dummy data there.

34
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,450
So let's update this in the next lecture.
