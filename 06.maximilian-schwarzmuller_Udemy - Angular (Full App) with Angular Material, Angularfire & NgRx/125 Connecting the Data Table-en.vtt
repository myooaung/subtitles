00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:11.040

Let's work on the past trainings now here in past trainings we also of course use the data from our



2

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.650

training service thus far.



3

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:20.370

And we should switch this to our observable based approach using and g are x switching is relatively



4

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.180

simple though.



5

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:32.110

We of course as always need to import our store again so we import to store from at Engy our X slash



6

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:41.760

store and then we need our training reducers so ask from training from dot slash or going up a couple



7

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.110

of levels one level training reducer.



8

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.280

So these two things you always import here.



9

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.530

Then we inject the stores so private store of type store which uses from training state as the state



10

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.210

it will give us in the end.



11

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.490

And with that story inject that here where we set up the subscription We don't need to subscription



12

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.560

anymore at least not stored in this property.



13

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:16.460

But now we can here simply subscribe to something else we can use this store select from training and



14

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.510

now get get finished exercises and subscribe to that and you get an exercise array that we assign to



15

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.730

our data table so this doesn't even change.



16

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.840

This is the same.



17

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.750

And we also want to have an ongoing subscription year because of course we're interested in future updates



18

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.930

to that data source.



19

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.580

So with that this should be the only place where we actually use our old training service we can remove



20

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.150

and be on Destroyer now because we no longer need that we can remove or destroy it.



21

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.490

We get no subscription to destroy anymore.



22

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.920

Remove it here also removed the subscription from our exchanges here we'll have to do some cleanup work



23

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.820

the other falls to remove the subscription property here.



24

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.650

And with that let's save this and let's see if it works.



25

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.740

So going back to our application let's click on past exercises and here indeed.



26

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.200

We got a bunch of exercises some broken ones.



27

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.020

That was during the phase where we had submitted every new exercise every exercise instantly to the



28

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.680

database.



29

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.980

But besides that Jesus is really looking good here.



30

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.830

We've got all these exercises stored here.



31

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.590

And again these completed ones which clearly aren't completed are coming from the time when we submitted



32

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.700

any active exercise to the store whenever it changed.



33

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.980

But with that we got a working store here.



34

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:56.480

We got a working set up here where we can still do our thing and then view it in our data table here.



35

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.670

Sort but eight verbs does is what I just did.



36

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.010

So this is really looking good.



37

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.530

Now.



38

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.530

Training part is also managed why ngi are x.



39

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.480

It's time for some cleanup in the next lecture.
