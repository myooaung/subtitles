Welcome to another module in the previous modules we edit a lot of angular material components and add

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,960
a lot of styling flex lay out to position everything correctly.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,790
And we use a lot of dummy data.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,840
Now it's time to replace them with real data and add some services so that our components can communicate

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,190
with each other that way we can start real exercises populate our components with dynamic data and so

6
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:38,340
on and we'll also have a look at another angle or a material component.

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,830
The data table as the names of gests discompose definitely needs input data.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,550
So let's work on this first.
