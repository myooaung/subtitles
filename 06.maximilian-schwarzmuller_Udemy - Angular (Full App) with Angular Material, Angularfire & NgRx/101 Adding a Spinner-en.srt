1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,120
So in the last lecture we added error handling and showing a better error message.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,150
Now I also want to show a spinner while we're waiting for the log in.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,480
And additionally once we are locked in.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,760
I also want to show a little spinner when we are on the new exercise page because there the available

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,570
options load very fast but are not there instantly.

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,700
So this is something I also want to ensure.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,930
That's possible.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,880
To achieve this we can look for a fitting component and the dare.

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,590
A progress spinner or a progress bar makes the most sense.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,810
Now a progress bar might not be ideal here because a progress bar kind of indicates that we're submitting

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,950
large chunks of data in either direction.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,730
So a progress spinner is what you see more often for these kinds of situations for logons or and so

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,250
on.

14
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,120
So therefore we want to have a spinner and now we want to have an indeterminate spinner if you want

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,980
to have an indeterminate spinner.

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:13,880
You could use the map progress spinner which we already used and set the mode to indeterminate or you

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,310
use the short cut mat spinner which is simply what you see here just that.

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,140
So we want to show this spinner while we're waiting for the log in.

19
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,290
And that means that in the log in component here we want to show it let's say instead of the button

20
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,460
so we could of course add this mat spinner down there.

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,000
Let me add it here and then go back to our application and log out.

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,780
Now we always see this better here.

23
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,440
So we have that spinner below the button.

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,600
I don't want to have a big load but I want to have it instead of the button of course.

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,960
So therefore we need to use NGF to control whether we showed a button or a spinner.

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,580
The question just is what is our condition and the condition is dead.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,830
We did submit to form but haven't received a response yet so we have to manage that in the off service

28
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,100
there.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:19,880
We do call our logging method and we start this log in process and we're done once we reach this or

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,640
to catch block because in the catch block we have an error but the submission still is done and we want

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,490
to start right before we execute this sign in with IIM-A and password method here.

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,820
So what I need is an additional event emitter that allows me to control the display of a splitter and

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,120
I will not control or create does eventa matter in the off service.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,940
Instead I want to create a new shared folder and yep folder and in that shared folder all create my

35
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,930
you I thought Service Dot.

36
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,860
Yes file and you can of course named it differently.

37
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,980
I'm calling it like this because it controls global UI functionalities and they're all just export a

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:11,410
class which has the name UI service and that class will simply have my event emitter.

39
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:26,450
So there I will therefore import subject from our SJS and will then here create my loading state changed

40
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:34,490
event listener which is a new subject which wraps a boolean triplicated whether loading started or finished.

41
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:41,430
Let's say and now with that service created a one provided in the module.

42
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,000
So I'll go there and in the provider's array I'll admire you ice service for dad.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,490
We also need to add an import at the top pointing to the shared folder and then you either service file

44
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:01,280
it with the service provided we can go back to the off service and now simply use that loading state.

45
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,580
Changed Lisner so any off service.

46
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,750
First of all inject DeWyze service bind it to a property named you a service maybe type is you guys

47
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,960
service and of course for Dad we all need to add an import import service from the shared folder and

48
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:25,060
then you Idylls service and we can now use that service in the log in the register method.

49
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,250
So here in logon our reach out to the ice service and I'll call the next method on the loading state

50
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:39,240
changed subject all set to true to indicate that we started loading and I'll also emit an event once

51
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,690
we're done here outside of two falls.

52
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:49,830
And as I said I'll also do the same and the catch block because we did fail but still we were successful

53
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,680
in submitting their request.

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,570
So we need to remove the splinter and show the button again and the same for registering here.

55
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,980
I'll also start by setting this to true.

56
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:09,420
And then and then block I want to stop everything and set the loading state to false.

57
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:16,020
With that we can now subscribe to that loading state changed listener and we want to do that in the

58
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,800
log in component.

59
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,630
So here are ULS and checked DeWyze service and bind it to a property named service for Dad's uter we

60
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,740
all need to add the import of course.

61
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,910
So when you log in component that is moving to the shared folder and importing from the user's file

62
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,270
injecting it in the constructor.

63
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:44,950
And with that object that we can add a new property is loading which initially is false and which we

64
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,250
now switch whenever we get a new loading state.

65
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:55,000
I therefore will subscribe to this loading state changed event emitter and that means I need to store

66
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,110
the subscription.

67
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:05,650
So I'll import subscription from our exchange Yes and it will create a new private property at the top

68
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:13,300
which will name loading Suppes which is just of type subscription.

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,240
Now an entry on an ad we can set up a subscription.

70
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:24,370
I can there bind to my loading Suppes and I do find this UI service loading state changed subscriber

71
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:31,180
which will fire whenever we trigger dis loading state changed as we do in the off service there I get

72
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,860
is is loading state so does Boullion which is either true or false.

73
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,420
And I want to set this is loading.

74
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,190
So this property I created a second ago to the value of its loading Sotoudeh value were emitting with

75
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,140
the subject.

76
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,850
And of course we have to unsubscribe in ngi on the stroy.

77
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,430
So let's implement on destroyed.

78
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:03,830
Make sure to also add an import which is coming from at angular coord and implement the energy on the

79
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:10,970
stroy method therefore so NGO and destroy they are I reach out to my loadings subscription and call

80
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,350
unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks.

81
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:22,010
With that we got our is loading state set and we can now use it in the template of the loading component.

82
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:29,120
And there finally we can bind the button with NGF to not is loading to only show it while we're not

83
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,520
loading and the spinner on the aberant should be shown whenever we are loading.

84
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,500
So when it is loading is true.

85
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,380
And with that let's see that an action for the log in screen.

86
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,540
Let's go back to our application.

87
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,040
Let's enter credentials.

88
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,240
And now you'll have to watch closely because fire is really fast.

89
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,710
But for a short duration you see the spinner.

90
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,540
Now let's do the same for the sign up page and I'll simply repeat the whole pattern there.

91
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,230
The Sign-Up component.

92
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:08,340
First of all inject you service and therefore your queue we need to add the import to the United Service.

93
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,340
And I plan on storing a subscription.

94
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,490
So I'll import subscription from our exchange Yes here too two and then I'll add two properties is loading

95
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,390
which is false and a private property.

96
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:31,940
My loading subscription which is of type subscription and then an entry on it all quickly assign my

97
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:38,720
loading subscription 2D subscription I get from the floating state changed subject in the ice service

98
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:48,060
where I also get is loading boolean and where a density is loading property of that component so this

99
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:56,930
one up here to the value of the emitted is loading Boullion and now of course I also implement on destroying

100
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,110
this method to prevent memory leaks from my loading subscription.

101
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:12,500
So for that we also have to import on the stroy from an angular core and implement DNG on destroy method

102
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,990
at the bottom.

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Dan called this loading SEPs unsubscribe.

104
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,280
And with that we can go to the Templi of the sign up component and use that new as loading property.

105
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:33,780
You only show the button if youre not loading and to otherwise show the math spinner.

106
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,700
And here therefore we add NGF is loading.

107
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,490
So now for Sign-Up we should also see a spinner.

108
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,790
Let's also see this in action.

109
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:51,380
For data I need to log out first and go to the sign up page and I enter wrong credentials here and email

110
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,300
which is already used.

111
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,910
But I should still see the spinner and I do.

112
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,820
And it also disappears in the Arrow case which should show it.

113
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,650
So we're almost there.

114
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,370
One thing I want to do now.

115
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,320
I also want to add a spinner.

116
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,370
If we are logged in and waiting for the exercises to load here I don't want to show the dropdown and

117
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,580
the button unless there's a stun.

118
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,700
This is a great exercise for you.

119
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,560
Now it's a bit different because we don't use firebase authentication but firebase firestorm.

120
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,870
But the pattern should be the same.

121
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,440
So this is the next assignable diven.
