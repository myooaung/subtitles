00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,240
In the last lecture we added the date picker and I simply reformatted to decode to make it easier to

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,600
read here not want to add validation.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:19,750
I want to use or add a max date which ensures that the user can only pick a date that makes him at least

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,540
18 years old.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:30,320
Q At dysfunctionality we can add the max property to the input.

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:37,000
This will add the max value validator and if we set this to a date this will automatically be recognized

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,730
by the date picker and taken into account.

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,090
So this should now be a date.

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,090
And let's actually use property binding so that we can bind to a property of our types of class all

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,600
named is Max state and I'll go to the typescript class.

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,910
This one here.

12
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,170
And at the max state property I binding to here too.

13
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:07,900
Now here I want to add a new date and this new date should ensure that a person has to be at least 18

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,950
years old.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:19,580
That's actually initialize this all in the energy on init method Ursel just set max date here to find

16
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,250
initially but an engine in it and then said this Max state equal to new date.

17
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:35,820
But thereafter I want to set a max date call a set date on it to set it to a new date and there used

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,080
the old max date just to date is to day by the way.

19
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:49,340
So I'll use today and on today on the date which refers to today I'll get the full year.

20
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,810
Is a method.

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,720
No I can deduct 18 here to set my not date.

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,880
Excuse me my full year instead.

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:09,950
Q Two days a year minus 18 and this should actually give me a max date which is today 18 years ago.

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:18,660
Now max date is what I bind to the max property here and now if we save that all and I click on the

25
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,580
date picker you see it automatically jump back to January 2000 because I'm recording this on January

26
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:33,470
16th 2008 team and the first date I can pick or the oldest date actually is dead and they can't even

27
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,430
go to more recent months.

28
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,540
So this is awesome functionality which of course takes quite simple trick to build on your own which

29
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,580
is shipping with the match date picker.

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,520
So again an example off.

31
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,110
It's not just styling.

32
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,770
There's a lot of logic inside that angle a material component.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,710
So now we can pick this and it will output the birth date here just fine of course with the same logic

34
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,980
as we said max date.

35
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,790
You could also set the mandate if you want to insure at at least a certain date has to be picked.

36
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,910
And this is how easy you can add validation to your date picker.

37
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,230
But even more than that how it automatically adjusts and only displays a certain range.

38
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,230
And this is the date picker and how we're going to use it in this project.

39
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,270
Now let's move on.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,640
And in the next lecture.

41
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,640
Let's also add a checkbox.
