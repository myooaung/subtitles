1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:11,630
So what is firebase firebase is an easy to use back and if this is our regular application set up where

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:18,260
we have a client so the browser and the server and we sent back and forth requests and the server returns

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:27,770
H-G e-mail pages or in the case of a singular only one single page at a time then firebase is relevant

4
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,530
for the service site.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:36,740
It can be used as a hosting provider to host the regular app but more than that it can be used as a

6
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,690
back end to which we connect to store data fetch data run all kinds of calculations or also very important

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,500
authenticate users.

8
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:53,920
Indeed tell'd firebase has a couple of different services and has services connected to real time databases

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:01,630
no real time simply means that the databases you can use can actually be used in a way that uses WEP

10
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:09,380
sockets behind the scenes so that you can get live updates into your page into your angular app without

11
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,610
the need to send subsequent rest API requests.

12
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,230
But more on that later.

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,950
So they offer database solutions using no sequel databases to be precise.

14
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,540
These databases are used to store in-sync data.

15
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,570
You can reach them while you rest.

16
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:33,710
AP I already official firebase SDK or with angle or fire as you will learn in this module and you don't

17
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,070
need to write any service code they work out the box.

18
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,320
You don't need to create rest endpoints.

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,400
You don't need to write any code to validate data.

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,130
You can almost directly communicate with the database.

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,330
So to you it looks like you do in-between.

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,480
There is of course some layer which although it acts as a cure to you there but you can easily access

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,250
the database.

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,970
That's the key take away of these services.

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,520
The site's databases firebase has an off indication service with this service you can easily add user

26
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,820
sign up and log in.

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,700
You can reach it.

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:13,670
Also why arrest API or do you firebase STK you here you don't have to write any server side code.

29
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:20,780
And if you use the SDK then even on the front end you get a lot of utility functions things like storing

30
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,640
the token and so on firebase also offers storage services.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,230
So files storage services which help to a file upload download also all down the wired firebase STK

32
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,980
end here too.

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,580
No server side code is required.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,960
Additionally firebase has analytics services where you can integrate analytics into your apps firebase

35
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,080
that's important to mention at this point alls is a popular back and for mobile apps.

36
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,660
So for Android or Iowa as apps there you can integrate even a bit more analytics services for web apps.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,320
And finally a relatively new service are cloud functions cloud functions as a service where you can

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,820
write your own code and execute on the Mont. by attaching it to certain event sources.

39
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,580
Now the cool thing about firebase in all these services is not just the service offerings but that here

40
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:22,110
all the resources are managed for you all the servers are managed for you you don't need to provision

41
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,810
spin up manage and secure servers.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,360
So that's all done for you.

43
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,760
You just used the services and you're charged on a pay what you use basis.

44
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,440
So if you're not using data a lot it's essentially free to you.

45
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:41,940
They have a generous free tier and if your usage becomes bigger and bigger because more people start

46
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,220
using your web app while then you're hopefully earning money and then this will also cost you money

47
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,880
but it will still be very cost efficient.

48
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,080
So these are all the fire based services in this module.

49
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,010
I'll only focus on the real time databases and authentication though don't we all use angular fire to

50
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,780
use these services in the angular app and you will see how easy that is.

51
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,660
Now one important note this is no firebase course firebase is way more than what we use in display app.

52
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,940
But this of course is an app focused course and it's about angular in its core.

53
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,860
Therefore I will indeed tell show you how we use the services we do use if you want to learn more about

54
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,690
firebase.

55
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,190
Please reach out to their official page.

56
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,070
You can find useful links in a lecture at the end of this module.

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,870
Now with that let's have a look at the services we are going to use and how we use them.
