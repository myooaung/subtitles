00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.690

Knouted we are prepared to start a new training.



2

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.160

I actually want to well do just that show some interface 40 running exercise and I want to show the



3

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.720

interface instead of does tap group here.



4

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.850

So in the training component I want to add my app current training here below the tap grew and with



5

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.530

app current training I'm of course referring to this current training component.



6

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.510

Now there there isn't much right.



7

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.020

It's a pretty empty component.



8

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.830

And right now I'm always showing this if my saved as we always see it below.



9

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.020

The new exercise repasts past exercise below the Tass.



10

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830

This is something that should change and for dental.



11

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.000

First of all add a property to the training component which will ne ongoing training and initially it's



12

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.550

false and it will be set to true whenever we chose a training so whenever we have a running training



13

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.440

and to be informed about this choice I'll add an event dimeter in new training that should fire.



14

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.580

Whenever this button is clicked and later we'll also turn this into a forum.



15

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.450

But for now I'll simply name was on start training like that.



16

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.020

And in new training I will now import U-bend emitter and output.



17

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.030

You saw this pattern already.



18

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.960

All named event training start and create a new event emitter.



19

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.700

There I will eventually also submit.



20

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.830

Which kind of training was started but for now let's just emit nothing and start some dummy training



21

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.320

and then I'll add my ADD output decorator now and new training where we click on this button we call



22

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.890

on start training so let's implement this method and then this method all reach out to training start



23

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.390

and call emit.



24

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.750

With that the training is starting and the next step now is to react to the event in the training component



25

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.980

which is where we use the new training component.



26

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.610

There we can now implement our newly created training start event whenever it fires.



27

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.830

I want to set ongoing training to true so here that ongoing training to true.



28

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.110

I will then use ongoing training as an indicator to wherever I want to show this tap group or this component



29

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.320

group should be shown with NGF which I can of course also add to angle the material components.



30

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.940

This should only be shown if we have no ongoing training so if this is false then I want to show this



31

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.980

step through.



32

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.410

If we do have ongoing training then I want to.



33

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.980

Whoops that's the wrong place.



34

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.760

Then I want to show the current training component with this setup in place.



35

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.380

We now don't see that current training component.



36

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.140

But if I click start then we do see it.



37

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.800

Now this is where I want to work on.



38

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.780

I want to work on this component so that here we have a nice little interface which basically has a



39

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.290

progress bar or something like that which counts down and finishes once it's done and which also gives



40

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.090

us a cancel button so that we can of course cancel the training whenever we want.



41

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.700

For that let's head over into current training and then I'll add a new section in this section.



42

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.860

I want to display a spinner and the current progress as well as some modal weighting phrase maybe.



43

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.900

I also want to add a button that allows me to stop the training.



44

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.110

Now let's have a look at the official docs and look for a fitting progress indicator.



45

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:03.080

If we scroll down then we get there's progress Spener and all these spinners as well as the progress



46

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.010

bars are available indeterminate and indeterminate modes so indeterminate modes are of course the right



47

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.370

choice.



48

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.650

If you don't know how long something is going to take and you want to show some progress indicator the



49

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.810

determinant question is a good choice.



50

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.480

If you well do you know how long it will take.



51

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.230

In our case that's the case.



52

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.640

So I want to show such a spinner as you can see the code is pretty straight forward.



53

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.830

So in my current training component I will implement the mat spinner but well to be precise I want to



54

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.950

implement mat progress spinner because that's the one I can turn to be determinate.



55

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.840

So let's implement mat progress spinner and mode should be determinate.



56

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.040

That's important.



57

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.310

This also requires me to then set the values between 0 and 100 to basically tell the spinner what to



58

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.700

render which progress to render.



59

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.080

But before we can do anything of that kind we need to unlock it right.



60

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:17.500

So same procedure as every year we go to the material module and in there we at the mat progress Spetner



61

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.600

module.



62

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:27.060

This one and then added two imports and add it to exports.



63

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.430

With that we can go back to current training and we get to the mat progress spinner.



64

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.070

Now as I said if the mode is to terminate we all need to set a value.



65

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.960

This could be for example 20 for 20 percent.



66

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:46.590

Now we also have to close that spinner and with that if we have a look at our application and we start



67

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.160

this we see a progress Bynner dats 20 percent into well it's full round.



68

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.380

That's a good start.



69

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.840

It looks a bit ugly I'd say and I want to have more content of course.



70

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.700

Let's work on the ugly part.



71

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.400

We know how to fix this right.



72

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.560

We had eFax layout equals Cullom here to the section because I want to position elements from top to



73

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.940

bottom lets say F X.



74

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.430

Lay out a line is censures center so that everything is centered horizontally and vertically.



75

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.770

And with that this already looks a bit better.



76

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.040

Would be nice to push this a bit further down though to do that all simply gift is a class of current



77

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.330

training and just as I added a padding of 30 pixels to new training.



78

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:43.720

I'll do the same for current trading with that if we have a look at is does looks know better.



79

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.330

Now of course it's not really counting up and a lot of information is missing.



80

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.330

So back to the HTL quote below the progress spinner.



81

00:06:52.410 --> 00:07:00.240

Let's add some text where we can say we're output the progress so we'll have to replace this with some



82

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.890

dynamic value as we will have to do with forward progress spinner.



83

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.410

Overall then I won't have a motivating phrase like keep on going.



84

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.900

You can do it and there after.



85

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.950

I want to have a button.



86

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:24.510

Maybe the match rased button with a color of X and which says stop so that we can stop this trading



87

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.580

if we absolutely can't continue.



88

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.450

So now it looks like this.



89

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.390

This interface is coming along quite nicely.



90

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.180

Now I want to ensure that we get some progress that's actually well progressing.



91

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:45.910

To ensure this will add a property cutis component and later this will be bound from outside.



92

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.630

Right now let's set it to Ciro initially and hardcoded in here and in NGO in it.



93

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.760

I want to kick off an intro will that increases that progress.



94

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:10.840

So in here I want to call said entrail well execute a method every let's say second and in that method



95

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.300

I want to set this progress to this progress.



96

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.410

Last fight.



97

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.480

So now we'll basically grow by 5 percent every second.



98

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.810

So overall it should take 20 seconds to complete.



99

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.260

Now you see something I need to go back to the HDMI the code and actually bind value of the mad progress



100

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.770

spinner to our newly created progress property and also output death here below the spinner.



101

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.510

So output progress percent year.



102

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:54.690

Now that we have a look we start this is see counting up every second.



103

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.360

It's increasing by 5.



104

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.120

Now this is nice.



105

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.260

Would be nice if we could all stop it though and would also be nice if it finishes when it reaches 100.



106

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.700

Because right now well see for yourself it continues growing.



107

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.560

So let's implement these two things in the next lecture.
