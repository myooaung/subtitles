00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,690
Welcome to this course it's really great to have you as a student in this course in discourse.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,280
We're going to do something fun.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,750
We're going to build an entire angular app from scratch now.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,980
Yep we're going to build this one.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,370
This is dangler Fitness Tracker app.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,060
It features users sign up where we specify e-mail password our birth date feature by a date picker and

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,010
then of course also have to agree to the terms and conditions.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,890
And then we can log in and start exercises we choose from a set of exercises that's actually fetched

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,870
from the server we started.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,050
We can cancel it if we want and we can of course do all the past exercises and we can even falter and

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,000
sorties.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,620
That's a lot of cool features combined.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,520
And behind the scenes we'll be using angular material angular fire and firebase which is awesome cloud

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,840
database service with a real time database and will also use N-G are x angular is more advanced state

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,980
management system.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,850
And of course by the end of discours We'll also deploy the app to a real server in case angler's something

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,310
you know but you are no expert in it yet.

18
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,830
I also get a brief refresher section on angular and discours so that you can get started with quickly

19
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,350
and refresh your angular knowledge.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,360
So that's of course pretty amazing and I can't wait to dive into that with you.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Now who am I though who's teaching you.

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,510
My name is MSXML and smarts Mitla.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,190
I'm a freelance web developer and 5 star rated instructor.

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,190
You're on to me.

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,810
I teach a broad range of topics and I created the best selling and best rated Anglo course here and

26
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,980
to me the complete guide now.

27
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,890
This course doesn't replace it.

28
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,790
Not even close.

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,830
You don't learn angler from scratch.

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,620
I only got a brief refresher.

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,060
But I will show you how to take that angle of knowledge and apply it to a real project.

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,130
I work with ular since it's been an early alpha stages.

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,800
So I guess I can tell you a lot about it.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,740
And with that I think enough of the talking.

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,020
Let's dive into what this course has to offer.

36
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,600
And then let's dive right into building this app.
