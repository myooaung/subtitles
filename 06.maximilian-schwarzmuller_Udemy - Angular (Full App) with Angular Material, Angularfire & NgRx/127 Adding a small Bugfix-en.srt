00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,020
Here's a quick addition in this module there is a bug in our code.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,870
A tiny back but there is a box which I want to fix if you will have a look at the training service due

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,380
to me copy and pasting code in the complete and cancel exercise.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,640
We always say to set the state to complete it and we can see this if we log in and we have a look at

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,370
our past exercises.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,130
We see that there are a lot of canceled ones which clearly didn't complete where we actually like this

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,760
one here and say completed.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,270
So that is of course incorrect on the cancell exercise year.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,170
I should set this to cancelled and not to complete it.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,150
So this is just one fix one logical error that's in the app which I quickly want to get rid of the rest

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,620
absolutely works fine.
