00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,230
Before we dive into this module Here's one important note in case you're using Anglo version 6 or higher

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,130
starting with that word an angler uses are extreme as worst than 6 or higher.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,120
And our next years is the library responsible for the observables.

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:26,890
Now it generally works exactly as before but the imports change now I actually used the new imports

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,960
index almost everywhere in the course and I added some notations throughout the course in places where

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,020
you can adjust it but to make sure that the exact same code as shown in this course works.

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,820
You should install an extra package with NPM install dash dash save.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,730
It's our extra Yes dash compact.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,830
With that the entire code in this course will work without any adjustments.

10
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:57,820
If you want to use our Extreme's version 6 without that extra package as I said there will be notations

11
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:05,000
in the course that allow you to update your code accordingly and well use it without that extra package.

12
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,490
But this is a fine work around to ensure that you don't have to do anything.
