1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:09,660
We added sorting and we added filtering filtering was particularly easy and as you saw from a data table

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,840
perspective it was only about assigning the filter property and the data source.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,840
Now let's work on page a nation that's alost important thing you often need on tables page anation is

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,950
all about showing how many rows you display and allowing the user to cycle between pages to switch between

5
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,340
the well rows for each page.

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,460
Engelen material gives you a special component you can use for page anation if you check out the page

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,610
anation docs you'll learn how to set up this component and how to connect that to a data table and the

8
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,710
computer I'm talking about is actually added below the table not inside of it.

9
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,150
It's not part of the table and you can actually use it in the pendant of the table.

10
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,870
But here it's the Matt page nature component.

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,560
So let's simply copy this component here.

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,330
And in the past training component HVM file are placed below my math table component.

13
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,600
Now the map page in nature here has a page sized property which in this case is bound to a number 10.

14
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,620
This term is how many items should be displayed on a given page.

15
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,270
Also the to one so that we can quickly see a result and page size options to find out which steps we

16
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,790
want to present to the user.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,090
Besides the forward and backward buttons so to jump to page 5 10 and 20 maybe we also assign a local

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,290
reference your by which we can grab access to the page and 8 or later.

19
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,340
So this is deep page and later.

20
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,820
And since it's a separate component we need to add an ORDER to the material module.

21
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,160
So they're at the top all import.

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:02:01,530
Matt page Nadr module and I'll wrap this and add it to both imports and exports.

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,400
Now with that added here we can go back to their past training component.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:14,350
This should now work and we should already be able to see this component to be honest if we quickly

25
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,810
do log in here.

26
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,600
We can see the page anation component below the table.

27
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,050
As I said it looks nice with the table but it works in dependently of that and you can find out more

28
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:32,380
about pagination and how it works independent of their table by clicking on the page name or article.

29
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,160
This will explain what it actually returns you and how you may use it.

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,570
Now back to the table though and back to our application we got the page NHL here and we can switch

31
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,080
between pages but we will get no data so this won't really work.

32
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,650
Let's make sure that it does work for that we need to connect it to the data table.

33
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,600
By the way keep in mind the page size options is bound by a property binding as a page size.

34
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,370
So we're passing a real number and a real array here.

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,510
But back to connecting it to connect that we have to go to the typescript file.

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,510
There we have to get access to the page and eighter and then set up a connection to data source page

37
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,810
and atre Let's get access First we get X in the same way we got access to the sorting directive.

38
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,660
We use view child and select Matt page and later like this.

39
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,230
We could also use the local reference we placed on it but I'll use a different approach so I'll get

40
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,150
rid of it.

41
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,340
So here I'm using Map page and Aitor all stored in a property named page and later though the name is

42
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,150
up to you it doesn't matter.

43
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,770
And the type will be met page and enter.

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:50,740
Now just as with sorting in Engy after you in it we assign this to this data source page and later this

45
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,680
will connect the two and Anglo material will do the rest.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,210
Behind the scenes let's see this in action.

47
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,650
We now connected it.

48
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:06,590
So let's quickly log in and here you see I can't do anything.

49
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,710
Now let's go back to the exercises and do two exercises since I find a page size of one.

50
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,580
We should get page nation already after only doing two exercises.

51
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,330
So if you go to paths exercises we indeed only see one row.

52
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,840
If my thoughts are here we still filter across all pages by the way so that's really cool but we only

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,140
see one road but we can go for it to see the second page and backward and that's all bandaged for us.

54
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,340
The styling and the behavior.

55
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,220
If I set the items per page size to 5 while then we see obviously 5 items so does allow us to override

56
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,870
the default.

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,630
We set up here

58
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,850
so this is the page and Atre you the find a page size here and you can find which options you want to

59
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,670
present to the user if any here for example that you can switch to 5 10 or 20 IPs per page we can of

60
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,620
course also add one here.

61
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,400
It is an array.

62
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:12,720
You simply add items to it and you can check the page nature by accessing it with the child and then

63
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,920
assigning it to the page and enter property of the data source and that is all this was sorting filtering

64
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,220
and using Page anation with the data table and as you saw these are some patterns you probably have

65
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,730
to remember or look up from time to time but in the end it's not difficult at all.
