1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,130
I'm all the firebase page now.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,510
And as I said it's a service provider that of course charge money.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,960
You can check the pricing page to find out what you will pay and they have a very generous free tier

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,880
plan here.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,170
So the things we're going to use here in this module should absolutely be free.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,770
If you use them in the same amount I used them here in this course if you ever exceed these limits you're

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,820
not going to be broke in a couple of hours.

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,150
You will actually get a warning and you don't even need a credit card to get started.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,160
So you're absolutely safe.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,390
So that's pricing.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,390
What about the services we will use.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:47,080
If you click on products that the services we will use are actually the cloud firers store here which

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:55,180
is their latest data based solution we can use and which is highly scalable and fast and use authentication.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,780
So these two services here now you can always dive into the docks here to learn more about services

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,870
if there are some cases which are not covered as course as discours.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,240
As I mentioned of course is no firebase deep dive court.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,180
Now to get started what you will need to do is you have to head to your console the fire based console

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,730
and for that you will need a Google account and then you need to create a new project here.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,420
So I will quickly do that and I will name it.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:31,060
Energy fitness tracker you can choose any name you want now choose your region which doesn't affect

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,480
the pricing by the way.

22
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,160
And then click Create project.

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:41,080
Now this will set up a firebase project for you where you can access all these services.

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,140
I was mentioning.

25
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,250
Now again we will only use the database in authentication but you will see these are their core services

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,090
which is also indicated by the fact that they're the top two services we see here.

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,230
So that's the firebase console and feel free to browse through it and explore their service offerings

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,920
in our application.

29
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:10,000
I want to start by adding a database to fetch the exercises we offer not from our service where we currently

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,140
hard code them.

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,720
You have a look at our training service that we have all our exercises hardcoded instead of want to

32
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,790
get them from firebase and I will use a singular fire.

33
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,860
Now what is a singular fired.
