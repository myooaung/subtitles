00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:10.020

Let's add some filtering to our math table filtering is surprisingly simple.



2

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.010

First of all we need to add the input into which the user can type we at is above the math tables so



3

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.090

not inside of it.



4

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.760

It's not strictly connected to it.



5

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.920

It's a neural input.



6

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.030

Just as you could add it anywhere else on your page.



7

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.100

So you're all at the map for feel to have a nice looking input with a floating label and so on.



8

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.780

And then there are and no real input with math input as a directive.



9

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.920

And that's almost it also set a time to text.



10

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.130

So this is now my full input field.



11

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.620

I want to use now on that input field.



12

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.700

I want to register an event listener that fires whenever we type.



13

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.650

So I will add a key up listener.



14

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.820

And here I will execute to do filter Meffert where I want to forward de-value to user entered I can



15

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.520

access this on the dollar sign even Optik angler gives me this simply and closes the default Dom event



16

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.170

that is emitted.



17

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.090

And there it connects the target and pass on the value.



18

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:19.960

So that is expected the string the user entered also add a placeholder to the input where they say FELTER.



19

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.520

So this is now my input field.



20

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.310

Next I want to use that so I need to implement the dual filter method in my component.



21

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:38.350

So in there I will add a new method to filter where I will get the full value which will be a string.



22

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.250

So this is what the user entered I know can filter very very simply by simply accessing the data source



23

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.480

and they're setting the filter property equal to the string I got here.



24

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.650

So to filter value the only thing I want to do is I want to call trim to remove any whitespace and then



25

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.480

to lower case.



26

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:12.470

The reason for this is dead angular or angular materials data source or a material table will in the



27

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.160

end concatenate all values of zero.



28

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.580

So if we have calories duration and so on next to chavrusa it will put this all into one row and then



29

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.990

search for our filtered string here in that long string it's created by doing it like this it will always



30

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.880

take into account all our rows and we therefore should provide a string which is trimmed and all lowercase



31

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.690

because angular will also put its long string to lowercase so that we have a unique casing for which



32

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.390

we falter.



33

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.890

And then we don't have to worry about casing.



34

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.380

You can override its default filtering mechanism and you can read more about this on the data table



35

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.820

page by clicking on filtering.



36

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.120

There you see there you can cast your own filter predicate function if you want to overwrite this.



37

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.470

Now back to our cupholder though here I don't want to override this and in a lot of cases you don't



38

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.260

want to.



39

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.720

So here let's simply ensure that all files are saved.



40

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.220

And then let's quickly log in here and start a couple of exercises and cancel them as before.



41

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.730

Just that we got some values.



42

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:35.510

Yes and now we get that the filter inputs we need to work on the positioning but it will work if I enter.



43

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.620

Here you see with full the four crunches awls if I enter a lower case if I enter 0.6 we only see Deadworld



44

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.370

adorations Sirat 6.



45

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.280

If my filter for bird ILEC the bird piece does this how easy that works.



46

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:59.180

Now let's make sure the positioning is all right and I do that by going back to my component and there



47

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:07.970

are two H.T. mail file and we simply need to style There's field the input field we positioned above



48

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.120

the material table there.



49

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.150

I will wrap this in a death so let's wrap this and put it into the div



50

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:29.290

and I will add X lay out your facts lay out a line to be precise and set this to center center



51

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.770

and give his a width of 40 percent.



52

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.540

Now let's have a look at this.



53

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.290

We don't need to add new values for Nabl in order to be able to see this and does this looking ready



54

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.310

got to me



55

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.750

I all should name this placeholder though to see the placeholder.



56

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.190

So now if you go back one more time we should have a nice looking folder field here setting about the



57

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.360

data table.



58

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.660

Also if we increase Dishon with and now we can enter our filter string here and have a data table which



59

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.160

works just like that out of the box.
