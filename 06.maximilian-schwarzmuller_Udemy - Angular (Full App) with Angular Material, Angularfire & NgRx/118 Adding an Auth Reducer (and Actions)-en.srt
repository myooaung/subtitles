1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:08,540
Who are still there time to continue with then John X the general pattern won't change anymore though

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,560
you learned about the store reducer actions selectors.

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,470
How we get values and how we dispatch values and that really is the main part.

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,080
Now I'll show you how to create more reducers for the different feature modules we have.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,100
We already created one for the UI state.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,580
Now I will just repeat this pattern for off and training.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,760
Let's start with off.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,210
So in the off area we get this off service next to it.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,660
I'll add my off reducer.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:49,490
TS file just as I created my producer and I will also create my of actions.

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,420
TS fall because you will have some actions like user is authenticated user id log out.

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:04,460
So with that we now can start working on this off reducer and we can actually have a look at UI producer

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,380
and copy the content from there into the off reducer to use this as a blueprint.

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,390
Of course we should import different actions.

15
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,860
We should import our off actions and we got on.

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,320
So this is an empty import right now.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,850
The state will look differently if we have a look at the off service what is our authentication status.

18
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,540
In the end we just want to know are we authenticated or not.

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,980
That is the only thing we really care about.

20
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,060
The other parts like tokens and so on.

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,800
Thats managed by Angel or fire behind the scenes.

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,670
So we really only care about this.

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:44,650
So we got is authenticated as a state which also happens to be a bully and again but of course dont

24
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,890
be deceived.

25
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,810
This can be a string this can be a number.

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,600
This could be an object or an array.

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,510
You are not limited to booleans and we will see this once we create detraining state.

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,770
So this is the stage for all indication though and the initial state is to have its authenticated set

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,400
to False.

30
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:10,150
We then have our producer and our named is off reducer and we also get the initial state here.

31
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,940
The actions Well that is something we'll need to create an action file as we do have to do that for

32
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,860
our cases.

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,030
So let's do this let's move to the off actions.

34
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,450
There again we can have a look at the UI actions and copy to set up from there and move it over to the

35
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,910
off actions in there.

36
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:35,750
We got the action imported from NPR X store and then we can have a couple of different actions.

37
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:45,090
I guess one actually would make sense would be set authenticated and one that we could call set an authenticated

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,360
and authenticated.

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,010
This is all coming from the off reducers all renamed is to off.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
And here I got set up.

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,640
They indicated and here I got said and indicated as I mentioned the exact values here don't really matter

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,980
said on of anti-cat it.

43
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,090
I guess it's a hardboard Somehow I don't get it.

44
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,930
So now we can create a clause which is named set or vindicated.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,090
God I do have to type that.

46
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,630
That'll do.

47
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,250
And your type is set off indicated.

48
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,180
The second clause is set up set unauthenticated using Pascal OK's.

49
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,750
And here we use set unauthenticated as our type.

50
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,140
And now we export both are merged into a custom type which all name off actions.

51
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:46,220
Here we have every asset authenticated or we have set an authenticated.

52
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,600
This is now the off actions file and the off or we can now import from there.

53
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,860
We have our off actions and we get specifically set authenticated and set.

54
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,340
I don't indicate it's set.

55
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,270
I don't indicate it's that constant.

56
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,350
So do you actually get in the off reducer is a type of actions.

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,080
It's either starting starting or stopping it's resetting or unsetting.

58
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:18,000
So to say the user authentication and the first case is set off then decay that like this and here on

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,360
a Saturday is authenticated property to True.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,090
The second case is set on authenticated.

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:33,450
And here I want to set is authenticated to false and devolved States always the state we got before.

62
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,470
Now I'll try to help method get is off.

63
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,920
Whereas simply state is offene catered for the same reason we did this new UI reducer to have easier

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,360
access to that.

65
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,160
So now we get our off reduce and of actions.

66
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,340
No we need to add it to our app reducers just as we did it for the UI reducer.

67
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:04,590
So any app reducer I'm going to import everything ass from off from the auth folder and there of course

68
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,080
our off reducer file.

69
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,120
And now we add both the state and the reducer itself.

70
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,240
So any state interface I'm going to edit off Sly's so that we can access all related state pieces which

71
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,050
points to from off state.

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,900
Excuse me.

73
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,230
This should be from all one word and in from off we should have a state.

74
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,420
So in the off reducers there should be a state export interface state.

75
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:40,640
I guess we have one yet I just need to add a semi-colon and indeed reducers map it no longer fits our

76
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,990
state because there is the off state missing.

77
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:52,000
So I will add the off key here which is coming from off and they're off reducer.

78
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,100
So now that's added here too.

79
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,680
Now we can also add more selectors.

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,040
The first one is d get off state selector which gives us direct access to the off slice.

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,250
And always keep in mind this is optional.

82
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,000
You could drill down manually by accessing the properties but it's easier if you do it like this.

83
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,950
So here it create a feature selector where access from off and state.

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,000
That's the type.

85
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,590
And that is what I will get when I access my of slice.

86
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,480
So this property here in my reducer map and in my state therefore And now we'll add a number select

87
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:36,660
or just as we did 40 you ii get is off we'll use the Create selector feature because now I don't want

88
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,870
to get access to the entire state slice but to a specific property in that slice and for that we use

89
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,530
create selector and here well first of all pass a reference to get off state.

90
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,990
So the feature select will be created a second ago and the second argument will then be coming from

91
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:02,280
the off reduce or file does get is off help or Mefford we defined in there and that is exactly the same

92
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,450
logic we used for the UI reducer.

93
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,990
So with that we got this all added to the app reducer.

94
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,070
Now we dont need to touch the app module.

95
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,940
Everything is fine there.

96
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,460
Now we can go to the places where we want to use Dadge reducer.

97
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:26,360
So that would be in the off related files of course were dispatching an action whenever we get back

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,270
to result from Register user.

99
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,260
So here we dispatch stop loading.

100
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:41,090
Now all that want to dispatch of course my action regarding the successful log in to be precise we don't

101
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,070
really need to do this here though.

102
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,440
Remember we got our off state listener.

103
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,870
This is where we also do the routing.

104
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:54,380
Actually it's here where we should now do that and where we should now trigger our action.

105
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:05,830
So first of all I'll import everything as of from my off actions file and with that I can dispatch actions

106
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,260
on my store.

107
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,960
Now the store still uses the global state of the app which now includes the off parts it is fine.

108
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:21,140
And now if they are I won't said this is authenticated and it won't trigger my off change here.

109
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:31,220
Instead I will call this store dispatch knew of set authenticated as to class name which I instantiate

110
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:40,400
and on the other and down there where we redirect to log in I will also not use my subject anymore but

111
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,320
instead dispatch set unauthenticated this class and it will not manage to get it property in this file

112
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,040
anymore.

113
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,730
I don't need the off change subject anymore which means I can remove the subject import up here.

114
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,230
This is all stuff I can get rid of in my is all helper method.

115
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,930
I will remove that because we've now managed this in ngi are x.

116
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,850
And with that we improved dieoff service and we're using NCR X to manage the state of our indication.

117
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:17,000
Now that's of course only worth something if we also take the values from there.

118
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,230
Right now we only dispatch but that broke our application because the parts of the app where we checked

119
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,060
for the user are being offended will now not work anymore.

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:36,680
For example our navigation there in the head header component we actually subscribe to off changes and

121
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:45,100
we did the same and decide neth we all were interested in that in our off guard of course.

122
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,840
All these things are now broken.

123
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,030
So let's fix this in the next lecture.
