00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.050

So time for some cleanup work.



2

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.100

Now let's go through all these files and see if there are any old subscriptions which we don't need



3

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.720

anymore or anything like that.



4

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.130

So when you log in component days looks good to me.



5

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.580

Sign up also looks good.



6

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.850

No old subscription no old and destroy book now Andy.



7

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.390

Off guard.



8

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.200

Yes looking good.



9

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.190

Do we have any imports we don't need anymore.



10

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:37.580

I guess we don't need a router here anymore and therefore we can remove the router here like this now



11

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.850

and be of service



12

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.550

here.



13

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.860

We got our constructor



14

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.180

all these things should actually still be required.



15

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.310

So there's nothing we can remove except for these comments of course now any navigation components any



16

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.870

hetero component we can remove off subscription we can remove these subscription imports therefore we



17

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.050

don't need that.



18

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.010

And we did just delete Engy honest trial ready so this should now be all right.



19

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.950

And the site Nav. component here we also can remove the subscription import and the office of Trojan



20

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.950

and property which we don't use anymore.



21

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.040

We already cleaned up ngi undestroyed that's good.



22

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.840

Now in the Sherratt service here it is looking all right.



23

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.660

I'll leave that here.



24

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.970

I want to send the snack bar still.



25

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.060

And in the current training component



26

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.340

that's all the looking.



27

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.540

All right.



28

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080

Stop training component should be fine.



29

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.660

Current training.



30

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.800

Quick look did we have.



31

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.400

Do we have any imports we don't need.



32

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.160

No that's looking fine to me.



33

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.880

New training here.



34

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.040

We certainly don't need to subscription anymore because we can't get rid of the or we already did get



35

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.220

rid of the old subscription properties so he implored was not required anymore.



36

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.040

Past trainings here.



37

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.580

There let's see that's looking good.



38

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.300

Yeah that's all looking good.



39

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.300

Nothing to clean up.



40

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.970

As far as I can see it in the training component itself.



41

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.880

Here.



42

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.900

We all can't get rid of the subscription import which you don't need anymore.



43

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560

We're not using description anymore and the training service.



44

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.270

Now we need the subscription actually.



45

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.200

But here we don't need the subject anymore.



46

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.730

By the way do I have this in the office services still.



47

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.190

No because we don't need the Tier 2 so that is all right.



48

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.910

So back to training service there we don't need to subject anymore because I'll get rid of all my subjects



49

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.710

these free.



50

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.780

We don't use them anymore.



51

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.860

We use energy or X..



52

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.530

Now we also don't need these properties to manage to state here anymore.



53

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.050

It's not required.



54

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.810

We need to firebase Suppes those all keep that just weight training and running exercises is not required



55

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.780

anymore.



56

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.770

Ala firestorm is required.



57

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.500

You story is required and store is required.



58

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.850

So that is all looking good.



59

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.600

Exercise has changed.



60

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.620

Next that's obsolete.



61

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.170

We don't need that anymore.



62

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.010

We dispatch here with dispatch here we dispatch everywhere and we want to have that cancel subscription



63

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.010

function still to cancel our firebase subscriptions if we log out on the welcome component.



64

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.460

We shouldn't have anything.



65

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750

And then the tiap component is here.



66

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.950

There we also have nothing spectacular.
