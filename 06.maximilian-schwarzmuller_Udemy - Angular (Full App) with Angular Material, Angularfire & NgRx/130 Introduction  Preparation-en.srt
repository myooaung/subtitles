00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:08,070
Over the last modules we spend a lot of work on this application but it's now really looking good.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:15,630
It's time to deploy it and an angular application once you built it is just a static application.

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,360
A bunch of H U M L C S S and javascript files.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,630
Let's see this.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,080
We can build it by running Engy build dash dash peron's.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,360
This will build it for production.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,450
Optimize it from a coding perspective or from the code base perspective I should say and also use ahead

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:39,350
of time compilation which means it will already parse all the angular templates and turn them into vanilla

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,230
javascript that executes really fast once you deployed it and doesn't need to be analyzed by Angola

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,070
first.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:54,400
So with that we get really performant bundle which we can then ship onto a server to run our app.

12
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,070
Now let's wait for this to finish.

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:04,900
And once it did finish you get dead dist folder here and you'll need to deploy only one thing and that's

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,930
the content of this disk folder.

15
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,040
That's all nothing else is required.

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,070
Just what's inside this folder.

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,500
Does this your entire angular app..

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,340
Now how do you deploy it.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:23,830
Then you can apply it to any static hosting provider you want such as AWOS as free but since we already

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:30,940
used firebase in this course why don't we all the lawyers on firebase because it turns out that firebase

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,210
has a service called firebase hosting which is just a static host and therefore perfectly suited to

22
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,690
run our angular app..

23
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,170
So let's put it there in the next lecture.
