00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.980

In the last lecture we added a shared module.



2

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.790

Let's now finish this whole module thing by splitting up our routes.



3

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.800

Right now we get this app routing module and then we get the welcome component as well as the off routes



4

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.310

and the trading route.



5

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.630

Now if you think about it the trading route doesn't make a lot of sense here because the training route



6

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.620

should belong to the training module and the off routes should belong to the off module.



7

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.020

So this is something I also want to do now.



8

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:42.970

I want to put these routes into their modules for the all module I'll simply cut them.



9

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.070

Go to my folder and add up all the routing module Katia's fall.



10

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.620

It's considered a good practice to always put routes into a separate module so named the file off routing



11

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.420

module and this will become a eagerly loaded routing file.



12

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:10.900

So here I am Engy module which we of course as you know have to import from at a singular core and in



13

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.490

that Engy module I want to set up my routes so I'll add my routes constant which is of type routes which



14

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.160

is imported from.



15

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.950

Angular router like this which is an array of routes and I just cut the routes so add them here.



16

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.150

These two objects sign up and log in component.



17

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.670

We need to import them here.



18

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:44.940

So we'll add imports to sign up component from the Sign-Up folder and an import to log in component



19

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.650

from the log in folder of course.



20

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.100

Now we get the Router Set up and now we can go to ngi module here and add imports and import the router



21

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.560

module which is coming from the angle or router package too.



22

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.960

So this module and here we don't call for root.



23

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.060

We only call that what's in an angular app and that isn't the routing module.



24

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.090

Instead we call for child and this will then merge it with a router.



25

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.310

Behind the scenes here we pass our routes and then we have to make sure that we export this router module.



26

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.050

And now we can import it into the off Marchal.



27

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.410

So the app not the app to you off routing module is now imported here added to the imports array and



28

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.620

the imports statement is also added pointing to the off routing module file with this.



29

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.180

These routes should still be available globally.



30

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.330

So in our application even though we don't have these routes and the app routing module anymore here



31

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.100

we can also remove the imports of Sign-Up component and log in component.



32

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.190

Now let's compile that and see if this works.



33

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.570

If the app loads and i log out we still can switch between Sign-Up and log in even though we put that



34

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.550

into a separate file.



35

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.760

Now it's worth mentioning that this is loaded eagerly.



36

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.700

So we're not using lazy loading here.



37

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.550

We use for child to add these routes to the global routes set up.



38

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.880

But we're doing this right at the start of the app because of education needs to be available right



39

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.300

at the start.



40

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.750

We now can also go on and have a look at the training component and see what we can do with that.
