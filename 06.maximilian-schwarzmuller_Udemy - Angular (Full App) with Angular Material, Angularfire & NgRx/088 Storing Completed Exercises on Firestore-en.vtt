00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.380

We worked a lot on the code to get the available exercises and it was a great practice for that whole



2

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.340

angle of fire and observable thing.



3

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.280

Now of course our app is not just about getting data but also about storing data whenever we complete



4

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.680

or cancel an exercise.



5

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.810

We right now push that onto our local array of exercises here.



6

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.490

This exercise is not the available exercises but the exercises in general and now do is nice but locally



7

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.890

it's not of that much use.



8

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.300

Whenever we relo deep this data will be gone it would be better to store it on fire store and of course



9

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.130

we can do that.



10

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.970

We can't just read data.



11

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.330

We can also store data obviously.



12

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.010

How does this work.



13

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.960

Let's add a new method into service it a private method here at the bottom and I'll name it adds data



14

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.540

to database to make it really clear what this is about in here.



15

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.960

I want to connect to angular fires to work and save my data to it.



16

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.940

So essentially uncancel exercise and complete exercise.



17

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:22.880

I want to call this method so to do that I will accept an exercise which should be stored which should



18

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.920

follow our exercise model as an input.



19

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.150

And now it will call this method here.



20

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:42.490

By calling this add data to database and this object is an exercise object the same cancel this as data



21

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.620

database.



22

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.610

This also is a valid exercise object.



23

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.100

Now the code with running exercises so that's fine I want to keep that and now in add data to database



24

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.550

I'll also reach out to this D-B.



25

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.320

So to or inject that angle or fire or reference and reach out to a collection which we didn't even create



26

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.970

yet.



27

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.530

If you connect to a collection which doesn't exist yet it will be created for you automatically.



28

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.780

So this is my collection.



29

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:23.680

I want to create the finished exercises and that will include both complete that and the canceled ones.



30

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.670

Now I'm connecting to this collection and I will call the add method and store my exercise just like



31

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.180

that.



32

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.940

Now this actually now returns as a promise.



33

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.670

Where we can handle the success case with a Ben walk or catch any arrows we might get.



34

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.680

I'll leave it as it is and simply check the database if it's exceeded.



35

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.860

So let's save this.



36

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.790

And let's find out if it works.



37

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.020

Let's quickly log in again and pick an exercise once they're loaded like crunches.



38

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.160

Start this and let's stop.



39

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.580

Now we don't get an error or which I guess is a good sign.



40

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.400

Hey let's look at our console and let's refresh this page.



41

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.320

You should see a new collection.



42

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.560

The finished exercise is as I said it's created on the fly if you try to access it and it doesn't exist



43

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.980

yet in there we got one document and debt document is exercise.



44

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.600

We finished crunches with the idea of the crunch just as it exists in a whaleboat exercises and all



45

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.480

of the meta data we create it.



46

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.200

So that's pretty cool.



47

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.490

It's just one line of code that stores this on the database.



48

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:49.890

Now in the next lecture we can actually connect our data table to that data we just stored to also populate



49

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.530

the data table with data coming from our database.
