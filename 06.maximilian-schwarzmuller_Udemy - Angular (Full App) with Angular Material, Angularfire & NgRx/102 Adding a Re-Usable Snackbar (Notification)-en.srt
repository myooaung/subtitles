1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:10,150
So we implemented downloading functionality and we're controlling it entirely through our YOU eyes service.

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:16,870
Now we have another UI element that we implement that just a few minutes ago if we have a look at the

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,410
log in screen.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:26,240
What about this snack bar which we're handling in the off service there were displaying this snack bar

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,920
a sodas message at the bottom.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,880
Whenever we get an error.

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,320
No actually this is a UI element that we might also need from other places in the app.

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:43,180
So a good improvement of the app is to actually add a method to all you Ice Service which we may call

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:51,770
a show snack bar with a message and an action and a duration.

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,960
And where we now use that snack bar instead.

11
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:02,150
So now I'll add injectable to debt service which is imported from Anglo COOREY so that we can inject

12
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:09,370
dad Matt snack bar service which will inject by adding a snack bar in the constructor which is of type.

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,840
Matt.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
Snack Bar which needs to be imported from ET angular material.

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:23,800
And now we can simply call this snack bar open and pass the message to the action.

16
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:32,660
And also my conflict here as an argument is not my conflict but an object where I set the duration to

17
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,640
the duration argument I'm getting here as the first argument of this method.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,740
Now we have that reuseable show snack bar method which we can use from inside the off service.

19
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,580
There we already are injecting to you Ice Service so we can simply go to all instances where we use

20
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:57,050
this snack bar open which are these two in register and log in and there instead of calling this snack

21
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,320
bar open.

22
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:06,470
I will now call this you I service show snack bar where my message just the error message where the

23
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,200
action is still null and to durations 3000 like dead.

24
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,770
And then I can remove this snack bar open from the You Ice Service you're actually from the officer

25
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,290
of this year from the registry user Meffert and for log in it's just the same method.

26
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,630
A service show snack bar with the error message null as an action and three seconds.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,600
And now I can remove the injection of Matt's snack bar from this service.

28
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,790
So this is now a tiny improvement which ensures staed in our application.

29
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:47,100
If I do log out I still get my error or a snack bar at the bottom if it fails.

30
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,390
But now we're controlling this in a central place too which makes it more reusable and spares the hassle

31
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,130
off injecting mat snack bar into all the places where we want to use it.

32
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,880
This also allows us to improve the error handling of other parts of the application.
