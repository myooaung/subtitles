00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.060

So let's add a form to the new training component a technically a form wouldn't be required though.



2

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.910

I just want to show that you can use it in conjunction with a card you could of course also add your



3

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.210

own click listener as we have it here and some passed the value of that select dropdown.



4

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:29.840

I will use a foreign though so I will wrap my entire mat cart here with a form close it after and I



5

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:40.080

will use to template driven approach which is easily used by assigning Engy model to the math select



6

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.070

component not the option but to math select does how you use it in a form.



7

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:54.060

And since I'm using the template or of the protocols and to assign a name dessous the exercise you can



8

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.680

of course pick any name you want.



9

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:08.030

So if that were binding this now all that needs to be done is add and you submit to the forum and call



10

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.110

on start training here a method we already have and get access to the forum by storing it in a local



11

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.230

reference and assigning any form as a value.



12

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.980

This gives us access to the underlying automatically created foreign.



13

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.260

Now I'm passing the form so does local reference to On-Star training and on the button.



14

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.880

This means that I can remove the click listener.



15

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.590

Instead I'll add the disabled binding here and set the button to disabled if form is invalid.



16

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.100

To make sure that it can be invalid.



17

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.010

I will go to Matt select and add required so that I have to select a value before it works.



18

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.650

Now back in the new training component here we get the form which is of type Engy form actually we have



19

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.460

to import data type Angi form from at a singular forms.



20

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.910

And this forum will now give us access to de-selected ID.



21

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.970

So here I can simply pass for him Dot value dot and that it was an exercise.



22

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:27.190

That was the name of the input we used here the name we assigned to the math select component with this



23

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.920

we're passing this on to the service.



24

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.350

And this should now all lead to our application to work again.



25

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.160

Well let's try this all out.



26

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.070

Let's log in and if we don't like that thing I can click the button so this works.



27

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.060

Now if I click this button however or choose something I can start this works fine.



28

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.250

One thing I noticed is in your training it still says favorite food here on the Select dropdown it should



29

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.990

be choose exercise.



30

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.600

Now with that we get this set up we're using the service to start a new training.



31

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.180

We're not using one to stop the training and we're not using the data off the select service in our



32

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.500

current training component.



33

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.480

We still have dummy data there.



34

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.450

So let's update this in the next lecture.
