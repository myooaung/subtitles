1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,890
What does angle fire.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,230
If we have firebase our angular app then angular fire acts as a bridge between these two things.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,890
Actually we have of course more options than just using angle of fire since dad is a package that is

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,290
not made available by the firebase team but buys up our developers.

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,800
So it's not the official solution but of course an absolutely fine one to use.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,470
I'm just stressing this to emphasize that you've got alternatives.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,790
You can't for example use various rest.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,820
API is provided by firebase does would allow you to use the angular H to the client to connect to firebase

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,780
store data fetch data authenticate users do all these things.

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,930
If you've gone through my angular Complete Guide course you saw the arrest API in action for the real

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,430
time database.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,940
And we won't use that in this course.

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,070
We also can use the official firebase SDK which is a javascript package we can use in any javascript

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,960
project and that's of course also true for angular projects.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,080
Again if you've gone from my complete guide course you saw DSK in action there we use that for the authentication

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,920
module but it will also not use that and discours Instead we'll use angular fire.

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,830
A third party package which actually also provides us all the features are a lot of the features the

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,200
STK the official SDK gives us.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,160
But in a manner that embraces observables and nicely integrates into angular.

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,450
You can only use it in annular atts that's important you can't use it in other frameworks but there

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,200
it integrates really nicely and it makes using firebase a recess you will see the important part really

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,880
is that observable based nature which is absolutely in line with angler's strategy of all is using observable

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,050
wolds wherever possible.

24
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,770
Now for that we of course need to understand what observables and subscriptions and so on really are.

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,020
Now that is something I'll have a look at in the next lecture if you know everything about that.

26
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,170
Feel free to skip that lecture of course.
