00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,300
So how do material themes work material themes have 5 colors that you need to define which will then

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,320
be automatically assigned to certain parts of certain components.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:20,040
So every component that's part of the angular material framework knows how to style itself or for some

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,070
components like a button you can overwrite it with the color property.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,770
But all of that refers back to the underlying theme which defines the base styles.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,010
So if you want to create such a theme you in the end need to do one simple thing you need to define

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,090
five colors.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,810
Now these colors are so-called palettes and we started with a primary palette.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,600
That's the most widely used color across all screens.

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,420
So do you based the main color on your app.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,750
It's accompanied by an accent palette that's used to highlight content for interactive elements for

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,970
these floating buttons.

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,220
Things like that.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:02,280
You also typically have a warrant palette so that is a color which is used to show warnings to really

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,510
draw attention.

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,760
And then you go to our palettes for text and general content.

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,310
One is the foreground palette which is used for text and icons.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,540
And once the background palette which is for example used by default for the toolbar so a light background

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,320
color with that I don't mean white which is the background color of your page anyways but I mean if

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,070
an element has a subtle background this will be used.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,430
So we need to find these five colors.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,760
The question of course is where do we find it and how.

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,040
Let's take a closer look.
