1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,660
So in the last lecture we added the sign up and sign in the firebase way.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,890
And now our app is kind of broken because we no longer store a user.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,130
No I will no longer store one here.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,390
I will instead store is off which is a boolean in which initially should be false.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,440
Now is is all the method name.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,290
Let's name it is authenticated to not have any conflicts here.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,820
So is if any code is a boolean.

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,900
If we do log in successfully here off successfully is called.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,760
So in all successfully here I want to set that this is often dictated to true.

10
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:49,530
And in log out I want to set it to false and this means I can remove this user assignment here and in

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,360
get user I can get rid of that.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,990
That won't work is all on yabber hand hearable return.

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,570
This is authenticate it.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,180
If we save this then we go back to our application.

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,130
Let's now try to log in again with valid credentials.

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,340
Now it works.

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,110
Now we can navigate around again.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:18,210
This is one way of doing this and it's not necessarily the worst but we will face an issue if we actually

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,170
start working with protected resources on the server.

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:30,830
If we lock down our firebase database so the firestorm database then we will need to prove to dad back

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,780
and so to firebase that we are offending hated and sending a single Boulia and it's not enough because

22
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,410
anyone could do that.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,170
Instead we will need to send a token debts issued to us by firebase.

24
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,050
Let's have a look at what I mean with that and how authentication and single page applications actually

25
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,740
works.
