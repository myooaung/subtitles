1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,230
What I can do the next module.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,230
So in the last modules we spend a lot of time working with angular material and I hope that it's clearer

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:17,170
how you work with it and how it works and how you can add the components you need in your app to your

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:17,790
app.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,560
Now let's move on with our app here and from a styling perspective I'm pretty happy right now.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:31,930
We miss a back end though we're only working with dummy data which we manage in the regular app through

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,220
services.

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,540
We're not storing anything on a server.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,540
We're not fetching anything from a server.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,180
So it's time to change this.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:48,880
And for this I'll use firebase as a back end and angular fired too which is a third party package as

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,320
a connector to that Bakhit.

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,040
Now before we dive into aler fire to let's have a look at firebase what is firebase.
