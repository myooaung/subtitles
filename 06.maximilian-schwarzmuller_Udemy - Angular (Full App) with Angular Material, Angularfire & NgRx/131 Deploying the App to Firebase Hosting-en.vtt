00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.940

Get your app deployed you can log into your project on firebase and click on hosting.



2

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.080

And there you will actually be able to click on get started to see the steps you need to execute to



3

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.670

get your app onto firebase hosting.



4

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.720

And the first step is that we need to install these firebase tools package which gives us a seal which



5

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.910

makes the deployment really easy.



6

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.650

So let's just run it in the command line.



7

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.970

And on Mac and Linux you probably need to add a pseudo in front of it to get the right permissions because



8

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.450

we're installing it as a global package.



9

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.860

And now with that this will download it and install it on our machine and we can already go to the next



10

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.280

step.



11

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.440

Now now here do you see the three steps you need to execute to get your project onto firebase.



12

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.260

So let's run the first command firebase log in.



13

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.680

Now I don't want to get that.



14

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.870

Thank you.



15

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.580

Now you should get a window in the browser where you have to log in.



16

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.230

I'll quickly do that.



17

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.850

And once you did this you should be forwarded.



18

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.310

Thereafter you can run firebase it needs to put this project under firebase control or to use various



19

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.900

features configure various fire of his features in that project.



20

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.960

That includes for example the database or fire store.



21

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.550

And this does not affect the fact that we're already using that in this project we could just apply



22

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.650

rules and configure the database from within that project.



23

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.350

But I don't want to do that.



24

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.190

I want to go to hosting and you can hit space and then enter to enable hosting for this project folder



25

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.710

choose your app thereafter and hit enter.



26

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.080

And then you have to choose where you are to be deployed.



27

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.330

Files are located now for us.



28

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.290

It's not the default which would be the public folder but the disk folder.



29

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.420

So simply enter disks here.



30

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.160

Thereafter you can choose yes.



31

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.310

This should be configured as a single page app which will ensure that we always return the index age



32

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.930

to him out file which ensures that the angular router always gets a chance of handling incoming requests.



33

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:15.590

If you would not choose yes year then you would get 4 0 4 errors for anything but the route route because



34

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.020

your routes are not known to the server and angular wouldn't get a chance of taking over by setting



35

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.380

this too yes it will.



36

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.170

And we get the warning that the next age tomorrow already exists there.



37

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.700

No I don't want to override that.



38

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.160

Thank you very much.



39

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.240

With that we can simply run firebase deploy now and this will upload all the files in the dist folder



40

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.900

to the firebase hosting configure everything for it there.



41

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.620

And once it's done also give us a link.



42

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.640

Here it is.



43

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.810

So this is D U R L which I can open and if I do so maybe zoom Suman a bit we can see our application



44

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.070

here.



45

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.110

So let's quickly log in.



46

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.330

That's looking good.



47

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.730

Let's start some Berberis



48

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.260

let's finish them let you all exercise.



49

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.960

We also see the whole exercises here by the way which makes sense because we are sharing the same database



50

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.320

behind the scenes filtering and so on.



51

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.840

That works.



52

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.040

And this is our application deployed.



53

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.650

So let me quickly create a new user to confirm that this all works.



54

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.640

Let's use a different e-mail your birth date and agree.



55

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.980

Oh I guess I took this e-mail too so let's use a different one.



56

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.000

That works.



57

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.270

We're locked in.



58

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.300

And let's now try this new e-mail address for logging in



59

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.350

and there's all the works.



60

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.400

And that also all works on the mobile.



61

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.160

You there as you can see by zoom in a little bit so that you can see it better here.



62

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:03.520

We of course also could use crunches and let's complete this exercise and watch our working end final



63

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.310

app run in the browser.



64

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.480

This is what we built.
