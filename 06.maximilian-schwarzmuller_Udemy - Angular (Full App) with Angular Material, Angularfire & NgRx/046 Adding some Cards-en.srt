1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,270
We had it's taps and The Last Lecture.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,800
Now I want to work on the new training now for the new training.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,030
I actually want to use a cart.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,200
Look now what do I mean with CART look.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,590
Let's look at the official documentation they are under layout.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:25,270
You find a cart component and you might notice look from a lot and lot and lot of web pages carts like

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,790
this or if you have a look at examples like this is a more complex card.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,160
Of course you can view the source code of this code to the idea behind a card a simple you have a wrapper

9
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,560
for the entire card like Matt card.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,510
In this case and then in the angular material you give a couple of subcomponents which you can nest

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:51,520
into the card if you want to get that out of the box nicely style title subtitle the general content

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,150
image that might be placed at the top and stretches to full with some action so some buttons at the

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:05,770
bottom which you can also see here and also a folder which you can optionally at all if that is optional.

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,220
It allows you to assign content to different places of your card but you can also start with a card

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,650
as simple as that.

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,210
Now here I won't take a super simple card.

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,960
We will build a card with the title a content and some actions and then want to have a card which essentially

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,250
says new training or something like that.

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:34,240
And where I don't have a form inside of it that allows me to select the training of what to do the exercise

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,310
I want to do.

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:42,010
And then an action so a button and which allows me to start that's trading now for that let's go back

22
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,760
to the code.

23
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,720
And let's at max dash cart as a component like this.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,390
Now Matt card won't work because why we haven't imported it right.

25
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,160
So let's go to the material module again.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,680
And they're at the top.

27
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,880
Let's import Matt Hart module.

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,690
This one and you know the game.

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:13,720
We also added two imports and we added two exports with Datsuns.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,710
We import data.

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,650
The module we can use the card in the new trading component like that.

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:28,250
Now Matt card is a start but as I said I want to have a title some content and also some buttons.

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:37,060
What I also want to have is I want to restrict the width of this mat card so that it's not spanning

34
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,730
the full width on big screens but only on small screens.

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,790
Let's start simple let's add.

36
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,880
This is a card and see what this looks like.

37
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,370
If I save this and we go back to our application then we see the card here.

38
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,530
And you don't really see a card because it spans the full width so everything is white here.

39
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,540
Now as I just said for bigger screens I'd like to restrict the width.

40
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,710
We can easily do this.

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,850
Why is simply assigning eFax blanks and setting this to let's say 400 pixels.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:19,620
We do that then we got a card which actually ends over here but which has one disadvantage.

43
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,720
The disadvantage is dead it's positioned all the way to the left.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,210
We can fix this with flex box as you learn but to be able to position this we need to wrap it to that

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,400
container where we can use the eFax lay out directives.

46
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,530
So let's quickly add a section to your class new training.

47
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,870
We'll see if we needed.

48
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:49,890
And then I'll add my card in that section and cutis s.i at F X or lay out just like death row is OK

49
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,870
and ethics lay out a line should center it horizontally.

50
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,880
Now what do I need to enter here to center the card horizontally.

51
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,750
Do you know that

52
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:10,550
I need to enter center because the first value which we assigned to ethics lay out a line always centers

53
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,260
on the main axis.

54
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,620
If we don't override ethics layout to use Culham then the default set up is to use row and then the

55
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,610
main axis is from left to right.

56
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,250
So if we don't center on the main axis we center horizontally so that if we say if this we get a centered

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,350
card in the middle.

58
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,130
No that's all right.

59
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,790
This is nice.

60
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,560
We got a card.

61
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:40,900
Yea but it would be better if we also had a title more detailed content for example.

62
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,490
Drop down and some buttons.

63
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,650
So let's add such things to our card.

64
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:55,110
I will remove this as a card and instead add Matt card's title a component we can use inside of Matt

65
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:04,690
card also exposed by the Matt card module and in there we could add time to start a workout.

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,300
Whatever you want.

67
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,230
If I've saved this then we got this title on the card.

68
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,020
Now a title is nice but we want to have some content too.

69
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,540
So let's add Matt card content below the title.

70
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,190
This is where I later want to add my dropdown so that I can select which type of training I want to

71
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,790
take.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,790
So I'll say select type of training for now.

73
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:40,140
And below that card content I'll add mat card actions and in here you add an action by simply adding

74
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,240
a normal button a normal button with Mat button.

75
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,860
Here like this.

76
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:54,790
Here you can give it any caption you want like start and the button can be of type submit as I will

77
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,830
later add for him.

78
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,080
But with that we essentially got our card finished.

79
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,070
If we go back and have a look at it does this how it would look like get the start button down there.

80
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,580
And this looks a bit ugly.

81
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,320
Odd traveler at a drop down here as I mentioned already.

82
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:17,290
So let's work on this and let's add a dropdown to select the type of exercise you want to do in the

83
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,040
next lecture.
