1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,160
In this module we again achieve a lot.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:13,040
We add a data table and besides that we added services and models to the entire app so that our app

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,910
does now not just look good but also work with real dynamic data.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,140
And at the end of this module you'll learn about the math data table a very powerful component that

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:31,520
can be used to output data in a structured form in a table where you can easily add features like sorting

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,670
and filtering and Page nation without having to write much code.

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,870
That's really powerful and useful in the next machos.

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,830
We will continue enhancing the sap.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,840
And for example connect to a real server and we'll see the power of a girl of fire while it's doing

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,530
so.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,510
Let's move on.
