00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.170

Let's now add some biggish items to our site NEF because right now we only have in the side Neph and



2

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.580

I have a feeling that this is not so useful for that.



3

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.230

Let's switch back to decide enough docs here on our angler material page.



4

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.300

There you can learn more about it and how to change its behavior.



5

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.320

But actually I'm interested in a list data something we haven't used before but I want to render a list



6

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.200

of elements in my side neth.



7

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.480

And actually there is this special navigational list's use case here which gives you a component that



8

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.890

makes sure that your items are really looking beautifully in a navigation list as you can see.



9

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.290

We should use this map nav list component here and then simply put our links inside of it.



10

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.010

Well let's do just that.



11

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.830

We can also by the way create a more complex list items by nesting a math list item inside.



12

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.450

Matt Napoli asked I'll show you both.



13

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:13.060

So let's add a math nav list component here into our math site nav and let's grab the first link without



14

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.040

the list item just yank or tag and put it in there.



15

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:25.380

And let's actually add all the links here without the list items as items in this neverless up here.



16

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.190

Well there are a lot of lists items I guess now you can already see I'm getting an error here because



17

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.840

of what did we forget.



18

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.650

We need to import it from material module.



19

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.180

So back to material module we added a new component de-list component.



20

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.490

So we need to import it and the name Asmat list module.



21

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.610

This is imported from at angleworm material and then it's added to imports and also to exports with



22

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.510

that make sure to save all files and go back to your application.



23

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.380

And now if we switch to a smaller screen and we are the side nav we see these items sit next to each



24

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.500

other.



25

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.070

The reason for this is that I simply put a couple of list items next to each other without further setup.



26

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:23.060

If we go back to our list here you'll see that we need to add this mapped list item selector to our



27

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.750

links though this really registers them as list items in the wrapping mat nationalist component just



28

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.010

putting a bunch of text in there doesn't really you use that correctly.



29

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.490

So let's add this year let's add Man list item to all these links and if we do that and this really



30

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.580

loads deep.



31

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.220

If I open the site again there are no need for each other and they automatically Please notice look



32

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.070

could get a little bit of padding to the left little bit of padding to the top and bottom.



33

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.460

So this is looking good.



34

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.720

And it also works.



35

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.330

You can see the background it changes doesn't close we'll have to work on that but it works for now.



36

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.510

However I want to have an icon next to it.



37

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.680

Now what we could do if we have a look at the official docs is we could of course follow this approach



38

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.560

add a map list item component like this into our map nap list and link it next to it.



39

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.560

Dyken.



40

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.500

However this approach is recommended if you want to have a list item which as it says here has more



41

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.470

than one target.



42

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.290

So you have a link and a button and they do different things.



43

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.310

Then you can still position them in the same line and make it look good by wrapping it with math list



44

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.900

item my case you or I ever I simply want to have a link with an icon inside of it.



45

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.370

And for this I can recommend a different approach here.



46

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:57.770

I will simply add something inside of my a link and that something will be a mat Iken component here



47

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:06.110

for Sign-Up Let's say I want to have the face I can I can I selected prior to this recording it'll look



48

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:15.910

like a face and it's from the material Aikins page and next to it all add a span where I say sign up.



49

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.800

Let's see how it looks.



50

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.050

We go back to our application and I open this.



51

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.720

Now we have sign up with a face next to it.



52

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.820

Now it's a little bit too close for my taste.



53

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.000

So what I can do is I can add a class neth caption maybe name is totally up to you.



54

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.410

Add it to D.C.'s Estival here.



55

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:45.240

Neph caption and do two things with these spans that hold the captions next to the icons.



56

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:54.580

First set the display to inline block so that we then can also maybe add padding simply padding left



57

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.770

of six pixels so that if we save all of that go back and open the menu We've got more space in between.



58

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.440

So this is looking good.



59

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.060

And as you can see the I can also gets to color the text gets.



60

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.520

So this is just it.



61

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.800

And it also has this light gray look if we hover over it and with that we can continue working on this



62

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.790

and add icons to all these items and then make sure that when we select an element here we actually



63

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.630

close the site now.



64

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:33.060

Now of course a good practice for you to do the I can thing shouldn't be too hard.



65

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.450

So please go ahead and search to can you personally like one for log in one for training and assigned



66

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.290

and next to these items.



67

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.420

Once we're done that we'll do the rest together and ensure that this navigation actually gets closed



68

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.860

when we click on an item.



69

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.620

Where are you successful.



70

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:00.640

Well let's go back to the app component HMO file and let's use this pattern here where we have our anchor



71

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.990

tag we're inside of it.



72

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:09.490

We're using a Eichen in a span with a class nav caption which will add padding where we use that to



73

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.840

also work on the log in or provide a log in link.



74

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.480

Here I'll use the input I can which I think looks good.



75

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.320

And let's also add a training.



76

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:30.210

I can hear your all add again Matt I can give Does the fitness center can which I have found which looks



77

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.200

really good.



78

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.560

And also add a span with a class naff caption here where it says training.



79

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:44.120

Now if we do that and we open the site navigation we get these three different icons.



80

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:54.610

Now actually there's one more link we could add here and that would be I guess log out link.



81

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.130

Which is more of a button so let's add a button.



82

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:09.870

Matt I can button where we then add a mat I can check to ikan is quite fitting here where it can also



83

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.590

add a span with Neph caption where I say log out.



84

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.960

Let's take a closer look at how that looks.



85

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.800

I opened this we got this sitting here.



86

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:29.090

However the issue we now have is that this a button is not an anchor tag with Matt last item.



87

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.500

So what we can try is we can simply add match list item to that button here.



88

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.460

Let's see how that works.



89

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.110

We opened that still doesn't look that good.



90

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.070

So we would we should do is instead try the different approach I showed you earlier.



91

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.610

Use math list item like this.



92

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.920

And now next to the bottom inside there.



93

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:55.140

So this is how we still see this approach to its approach you should take if you don't have to as well.



94

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.210

Rob simpler approach of just having a link in your list.



95

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.690

If we now open the side if we get the log out button here.



96

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.710

Now we're almost done.



97

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.530

The one thing that's missing is that we actually closed the side.



98

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.400

Now when we click one of these buttons.



99

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:18.510

So to achieve this we can simply add click listeners to the list items by default angler already handles



100

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.900

clicks and loads the appropriate route.



101

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:28.650

But we can add extra listeners for example here to the first one I add a click listener and there I



102

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:34.950

went to close the site that saw the whole site Neph close and what side the half year I'm referring



103

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.410

to the local reference which refers to decide neth.



104

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.600

And with this code if we save this I only added it to sign up.



105

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.480

If I click on sign up it loads a sign up page as I can prove to you and closes the site.



106

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:58.560

So that's one thing we can now add this to all our items here including the log out button which will



107

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.310

later hook up differently



108

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.080

and with DAPs.



109

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.920

Now we got a navigation that goes out of the way once we load a page.



110

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:17.010

So this is Deeside now half finished and the general navigation on bigger screens.



111

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.420

We have a different approach though.



112

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.080

The log out is missing here.



113

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:29.130

Let's quickly add one more where we say log out and where a won't add a router link because I'll later



114

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.320

actually handle this differently.



115

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.190

I will just add a click listener later on.



116

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.610

For now let's go with this approach here though.
