00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.760

So in this model we implemented a lot of changes and improvements to our code structure and all the



2

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.820

will lead to the error handling and so on.



3

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.570

Now let's do a test run for deployment will not deployed yet but I want to see if it would work if I



4

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.110

build it for production.



5

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:29.070

So like with Def server and then will run Engy build dash dash fraud to both for production which will



6

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.510

also use ahead of time compilation which means that the entire angle or templates are already optimized



7

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.410

and compiled now.



8

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.490

So that in the browser dishtowels has to be done again and therefore the angle starts faster.



9

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.150

So we do this by running Engy build dash dash Pre-OT and this will now optimize our code strip out unnecessary



10

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.030

code and really give us a good bundle which we can deploy.



11

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.960

And give us an error.



12

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.530

This is why I wanted to do this test run.



13

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.140

The error is coming from our environments file.



14

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.590

The problem there is that we can't initialize firebase for our production build because we're doing



15

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.930

this in the environment or TS file but Derrida's firebase key is only available in our well development



16

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.610

environment for the production varment.



17

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.150

We should at the same set up for our environment.



18

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.230

Perrott that TS file like this.



19

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.920

If we do this and we rerun the command it today actually finished the build process successfully and



20

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.580

this is one important step you have to do to ensure that your app will later work correctly.



21

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.860

Once you run it on a real server.



22

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.250

So let's not wait for it to finish and see if we got any other errors.



23

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.180

The build process finished successfully and with that we should be saved later deploy it.



24

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.960

With that I'm happy with all the optimizations we put into place.



25

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.800

Let's see what else we can do with our app.
