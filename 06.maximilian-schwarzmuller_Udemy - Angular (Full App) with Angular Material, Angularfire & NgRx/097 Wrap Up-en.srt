1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,790
In this module we did a lot of cool things.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,010
We added firebase and the angle of fire store to be precise.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,290
We hooked it up to our angular gap through angle of fire.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,960
You learn about the various ways of using angular fire to set up different types of subscriptions.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,110
Referring to the angular fires Stallworth to work with data to manipulate data to add data and get data

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:38,440
of course and you learned how to implement authentication with Angel of fire and fire base and how to

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,360
protect your service resources using data authentication approach.

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:51,160
Now we get a cool realtime application that's fed from different running app instances so where we're

9
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:59,380
sharing data in real time without reloading the page and I'd say this is a really cool state for this

10
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,280
app to be in.
