00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.170

So even gets true or false depending on what the user chose in the dialogue if it's true.



2

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.910

So if he wants to finish then we should go back to the previous page.



3

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.490

So we probably somehow want to emit an event dead we are no longer in an ongoing exercise.



4

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.270

If it's false.



5

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.390

So if the user didn't confirm to exit then we want to receive them.



6

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.410

The timer now to achieve that.



7

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.820

Let's start with the exit case for dead or import the event emitter and output from an angle of core



8

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.620

and create my new property here.



9

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:53.960

Maybe at the top so that we can quickly see it decorated with at output which is training wups training



10

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.870

exit new event motor like dat.



11

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.130

Now I want to hold it if down here.



12

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.540

Result is true because it's true if the user confirms to exit.



13

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:20.260

So if for assault then I want to call this training exit emet just like that we made this event.



14

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.840

And now in the training component where we use the current training I can listen to training excerpt



15

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:35.190

and set ongoing training equal to force if it occurs because the user quit.



16

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.500

Let's try that out.



17

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.230

Let's start the training.



18

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.580

And stop it and confirm.



19

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.430

And we're back.



20

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.630

Let's start and stop and don't confirm and we stay alert to resume the timer.



21

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.830

So now to resume the timer.



22

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.480

We of course all need to implement some code.



23

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:05.490

The good thing is one thing we can do we can simply add a method maybe names start or resume timer and



24

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.420

put our timer code into this method.



25

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.040

Now I will call this method right in on in it.



26

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.800

So this start or reassumed timer.



27

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.850

And I also call it down there.



28

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.540

If resoled is not true so do we continue.



29

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.200

And since we always start to progress we can just continue like that.



30

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:37.200

So if we start a new training and we stop but then decide to not quit then it will actually recede and



31

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.460

continue.



32

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.840

We do quit though.



33

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.010

Well then we're done.



34

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.650

Ragon So with that we added our dialogue and we can control our ongoing training.



35

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.940

Still we're not really passing around data.



36

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.550

Obviously it works without us selecting anything and that dropdown.



37

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.970

These are all things we'll work on.



38

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.360

But for now I really liked the progress we made.



39

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.900

Now let's see what else we can do in the next lectures.
