00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.330

Get zone the last lecture I explained how observables work in a very condensed manner let's simply see



2

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.010

it in action.



3

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.810

What do you think about that.



4

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.970

So you see it in action with first of all need some data.



5

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.400

So let's switch back to firebase and go to the database section there.



6

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.800

Now there you have the choice between two databases.



7

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.070

The real time data and the cloud firers store.



8

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.790

It's still in beta at the point of time recording this.



9

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.010

But it should be safe to use and it is the next gen database offering by firebase.



10

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.710

So let's click try fires door and there let's actually start in test mode.



11

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.890

Now here important.



12

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.440

Anyone can read or write your database.



13

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.850

So this is really only for us now to get started quickly.



14

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.580

We will later switches to lock mode to make sure that only offene cable users can read and write the



15

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.150

data.



16

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.690

For now let's start in test mode here.



17

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.220

This will now wish in the fire store for us and prepare everything so that we can use it when everything



18

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.050

is prepared.



19

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.820

This is how the cloud firestorm looks like.



20

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.900

Now how does the cloud firestorm actually work.



21

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.850

The official docs are a great place to learn more but let me quickly walk you through the core concepts



22

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.670

and then we'll show you the example of the docs because they're really great to understand how cloud



23

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.840

Firestar works.



24

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.250

And a great place for you to dive deeper.



25

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.340

So classifiers fires tornadoes freak kinds of turns when working with well cloud fires firestorm collections



26

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.430

which you could compare to folders on your operating system documents which you can well compare to



27

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.520

documents on your operating system which are organized in folders or collections in this case and data



28

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.870

inside a document.



29

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.490

Now that's a really good picture to understand what we're working with.



30

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.220

The idea of falling in the fire story if you store documents and you end a document could be the data



31

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.320

about one single user multiple users would have multiple documents.



32

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.350

Now documents are part of collections.



33

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.710

You must have documents in a collection collection.



34

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.500

Remember it's just a folder.



35

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.390

So in this example your we have a user's folder with two documents two users.



36

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.620

Now you can also have collections which are nested though you can't have a collection inside a collection.



37

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.700

But as a child of a document.



38

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.230

So what you can actually have if you scroll down to hierarchical data is you can have a Rooms folder



39

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.790

so a collection with Room A and B which are both documents but where Room A might have a message just



40

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.170

subcollection.



41

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.250

So debt collection is part of the document which is part of a collection.



42

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.380

And you always have this alternating pattern of collection document collection document.



43

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.000

Now what's the data then the data is what's inside a document besides any possible sub collections.



44

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.910

So in this case your room A has the data name which holds a value of my chat room.



45

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.070

And then additionally also has the subcollection.



46

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.470

Now the data in the document really is like in a javascript object or to be precise like Chase and data



47

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.270

key value pairs.



48

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.490

This is the cloud fire story.



49

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.370

It's not meant to store files.



50

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.780

By the way you don't store images there.



51

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.250

It's there to store data text data if you want.



52

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.410

So this is to cloud firestorm in a nutshell.



53

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.450

And again you can dive deeper into firebase in general if you're interested.



54

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.580

But angle of fire is now what I want to have a look at.



55

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.610

But to do that we should go back to our console and simply add our first collection.



56

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.150

Now remember I want to set up some data which we can use to populate our away level exercise data.



57

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:58.040

So I would simply named is available exercises now click next.



58

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.620

And now it allows me to create a new document.



59

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.590

It actually is able to generate an ID for that document automatically which you might want to do.



60

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.140

And then you can assign key value pairs.



61

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.940

For example if you have a look at our code each exercise of us has an idea.



62

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.010

Now here we had a clearly readable one.



63

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.800

But we can take the automatically generated one and then we have a name duration and calories.



64

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.590

So let's now create this here too.



65

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.420

Let's add a name and the first one should be crunches and it is history.



66

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.610

Now let's add another field here.



67

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.250

That field is the duration.



68

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580

It's not a string but a number.



69

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.550

And for crunches we had 30 seconds.



70

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.530

So let's enter 30.



71

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.570

Last but not least we have the calories.



72

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.360

The calories for crunches are also a number.



73

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.470

And there it was eight.



74

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.770

As you can see.



75

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.120

So this is our collection.



76

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.740

And if you want you can of course also assign your own unique ID here and use crunches again instead



77

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.540

of the automatically generated one.



78

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.020

I will use that automatically generated one.



79

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.860

This prevents collisions of our data.



80

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.130

So that is our first document.



81

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.350

If we had save now it will get created and you can now see the collection at the document in the collection.



82

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.500

And as you can see you can now add more fields or sub collections does this alternating pattern that



83

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.480

you can follow.



84

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.340

But of course here I don't need some collections.



85

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.960

So we got more than one exercise though.



86

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.710

So let's quickly create documents for the ABA exercises.



87

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.170

So here we have the name field and the name was touched hos.



88

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.750

We can also already remember the duration which was 180 calories which were 15.



89

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.970

So let me quickly enter the name then the duration 180.



90

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:59.070

Though that is a number and the calories which was 15 also a number by the way.



91

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:07.130

In my case here I m whip's I am using the same structure for all my documents.



92

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.450

They all have a name calories and a duration.



93

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.040

This is not required though you could have different fields for different documents.



94

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.850

Firestorm is a schema less database here however it makes sense to use the same because well my exercises



95

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.060

just happened to be in the same structure.



96

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.380

So let's create the next the exercise side lungis.



97

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.590

So here the name is side lungis and then we got 120 and 18.



98

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.360

So let's quickly add this here.



99

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:44.260

Let's add a field duration is the number 120 and then 18 for the calories.



100

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.930

So here let's quickly add calories.



101

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.150

Number 18 and with that we got created.



102

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.570

Now on to the last data piece by piece.



103

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.330

Let's copy Burpy here.



104

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.000

Add a document create an ID automatically and create our name Burpy is.



105

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.680

And for Burpy we have a duration of sixty eight calories.



106

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:15.150

So let's a side iteration which is a type of number 60 and then calorie is also a number.



107

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.170

And that was eight.



108

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.030

And with that we created all the data we use in our application in the database.



109

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:28.360

Firebase offers us tick West now just is how do we connect angular to that.



110

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.670

The answer of course is angular fire.



111

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.930

And we're going to install and use it in the next lecture as.
