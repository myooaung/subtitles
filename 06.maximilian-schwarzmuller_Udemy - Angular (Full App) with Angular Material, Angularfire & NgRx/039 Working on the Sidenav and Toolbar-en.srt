1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,080
In the last lecture we at the site Nav. know when to add a toolbar.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,190
So a menu bar at the top you could say a toolbar is more than that though you can add it anywhere in

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,580
any container in any place of your application.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,210
And in the end it's just a block with a background color with some items on it.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,660
It uses flex blocks internally to distribute these items.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:28,570
You learned about flex box earlier in this course and will let me show you how to use it.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:37,300
As I mentioned if we want to have to site nav go over it we have to add toolbar to our mat site Neph

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,420
content component inside of it to be precise.

9
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:48,220
There I will add Matt toolbar my to war for now and it will wrap router outlet into a main element.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,020
Does this not angular material component it's a different age.

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,930
Tim L-1 just to ensure that this looks good and is semantically correct.

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,820
So now we get the toolbar and what's missing to make this work.

13
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,710
The import of course.

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,140
So the material module.

15
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:13,940
As always we need to import a module for this component so that Matt toolbar module will wrap that module

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,720
and we add it to imports and exports.

17
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,940
And with that if we go back to our running application we now see the toolbar at the top here and it

18
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,980
has this light gray ish background as you can see.

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,200
Now as I mentioned this toolbar internally uses flex blocks.

20
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,690
First of all let's make sure we can see it a bit better because one thing you can do with the tool bar

21
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,810
just as some other components.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,650
It helps to have a color property you can bind.

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,110
Not that many components have them but buttons are one of them and the tool bar is another kind of component

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,940
that has it.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,860
So there you can add your primary accent or we're in color now here I'll go with primary.

26
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:07,250
This will give us this nice purple of our theme and the cool thing is when you change your theme of

27
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,370
course all these elements are going to change with it which is the whole idea behind having a global

28
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,360
theme.

29
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,480
So now we get that toolbar.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,460
As I said it was a flex box.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,210
So let's see this in action by adding more elements to it.

32
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,920
It does is the simplest form of a tool bar a more realistic toolbar is to have a couple of different

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,210
sections on it so to say.

34
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:37,400
So let's add a death year and the first div I later want to have my toggle button.

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:47,330
So for now I'll add a button where I say toggle side NAV then I'll add a number diff where I want yes.

36
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:55,830
Let's say the logo of our application and offer we could have a div with some menu icons.

37
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:11,640
There we could already add some anchor tax where we said router link equal to let's say sign up sign

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,040
and so on.

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:20,160
We can work on the styling later for now I would simply add to us also that we can see something at

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,850
least if I save this now.

41
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,620
Everything is positioned next to each other because we use flex box are ways you would have expected

42
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,900
to see all these things go beneath each other because they're all the diff which are block level elements

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,430
but Flex box takes over control and position stand next to each other.

44
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,190
But of course the styling yet is not super beautiful I'd say.

45
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:51,280
So that is something we should work on before we do that let's connect this button here to decide now

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,060
though.

47
00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:00,130
And to achieve this all at a click Lisner year were executed let's say on toggle the name is totally

48
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,070
up to you.

49
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,980
And in the on toggle method which I implement in my app component here I will now want to emit an event

50
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,770
to which I can listen from outside so that my side nav can be toggled.

51
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,980
And now inside of on toggle in the typescript class here I want to toggle my side now.

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:29,140
Now I'm not going to use this openside nav method but instead I want to use this site nav reference.

53
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,650
They were actually the easiest way might be to either use at view child to get access to that so at

54
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:43,150
you child site NAF would give us access to this reference and we can use it in on toggle or we actually

55
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,790
don't use on TOL.

56
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:52,510
We'll go back to this later though and instead we use side Nav. toggle just as we did earlier with that

57
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:59,710
if we save this set up and I click this button we can target the site now but we can see one issue the

58
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,860
content here is actually not that high end.

59
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,390
That makes it look rather strange.

60
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,650
So let's fix the site neth height in the next lecture before we then fix the styling of the toolbar.
