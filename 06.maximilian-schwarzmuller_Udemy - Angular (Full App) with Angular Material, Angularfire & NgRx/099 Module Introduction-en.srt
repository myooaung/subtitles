1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,080
This far in course we already achieved a lot.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,700
And our application is already looking good and working great.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,470
Still there are things we can polish we can optimize both from our optical as well as from a technical

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,800
perspective from an optical perspective.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,510
We could for example add better error handling especially during authentication and maybe also show

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,820
some spinners some loading indicator.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:38,290
Whilst we are affiliating and from a technical perspective we could split our app module into further

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,760
modules so that it's less crowded and implement lazy loading forward of training part.

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,380
These are the things I'll tackle in this module.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,530
So let's dive right in.
