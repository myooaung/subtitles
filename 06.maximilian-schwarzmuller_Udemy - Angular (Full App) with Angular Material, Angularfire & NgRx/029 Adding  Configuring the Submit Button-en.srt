1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,680
Time to continue on our sign up for.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,610
We added.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,150
Q inputs are two components actually we are more than that.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,210
We are at the forum field and input component and I want to add more components but first of all let's

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,330
add a basic component a button so that we can submit this form and see how we can actually grab these

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,520
values and work with them.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:32,030
Now the cool thing is these form field components your work with both the reactive forms approach and

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,550
the template driven one.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,860
So you can use either of the two.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,800
Let me show you how to use the template driven one year.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,060
However it's exactly the same code you use in any other English app.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,530
First of all let me quickly add a button as you might remember that's a normal button where you add

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,250
Matt.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:59,400
And then for example rased button I will also add a color here which are set to primary and I'll add

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,750
submit as a text.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,500
Now use that button you need to add something to the material module the mat but marginal needs to be

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,720
imported and added to imports and exports.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,210
We already got this from the early example though.

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,910
So with that added If we go back to the application we see that button in the middle of the click it

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,480
submits the form which I don't want like this.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,040
Now first of all let me get this partner type submit which is a good practice a good pattern.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:38,220
And let's now make sure that we control is for Frue angular as you might know it by default on a form

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,120
which is not initialized with the re-active approach angle or use a template driven approach.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,970
If we add a special import to the app module Do you know which import that is.

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:59,440
If you do go ahead and edit It's the form's module to unlock forms functionalities we need to import

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,050
this into our Engler app.

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,090
So I'm going to add import to the app module.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,930
It's the form's module and it's coming from angular forms like this.

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,790
Now go to Raptor's forms module and I will add it to imports.

30
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:23,590
Now aler will detect our form and will automatically create object representation offered behind the

31
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,940
scenes.

32
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,830
The form isn't that useful though.

33
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,400
We need to register our inputs as controls to the angle of form and we do this by adding two things

34
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,290
when using the template driven approach.

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,890
At least we add energy model like this.

36
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,790
We could add with two way binding but this directive alone is enough to make angular aware of it.

37
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,450
And I don't want to use tway binding here.

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,530
One thing we have to add though is the name attribute where we give this control a name.

39
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,790
Here I'll name it email.

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,770
Now for the password.

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:09,460
All the add and model and give us a name of password now with that we got all these controls set up

42
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,210
now to make this forum submit a bill I will first of all give it a local reference by adding hash tag

43
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,150
and that the name of the reference like F and assigned us to Engy form.

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,420
It just gives us access to this automatically created object.

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,020
It then stores it in this f local reference which we can only use the template to get to some method

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,490
in our typescript file or bind DNG submit event which is made available by Engler and it will execute

47
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:46,030
on submit and pass this local reference F and you can name as whatever you want.

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,830
Now in the typescript file maps on the testing fall but in the typescript file here I can add on submit

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,710
and there will receive a form which will be of type ngi for him and you can add the import here which

50
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,440
should point to at angle of forums like this.

51
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:12,030
So we get this forum here and for now let's simply log it to the console like at.

52
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:19,480
Now with that we help button which will submit the form which will be catched by angular through and

53
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,530
you submit it which will trigger on submit and forewards the automatically created for.

54
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,450
Let's go back to our page and hit submit.

55
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,710
And indeed I greased this entry form here with all the fields.

56
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,520
You probably already know.

57
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:46,340
And if I enter an e-mail here like test at test dot com and testor and submit does well then we can

58
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,020
see that under value we get an object which has an or a password with our values.

59
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,520
Now that's nice but can't we do more with that.

60
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Can we add validation.

61
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,380
Maybe show an error message and maybe show a hint.

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,190
Let's do all these things in the next lecture.
