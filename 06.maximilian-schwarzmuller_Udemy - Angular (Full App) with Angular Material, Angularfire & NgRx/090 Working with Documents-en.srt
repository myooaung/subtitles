1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,150
Over the last lectures we worked a lot with the angle of fire still where we learned how to read data

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,660
both just the values as well as well use and meta data.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,630
You'll learn how to store data.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,740
But of course you can also delete and update data and do more.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:26,340
Now on the regular fire documentation you can dive deeper into all of that here under interacting with

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,540
your databases.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,510
You get the cloud firestorm.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,000
And there you can work with documents and collections.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,970
We thus far always worked with the collections interface which at that can be confusing.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,130
Which also allows you to fetch documents the documents documentation really should be understood as

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,790
if you want to update or delete a single document but you can access that all through collections.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,310
If you click on documents though you can read more about how to work with documents for example that

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:05,770
you can simply exit doc method on your injected angler fire store and pass the path to a document.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,630
This would be the collection name and then the document name.

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:16,070
So the idea of the document in our case and then you can also listen to changes to debt document only

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,200
instead of to the entire collection.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,470
What we always did since we need that behavior in our app and if you scroll down further you have to

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,200
say mephitic or snapshot changes and so on.

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,790
You also can call set update and delete on a single document instead of as we do it in our training

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,510
service and on the entire collection.

21
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,510
And it's not available on a single document because on a document you can't add more documents.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,140
You can only set it to a new value overwriting all the old values update the values which will merge

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,920
the old with new values or delete the document to still give you an example of how you would interact

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,350
with a single document.

25
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,050
Let's add some dummy method for now.

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,930
Whenever we start a new exercise we get the idea of de-select that exercise and we can use that ID to

27
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,480
access it and add a new field to it like the selected count.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,310
So let me show you how this would work.

29
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,240
We would still access our injected database property.

30
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:28,610
So the injected angle or firestorm class here and there I would use the doc method the method takes

31
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:36,650
a path to the document which would be available exercises which of course is the collection slash and

32
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,010
then the selected to select a single document because that document method has one goal.

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,760
Select one single document if you want more documents use to collection as we did it thus far on that

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,140
select document.

35
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,640
We could then call well delete to get rid of it whenever we selected or we could of course all the calls

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,250
set to override or update to add fields without overwriting the old ones.

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,170
So that's what I'll do here.

38
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,620
I add data that will be merged with the old data.

39
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,050
And I will at last select that field here.

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,310
Which simply could be the current date.

41
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:25,490
Let's say let's save this and go back to our application now in the fitness tracker if I log in again

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,260
and I open the console lock to ensure we don't get any errors.

43
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,290
If I select an exercise we don't see anything here.

44
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,630
Let's go back to the firebase console and let's check our documents now.

45
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,850
They're all as we stored them before.

46
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,320
Because start exercise wasn't executed yet.

47
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,970
So let me start it.

48
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,960
Still no error.

49
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,140
Let's now have a look at our fire store.

50
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,550
And now for teched those we see this new field.

51
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,770
So this is how this was added and how we interact with a single document just like that.

52
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,110
Now I'll comment this out because we don't really need that functionality.

53
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,200
But this is how you could select a single document and then updated.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,250
And the alternatives would be setting it or deleting it or of course also subscribing to value changes

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,080
of this document.

56
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,540
Only if you're not interested in the changes of a whole collection.

57
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,030
Now for a whole collection I show you how to add elements and how to get all elements.

58
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,850
And of course with a mixture of these two working with single documents and working with collections

59
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,550
where you can get lists of documents with their IDs which then could be used to access single documents

60
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,980
and for example define such a POV and delete them with that combination.

61
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:53,200
You got the full power to interact with the fire store with firebase fire store through angle or fire.

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,490
So that's it for the database.

63
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,640
We still got authentication though.

64
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,760
So let's implement some real of indication over the next lectures.
