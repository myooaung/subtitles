1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,390
Now with all the time spent on the welcome component and so on.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,670
It's time to go on to the training component.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,340
Let's close all our sections and open the training section and then we get current new and past trainings.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,030
Now we'll work on past training Slater first.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,290
We need a training.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,010
And before we can see a current training we need to be able to set one up.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:30,420
So why don't we start with the new training and now we all got that training component here right.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,020
Is Paran components so to say of the whole section.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,580
Now my idea is the following a one I use some tabs here that we get a tap's component where we can switch

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,160
between set up a new training or view past trainings.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,630
So that is what I want to do implement some tabs year in the training component.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,810
Let's go back to the official documentation and let's look for Tapps.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,460
Here they are under layout.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,580
There we find the taps component.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,450
We see an example of how this works and looks.

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:11,220
As always you can inspect the source code and you can read more about different use cases and different

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,600
adjustments you can make to that component.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,780
In general there's one specific case which might be interesting to you and that's tap's navigation where

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,140
you should use this special syntax for setting up navigation at the taps.

20
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,030
Now if you're not planning on using tabs as navigation do you approach shown at the beginning as to

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,770
what you want to use with Matt tap room instead of is Neph element with Matt have nav bar in our project

22
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,030
you could actually use both.

23
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,620
We could set up some different routes for setting up a new training or doing past trainings.

24
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,610
I want to use a single route approach here though to show this first way of using it.

25
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,210
But it's ultimately of course up to you which one you want to use.

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,230
What we will do is since I want to use the first approach is that I will grab this set up cohered this

27
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,860
example code and then walk you through it.

28
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:12,090
So let's take that code here and put it into the training component like this.

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,460
Now as always the components here are not recognized because we haven't added them to our project yet.

30
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:26,910
Let's go back to the material module and simply add the mat tab module mat tab module excuse me added

31
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:37,270
like this and then add it here to imports and two exports and with that added We can go back to the

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,050
training component.

33
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,530
And in this component and the training component.

34
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,520
Now these will actually be recognized we can already see that if we go back to our application and we

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,550
switch to training.

36
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,330
Here are the taps and we can switch between them and I will actually leave the set up as this year spanning

37
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,430
the full width.

38
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:03,220
Of course you could restrict the width by assigning a with to match tab group or using flex layout in

39
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,430
some sort.

40
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:12,250
However I want to have that full screen look I won't name my taps Tab 1 and 2 instead I will have a

41
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,060
new training or new exercise maybe.

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,190
And here I will have past exercises.

43
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:29,500
Now the part between Matt's tab your content one and content two is not what's on the labels of the

44
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,090
tabs but actually what gets loaded when a tab is selected.

45
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:40,210
So if we go back we see content one here for the first tab and content to forward a second.

46
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course I don't want to have Clinton one in Canton to hear I want to have my new training component

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,190
and my past trainings component.

48
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,730
So I will replace contemned one with new training.

49
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,150
This is the selector of this new training component.

50
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,410
So that's added as a component here and for content too.

51
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:11,580
I want to use the selector of past trainings which is at past tradings this one so I'll add this here

52
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,260
like that.

53
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,150
With that if we go back we can also still twitch.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,060
But now between new training and past tradings.

55
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,720
So this is our tabs working.

56
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,920
Now the goal is to ensure that we actually well see more than just new training works here.

57
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,520
Let's start with the new training and let's start editing it.

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,620
Let's have a look at what we can add here in the next lecture.
