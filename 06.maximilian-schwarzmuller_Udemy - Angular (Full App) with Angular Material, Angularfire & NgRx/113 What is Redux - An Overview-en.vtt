00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.000

So what is relax read.



2

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.220

Is all about having a central store where we store the entire application state.



3

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.380

So things like are we loading something data.



4

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:20.030

We load exercises and the array of loaded exercises and then we have our services and components that



5

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.470

interact with each other.



6

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.930

And that received a state from that central store so that we really have that centralized approach.



7

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.400

We also have actions if we want to change the story.



8

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.150

We don't directly manipulate it.



9

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.520

Instead we dispatch actions that reach so-called reducers were to be precise.



10

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.470

There's only one producer but we can combine it build it from multiple reducers this takes action and



11

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.180

a potential payload and reduces it to a value which then is stored in that central store in the immutable



12

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.580

way.



13

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.220

So it doesn't alter the old store.



14

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.530

It simply takes the old store and replaces a part of it with a brand new value.



15

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.190

The approach shown here is redux and we can implemented an angular.



16

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.030

And you typically do this with DNG are X pattern.



17

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.940

This also follows this approach but the differences are that it's steeply integrated into angular from



18

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.130

the naming conventions by the fact that it uses typescript and so on that it uses our x.



19

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.080

Yes.



20

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.890

And then we have actions and also the so-called side effects.



21

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.720

Side effects are things like.



22

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.750

I want to change the route I wanted to make an HDP request so things which are not stored in the store



23

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.080

you don't store the route there you don't store the HTP request they're the result of the HTP request



24

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.280

but not the fact that you're making one.



25

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.820

So that is a side effects and that's probably now all confusing.



26

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.320

So let's implement this step by step and let's add energy or X to our application.
