00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,880
I don't know if you have read the phenomenal book by Malcolm Gladwell,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,190
titled Outliers.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,310
In this book, Gladwell shows that completely random factors,

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,480
such as day of birth, can determine opportunities to achieve success.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,330
For example, Gladwell found that in Canadian ice hockey,

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,870
most of the players who ended up in the NHL were

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,700
born in the first half of the year.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,650
The reason was that the age cut‑off set for youth

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,170
teams was at the beginning of January,

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,880
meaning that kids who are born in December can compete with

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,040
kids who are almost one year older than them.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,580
So, practically speaking,

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,730
these small age differences can have a lifelong effect on the

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,240
hockey player's opportunity to succeed.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,410
Whether we agree with the author or not,

16
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,420
outliers do exist in our daily life,

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,280
and they have a significant impact on our long‑term prospects.

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,260
Machine learning is no exception.

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,000
Outlier data points are data points that differ

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,850
significantly from other data points,

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,600
and they can have severe effects on our machine

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,070
learning and data analysis endeavors.

23
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,840
The real‑world data is not ideal,

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,600
due to several reasons: Data entry mistakes either from

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,470
human or even instruments failure.

26
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,070
Data processing and manipulation errors.

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,130
A legitimate outlier in form of extremely rare events that are not

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,730
representative of the current status quo. For example,

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,610
a super generous millionaire who decides to pay 10 times the property price.

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,890
The risky thing about outliers, even though they are usually in small magnitudes,

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,670
even though they are usually in small amounts in our dataset,

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,940
is that they significantly damage the statistical properties of our

33
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,140
dataset by introducing skews and faulty distributions.

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,270
However, in certain scenarios such as fraud detection,

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,010
the rare events can be more interesting than the

36
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,670
more regularly occurring events.

37
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,480
And, hence, outlier analysis becomes important.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,840
Let's now start discussing how we can fix outliers. In

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,910
this case, our solution will be two steps‑‑finding

40
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,330
outliers and then handling outliers.

41
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,250
Let's first discuss finding outliers.

42
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,420
The first technique that we can use is what is so called Z‑Score. A

43
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,730
Z‑Score is simply an indication of how many standard deviation

44
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,970
points a specific data point is far from the mean. A typical outlier

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,840
value would be a Z‑Score of 3.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,740
However,

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,940
you can define a different value based on your dataset. Z‑Score

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,980
works better with normally distributed data.

49
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,410
The second approach would be to use the interquartile range we discussed

50
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,840
earlier and to consider everything outside it as outlier.

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,540
Also, the box and scatterplots are excellent tools to detect outliers visually.

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,770
To handle outliers, there are two general approaches‑‑to remove

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,990
them all together or to correct them if you feel that you know

54
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,000
their reasonable limits. An example would be to cap the dataset elements to specific value.
