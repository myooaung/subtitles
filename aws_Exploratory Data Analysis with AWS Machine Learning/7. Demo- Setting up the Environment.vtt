00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.420
And now let's proceed with a demo where we will set up our Amazon

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.080
SageMaker instance and upload our dataset to get ready with the next

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.340
steps in the exploratory data analysis.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.780
First, you need to make sure that you have access to AWS subscription.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.840
Amazon provides a free subscription that works for our course purposes.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.190
You can create a one by going here.

7
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.800
Then,

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.820
we will navigate to the AWS Management Console and sign in

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:48.740
with the registered email and password.

10
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.430
Then, I will be presented with the Amazon dashboard.

11
00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:03.340
In the search box, we will type SageMaker and chose Amazon SageMaker.

12
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.330
After we chose Amazon SageMaker,

13
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.640
we will be presented with the SageMaker dashboard,

14
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.700
and on the left,

15
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.250
you can see there are several options that enable

16
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.940
machine learning functionality, such as labeling using Ground Truth,

17
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.740
Notebook instances and Git repositories,

18
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.330
training our algorithms, inferencing, and some AWS Marketplace features,

19
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.080
such as community algorithms.

20
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.500
Let's just focus on setting up our notebooks.

21
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.640
Click on Notebook instances on the left under the Notebook tree element.

22
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.570
We will be presented with a window containing all

23
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.040
our currently running notebooks.

24
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.860
There is no one running currently.

25
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.540
Let's create a new one.

26
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.290
Click on Create a notebook instance.

27
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.600
Now we will need to fill in bunch of details.

28
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.800
Notebook instance name.

29
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.360
Let's call it HousesPricesDataAnalysisInstance.

30
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.240
I know it's a long name, but I like to be precise.

31
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.340
The second option is the Notebook instance type.

32
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.200
This is an important field as it tells how much power we

33
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.940
will need for our machine learning tests.

34
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.790
Amazon provides many different types of machine learning

35
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.590
instances that differ in virtual CPU, GPU,

36
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.660
memory, and network performance.

37
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.540
You can follow the shown link to know more.

38
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.180
You can leave it as ml.t2.medium.

39
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.940
It works for us.

40
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.740
The third option is Elastic Inference.

41
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.840
This helps if we want to get a higher performance for deep learning models.

42
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.480
We don't need that for our model.

43
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.100
Leave it as none.

44
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.130
There are other advanced options,

45
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.470
whether we want to grant SageMaker access to S3 packet,

46
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.040
to enable root access.

47
00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.040
Do we need to attach the notebook instance to a VPC or use a Git repo.

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
We need none of them, and I would proceed and create the notebook instance.

49
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.970
Then, we will need to wait some time until our instance is created.

50
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.660
As you can see, the Status is Pending.

51
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.440
And in few minutes, my instance is up and running and showing Status InService,

52
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.970
Click on Open Jupyter to open your Jupyter Notebook instance in AWS.

53
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.730
As you can see in the URL,

54
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.540
there is a designated URL for your Jupyter Notebook instance.

55
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.040
Let's now upload our dataset to our notebook instance.

56
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.430
Click on Upload, and I have chosen the AmesHousing dataset,

57
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.040
and I will upload it.

58
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.330
I'll click Upload. And now click on New, and notice that Amazon

59
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.370
SageMaker notebook instance supports different types of

60
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.630
notebooks. Choose conda_pyton3, and now a new Python 3

61
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.380
Anacondaâ€‘based notebook will be instantiated.

62
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.510
It is just similar to the regular Jupyter Notebooks you use to work

63
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.090
with. Change the title to HousesPricesDataAnalysis. After we have

64
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.310
changed the title to HousesPricesDataAnalysis,

65
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.480
we can start typing some Python code.

66
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.240
Let's import a few Python libraries that we will need to data analysis effort.

67
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.030
Firstly, I will add import numpy.

68
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.210
And for those of you who don't know NumPy, it's a Python packet

69
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.080
that allows to do mathematical operations over arrays. You can

70
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.020
learn about it more in my course here,

71
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.970
at Pluralsight, Building Your First Machine Learning Solution.

72
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.310
Then I will import pandas,

73
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:56.380
and I will import a certain function from Matplotlib. Pandas

74
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.480
helps in certain that analysis features,

75
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.140
while Matplotlib makes it easy for us to do some plotting.

76
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.190
And now let me run this line. Good.

77
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.680
Let's now load our data to our pandas data frame. And that's run it.

78
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.500
Let's see the first five lines in our data. And this

79
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.540
is done using the head function.

80
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.970
And here is it.

81
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.000
As you can see,

82
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000
SageMaker notebooks work more or less the same as regular Jupyter Notebooks. We are done with preparing our Amazon SageMaker instance now.
