Hello, everyone. This is Mohammed Osman speaking over here. We have

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.740
seen how descriptive statistics can help us with understanding the

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.160
overall data distribution, and now let's look at the second piece of

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.940
the puzzle, data visualization.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.570
We will start this module by discussing the reasons and

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.390
motivations behind doing data visualization.

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.700
Then, we will discuss their benefits of doing these

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.340
visualizations and their practical usage scenarios.

9
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.450
Then, we will see a powerful visualization that can help us

10
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.840
to summarize the descriptive statistics,

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.440
which is the box plot.

12
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.840
Then, we will discuss what are the different types of visualizations

13
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.080
and go through the most common ones and their benefits in the context

14
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.840
of data analysis and machine learning.

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.420
Then, we will proceed with a demo and see how we can do

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.240
these visualizations using AWS SageMaker.

17
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.500
After that, we'll explain a different way to do visualizations in AWS,

18
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:23.000
which is AWS QuickSight, an AWS service directed towards data visualization. And then, we will conclude with a demo for AWS QuickSight.
