00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,940
In this section, we are going to briefly discuss some statistical concepts.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,140
Feel free to skip them if you are familiar with them.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,240
Univariate statistics refer to statistics over a single variable.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,460
This is because there are many different statistical

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,840
measures based on the number of variables.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,090
Let's assume that we have the following dataset.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,490
Let's define the following statistical measures. Minimum,

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,310
which is defined as the least value in our dataset, is 1,

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,470
while maximum, which is defined as the greatest value in our dataset,

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,200
is 55.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,730
The range,

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,990
which is defined as the difference between the greatest

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,840
and smallest value in the dataset, which is 54.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,240
Count, which is defined as the number of elements in the dataset is 10.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,340
Sum, which is defined as the sum of all dataset elements, is 161.

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,960
The mean, which is defined as the sum over the count or the average, is 16.1.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,690
The median,

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,580
which is defined as the middle value in the dataset when

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,040
ordered in an ascending or descending fashion,

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,720
which is 7.5.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,120
The mode, which is defined as the most common value in our dataset, is 5.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,760
The standard deviation,

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,740
which is a measure of how the numbers are spread out in the dataset,

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,490
is 18.6.

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,920
A closely related measure is variance,

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,840
which is 347 and defined as the square of the standard deviation.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,340
Quartiles are calculated when the data is ordered in an ascending fashion.

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,760
The first quartile, which describes which value is higher than 25% of the data,

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,640
is calculated as 5, while the second quartile,

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,350
which is defined as the value, which is higher than 50% of the data,

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,840
is 7.5, which is as same as the median.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,880
Finally, the third quartile,

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,440
which defines the value that is higher than 75% of the data,

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,340
is 20.

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,030
The interquartile range is defined as the difference between

36
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,610
the third quartile and the first quartile,

37
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,340
which is 15.

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,140
The interquartile range is very useful to identify outlier data points.

39
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,920
The mean and median are categorized as central tendency measures since

40
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,150
they calculate value that generally tend to the center,

41
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,080
while standard deviation, variance,

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,800
and IQR are commonly referred to as dispersion measures as they tell

43
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,240
us to what extent the data points are dispersed.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
This was a brief explanation.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,410
If you are totally new to statistics,

46
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,730
I would recommend you to watch Understanding the Overall Data Trends

47
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,240
module in my course Building Your First Machine Learning Solution

48
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,040
where I discuss these measures in detail.

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,820
Correlation is one type of bivariate statistics.

50
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,970
Bivariate statistics refer to statistical measures

51
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,890
that are applied over two variables.

52
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,950
Correlation tells us to what extent two variables are linearly related.

53
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,040
Let's take the following example,

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,880
which is a table that describes the temperature,

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,170
ice cream sales, and jacket sales.

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,330
As you can note, the general trend, as the temperature decreases,

57
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,290
the ice cream sales also decreases.

58
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,010
That makes sense since many people don't like to take

59
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,770
ice cream during the cold weather.

60
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,820
However, as the temperature decreases,

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,540
jacket sales increases as people don't want to get caught with flu.

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,520
To quantify the type of relationship between temperature and ice

63
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,750
cream sales on one hand an the relationship between temperature

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,040
and jacket sales on the other hand, we use correlation.

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,450
There are a couple of methods to calculate correlation.

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,040
We will use a method called Pearson correlation.

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,930
Pearson correlation defines correlation measures between ‑1 and +1

68
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,040
with ‑1 indicating a high negative correlation,

69
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
which is inverse linear relationship.

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,150
When one variable increases, the other variable decreases.

71
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,220
While +1 indicate the high positive correlation linear relationship. When

72
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,550
one variable increases, the other variable increases also. The correlation

73
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,000
between temperature and ice cream sales is calculated as 0.92, which

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,840
indicates a high positive relationship.

75
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,040
When the temperature increases, ice cream sales increases.

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,680
The correlation between temperature and ice cream sales is calculated as

77
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,740
‑9.5, which indicates a high negative relationship.

78
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,740
When the temperature increases, the jacket sales decreases.

79
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,860
You can also read about details on calculating correlation on

80
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,740
Building Your First Machine Learning Solution course.

81
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,340
Before we conclude our discussion about correlation,

82
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,240
I would like to discuss something very crucial.

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,510
It is what's so called the correlation fallacy.

84
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,410
Let's assume that we are in the summer in the hot and nice weather. Because

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,110
it's hot, many people decide that they will buy ice cream.

86
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,250
Also, because of the sun, many people will get sunburned.

87
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,170
However,

88
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,360
the fact that sunburn and increase of ice cream sales happen together does

89
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,180
not mean that any of them is the cause of the other.

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,990
Even though this looks clear and obvious,

91
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,140
you cannot imagine how many people try to draw causation from correlation.

92
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,100
For example,

93
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,620
if one says sleeping with one's shoes is strongly related to waking up

94
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,260
with headache, this does not mean that necessarily wearing shoes means

95
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,040
that you will wake up with a headache.

96
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:21,000
We can summarize this discussion by saying correlation does not imply causation. It is also called with that therefore because of this fallacy.
