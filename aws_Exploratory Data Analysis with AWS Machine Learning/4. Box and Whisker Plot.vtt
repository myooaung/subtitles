Let's start by discussing one comeback visualization that

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.940
summarizes the descriptive statistics,

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.250
which is the whisker and box plot. Box and whisker plot

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
summarizes multiple aspects of the data in a single compact

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.780
visualization, the median, the upper quartile,

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.280
which is the 75 percentile we discussed earlier, the lower quartile,

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.680
which is the 25 percentile we discussed earlier, the upper extreme value,

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.770
which is defined as the upper quartile plus 1.5 interquartile

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.070
range. The interquartile range is the interval between the

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.170
upper quartile and the lower quartile.

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.400
The extreme value,

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.250
which is defined as the lower quartile minus 1.5 interquartile

13
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.200
range. Whisker is the line extending between the upper extreme and

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.100
the upper quartile and the line extending between the lower

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.230
extreme and the lower quartile.

16
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.340
Finally, outliers are values outside the upper and lower extremes.

17
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:17.000
The whisker and box plot helps to summarize descriptive statistics. It is also useful to detect potential outliers in the dataset.
