00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,900
And now, congratulations on finishing Exploratory Data Analysis with AWS

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,190
course. Let's review together what we learned across this amazing journey. We

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:21,390
started by understanding how machine learning is done in AWS. We recapped the

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,770
machine learning pipeline and discussed relevant services in each phase. And

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,610
we clearly specified the position of our course within AWS Certified Learning

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,290
‑ Specialty exam.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,270
Then we introduced the housing pricing forecast dataset and

8
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,820
used our fictitious company, Globomantics.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,240
Then we learned how to set up our AWS environment.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,980
Then we proceeded with a module to understand data analysis in AWS. We have

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,000
seen how Globomantics machine learning organization looks like and clearly

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,640
identified where our roles as data analysts.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,550
Then we learned how to name things correctly in data analysis, an important

14
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,610
thing to communicate effectively with other data scientists.

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,240
Then we reviewed basic probability and statistics.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,940
After that,

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:23,130
we concluded with a demo where we did data analysis. On the

18
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,340
following module, we proceeded with data visualization.

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,450
We understood why we need data visualization, different types of data

20
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,060
visualizations and their usage, and then we did a demo using AWS

21
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:46,340
QuickSight and seaborn library in AWS SageMaker. And finally, in the

22
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,030
last module, where we discussed data preparation, we understood the

23
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,640
importance of data preparation.

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,010
It's mainly because our machine learning algorithms has certain

25
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,700
expectations on our dataset, and unfortunately,

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,860
our data usually is not what we are expecting due to

27
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,840
different reasons, such as entry errors,

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,140
differences among data sources, and just real‑life facts.

29
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,010
Then we went through a long list of common data challenges and

30
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,640
discussed possible solutions for them, for example,

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,760
how to handle imbalanced data using undersampling and oversampling

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,880
strategies, how to skill our data using standardization, min, max, and

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,750
normalization, and how to detect and remove outliers, and how to fix

34
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,040
malformed distributions, and many others.

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,120
And as usual,

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,870
we concluded with a demo where we illustrated some

37
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,240
of the challenges. And finally,

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,940
don't forget to rate the course from the options in the right and share

39
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,790
your questions and insights in the course discussion.

40
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you again for your time, and I hope that I meet you in future Pluralsight courses.
