1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,370
And now let's remove the outliers we have in our dataset.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,140
Before doing so,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,650
we had a discussion with a domain expert from Globomantics who

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,140
provided us with certain criteria to filter outliers.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,520
You may choose a different criteria based on your

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,940
domain expert's recommendation.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,950
Here I defined a Python function called Outlier_Mask. Then I calculate the

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,120
range between the 90 percentile and the 10th percentile.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,670
Then I define a filter to detect the outliers.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,080
The outliers have been defined as values smaller than 10th

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,350
percentile minus 1.5 the range or values larger than 90th

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,490
percentile plus 1.5 the range. Your definition may change based

13
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,010
on the domain expert's recommendation.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,310
Then I filter out the dataset.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's examine it. And now notice that we have less number of rows, 2189 after removal of outliers.
