00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.660
In our real world, data exists in many different formats.

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.240
It can be for ages, colors, temperature, audio, text, you name it.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.870
An important question that comes,

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.290
how we can classify and categorize these data groups?

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.200
Therefore,

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.010
a discussion about different data groups in the real world is quite important,

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.100
and it has a direct influence on which techniques we are going

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.540
to use to manipulate and transform our data.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.930
Let's now have a quick discussion about a basic,

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.180
yet important topic, and that is how the data looks like in the real world.

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.730
Generally speaking, we can categorize the data into four main categories,

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.140
numerical data, which represents numbers,

13
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.400
categorical data, which represents different classifications of data like colors,

14
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.920
which can be red or blue, unstructured data,

15
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.440
which does not follow a usual order, and time data.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.220
One category of the numerical data is the discrete data,

17
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.640
which represents a count of integer or a whole number.

18
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.930
An example would be the count of people in a certain area.

19
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.140
You can only have 1, 2, 3, and so on number of people.

20
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.730
It doesn't make sense to have two persons and a half, right?

21
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.960
The second category.

22
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.650
of numerical data is the continuous data,

23
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.530
and this is numerical data that can assume a full range of values.

24
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.180
An example of that would be temperature. Temperature can be 25 C,

25
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.480
25.7, or 40.1 C. So decimal and floating point values

26
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.000
are acceptable beside integer values.

27
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.220
One type of categorical data is the nominal data, and this is where the

28
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.020
specific type of the data doesn't indicate any mathematical

29
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.440
significance. An example of that would be a country.

30
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.200
We cannot say country X is larger than country Y. Notice that I

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.210
am talking about the country category itself,

32
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.040
not the country area size since it would be logical to say

33
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.000
that America area is bigger than Mexico area.

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.410
Another type of categorical data is ordinal later,

35
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.130
and this is where different values do have a mathematical significance.

36
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.640
For example, a film can be rated from 1 to 5. A rating or 4 is

37
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.200
higher than a rating of 2. Unstructured data are data types that

38
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.710
don't really follow our previous structures,

39
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.320
such as text, audio, image, and video.

40
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.640
It is possible to argue that all these unstructured data

41
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.420
types have to be converted into a numerical and

42
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.840
categorical formats to deal with them.

43
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.340
But this is a different discussion that we will touch on later.

44
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.000
Finally, time data or time series data represent the usual time and date we deal with.
