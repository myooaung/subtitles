00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.680
A picture is worth 1000 words,

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.100
is an English language saying that tells us how much information can be

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.330
carried in a picture rather than verbal explanation.

4
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.040
Let's take a practical explanation.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.420
Imagine that I am telling you about New York City in rush

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.470
hour, and I say there are many incoming cars and people

7
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.240
are coming from everywhere.

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.480
The street is full with high buildings,

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.260
and there are some trees here and there and one

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.680
traffic light controlling the traffic.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.210
Just imagine for a few seconds, do you think you can relate

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.350
with me or even imagine what's in my head?

13
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.530
It turns out that our cognitive ability to process

14
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.120
verbal information is limited.

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.900
On the other hand, imagine if I just show you this lovely picture.

16
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.070
Do you see how lively and rich is it?

17
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.650
Research confirms that our brains are able to process visual data better.

18
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.360
Just imagine doing the same with the data we analyze.

19
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.000
We can relate to pictures better than numbers, and this is why we have this module.
