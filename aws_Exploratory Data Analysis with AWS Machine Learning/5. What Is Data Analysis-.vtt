00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.610
The abundance of data is everywhere.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.440
Either it's from our ERP systems, HR systems, or CRM systems, or even IoT.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.260
We started to realize that we indeed have a treasure,

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.940
and we need to utilize that treasure and understand what's going on.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.840
Welcome to data analysis.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.350
If we take an academic definition from Wikipedia,

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.210
we will find that data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing,

8
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.030
transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information,

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.140
informing conclusion, and supporting decision making.

10
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.980
So, the data analysis process involves many steps on the data,

11
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.670
such as cleansing and transformation,

12
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.920
in order to find out what hidden information the data has and how this

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.940
information can help us in our decision‑making process.

14
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.400
Let's see. Let's take a simple example to understand how data

15
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.190
analysis can help us in our daily decision making.

16
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.430
Let's assume that you are the head of a huge hospital and your

17
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.740
supply chain faces a really annoying challenge,

18
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.340
which is that a large amount of the medication you

19
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.000
purchase gets expired before being used,

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.240
which results in a financial loss for the hospital and, even worse,

21
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.440
some patients not getting medication at the right time due to a lack of stock.

22
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.660
You really feel irritated because of this problem.

23
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.810
That should be easy to fix. It's just about getting

24
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.530
our supply at the right time.

25
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.840
Of course, there should be something we can do.

26
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.810
One day, in a coffee machine chat with a bright data scientist

27
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.650
that works at the IT department, he mentions something about

28
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.140
data analytics and data trends.

29
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.260
You became excited and shared the problem with him

30
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.040
and see if he can find a solution.

31
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.530
He says,

32
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.460
sure, can you just give me the access rights to the prescription systems

33
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.740
that our doctors use and a couple of days of work?

34
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.290
You say, surely. You will get it.

35
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.220
I would shoot an email right now from my mobile to the head

36
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.040
of IT to grant you the required access.

37
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.940
Now the bright data scientist works on the prescription system data

38
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.820
and does some data analysis work and, ta‑da, comes back with a

39
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.790
finding. The data scientist presents, hey,

40
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.180
I simply made an analysis on our patients' prescription history over the last

41
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.210
10 years, and you know what, I found an interesting pattern.

42
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.540
What is it? During the winter, we tend to request lots of saline,

43
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.840
while in the summer we use lots of syringes.

44
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.370
However, in the autumn, we need lots of pills, and in the spring,

45
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.070
many, many bandages,

46
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.340
usually since kids are playing everywhere around and

47
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.700
they get injured quite often. You, the head of the hospital,

48
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.660
say with a big smile, what an interesting finding. I will

49
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.260
share that with our supply chain unit and make sure that we

50
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.640
align our orders accordingly.

51
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.340
Thanks very much.

52
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.100
This simple story gives you a small hint on what useful

53
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.290
insights we can extract from our daily operational data if we

54
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.240
apply proper data analysis on it.

55
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.780
While the previous application makes use of data analysis alone on it's own in

56
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.740
the machine learning context, data analysis is needed for a different purpose,

57
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.880
to please our machine learning algorithm. That is,

58
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.810
machine learning algorithms have specific expectations of the data; therefore,

59
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.000
we need to study our data and align it, if needed, to please our machine learning algorithms.
