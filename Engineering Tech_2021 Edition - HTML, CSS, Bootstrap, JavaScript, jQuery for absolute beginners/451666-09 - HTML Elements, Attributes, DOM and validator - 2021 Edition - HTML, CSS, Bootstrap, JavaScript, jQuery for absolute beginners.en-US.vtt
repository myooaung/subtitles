00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.484
Let's understand some of the details of HTML.

00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:07.185
We'll create a new HTML file,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:09.645
abc dot HTML, a 100 new folder.

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:11.220
In Visual Studio Code,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.045
you can simply type HTML and then select this table five,

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:20.370
it'll generate the basic structure for you where the first slain his,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.980
they still worsen, which is by default five.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.920
And then it has the head tag and then you get

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.625
the body tag onto which you can have the content, whether main body.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.390
So let's add a few more elements.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.180
We have added fuel,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.620
DFS, her deep start for division.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.360
Typically that is the way you build an HTML page.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.180
You create multiple divisions and now the data,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.935
you put your content.

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:46.865
Here.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:51.020
Let's look at some of the elements that we've added.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.660
Each one stands for heading one,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.909
and p stands for paragraph.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.630
Similarly, you can have an element for image,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.855
for link, anchor, a chorus for link.

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:05.900
You can visit developers dot mozilla.org is

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.395
emoluments reference page to know the list of

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:13.385
all HTML elements available and then the description.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:17.090
You do not need to remember all these estimated tax.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.920
You get lot of online editors IDs using which you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.170
can generate the stephen files by simply typing your text and formatting it.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.940
But just for your reference,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.150
all the HTML elements are captured here,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.820
the developer dot mozilla.org webpage.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.985
So all this HTML head body,

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:42.110
these are all elements and each element is a tag.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.525
For example, this one element,

00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:48.425
the tag is each one then the for the P element the tag is B.

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:52.024
And an element can have one or more attributes.

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:57.500
For example, is an attribute href that tells you which Likud 1s2.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.375
Similarly image has an attribute called sorts, height and width.

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:06.540
Let's say Lord, this Bayesian does heat output,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.970
will open it in Chrome.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.890
Inspect the limits.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.660
So we can see all the ribs,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.985
all the building blocks of the page.

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:27.905
This is the heading.

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:33.450
This is the paragraph. It highlights the one that you selected di Inspector tab.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.115
This is the table we have.

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.635
Let's add a bargainer.

00:02:42.635 --> 00:02:49.170
Should that the table is clearly visible to the table element will add a border report.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.490
Now you can see that the border is visible.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.020
This is an ordered list.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.520
This is an unordered list.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.980
And this is how you write an unordered list.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.705
So these are some examples.

00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:12.140
The key thing to understand is how to create the structure of

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.860
the page by having different divisions within the page.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.245
And then under each division you can have elements had specify their attributes.

00:03:21.245 --> 00:03:25.265
And that is how you keep building an HTML page.

00:03:25.265 --> 00:03:30.960
Let's understand another concept called DOM or Document Object Model.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.180
But the way a browser represents a weak base

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.735
in memory is through Document Object Model or DOM.

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:40.640
Let's see how that works.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.120
Go to the Console tab and type document.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.645
And it returns you a reference to the page which is shown here.

00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:52.430
When you hover over document,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.750
you see the entire page.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.605
Everything you see under the elements tag is also available under the document reference.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:08.325
For the browser, the document object represents the entire page.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:13.270
Element is an object which represents certain section of the page.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.385
You can think of it as a hierarchical tree structure in memory for the browser.

00:04:18.385 --> 00:04:24.820
And the browser is able to read and interpret each element or each object,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.160
and then takes action on it.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.230
Now let's go to the element stack and silicon element.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.239
If you see here you see $1.

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:38.530
Now if you go to the console and type $1,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.560
you get the object map to that particular element.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.240
Let's select the table.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.080
Let's type $1. And we see that table element here.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.840
What you are getting here is a reference to that element.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.084
Let's select the paragraph. You again see $1.

00:04:57.084 --> 00:04:59.125
You type $1 and hit enter.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:00.460
You'll get that paragraph,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.770
will look at DOM and how we can use

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.640
it to manipulate different elements later in the course.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.850
One last thing I wanted to point out is the HTML standard is defined

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.454
by the W3.org or worldwide web consortium.

00:05:17.454 --> 00:05:21.925
And they were validator page using which you can validate with

00:05:21.925 --> 00:05:27.655
your HTML is following the correct standards and die it has the right syntax or not.

00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:31.300
Here you can specify your URL and validate the page,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.510
or you can upload your HTML file.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.105
Simply paste up contain ten c if it is correct or not.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:41.420
Let's validate the HTML we have written so far.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.440
Copy the entire contained and paste it here, and check.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.325
It gave a few edits.

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:54.020
Can the image element must have an attribute except under certain conditions.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.770
So in Altay, Tribute is required so that when you hover over the image,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.140
you see what is a description of that image.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.795
That's a best practice though the image loaded.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.670
But as a standard practice,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.470
we need to have an alternate report.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.440
We got another error that the border attribute is

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.484
obsolete because it should be defined using a CSS.

00:06:12.484 --> 00:06:14.120
Though it loaded fine.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.550
But the best practice is to define the border and certain styling

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.920
using the CSS are pays glory displayed these zeros,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.910
but there is a certain way that ties demolished with developed and

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.245
W3.org or worldwide web consortium they defined that stand out,

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:36.140
are succumb to this validator page and validate and

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.740
understand whether you are following the right standards or not.
