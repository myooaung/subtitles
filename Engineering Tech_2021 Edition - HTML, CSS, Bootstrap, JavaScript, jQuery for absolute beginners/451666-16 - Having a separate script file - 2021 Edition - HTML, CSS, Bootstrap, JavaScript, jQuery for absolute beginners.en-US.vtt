00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's now understand how we can move this JavaScript code into a separate file.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.390
We'll create a new file called spider.js.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.240
And let's now copy this JavaScript function to the site

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.135
ab.js will remove this script tags.

00:00:33.135 --> 00:00:35.325
Now back on the page.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.200
If we click on prior JavaScript,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.470
nothing happens because we need to include the JavaScript file in the main HTML page.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.690
We can include the JavaScript by simply doing script,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.874
specifying the source and the type is take slash JavaScript.

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:51.020
It's standard practice to have the included

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.105
the end so that if there is any error in the script,

00:00:53.105 --> 00:00:55.790
the page will not fail to load.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.370
So now when we click on our type JavaScript,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.490
that text changes to changed with JavaScript.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.320
So this is how you can have JavaScript code in

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.520
a separate file and include that in your main HTML file.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.370
Now this can be included in all these terminals

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.370
of the page and the functions will be available in all the pages.
