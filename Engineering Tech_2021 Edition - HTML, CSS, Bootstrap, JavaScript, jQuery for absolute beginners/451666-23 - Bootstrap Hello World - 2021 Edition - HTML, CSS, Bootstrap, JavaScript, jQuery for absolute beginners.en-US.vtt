00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
Let's understand how to build pages using the Bootstrap framework.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.755
We'll create a new folder, my website.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.670
Under that, we'll copy all the content that we've developed so far.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.320
So we're, we're abc dot HTML.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.730
We were contact duties, KML,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.300
we were Hadoop image and then we have site dot, CSS and spider.js.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.540
Let's open this folder in Visual Studio code.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.130
Will now clean up the code,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.940
remove the styling that we avoided.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.870
Go to abc dot HTML,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.830
and remove all the styles.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.840
And we'll remove all the classes that we have learned so far.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.910
Let's remove this border attribute also.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.130
Cleaned up the VC dot HTML,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.870
removed all the styling.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.175
Let's not remove styles.css from here.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:15.230
If required, we can add a custom styling later to the site dot CSS.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.795
Similarly, the contact dot HTML will ensure there is no styling.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:25.460
Let's open this page with live server and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.215
we're back to the original state in which we do not have any styling.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:36.360
Go to getbootstrap.com and download the latest version of Bootstrap.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.560
At the time of this recording,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.545
the latest version is port dot-dot-dot T2.

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:51.810
When you extract it, you see a CSS folder and a JavaScript folder.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.310
Within the CSS folder,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.320
you will find multiple files.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.945
Bootstrap.css is the main file and there is a mini version also,

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:04.790
which is a compressed version.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.600
And before do use some specific models of bootstrap.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.855
You can do that. There is Bootstrap Gilead and reboot for specific features of Bootstrap.

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:18.170
But in this course we'll work with the main file.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.430
So let's copy the Bootstrap CSS and take it to our website folder,

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.295
will go to my website and paste trip.

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:31.280
There. In fact, is a best practice.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.010
We should have a separate directory for CSS.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.650
So let's move bootstrapper does site psi dot CSS is currently black.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.780
Back into Visual Studio code.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.650
We can see bootstrap.css and psi dot CSS.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.650
Within bootstrap.css, you will see lot of styles already defined.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.880
So let's now art bootstrap.css to the main page.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.080
We can do that the way we added style.css,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.235
This will be CSS class bootstrap.css.

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:15.080
Similarly, psi dot CSS,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.220
we need to modify the path.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.280
Now, let's now see how the page looks.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.965
After we have included bootstrap.css.

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:27.110
We have not used any of the styling of bootstrap.css.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.870
But let's see if I just simply putting the bootstrap.css changes anything in the site.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.870
You can see that the fonts look a lot nicer.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.550
Now, we haven't done anything.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.670
But bootstrap has some default styling which it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.245
uses to override the style for different p tags.

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:50.610
There are different other elements like beef to the font is automatically changed.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.680
Now let's see how to apply more styling using Bootstrap will go to the boughten,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.610
changed me and apply some styling using Bootstrap.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.780
If the bootstrap.css, if you search for btn,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.950
our button, you can see dot btn class,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.040
BTN, which is nothing but btn class.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.635
And if you search further,

00:04:17.635 --> 00:04:21.610
you can see many other styling defined for the button,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.315
the button class on homework, on focus.

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:27.740
You'll see a lot of things.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.790
Are that button class here.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.095
We'll say classical PTEN.

00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:36.985
Now you don't see any color.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:40.105
The button is there, is there with the white background.

00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:41.470
There is a steady level,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.675
level BP and dash info.

00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:47.295
Can it is with a different background.

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:50.225
Let's add that class also.

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:54.630
You can have multiple classes separated by space.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.990
Now we can see a nice
