00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Let's see what else we can do with the equity.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.490
Typically the LA ports, tryout or JavaScript and jQuery in the console.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.860
And once they are fine with it,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.730
moved to the main source file.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.720
Let's try out some of the jQuery features directly in the console.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.860
We'll copy this.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.080
And we have done Inspect Element and open the console tab.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.830
And here we can directly type and see the output.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.230
The advantage here is you can highlight and

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.310
see how which element you are interacting with.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.850
Similarly, you can change the color now and see the output directly here.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.490
Instead of create, let's change it to green.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.635
And you can make changes and directly see the effect on the browser.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:00.950
With jQuery, you can get element by ID or class

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.270
or by illumined name and perform different operations.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.480
When it could do multiple operations on the same element.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.450
Instead of fetching the element twice,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.220
you can face the eluent once and then do multiple operations.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.850
For example, you will to change the HTML and also change the color,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.100
get their limit once and do both the operations that we're the performance would

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.025
be a lot faster because you are not trying to find the element again and again.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:39.860
You can also store it in a variable if you have to use it later new program.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.470
So grab the element P2,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.645
stored it in a variable p2,

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:50.580
and then modify by invoking various function directly on the variable.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.275
We faced element by Id.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.905
Similarly, we can fit directly, giving the element name.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:03.710
Here we face the H1 tag and you can just hover

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.815
over each one and see which one we are looking at.

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:08.795
We had just one H1 tag.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.700
So it faced that if there are multiple,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.160
It would have fetched all the items.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.130
Let's try to fetch p tags.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.285
We know we have multiple P tags in the page P1, P2, P3.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:24.875
And you can store it in a variable and Luke treat and far from different operation.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:32.060
Or you can directly make changes to all the elements the way you do for a single element.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.260
For example, we can change all p elements to green.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.580
With this command. You can see that all the p tags are now changed to green.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.530
To know how many elements are there.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.110
You can have p dot length and get the element length.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.610
You can take advantage of the Visual Studio Code assist feature.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.790
Just type in element and type dot and see all the functions that are available.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.790
Let's try it out again because we've made

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.835
some changes on the Visual Studio Code of the Pays got refreshed.

00:03:10.835 --> 00:03:13.085
Now all the paragraphs are red.

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:17.630
You could try it on H1 where we know only one element is there.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.895
One element will get modified.

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:24.980
So you can modify multiple elements or a single element with the same code.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.820
You can get all the bibs in your page.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.020
We have container, we have rho,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.560
we have some deeps with Bootstrap classes.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.660
We can see all the divs and we can get the length of that array also,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.980
how many ships are there?

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.610
Let's grab the container class,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.070
which is the main page and change the styling.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:59.040
We can see that we managed to change the border up doc container with the jQuery.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.570
So this is how easy it is to work with jQuery.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.120
You don't need to grab element by class or by

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.330
ID and then try to do something with jQuery.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.870
It's really easy to find a particular section of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.815
the page and change the styling or change the behavior.

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:17.525
You can also add.

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:23.210
Classes, will get all the p elements and art class,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.775
which is a margin class provided by bootstrap.

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:29.180
And you can see margin for has been applied.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.780
Now you can remove the margin also by saying remote Class info.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.850
Let's get the div,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.860
which has the call is m for class,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.240
we know that is the first row,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.225
first column, and the players solid green border on it.

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:47.465
We can see that the green water has been applied on it.

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:50.630
So you can pretty much should grab anything from the page,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.640
be BB, type, particular class or element by Id and do operations on them.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.250
With dot parents, you can get parents of whatever you have fetched.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.094
So this is the main selector.

00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:14.780
And then you are grabbing the patents for collars,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.640
him for the parents are the row and the container in the main,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.870
in the body and the HTML.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.655
Similarly, the children out.

00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:29.825
Anything that we see within this row one, column one,

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:35.390
all the p tags to hitting the button Control L to clear the console,

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.230
we can get all the rows of our table by doing peabody dot children.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.150
And if you have to change the color of all the rows,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.050
just simply do peabody dot children dot CSS, color green.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.440
This would change color of the text in the entire body section of the table.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.035
We can hide an element by invoking function.

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:02.840
We can see that P3 got hidden.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.810
Now we can show it by doing a dot show.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.380
We can also do toggle if it is shown it to be hidden.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.315
If it is hidden, it will be shown.

00:06:11.315 --> 00:06:14.190
Let's grab the bottom element.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.330
We can also grab it with the class,

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.440
but since we have one button,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.125
we're able to grab it with the bottom element name.

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.810
There are multiple buttons would have faced

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.095
this particular button with a particular class or ID name,

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.690
not this button we have fetched.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.770
It's really easy to work with events with jQuery.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.460
You can grab a button and then the onclick up that

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.210
you can call a function and only must function,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.985
which will let say height H1 element.

00:06:43.985 --> 00:06:46.025
Or you could do any operation,

00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:47.495
whatever you pled till now,

00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:48.905
you can put the intercourse.

00:06:48.905 --> 00:06:52.170
We did the button click function and try it out.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.250
Let's execute it.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.724
Now click on try JavaScript.

00:06:57.724 --> 00:07:02.180
They join element is getting hadn't and it toggles.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.020
So every time you click it either shows, it gets hidden.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.365
Go to Visual Studio code and see what are the other functions available on the button.

00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:18.020
Or you can also look at the jQuery documentation

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.155
to learn more about different event types.

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:24.680
These are various things you can jQuery,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.330
it's really easy to apply styling and do operation on various events.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.935
And you can easily reach out to an E6 and up the page and do some operations.

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:39.920
Whatever we tried in the console is also available in the abc dot HTML page.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.905
Two key concepts in jQuery,

00:07:42.905 --> 00:07:46.535
document.ready to start jQuery operations.

00:07:46.535 --> 00:07:49.490
And you use Select the expression,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.910
grab eliminates classes or IDs,

00:07:52.910 --> 00:08:02.090
and then invoke different functions to manipulate those elements or classes or IDs.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.510
So this is how you can apply styling with jQuery.
