00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.605
Let's look at what else we can do with Bootstrap.

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:08.265
Bootstrap has many classes for tables.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:11.500
Let's try out one of them.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.880
Let's try out the table class.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.180
We'll go to our page and apply the tablecloth on the table element.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.050
Once we do that,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.510
you can see that the table styling is Chase and it is occupying the entire space.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.620
And we can see different heroes getting highlighted.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.290
And the moment we are just the screen size,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.110
the table width gets automatically adjusted.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.675
So Bootstrap has applied styling and also made the table responsive.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:54.275
There is also a class available called table dark.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.270
Let's apply it and see the effect.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.240
We can see that now the table looks nice shirt with a darker background.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.400
All the classes in bootstrap or by default, responsive.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.815
We can also apply this styling to the table header or table body.

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:16.160
We have not hardheaded table header. So let's do that.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.705
Instead of P body,

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:22.820
this should be the head and the rest of the table should be under the body.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.120
When it could change these two th, table heading.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.520
Let's say about a header P-hat.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.295
And we did that PR and pH for each column of the header.

00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:41.420
And then we have the table body with two rows will go and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.100
apply class equal p head light to the table header.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.755
You can see that table header is now in a light color.

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:57.800
Again, it's a responsive table.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.440
Similarly, you can apply styling on the other elements of the table and go to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.620
the Bootstrap CSS and explore different styling options available for tables.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.260
And you can also look at the documentation on their website to learn more about styling,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.870
not just stable, but different other elements.
