00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.540
Let's now move the styles are to a separate stylesheet.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.350
Before that, let's check out the page in the current state.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.080
Will create a new folder for this module.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.370
Will create a new folder,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.400
separate stylesheet and more styles copy the same file.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.220
Let's select this folder now and will launch. The same file.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.330
With slaves server. Site is launched,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.160
let's insert is pointing to the correct.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.430
Yet the title changes. It's pointing to the correct.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.960
Will open the code editor in

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.820
the Chrome browser next to each other so that we can see all the tildes.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.415
Let's try to move dash to the CSS file and remove it from here.

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:02.930
And as soon as you remove the judges get reflected their homepage,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.490
the styles are gone now.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.550
Now we'll put those tails at the site dot CSS.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.690
He says do not reflecting because we need to give a reference to the site dot CSS.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.790
And we do that using the link element.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.800
Just take blink and it tap.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.580
Visual Studio code will automatically populate the link attributes you need to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.300
give a reference to the psi dot CSS using the HREF attribute,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.180
simply take psi dot CSS here,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.645
and it would pick up styles from thes i dot CSS and the same is getting reflected here.

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:41.840
Now let's look at the psi dot CSS.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.850
So we have a body background color yellow,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.430
and we have a background color for the H1 tag.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.680
Let's do one piglets artist title for the H1 tag.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.220
And we'll say background color.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.965
So what would happen immediately that is getting reflected.

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:02.710
So this has higher precedence over the site dirty CSS.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.910
And if we go to,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.410
let's say the Jordan tag and put a style here,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.900
we'll say background color, grey.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.045
Now graze getting deflected.

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:19.600
So you can overwrite the styles that are present inside that CSS by

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.980
heavy pays specific styles are having style statically in the element.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.235
Now that you have understood how to create a separate stylesheet,

00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:32.784
let's look at some of the other features of CSS.

00:02:32.784 --> 00:02:35.995
Earlier we looked at the class attribute,

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:40.190
will have a gentry class for our tax,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.595
will add another paragraph and say this is paragraph up to.

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:47.720
Now we have not defined any property for the paragraph class.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.475
We have removed that. Let start it back.

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:51.425
We can say dot paragraph.

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:53.660
And again background-color.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.090
We'll say grid.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.670
The background color of both the P tags have

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.910
changed to green because both have the class attribute.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.975
We can also have an idea attribute to target specific element

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:09.605
or multiple elements can belong to the same class,

00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:13.530
but I d will be unique to a particular element.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.430
We will call it P1.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.960
And let say there is another ID, we'll call it.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.365
Now how do we target a particular P tag?

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:34.280
And let's say we want to change the color of this particular paragraph.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.450
Or we can do that by applying styling on

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.495
the IDP to when we do that using the hash symbol hash B2,

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.925
that would pick up DID P2.

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:48.875
And we'll say background color,

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:52.325
gray targets replicating the grey color.

00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:55.385
In the second paragraph.

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:59.150
Typically the practice you put it dash with

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.110
diet and bagging the number to easily identify.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.140
Let's say this is p1 and p2.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.680
And then we'll send this also,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.060
you can see the gray background for the second P tag.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.780
So as you have symptom now you can apply styling,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.060
class liberal lead, ID,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.130
label and target specific elements.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.555
And you can also target and list of elements in the single cord blood.

00:04:26.555 --> 00:04:33.395
For example, you can see all H1 and H2 should be of background-color read.

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:36.500
Let's see if there is any S2 and the page will

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.880
change one of the text which will make it H2.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.020
Now this also isn't it.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.515
You can also have a list with elements.

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:53.600
Class will remove this one,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.860
H2, and paragraphs should have white background.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.240
Now, another thing we wanted to show you is how you can target the child elements.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.190
So we didn't domain element.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.475
Let's have a class are defined for our div.

00:05:13.475 --> 00:05:16.340
We'll call it, let's say div class.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.460
For now, we'll just remove this tense that are available at the element level.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.740
Let's start a new P tag without any class.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.410
Let's add another one at the top.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.040
We can define the background color for the entire class.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.835
Will say green. Now the entire div is green.

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:56.660
And wherever we have overwritten giving element level styling,

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.535
that is getting reflected.

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:03.770
Now here we cannot target a specific element.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.450
If a 100 target P tags of this div tag, we can say.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.600
Now we are seeing all the p tags of the div class should have blue background.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.390
This is how you can change the style of a child element.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.770
And since this is a computing after

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.965
the B class background or the specific element background that is taking precedence.

00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:31.190
In this lecture, we have understood how to get a separate style sheet

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.760
and how to apply different styles at class level,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.955
target levels, and also how to apply style for a particular child element.

00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:44.090
And we have also understood the precedence of

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.440
styling and how the cascading style sheet works behind the scenes.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.400
Thank you.
