00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
There are various editors available online to write is HTML code.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.575
Let's look at one of them.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:12.970
Codepen.io, go to their website and start coding.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.890
Let's copy a stimulus code that you've written so far.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.135
We'll paste it here.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.660
And we can see the output at the bottom.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.520
Let's add another div.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.430
This is the second div.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:51.125
Note that both the dips are great because they're both using this CSS or stale Gray.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.945
On the first one when you hold, it becomes red.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:56.360
And the second one, there is no JavaScript function,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.865
so the color doesn't change.

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:03.575
The JavaScript that we had written is specific to the first div.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:09.930
So this is how you can code online using CodePen.io.
