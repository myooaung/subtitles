00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
We'll now check how to modify styles with JavaScript.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.770
We have opened the same contact dot HTML page

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.100
where we have one element getting displayed.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.460
And earlier we saw how to use JavaScript to modify the content of that element.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.850
Let us now understand how we can apply different styling,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.200
different color, different font using JavaScript.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.890
Let's comment out the code that we had written earlier.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.300
Let's understand how to change styling of this element. Contact us.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.900
We can get the element by doing document.getElementById and then pass di di name,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.735
which is contact us and stored it in a variable.

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:46.775
You can give it any name.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:51.245
Then you can simply say contact ID, style.

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:54.710
And you can see different properties like color font.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.890
Let's try out Khaled first rate.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.065
So immediately the color change to rate.

00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:04.100
You can also function and invoke this on click a button.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.595
And let's try out something else.

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.970
You can go to developer dot mozilla.org and see

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.205
all the foreign font families and other styling aspects and try out different things.

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:20.780
Let's try to change the font for our Contact Us element.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.780
Let's try out one of these.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.495
You can see that the font exchange to Italy, Finnish sense.

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:34.054
This though we can chain styling your page using Javascript.

00:01:34.054 --> 00:01:37.490
You can get elements by ID or by class name,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.265
and then look at different properties and apply styling based on your requirement.

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:47.600
And you can have this entire corps within a function.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.240
And invoke that on click of a button.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.065
We learned Wharton and we'll say on click.

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:59.465
And we would write a function,

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:04.745
change me and put discord within a function.

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:06.410
Click on Click Me.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.320
You can see that the font and color is getting changed.
