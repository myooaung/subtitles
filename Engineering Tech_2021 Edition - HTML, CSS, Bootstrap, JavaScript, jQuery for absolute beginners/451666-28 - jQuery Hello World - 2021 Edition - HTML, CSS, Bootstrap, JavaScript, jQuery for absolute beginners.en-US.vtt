00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.755
Jquery is one of the most popular JavaScript liabilities.

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:07.785
And it is used to manipulate HTML and CSS,

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.605
but in a much more efficient way.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.800
Jquery initially gained popularity because of

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.400
its ability to handle cross-browser issues efficiently.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000
With jQuery, you can write code without worrying about whether

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.065
it's going to run a naive Chrome Safari or any other browser.

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.545
And with jQuery, you can build very powerful,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:32.850
feature rich UI applications with very less code.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.355
There's a very strong community out there.

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:38.415
You will find many free plugins using which you can

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:42.430
build very complex UI application in a very short time.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.160
Jay equities is single JavaScript file.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.675
Let's pick a look.

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:50.105
Go to download jQuery.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:55.925
And you can either download the compressed version which is required for production code,

00:00:55.925 --> 00:01:00.800
or you can download the uncompressed worsen and take a look at the source code.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.365
Let's download the uncompress worsen.

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.000
So when you click on it,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.010
you see the content.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.535
So this is the JavaScript file and this is all about jQuery,

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.380
one single JavaScript file,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.885
but with very powerful features.

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:20.180
You can simply right-click it and save it in your project folder.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.910
Jquery 3.5.1. This is the latest worsen time of this recording.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.980
Now let's go to Visual Studio code and take a look at the jQuery source, fine.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.890
Jquery 3.5.1 ab.js kept at the root of the project folder.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.825
So it has variables,

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:43.699
it is functions and using which we can do lot of things much more efficiently,

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:45.485
which we'll see shortly.

00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:50.720
To use jQuery, we need to include it in our HTML file.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.560
And you can include it like any other JavaScript file.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.510
Once it is integrated, you can start writing g equity code.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.285
Let's write a helloworld program,

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.220
will declare a script tag.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.014
And within that, we'll say dollar document,

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.250
dark, ready and a function.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.260
We'll call an anonymous function.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.465
Then within curly braces will do something and closed-off ready function.

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:26.330
So what does this really mean?

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.380
Dollar is an alias for jQuery and document does what the DOM or Document Object Model.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.275
So when the document is ready,

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:38.960
that means when the DOM is loaded,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.855
not necessarily all the content loaded.

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:46.985
When the DOM is loaded means the structure of the page is loaded.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:49.940
The images and content might take time to load,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.505
but the basic structure of the page is loaded.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:59.310
Then using jQuery, you can start manipulating different elements.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.440
Let's try to print something to the console.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.580
The 3D port equity.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.750
Let's load the page and see what happens.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.470
We'll open the Patriot late server and inspect and go to console.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.090
And we can see that ready for jQuery is getting printing.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.510
This is the starting point of jQuery.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.440
When the document is ready, you do something.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.010
Let's try to change the content of one of the elements using jQuery.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.080
We have a paragraph with IDP.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.780
Do we know how to get the element by ID and manipulate with jQuery.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.045
You can also achieve the same thing.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:56.180
Dollar starts, but again, G equity,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.010
IDP to HTML should be changed with jQuery.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.375
Now when we go to the page,

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:12.600
we can see that that takes test when modified.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.050
We can also change the color.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.255
Let's change it to red.

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:23.495
And the color is getting changed to red.

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.430
And if we change it to green,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.080
it will get genes to clean.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.650
One thing to note, if there is any syntax letter g,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.210
equity would not complain.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.265
Jquery would simply ignored it.

00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:42.965
And let your page load.

00:04:42.965 --> 00:04:47.190
We just did late, late and didn't do anything.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.785
Or let's say we've missed a court with the equity whenever there are syntax errors,

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:57.050
the page will continue to load.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.220
You must be wondering why we need jQuery when we can

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.975
achieve many of these things with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:08.075
First reason is jQuery.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.610
Functions should work on any browser.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.310
Most of the modern browser supports extracting elements from DOM and manipulating them.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.025
But people are working on some of the older browsers,

00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:21.815
then those things might not work.

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:23.810
But if we are written with jQuery,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.530
you can be assured that most of it is going to work.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.300
Secondly, with jQuery, you can build very powerful UI components.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.870
Beta slider, beta, carousel.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.380
To critic, gives you a lot of power to manipulate

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.845
HTML CSS elements and build very interactive UI components.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:49.895
And also you will find lot of plug-ins available online.

00:05:49.895 --> 00:05:52.700
You can easily take a plug-in and included in your code.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.025
Those plug-ins are mostly free plug-in,

00:05:55.025 --> 00:06:00.690
and you can easily build very complex UI using jQuery.
