00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.155
Let's now look at an example of JavaScript.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.120
Using JavaScript, we could make a paste

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.885
interactive and we can manipulate different elements.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:13.440
Let's add a JavaScript function on mouseover.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.455
So whenever we over the mouse on the div element,

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:20.580
the background color would change to some other color, let's say red.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.990
Instead of writing the code,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.850
we can also simply type grid and the browser will recognize that it's for red color.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.850
So let's see that now will decrease the page by default,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.330
gray color appears, but when we take the mouse over the div,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.770
the background becomes red.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.670
Now we'll say on mouse out, it should be white.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.810
Refresh the page initially it's gray.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.040
When you hover the mouse,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.300
its rate and when you take the mouse out becomes quite. So.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.105
We've made the space interactive using JavaScript.

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:03.469
We're manipulating the div elements using JavaScript functions.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.090
So modern JavaScript later.
