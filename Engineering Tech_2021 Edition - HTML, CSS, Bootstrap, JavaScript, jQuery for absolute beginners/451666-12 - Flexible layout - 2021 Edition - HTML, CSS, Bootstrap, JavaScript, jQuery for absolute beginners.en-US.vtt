00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Let us understand how to build a layout for our page.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:07.680
Currently they enter, content is getting displayed in a single column.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.190
Typically we're British would have it two or three column layout.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.895
So let's understand how we can build that using different HTML and CSS properties.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:23.400
One of the easiest ways to be Layout is by using the flexible layout option.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.635
Let's understand how that would work.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:29.950
Will put all our dibs under a parent div.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.740
And let's declare a class for the main div.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.010
Now let's give some properties to the men div class.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.255
Will see for the main div class,

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.370
the display type is flex.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:18.390
Flexible column will say plexus.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.520
Now let's open the space with slaves that were looking.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.305
So when we refresh the page,

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:31.190
we can see that the entire base has been

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.510
divided into multiple columns depending on the number of deaths. We have.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.525
To make it simple. Let's get rid of some of the dibs and just keep three divs.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.225
Now we have a three column layout.

00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.850
Note that it did not take up the entire space.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.190
It looked at how much makerspace is required

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.905
for each of the two that the Texture2D naught get wrapped.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:55.325
And based on that, it decides on the layout.

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.020
If we had a longer text,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.210
it would have taken up more space and then it would have

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.785
equally distributed the space among three columns.

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:09.395
Now if want to increase the width of the first block or the first column,

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.220
we can do that by giving more space.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.365
But this particular div.

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:17.675
You can do that by men selling

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:21.260
a metal tape and then specifying which div you want to target.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.405
One is for the first div.

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:28.830
And then you capture how much space you want to give.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.435
If we give flicks to them,

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.465
to the first div, which would give more space.

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:42.500
It will calculate the total width of the page and give more space to the first column.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.245
If we target per second instead of first,

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:48.990
we can see that the image is occupying more space.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.590
If we increase it further,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.190
it nothing happens because the page would also look at how much space

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.425
is required for the other elements without wrapping the text.

00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:02.930
This is how you can build a two column,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.160
three column layout for your pitch and capture content under each of the column.
