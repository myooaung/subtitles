00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.950
Let's understand why we need to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.705
Html CSS and JavaScript are called building blocks of a webpage.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:16.635
So what exactly is a web based and what exactly is with any webpage that we see contents,

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:19.154
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:24.780
So this is Google.com webpage which we access through a URL, google.com.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.620
Every webpage has a unique address in the internet.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.980
It has STDP, www.google.com.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.830
So what exactly is www and HTTP?

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.465
Www is worldwide wave where documents can be found with URLs.

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:42.545
Google.com is the URN.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:44.855
These documents are HTML pages,

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:48.080
which can be text, images or videos.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.484
So how are these documents subdue the integers?

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.440
It is done through East UDP protocol.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.130
Every URL you see starts with HTTP or HTTPS,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.070
which starts for HTTP secured history,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.785
DPS, Hypertext Transport Protocol.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:06.125
In the worldwide web or internet.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:07.985
Every document has a URN.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:11.540
Customers, somebody requested document specifying the URL,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.570
HTTP or Hypertext Transport Protocol be quizzed

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.840
is sent to the server which host that page.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.205
So this is typically decides on a subtler which is called webserver.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:26.675
And the page is accessed through a unique Resource Locator or URL,

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:32.030
and the document is subject to the individual who might be accessing it from a desktop,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.410
browser art from a mobile phone over the transport protocol.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.990
And in this course, our focus is more around building this document using HTML page.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.994
So why do we need to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript?

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:48.830
We display the content using a stamen.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.234
We styled it using cascading style sheets or CSS,

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:54.980
and we make it interactive using JavaScript.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.100
So the best way to understand is HTML, CSS,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.339
and JavaScript is by looking at some examples.
