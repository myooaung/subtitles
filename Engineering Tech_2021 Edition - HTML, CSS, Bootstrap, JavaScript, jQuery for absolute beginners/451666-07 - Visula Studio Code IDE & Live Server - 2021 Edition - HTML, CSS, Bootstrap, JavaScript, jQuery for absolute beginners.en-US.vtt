00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
You will be doing most of our development using Visual Studio code.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.870
So let's download and install the software.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.495
This is a very popular IDE or integrated development environment to write HTML,

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.640
CSS, and JavaScript code.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.920
You can simply download it and start using it.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.125
Note that it is Visual Studio Code,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:23.700
not the Visual Studio IDE,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.100
Visual Studio code that you need to download.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.830
And once you've downloaded and installed,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.440
then you can open it and start writing your code.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.955
So within Visual Studio code,

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:38.140
you'll have to open the folder.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.930
Will open the folder which convinced though, latest index.html file.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.085
You'd open the folder and we can see the index.html within that.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.790
And here we can start making changes.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.785
Let's add another div.

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:01.805
It'll prompt you for what you're trying to art.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:05.585
And you can also read more about the element.

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:11.210
You'd automatically completed our dv to automatically added the closing tab.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.370
This is the second bin.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.260
You can save it or you can configure it to opposite.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.635
You can make changes and see the output.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:29.960
There are various extensions available.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.645
Let one of them that will make working with HTML daily easy.

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.790
It's called Life server,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.965
larger development local server with live reload feature for static and dynamic pages.

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:45.169
So we lard this extension,

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:48.605
just click on this extends our search for life server.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:51.770
You'd get in started within a few seconds.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.480
Once it is installed,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.585
let's go back to the explorer view.

00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:00.150
Will open index.html.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.635
Make some changes.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:07.490
Now will say right click open with live server.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.280
The strength to start a server at port 55,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.389
0-0 will allow axis.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.425
Using the leaps that, or we can have the same experience as a web server.

00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:22.880
Now our site is loaded it 127001,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.070
which is the local laws, IP,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.010
then port 55 00 And index.html.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.630
So instead of opening it,

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.525
specifying the complete file path,

00:02:32.525 --> 00:02:39.035
we now have a local web server running which displays the content of this webpage.

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:42.170
As soon as we type something that changes will automatically get that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.550
afflicted in the lifestyle index.html page.
