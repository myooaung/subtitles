00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.720
Let's create a Hello World HTML page.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.000
We'll dive into this tags later.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.470
First, let's create a sample page and see the output.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.605
I'm using. Notepad Plus Plus.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.800
Feel free to use any other text editor that you might have.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.545
Later on will try to look at another tool, Visual Studio Core.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:31.140
And you'll see how easy it is to do HTML programming using that tool.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.030
Will say this is title.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.935
Then Hello World.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:41.945
This is his body.

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:48.970
We'll close the tag and let's save it in a directory.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.570
Will create a working directory for all our files.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.770
Hello HTML. And we didn't dark will have

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.450
a index dot HTML file, which will have discontent.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.850
Now let's open that page.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.580
By default it opens on IE browser,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.000
but you can not idyllic and open in some other projects also,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.340
you see the page title and whatever we put

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.040
within the body tag that you see in the main body.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.870
Let's fix the typo in the page title.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.370
Saved the file, press F5 to replace the page or just reload the URL.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.880
You can right-click and open the index.html file in Chrome or any other browser.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.210
So this is how we can build a standard pitch and display content.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.895
And as you can see,

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:47.900
the tags that are not visible,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.565
only the content is visible.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:54.450
You can go to the page source and view the source.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.060
Or you can just right-click, say inspect.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.920
And you can inspect all the elements.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.665
We'll talk about what is the element and all that.

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:12.605
But these are the ways you can see what is behind this HTML page.

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:14.640
Thank you.
