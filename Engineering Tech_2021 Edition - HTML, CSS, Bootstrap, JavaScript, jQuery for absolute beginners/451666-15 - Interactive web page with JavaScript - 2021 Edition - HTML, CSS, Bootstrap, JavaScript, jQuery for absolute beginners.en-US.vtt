00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.055
Let's now see how to build interactive webpage using JavaScript.

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:08.140
Let's open the console.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.014
The very first object that you need to understand in JavaScript

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:18.960
is document object that gives you a reference to the entire page.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.615
It was simply typed document and hit Enter.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:26.070
You can see that the entire page content is available under that object.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.880
Using this object, we can extract different elements and manipulate them.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.935
Let's look at some example.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:35.745
We'll say document, get element by ID.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:40.750
Let's open the Visual Studio code on the leptin shade.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.550
So we have a paragraph with ADP to we tried to print it out.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.255
So this returns the paragraph P2.

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.330
If we change this to some other ID,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.895
will get that particular id.

00:00:55.895 --> 00:00:58.700
This is paragraph P1, similar to ID,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.525
we can also get classes using document dot,

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:05.120
get element by class.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.550
We do not need to give dot here.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.720
It returns all the elements having classes paragraph.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.890
So wherever classes, paragraph that is getting fetched.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.710
We'll add a simple button to the pitch.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.495
And onClick up that button.

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:25.265
We'll invoke a method.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:30.725
Change me. Let's name it.

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:33.030
Tried JavaScript.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.360
And we can write the code anywhere.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.370
So let's write it right here.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.450
Is a best practice to have

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.320
all the JavaScript code in a separate file, which we'll see later.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:58.430
For now, let's try to change the content of paragraph p2 or p3 using this button.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.860
Now you've written the function changed me.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.650
And when the user clicks on this change,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.630
we brought on this function would get invoked.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.960
I'm invocation of this function will get element by ID.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.745
And that should be, let say, P2.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:25.040
And we will change the inner HTML of that change.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.720
With JavaScript.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.370
We'll also print di limit to console.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.465
Click on JavaScript button.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:50.690
We can see the limit contending console.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.330
And we can also see the paragraph text has been changed

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.480
to change with JavaScript in the HTML page.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.960
This is how we can get an HTML element and then try to modify different properties.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.535
Here we modified innerHTML.

00:03:04.535 --> 00:03:08.130
You can also change the ID and other properties.
