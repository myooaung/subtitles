00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.900
Let's now see an example of CSS or cascading style sheet will add a div tag.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.740
Again, all this tax will be explained in detail later on.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.180
We just want to get a feel of how HTML and CSS and JavaScript looks.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.350
And then we'll dive into the details of each of these topics.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.340
There are many ways you can add style or

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
cascading style sheet to your pitch or your HTML page.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.255
Let's look at one such technique will have a style element within the head.

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:42.340
And now we can define how this div element,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.615
it is going to be styled.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:47.360
Let's save this and refresh the pitch rate.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.970
Nowadays, no style will start playing style to this div element,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.550
which contains this text.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.590
So the text is within a div element and we'll apply a style to this div element.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.185
Notepad automatically prompt us for background color.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:19.550
And we'll also have the same experience using Visual Studio Code

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.570
where as soon as you start typing it will prompt you for the text that you're trying to.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.210
So how would we find the core for different background colors?

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.950
There are many places where you can find the number for different colors.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.160
Let's pick something from the Wikipedia page.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.135
We'll pick the color code for gray and capture it in the background colour section.

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:50.990
Now save the changes and dataframes the page and you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.710
can see the background of their development is now ugly.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.820
So this is how you can apply style to HTML elements.
