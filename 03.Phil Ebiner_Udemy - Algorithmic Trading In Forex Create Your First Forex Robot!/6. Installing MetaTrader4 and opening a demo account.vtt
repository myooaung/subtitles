00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.860
Welcome back to this lecture.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.770
Super excited to have you in today's tutorial.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.660
Today we're going to learn how to download meditator for and open an account of my fair broker actually

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.400
trader.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.910
I wanted to quickly preface this by saying that you don't have to go fax a trader.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.110
This is my fair broker.

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.200
If you have your own favorite grow broker you can definitely follow along with their steps of opening

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.320
a demo account and open a demo account with them or you can go and look at other reviews out there online

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.650
and pick a broker up John.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.880
But if you are interested to see who is my fair broker and why then this is the tutorial where will

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.740
make it all happen and by the end of it you will have a working demo college ready.

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.660
So if I followed you Let's dive straight into it.

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.500
So the first thing we need to do is open a browser window right over here and type in the following

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.920
year l w w w dot for us both dot com slash AKC.

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900
Trader demo.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.540
That's three words altogether.

17
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.450
AKC trader demo

18
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.790
and I'll take a couple of seconds to load and eventually get this beautiful page here displayed and

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.130
the first thing I want to point out is that you'll see here that the URL has slightly changed but you

20
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.650
don't need to worry about that because what has happened is actually trader has added here our code

21
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.350
and basically this code will let them know that you're a forex boat student and they can give you better

22
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.070
support.

23
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.410
Priority servers and basically take care of you.

24
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.540
So we have a relationship with active trader where they take good care of our students and you want

25
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.590
to take advantage of that.

26
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.060
So before downloading the metaphor for platform there are two things I'd like to show you.

27
00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.960
So if we scroll down here on the page to the very bottom you will see the product disclosure statement

28
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:12.040
or PBS and financial services guide or FSG and actually trader being a regulated broker has to provide

29
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.220
you these two documents as a cloud.

30
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.210
So this is very important and you have these two links and you can check the PBS and FSG at any time

31
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.530
when you want to.

32
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.630
You always have these links to have and check them just scroll down to the bottom of the page.

33
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.260
Now let's scroll back to the top of the page and here I will inputs my information.

34
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.850
So first name surname e mail

35
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.130
and something that I want to mention here is that it's quite important to provide accurate information

36
00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.700
to axe trader because that way they will be able to contact you and serve you better if you have a question

37
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.530
or you have a technical issue of your cards.

38
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.190
They'll be able to help you resolve these problems faster.

39
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.690
They're an amazing broker.

40
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:22.430
And so I'll proceed to filling in my phone number here and once I verified this information I'm going

41
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.140
to click submit

42
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.380
and it will take a couple of minutes to load.

43
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.360
And don't worry about it.

44
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:39.350
It will all happen after a couple of seconds you'll get to agree to this page which is a thank you page

45
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.040
and it has all the steps that you will need to follow from here.

46
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.840
Step number one is you'll need to check your email and get your demo log in from there.

47
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.320
And that's actually what we're going to do right now.

48
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:59.800
So bring up my email account here and here you will see that I received an email from active trader

49
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:07.730
client services and it contains all the information related to Mr. a trader for demo accounts and how

50
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.270
to get it how to install it at the bottom you'll see that card details with the log in and password

51
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.500
and server and so on and one of the things that I love with actually trader is that they have an installation

52
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.990
package for Mac users and it's important here to mention that number four is not native actually to

53
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.810
Mac.

54
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.040
And so they go this extra step to serve their customers regardless of what's ply from the use.

55
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.490
So they've gone above and beyond to develop the special installation package for Mac users it's not

56
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.730
something you often see with brokers just something to to note it's always nice when a company takes

57
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.050
care of their customers.

58
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.170
But however in this course we're using a Windows machine so I'm gonna go ahead and download the Windows

59
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:05.400
installation package is quite a small file that gives download load I'll just save it here and I'll

60
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.500
open it up right away

61
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.140
so I'll get this Windows message as you can see I'll check yes make sure to read the terms and conditions

62
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.260
and that'll start the installation.

63
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.740
Once you click next if you have any questions.

64
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.350
Make sure to read a shout out to exit trader.

65
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.620
If you're cavers then check the box and click next and actually trader from here will get installed.

66
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.230
You'll see here that all the rest of the files are being downloaded and it's just going take a couple

67
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:57.110
seconds then you need to click finish and that and you see here in the desktop that we already have

68
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.810
an icon for the meditative wall for platform so double click it to open up the platform and you'll see

69
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.690
here that you'll get a window prompt to open up an account but we won't do that because we've already

70
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:18.170
opened an account through all registration process and now we get a log in window prompt so we just

71
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:26.210
need to enter our details so with a way there where we get them as we go back to the email and see what

72
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:35.900
access to centers and from here we just copy paste our log in password and select our server.

73
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.940
So once we've done that click logon and voila you'll hear a boring sound and that means that you are

74
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:50.090
successfully connected to the server and you'll see here in the trade tab that I have my balance of

75
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:57.440
fifty thousand demo U.S. dollars and so that means everything's working so in a nutshell that's how

76
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.950
you open a demo onto a fact trader.

77
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:09.260
And feel free to proceed to the next lecture if you wish but if you want to stick around for a bit I

78
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:16.900
I'd like to address the question of why I'm choosing AKC trader as my preferred broker.

79
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:30.950
So if you go to this following your o w w w dot for export dot com slash brokers you'll find here an

80
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:36.650
extensive review which basically helps us answer the question of why I'm choosing actually trader as

81
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.120
my favorite broker.

82
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:47.060
So you'll notice here that I did an extensive review of exit trader I tested them for three months and

83
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:55.110
came up with these four priority tests trustworthiness trading conditions customer service and funding.

84
00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:01.040
For example you'll see that actually trader is regulated by a sec which is the Australian Securities

85
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:10.100
and Investments Commission and a sec has a very stringent regulation one of the most thorough and stringent

86
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.850
regulations in the world.

87
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:18.500
Our own financial markets around financial services and really gives me personally a peace of mind that

88
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:30.400
this broker is regulated by a sec and not often you see that kind of regulation in the broker space.

89
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:38.360
Very often it's either unregulated or regulated by some shady companies or authorities in this case

90
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.060
it is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

91
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:50.720
Another interesting thing about actually trader is that they've placed their servers in the US.

92
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.370
So basically what that means is that they're close to their liquidity providers and that gives them

93
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.060
very fast execution.

94
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.340
And in that way you basically get the best of both worlds.

95
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:10.850
You get the regulation by an Australian authority and you also get the execution speed of the servers

96
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.850
being close to the liquidity provider.

97
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:18.360
But the thing that stands out probably the most is the customer service.

98
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:24.650
You can see all the wars that they've won throughout the years and having dealt with active trader for

99
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:32.180
multiple years myself now I can vouch for the fact that they're just great people working there and

100
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.140
that's what you want when you're starting out when you're just learning forex you want somebody to take

101
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.490
you by the hand and guide you through this world and not take advantage of you.

102
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:49.790
And we've had numerous hundreds if not thousands of forums both students go through AKC trade and work

103
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:56.810
with facts trader and every time access trader has delivered and taken care of our students.

104
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.770
Here's an example.

105
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:06.860
So for instance the demo trial that you downloaded is a 30 day demo trial and that's just a normal offering

106
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.040
that actually trader has.

107
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.850
But if you want to extend it all you have to do is just reach out to actually trader and tell them that

108
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:19.940
you're a for exposed student and they will extend your demo on trial for longer to help you practice

109
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:27.860
longer until you're ready until you're confident something to mention is that access trader accepts

110
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:38.300
live account clients from almost all countries except from the US and maybe some other countries.

111
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:44.420
So that's in a nutshell actually trader if you want feel free to check out this interesting read and

112
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.610
leave me your comments and questions and that's it for today and I look forward to seeing you in the

113
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.520
next lecture.

114
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.700
And until then Happy trading.
