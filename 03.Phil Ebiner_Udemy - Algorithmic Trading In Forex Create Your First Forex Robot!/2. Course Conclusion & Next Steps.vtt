00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.280
Hello this is Kerl from Fargo dot com and welcome to this concluding video for a course on algorithmic

2
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.960
training for beginners.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.370
And first of all congratulations if you're watching this video that means you've successfully completed

4
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.080
the course.

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.250
Perhaps you've even wash or thirty seven tutorials or somewhere thereabouts.

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.380
And for myself I'd like to say thank you because I do.

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.160
I do hope that you enjoyed the course and also for me it's really rewarding to know that people watch

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.820
my tutorials and that maybe I've even influenced your trading experience to make it a little bit better

9
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.900
in this short video.

10
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.430
We will discuss some next steps which you might consider taking to further develop your algorithmic

11
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.660
trading skills.

12
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.500
In front of you on your screen you can see four different courses one of which you've just completed.

13
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.260
That's the one on top left algorithmic training for beginners.

14
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.410
At the time of making this video the other three don't exist yet but I'm actively working on them and

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.930
hopefully they'll be released in the coming months.

16
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.330
And I just wanted to give you a quick overview of what you can be expecting in the near future.

17
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.600
So the discourse on the bottom left to right here which I've decided to call algorithmic training for

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.160
success is a more advanced course on algorithmic trading and programming and then kill for and it will

19
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:34.080
be a paid course and will be available on you Dimi and perhaps some other learning platforms.

20
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.240
This course represents an essential next step up from the algorithmic training for beginners course

21
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.270
we will delve deeper into topics such as strategy design money management working with indicators.

22
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.630
Building your own indicators with your prices arrays and so on.

23
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.670
And I'll also give you some handy tips and tricks to using your own algorithmic trading systems.

24
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.000
The other two courses here on the right relate to exclusively strategy testing and optimization.

25
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.370
As I recall we briefly touched on this topic in the algorithmic training for beginners course but I'm

26
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.880
also planning to release two more courses of just focused only on this topic and the first one will

27
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.430
be a free course basic strategy testing and MT for where we will expand a bit on what we've already

28
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:33.660
discussed and learn how to do back Tests forward tests demo tests and how to do simple optimizations

29
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.390
how to read.

30
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:43.350
The strategy test to report report and so on what parameters to focus on during a testing and the next

31
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.100
course after that we'll be testing an optimization for success which will also be a paid course and

32
00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:00.600
it will be a very comprehensive guide to testing your foreign exchange robots and it will even include

33
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.440
topics such as export of the MT for tests or data into Excel and a manipulation of that data in Excel

34
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.550
to derive extra parameters to evaluate your trading systems.

35
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.500
So that's what you can expect to come out in the near future.

36
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.520
And if you did enjoy this course and I encourage you to look further into one or maybe several of these

37
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.350
other upcoming courses at the same time as you can imagine it's very simple to keep up to date with

38
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.320
any new tutorials that I post.

39
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.120

Up here there is a review button and I'd really appreciate if you could leave me a rating and write

50
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:39.240
a review in that way you can help other students see if this course is worth their while and help them

51
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.360
make a better informed decision on whether they should take it or not.

52
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.190
Other than that thank you very much.

53
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.400
I really appreciate your time and I look forward to seeing you on my other courses.

54
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.680
Until then happy coding.
