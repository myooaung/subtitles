00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.240
Hello this is Carol from for explode dot com.

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.800
And welcome to the 24th tutorial on algorithmic trading for beginners.

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.490
And today we're going to be discussing the design of our algorithmic trading system what you see in

4
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.180
front of your screen right now is something what I call the blueprint of an algorithmic trading system

5
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:40.660
and simply put this is a diagram showing the set of string the logic behind our trading strategy which

6
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.970
will be the core of the algorithmic Chase system.

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.280
And as you can see I've highlighted some three different parts blue red and green.

8
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.930
But before we go deeper into this diagram Let's quickly look at a recap on what we discussed in the

9
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.190
previous tutorial.

10
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.520
The idea behind the trading strategy.

11
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.420
So if I bring up a or for you it should be familiar with this chart which I marked up previously.

12
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.480
If you are not then I would strongly advise for you to first watch the previous tutorial to understand

13
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.910
what the strategy is about.

14
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.080
However let's move on so what else strategy as you recall what a strategy is doing it is checking if

15
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:43.780
the British pound dollar has moved in a certain direction after the day has been opened to the day opening

16
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.230
of the day of each day are marked with these vertical lines and then the red or the blue lines show

17
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.940
which in which direction the market moved initially and then around 9:00 or 10:00.

18
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:07.990
Well let's say force simplicity's sake we'll say nine o'clock at 9:00 we're looking to see whether the

19
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.900
market has moved up or down.

20
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.250
Up until this point and if it's been moving downwards then we will trade upwards if it's been moving

21
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.200
upwards will trade downwards.

22
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:27.010
And it's all based on as of that we think that there is a pattern in the market which we can exploit.

23
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.300
So going back to our presentation here.

24
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.170
This is basically the same thing what we just said in words this is this has been put into a diagram

25
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.830
or here.

26
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.790
So let's quickly try to understand what's happening.

27
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.170
The program starts at the top.

28
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.900
It moves into this diamond first and every diamond is a decision.

29
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.810
So first the program has to check if the hour is 9:00 or not.

30
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.520
So let's assume the hour is 9:00 in the morning then we're going down this path.

31
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.460
So yes the hours 9:00 now we have to check if flag is true.

32
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:19.170
So what the flag is the flag is something very specific to you or in this case this flag is a specific.

33
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:28.180
Well it's a necessity which is specific to kill for because of the way that expert advisors work and

34
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:36.200
they will execute on tick function with every new tick that comes to that chart.

35
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.090
And this is something we discussed previously in this course because of that we cannot just check that

36
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.870
if the time is 9:00 and then do all of our required

37
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.360
procedures because the time is 9:00 in the morning.

38
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:07.830
In that one hour they can be thousands of takes that can be literally lots and lots and lots of ticks

39
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.760
come through.

40
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.220
And that condition this condition or here will be correct for every single one of them because we're

41
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.040
all we're doing is checking the hour and not checking the minute for not checking the second.

42
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.510
Even in the ninth hour and the first minute and the First Second it can be several takes or they can

43
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:33.040
be none so we can just check for 9:00 one minute and one second we have to have a different check.

44
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.570
So what we will do is we are looking for the ferry first take in the ninth hour of any given day and

45
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.780
to do that we are introducing a flag.

46
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:50.740
So originally initially the flag will always be false flag will always be true meaning that the first

47
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.890
take this is the first take.

48
00:04:52.890 --> 00:05:03.000
So if the flag is true then it is the first take and then we we start executing the rest of this algorithm.

49
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.250
But before we do that the first thing we do is we set the flag to false saying it's telling us that

50
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.000
the next tick that will come will no longer be the very first tick of the hour.

51
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:21.160
And so next time when the strategy goes this way with the next if the second tick of the 9:00 hour he'll

52
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.600
go here Ill go here.

53
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.680
But then the flag will already be false and so nothing will be done at all exit.

54
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.480
And so every third fourth and so on.

55
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.820
All it takes after the first will be going down this route.

56
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.240
So only the first take will go down this way and it will set the flag to false and then all of this

57
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.130
will be executed.

58
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:48.380
But only for the first tick and that is good because we only want to execute our strategy once at 9:00.

59
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.040
Not not a thousand times.

60
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.370
So after we fire serious set the Flucht falls.

61
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:06.470
What we're doing is we're the spread part is responsible for checking if there is any you know if there's

62
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:16.670
any orders that already exists so if we have an existing order we want to check if we're basically we

63
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.280
want to close it so we have the ticket number as you remember we know how to.

64
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.630
After sending the order how to preserve the ticket number of that order.

65
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.700
So using that ticket number will select in the order and that order select to something we discussed

66
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.580
in an earlier in the course.

67
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:45.520
Then if we have successfully if if we weren't successful at selecting the order that could mean probably

68
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.700
or the only case when that will most likely happen is at the very start of our algorithm so when we

69
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.210
haven't sent any orders are Tich will our ticket variable be zero.

70
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.580
So we won't be able to select an order so we'll just proceed to executing Greenport which is actual

71
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.110
the trading strategy the actual sending of the order.

72
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:18.830
So but if we were able to select the ticket or the order then we have to try and close it.

73
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:24.710
So we move on and we check if the close time of the order is zero.

74
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:34.400
So this as I recall from our order select Toral This is the way that we check if the order has already

75
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.160
been closed for it could have been close to various other reasons like the stop loss has been triggered

76
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.810
or the take profit has been triggered.

77
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.930
So before closing the order over here we have to check if it has already been closed so closed time

78
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.380
is zero.

79
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.900
That means that there order doesn't have a close time and that means we need to close it so close time

80
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.260
is zero.

81
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:05.000
Yes then we close those if close time is non-zero meaning that there is already a close time assigned

82
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.420
to this order by meditator for then we don't bother closing it because it is already a closed order

83
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.150
and proceed to the green part.

84
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.640
The main trading strategy.

85
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:23.180
So once we close the order we do the failsafe mechanism so I didn't write it all out because we have

86
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.930
done the failsafe so many times already.

87
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.390
It should just come off the bat for us by now.

88
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.820
It's very simple we just check if there has been an error if there has then we alert the trade it hasn't

89
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.490
we just continued doing what we were.

90
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.240
So that's why I put Fail-Safe is just one circle.

91
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.840
We implement a failsafe mechanism and then we proceed to executing our strategy.

92
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.470
All right so by the time we get here because of all of this red bit we are confident that there is no

93
00:08:54.470 --> 00:09:01.670
more open orders or by our trading system our algorithmic trading system has no open orders and now

94
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.450
we can go ahead and open a new order if the conditions are met.

95
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.880
So now we're going to check the conditions.

96
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.820
The first condition is is the price lower here.

97
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.760
We're checking if the price has moved up or down if the price is lower.

98
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:25.100
That means going back to the chart like in this case the price is lower than it was at the beginning

99
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.940
of the day.

100
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:32.510
So when that happens that means we potentially can open a buy order if the price is not lower it means

101
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.880
that it's higher.

102
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.260
And in that case we can potentially open a cell.

103
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:46.370
So if it is lower and we intend on opening a buy order we have to also check our filter the filter which

104
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:53.390
we introduced also in the previous lecture and as discussed before because we were trading the retracement

105
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:59.370
of a trend we want to buy below the Amay and sell about the Amay.

106
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:07.810
So if if we intending on doing a buy order and we checked that or the price is below Amay.

107
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.590
If the answer is no then we don't do anything and we exit.

108
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.800
If the answer is yes then we do open a buy order we implement a failsafe mechanism and then we exit.

109
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:26.160
Similarly if the price is not lower than it has then it can.

110
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.880
We're potentially looking at opening a sell order.

111
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.320
So we have to check if it is above the M8 if it is above them.

112
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.880
If it's not above them and then we just exit doing nothing if it is not above them.

113
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:44.900
If it is above them and then we do open a sell order failsafe mechanism and then we exit.

114
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.270
So we've discussed all of these dynamics if this over here which is floury is true.

115
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.280
So going back to the blue part which is responsible for checking time and making sure we only trade

116
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.840
on one tick what does this flag equal Strood do for us.

117
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:05.840
So once we're in here and say it's nine o'clock the very first take then we'll go through this pathway

118
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.680
will somehow we'll get to the green part and maybe open or maybe not.

119
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.990
Then every next second third fourth and fifth as discussed will go down this path we won't do anything.

120
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:24.950
And then as soon as it's no longer 9:00 when it's 10:00 11:00 and so on for the third day or even before

121
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.990

122
9:00 the tix will always go down this path.

123
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.920
And we can use this opportunity to reset our flag.

124
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:39.800
So once we know it's 10:00 or it's the next hour we know that we should go ahead and set the flag to

125
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:49.040
true meaning that the next tick that comes at and and has will comes within at 9:00 will be the first

126
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.530
take of nine o'clock.

127
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:58.160
So after nine o'clock all the ticks go here 10 and 11 and 12 at 13 and then in the morning at 6:00 AM

128
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:04.310
7 and so on 8:00 a.m. and then all of the ticks have been going here so we're guaranteed that the flag

129
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:10.640
is set to true so when the first tick does arrive for 9:00 it will go this way and we'll see that the

130
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.070
flag is true because we have said it so.

131
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:19.520
And then this will will be executed and then the next X will go this way and then after 9:00 they'll

132
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.490
go this way and then reset the flight.

133
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.520
So that's in a lot of detail how our training strategy works.

134
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:35.960
And if we sum it up with just a few very short and simple diagram then it will look like this.

135
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:41.600
So in the blue part we check that tie check time condition and make sure that this is the first take

136
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.070
of this bar.

137
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.580
Once we've done that we go and we close existing orders.

138
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.430
If it is an existing order if it is still open once we've done that would open relevant order if entry

139
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.520
conditions are met.

140
00:12:53.690 --> 00:13:03.800
So this is a very simplified view of our trading strategy and this is how you would start thinking about

141
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.550
what what's your algorithmic trading system will look like.

142
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:14.660
But once you've done that then it is very highly advisable to create something like this which is detail

143
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:20.090
that can take can take maybe half an hour an hour to put this together.

144
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.520
But once you have it in front of you you know exactly what you do which algorithmic trading system will

145
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:33.760
look like and what you need to program and the programming part will be very very simple.

146
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:40.020
Just before we finish this to trial I'll just like to recommend a tool which I use to put this together.

147
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.150
So I previously try.

148
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.900
Or I was used to putting them together in PowerPoint is used to take so long but now I know about the

149
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.270
still Liffey it's a tool which you can do.

150
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:58.910
I'm using a trial right now so you get a 15 day trial it's an online tool and you can put these diagrams

151
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:07.490
together very easily and like the like if I drag this around as you can see it's following it's following

152
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:14.660
where I'm putting it you can change the colors and you can add any kinds of shapes you want and you

153
00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.530
can make it very simple and easy to understand.

154
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:26.060
And it also allows you to change quickly change colors and make make it like a really cool diagram at

155
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:34.460
all the controls are basically at your fingertips I really like this tool and I'm going to use it for

156
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:41.120
use it going forward with my diagrams and I would like to recommend it to you as well.

157
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.660
So.

158
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.160
So that's basically it.

159
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:52.250
That's the end of this Tauriel this diagram both of these diagrams will be available on w w w dot for

160
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.790
spot dot com.

161
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.080
So that kind of sums it up.

162
00:14:55.090 --> 00:15:00.320
And and if you're watching on to me then I would like to ask for small favor.

163
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.970
Up here there's a review board.

164
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.090
And I'd really appreciate if you could leave me a rating and write a review in that way you can help

165
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:15.440
other students see if this course is worth their while and help them make a better informed decision

166
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.410
on whether they should take it or not.

167
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.970
And in the next tutorial we're going to we're going to actually start programming our expert adviser

168
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.760
which is very exciting and I hope to see you there.

169
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.090
Until then decoding.
