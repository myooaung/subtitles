00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,090
Hello this is Carol from Fargus dot com.

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,220
And welcome to this Twenty-Third tutorial on algorithmic training for beginners and I really hope that

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,270
you're as excited about today's tutorial as I am.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,940
Because today is the day that we're finally going to start working on our very own algorithmic trading

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,110
system.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,800
So what does any algorithmic trading system start with any algorithmic trading system starts with an

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,390
idea an idea that we can put in the core of our trading strategy an idea that we will build all of our

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,360
rules around.

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,470
And that idea can be anything.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:52,210
And most most of the time it will be a dependency that we observe on the market some sort of pattern

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,520
or something that we can expect we can.

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,980
We think that we can exploit.

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,890
So how do you come up with an idea like that.

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:08,710
Well I recommend using recalling what we talked about in the previous tutorial when we discussed rule

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,140
based decisions in algorithmic trading.

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:20,170
And I'll just bring up the slide from there and that time we talked about three types of rules that

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,430
we will be trying.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,760
We'll be looking to incorporate in our system and those are price rules timebase rules and indicator

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,720
based rules.

20
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,560
So we can use this diagram as a guideline.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,170
We look at price time and indicators to try to find some sort of pattern in the market.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:46,090
So here you see the British pound dollar chart and some highlights that are very dismayed and they might

23
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,430
not make sense right away.

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:56,100
But watch how this changes in less than a minute as I just said just the chatter a little bit.

25
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,180
So first of all we are going to change the chart to a line graph and then I'm going to go into properties

26
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,410
and I'm going to add the period separate just like we did in the previous Toral.

27
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,920
So now as you can see it's starting to make a bit more sense.

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:21,850
The lines are always connecting the open price of the day with a price somewhere in the market which

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:30,220
we'll talk about just now and then some other arrows show which way the traders should and the market

30
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,640
blue means by Red means sell.

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,660
So what am I doing here.

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,840
I I looked at the British pound dollar.

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,550
And well actually let's rewind a little bit.

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,340
What I was trying to do was I wanted to come up with a trading system that we that we would program

35
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,370
in these in this series of tutorials.

36
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:58,480
But I didn't want to be just a generic indicator based system or something that we would code just for

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,170
the sake of training and practicing and picking up our programming skills I wanted to actually make

38
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:14,470
it interesting by actually finding a pattern in the market and something that we can exploit and something

39
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:23,110
that will give our system a chance so that it can actually be profitable and it can bring us money in

40
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:29,080
the end and that way it'll be more interesting and more fun to create the code for the system.

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,850
So what I was doing I was looking at the British pound dollar chart and I noticed the dependency is

42
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,860
something we actually spoke a little bit about in the previous tutorial that usually the day here starts

43
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:50,800
pretty flat and then it and then there's a big movement at the Miss somewhere in the middle of the day

44
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,240
and upon further investigation this is what I found.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:03,250
I found that often the British pound will at the start of they will move in one direction and then around

46
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,950

47
9:00 or maybe eight nine ten eleven o'clock it will actually jump in the opposite direction.

48
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,430
So as you can see here the red line showing that the British pound was going down from the start of

49
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:23,230
the day from 0 0 to here it's 13 oclock and then it jumped back up here again it's going down from 0

50
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,060
0 and going all the way to 12 and then jumping back up here.

51
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,180
We can see the opposite happening.

52
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:40,870
The British pound dollar started at 1.7 8:59 went up to 1.7 136 and then it jump or it tumbled all the

53
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,210
way back down.

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,940
Here's another one.

55
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:52,180
It started somewhere around 1.7 1 2 0 0 went up and then at 9:00 it tumbled down.

56
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,370
And so this dependency can be observed quite often.

57
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,880
Sometimes you can observe it like for example here on the 16th of July 2014.

58
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,490
It's just going flat.

59
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,470
Pretty much no.

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,700
No movements and the biggest span here is about 20 pips courage you make a profit of that on British

61
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:22,170
pound dollar H-1 chart on our chart here which you can see is that is just going down just plain down

62
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:29,590
and that's why there's no bounce back up and that's why I put the x's here meaning that Conry tray if

63
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,500
we try we won't make a profit on these days if we try to trade this pattern that we've noticed over

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:45,630
here yesterday on the 18th of July 2014 what happened was it went up and then the British pound dollar

65
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,650
went up and around 10:00 and tumbled all the way down.

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,790
And so that's that's the dependency on notice and that's what we're going to put to try to put at the

67
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,270
core of our system and build a whole trading strategy around.

68
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,980
And of course automated in the process.

69
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:12,100
Let's have a look let's go back a bit and have a look if we can observe the same relation relationship

70
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,140
back in stock at the start of the year meaning just to make sure that it's not a recent trend.

71
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,070
It's not a recent thing that's happening that we it's actually pretty consistent because any trading

72
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,580
strategy can survive for forever.

73
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:33,670
But we would prefer it to be viable for at least two three four months and until we have to maybe adjust

74
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,030
it.

75
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,280
So looking back at February this year what we can see is that

76
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,170
we can actually observe this pattern as well here on the 24th of February.

77
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,140
The British pound dollar started low went up and then tumbled down.

78
00:06:53,140 --> 00:07:00,700
And what time did that happen happened at 10 o'clock on this day I put across here because it did happen

79
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:07,570
but it happened around 3:00 which is pretty late me like we have to choose a time we have to choose

80
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,670
a time when we're going to be expecting this to happen.

81
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,420
And from what we've seen so far it's probably going to be nine or ten o'clock.

82
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:21,060
So I hear we probably wouldn't have made money on this one on the 26 of February.

83
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:28,080
You can see it started low went up and tumbled down at nine o'clock here.

84
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,990
It started high went down and then jumped up at 10:00.

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,320
Here it's kind of generally going up.

86
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,570
However Well there is a there is a jump down at 10:00.

87
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,530
And just I just didn't highlight everything around here just a few here.

88
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,750
You can also see it started low went high tumbled down at 9:00.

89
00:07:50,920 --> 00:08:00,020
So this whole pattern or this whole behavior in the market is happening around 9:00.

90
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,810
And what does that mean.

91
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:10,630
Well it means that 9:00 on this server time is actually when the European session starts or somewhere

92
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,050
around there.

93
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:20,830
So during the Asian session this British pound dollar it's pretty is pretty calm or it's going in one

94
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,410
direction and then like here it's calm of course but it's going in one direction.

95
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:32,870
But then when the euro the European session starts it makes a rapid movement in the opposite direction.

96
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,690
And so that's how it can be explained from a market point of view.

97
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,460
Why why it could be happening.

98
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,350
And as you can see we're not observing this you know pattern every time.

99
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,870
There are exceptions and sometimes it happens later sometimes happens earlier.

100
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,900
But a lot of the time it does happen at 9:00 or 10:00 so and that's the beauty of Forex you don't have

101
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:06,730
to actually observe something or find something on a parody that happens every single time even if it

102
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,790
happens in 60 or 70 percent percent of the time.

103
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:17,320
Then you can still make a profit out of it by putting the right decision based rules around it and putting

104
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,400
good trading generally good trading strategy around.

105
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:29,360
So generally speaking this is a good looks like a good pattern for us to trade.

106
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,110
So let's bring up this presentation again and what what have we discussed so far we've ticked the price

107
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,440
because we can't the star of the day price and price at 9:00 or 10:00 and we take the time and because

108
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,240
we're looking at a fixed time we're expecting this pattern to happen at exactly 9:00.

109
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,390
So we are looking at time.

110
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,190
We haven't looked at indicators yet so how'd we do that.

111
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,790
How would we see if we can improve the system a little bit by using an indicator.

112
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:09,950
So we'll quickly add a moving average it's a 100 periods simple I reach by using the close price and

113
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,250
generally what you would do is a movie you tread a moving average is a moving average as a filter.

114
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,800
And if you're above the moving average if your price is above the moving average like here then you

115
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:30,480
trade you Jews you Dubai or as you trade upwards because it's that indicates that it's an upward trend.

116
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,950
If your price is below the moving average like over here you would generally sell because that indicates

117
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:42,330
the price being below the moving average indicates that it's a downward trend.

118
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,130
And obviously you had your druthers Sallon downward trend.

119
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,460
However let's see what's happening in our particular situation.

120
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:57,800
So in this system in this system that we're outlining here what we can see is that these blue arrows

121
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,310
are below the moving average and the red ones for this one are either very close to the moving average

122
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,710
or above.

123
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,070
And what does that mean to us.

124
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:13,720
That means that we're actually doing the opposite of what was prescribed.

125
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,160
So the price here is generally below the moving average but we are buying.

126
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:27,200
And that means that we are tré it we're actually going against the trade and looks like it by the looks

127
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,560
of it.

128
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:35,570
If we look back here we can see that the price is going down generally but at every one of these blue

129
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,130
Iris's the retracement.

130
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:44,570
And so to me that says that probably during the European session the British pound dollar currency pair

131
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:51,570
experience at the open of that session experiences a retracement within the trade within the trend and

132
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,520
not even knowing that what we've come up with this trading strategy we've come up with is actually based

133
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,020
on trading that retracement.

134
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:07,370
So it is legitimate that we are trading by orders we're creating by or below them moving our age because

135
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,510
we want to catch this retracement movement that we've observed.

136
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,770
And so that's basically it.

137
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,250
That's that's how strategies played out.

138
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:24,890
And it's picked all all three of these boxes price time and indicators and that's exactly what we're

139
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,410
going to be working on in the future in the next couple of tutorials and in the next one we're going

140
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:37,070
to create a blueprint for the system just so that our coding is then much simpler and then in the toilet

141
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:41,960
after that we're actually going to start coding it and you'll see how because we've done all of this

142
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,450
groundwork already and our system is shaping up pretty nicely and it's pretty straightforward and quite

143
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,680
simple.
