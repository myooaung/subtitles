00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,800
Below this is Carol from for explode dot com.

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:18,360
And welcome to Turrell number 10 in our series of em call for Torrijos for beginners.

3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:26,290
Today we're going to finish up of the if else statements and we're finally going to add the last bit

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,490
which is the else statement.

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:41,580
And so this is the code from the previous tutorial where we had two statements if and else and we'll

6
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,700
just get rid of this comment here at the bottom.

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:57,050
And as you can remember we checked whether the current bid price is less than a certain level and if

8
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:06,190
it was then we executed this bit of code which told give us some information told us to sell it gave

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
us recommendation to sell.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,280
And if this condition was false then we asked the program to execute this other bit of code which also

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,190
gave us some information and gave us recommissioned by.

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,500
So going back to the terminal that's where we set our last level.

13
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:39,590
And when we execute tural turn we see that the prices above are 1 3 one point thirty six nine hundred

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,550
which is correct.

15
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:50,540
The price is above and it's telling us that we shouldn't buy in this case which could be a rule set

16
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,890
in our strategy.

17
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,240
And also it's all so but that's the sort of commission we're getting.

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,410
And before that we see this message.

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,540
So these are in reverse order.

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,650
I forget that sometimes myself.

21
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:11,620
Now let's go back to Mr. Editor and what we're going to do now is we're going to add another

22
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,380
condition which is called LCF another statement which also.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,230
So in between an if and else are or even if we don't have it.

24
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:32,020
So basically after and if we can always add an ELSE else if something then do something else.

25
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:44,570
So what that means is that if your first condition is false then the program will go on to this block

26
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,880
and or check the second condition.

27
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:56,440
And if the second condition is true then the program will execute the code that's in here.

28
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,430
If this condition is also false then and only then the program will move onto getting out.

29
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:12,450
So basically we moved from two separate blocks of code to three separate blocks of code.

30
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,470
The first one gets executed only if this condition is true.

31
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,750
And then if that is the case then the rest get ignored.

32
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:29,110
If this condition is false then the same rules apply to this block and this condition is false then

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,710
the else is finely executed.

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,370
So that's not a condition here.

35
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:44,010
And to do that we'll look at another level so we have this red level Now let's say a level here.

36
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:55,610
This looks like like a support resistance level and we'll just change the color here to say aqua and

37
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,540
the value is one point 3 7 3.

38
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,490
I think we can change the it around the other way there you go.

39
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:19,890
So one point thirty seven 400 And let's go back to code and that information here so we'll add another

40
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,650
level.

41
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:29,080
This will be level 2 and this will be 1:37 400.

42
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:39,330
And so in case if the bid is I'll just change this to level 1 so that it makes more sense.

43
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:50,280
One year in case when the bid is less than level 1 then this code will be executed.

44
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,160
And then if the bid is not less than level 1.

45
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,930
So if it's above Level 1 we want to check whether it's still below level 2.

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,900
So this is the one.

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,370
This is level 2.

48
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:15,560
So we want to check if the bid is too low level to him he is less than 2.

49
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:24,900
In that case we will say lurks.

50
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,480
Price is.

51
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:35,690
We can all just leave it as takes a level one and level

52
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:55,640
and then if so but if that is not the case meaning that price is actually a bar to then you know find

53
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,160
a whole block of code.

54
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,060
We want to say exactly that the price is above level two and that's why we want to buy.

55
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,080
So let's compile that and see how that works.

56
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:20,320
So see here it says are the prices of Bob 1:36 mind.

57
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,100
Sorry my bad.

58
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:32,870
Why did I just say I can so compile it and try and

59
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,850
others because it took to out.

60
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,460
There you go.

61
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,610
So bid is is over there.

62
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:55,690
One point thirty seven hundred five and the price is above 1.3 74 so buy and that is correct.

63
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:10,570
Now let's see what will happen if we move this level to say for example for instance here so be 1 3

64
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:22,790
7 900 go back to Mr. Editor and replace that with that so that's level 2.

65
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,370
Now that's where it is.

66
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:32,490
And so as you saw in the previous case this was executed because the price was above all levels.

67
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,570
But now what we're expecting is that prices between these two levels.

68
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,780
So what we're expecting is for this part to be executed because it is less than 1.

69
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,760
This is level 1 this is not true this is false.

70
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,260
But then when we go into checking the second condition bid is less than level 2.

71
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,800
This condition will be true.

72
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,550
So this code will be executed and this code will be ignored.

73
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,000
So let's compile that and have a look at how it works for upturn.

74
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,420
So that's our current bid.

75
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,820
And that's the message we wanted to see.

76
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:17,240
The price is between Level 1 and level 2 goes and the price is between these two levels and what that

77
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:27,040
means is that we have just developed a very simple script that are based on this.

78
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:34,940
These two pieces of information in the beginning can provide us recommendations on what we should do

79
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,420
on the forex market.

80
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,540
So let's recap the script tells us first of all what the current price is.

81
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,830
And then by comparing the current bid price to these levels it will tell us whether we should buy sell

82
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,860
or basically do nothing in this middle case.

83
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:59,250
So the script will tell us to sell when the bid is less than level 1.

84
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,220
So basically whenever we're whenever the price is here the script will tell us to sell.

85
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:13,270
Now whenever whenever that's not the case this group will check if the price is still below level 2.

86
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,640
So the script will check if the price is below the level where we know that in that case it will be

87
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,680
above Level 1.

88
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,690
So somewhere here.

89
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,290
But the script will check if it's also below level 2.

90
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,820
So when the when prices here the script will tell us not to do anything.

91
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,090
Just tell us the price is between these two levels and there will be no recommendation whether to buy

92
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,090
or sell.

93
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:42,170
And then finally if this is not correct this is false then the script knows that the price must be somewhere

94
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,060
up here.

95
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:50,280
And in that case the script gives a recommendation to buy by printing this last message.

96
00:09:50,630 --> 00:10:00,240
And also we're also and also were able to control the script by setting these levels here in the code.

97
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,740
So there you go.

98
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,230
Those are your first

99
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:19,400
simple advisors type typescript and I hope you found this Tauriel interesting and I encourage you to

100
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:29,170
play around with the code and see how you can adjust it to suit your own requirements.

101
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,740
At the same time you can always find more information tutorials on for example dot com.

102
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,970
I hope you can join me next.

103
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,570
And until then coding.
