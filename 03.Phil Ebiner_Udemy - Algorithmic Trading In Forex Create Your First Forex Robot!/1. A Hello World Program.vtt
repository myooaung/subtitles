00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.190
Hello this is Curole from both dot com and welcome to this tutorial on creating your own automated trading

2
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.030
strategies for the foreign exchange market.

3
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.710
We will be using them as a trader for trading platform and consequently our programming language is

4
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.600
immaterial for.

5
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.630
I'm assuming that you already have met a trader for installed and that you have met or the Mirror editor

6
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.310
window in front of you.

7
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.880
So what are we going to do today is we going to create a very simple program which says or outputs onto

8
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.090
a screen.

9
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.350
The phrase hello world is kind of a tradition in programming that when you start learning a new language

10
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.750
that's the first thing that occurred.

11
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.220
All right so what we can do is in Mitta editor and the top left corner we're going to click you and

12
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:18.070
this will bring up the kill wizard lets them kill wizard is not something that we're going to be necessarily

13
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:27.310
using all the time going forward but it's a very handy tool to have and to use especially when you're

14
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.770
just getting started with and kill for.

15
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.180
So right now we have a choice of six different options.

16
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.860
An expert advisor custom indicators script library include new class so an expert advisor is the ultimate

17
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.690
program that we're going to be aiming to code at.

18
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.230
By the end of this course it's a robot it's a training robot that actually executes orders on the foreign

19
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.960
exchange market indicator shows.

20
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.190
It basically allows you to create your own indicator which can do your signals and identify certain

21
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.910
things on the market.

22
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:18.890
A script is a program that gets executed once and only once assumes that it's attached to the chart.

23
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.070
And about the other three we'll talk some some other time.

24
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.670
They're not as crucial at this stage so we're going to select a script because it's the easiest of the

25
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.100
top three then we're going to click next.

26
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.380
We're going to give our script a name over here at the top of the backslash.

27
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.650
You can call it whatever you like.

28
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.170
I'm just going to call it a real one as if this is your first time using my editor and you've just installed

29
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.020
it then these two fields author and link will be populated with default values.

30
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.690
I suggest you change them to something that is relevant to you.

31
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:09.180
So you have copyright over the code and plus somebody can find you there they ever want to get to get

32
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.900
in touch.

33
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.330
We're not going to have any parameters at this stage so just click Finish.

34
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.900
So what happened here is that Weser has created a script for us.

35
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.660
It's a script template.

36
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.500
You can check that the script actually exists by clicking opening the script folder on the left and

37
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.490
you'll see your script here to Tauriel one.

38
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:41.070
So everything that starts with double slash is a comment it is ignored by the compiler.

39
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.540
So basically when you create this script into a working program all these lines will be ignored.

40
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.910
They're there just for visual interpretation.

41
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.490
We're going to get rid of this line and this line because are basically useless.

42
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.720
These four properties they describe the program to meditate are four.

43
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.590
And we're not going to focus on them because they just get put there all the time by the wizard and

44
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.370
they're not really relevant to us at this stage.

45
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.620
What are we going to focus on.

46
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.450
Is this part this is the function or this is the body of the program which.

47
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.430
And it gets executed as soon as you attach a script to the chart right now.

48
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.590
Inside the body there's nothing inside the body.

49
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.360
And when I say inside I mean between these two curly brackets.

50
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.860
So we want to add some code to the program.

51
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.100
We're going to put it between these two curly brackets and what we're going to do is we're going to

52
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.740
type in the red alert and you can see it's come up here as a prompt alert is a built in function that

53
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.040
allows it to output messages onto the screen.

54
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.520
So we'll just use it at this stage we'll type and alert then we'll put into brackets and we'll put a

55
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.680
semi-colon inside the two brackets we need to type in all message.

56
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.930
Message has to be in quotation marks so we'll put two quotation marks and between them we will say hello

57
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.240
world exclamation mark.

58
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.690
So that's basically it.

59
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.250
Alert.

60
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.740
And then within the brackets message in quotation marks.

61
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.570
And please don't forget the semi-colon on the end.

62
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.040
That is quite important.

63
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.710
All right so that's our program.

64
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.160
Now we're going to compile it.

65
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.340
And what that means is we're going to create an executable file.

66
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.520
We're going to click compile as you can see here.

67
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.520
The compiler says that there's zero errors and zero warnings which is good.

68
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.080
Which means that everything worked fine.

69
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.990
Now we're going to go two minutes later for by clicking this button over here this is met a traitor

70
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.770
for.

71
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.330
And here we are going to find our script.

72
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:15.870
So on the left in the navigator panel just open up the scripts menu and find tutorial one.

73
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.280
And now we're going to attach it to the screen and hopefully that what will happen is we'll see the

74
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.340
message Hello world.

75
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.550
So let's go to go touch and there we go.

76
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.810
So.

77
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.860
Hello world.

78
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.120
And that's all we wanted to do for today.

79
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:44.140
I hope it was a useful tutorial and more tutorials and information are available and forget about dot

80
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.480
com and then to the next Tauriel happy coding.
