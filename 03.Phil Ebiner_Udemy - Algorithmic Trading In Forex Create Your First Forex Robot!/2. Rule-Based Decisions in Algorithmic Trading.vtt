00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.850
Hello this is curial from for example dot com and welcome to this 20 second tutorial on algorithmic

2
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.880
trading for beginners and today we're going to be talking about rule based decisions.

3
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.480
If you recall in the previous tutorial we spoke about algorithmic trading systems and how they're called

4
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.750
expert advisors and then kill four wheels to find out how they're structured on the inside what functions

5
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:43.040
they incorporate and basically how they work from an execution point of view to begin to understand

6
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:53.060
how like what we will be putting in the body of each of our expert advisors how we will tell the robot

7
00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.450
how to correctly understand when to open in order when to close an order and when to take certain actions.

8
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.620
That's basically a rule based decisions.

9
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.220
So rule rule based decisions are a way of analyzing the market and it is the predominant approach to

10
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.100
automated trading systems and basically even most of trading strategies are rule based trades trading

11
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.500
strategies.

12
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.020
It actually it was quite a challenge for me to find out what other types of

13
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.390
strategies or decisions there can be and I have outlined a few.

14
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.140
And I don't know if you'll agree with this if they can be separated into their own clauses but for example

15
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:55.550
random decisions are not ruled based decisions so when an expert advisor or even a person makes trading

16
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:07.250
decisions at random that wouldn't involve any rules behind it and then say a self-learning algorithm

17
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.640
like a neural network.

18
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:18.260
That's a more much more complicated complex expert advisor which learns from its own mistakes and redeveloped

19
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.820
itself in its core it would have rules around how a story develops itself and how it learns from its

20
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.410
own mistakes and from the market etc..

21
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.510
But in general I would probably say that that's not as a rule based decision system or at least it's

22
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.660
not a simple one.

23
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.020
And of course informed decisions.

24
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:50.510
Those are most definitely not rule based decisions those are just when you have some information when

25
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:59.260
you know that somebody told you that your dollar is going up or you just have some sort of information

26
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.100
and you don't have any rules around it you just act on it right away.

27
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.760
So but we will be talking about real base decisions and that's how our automated trading systems will

28
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.460
be structured.

29
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:20.090
And on this slide as you can see I've outlined three main types of rule based decisions which we will

30
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:30.290
be talking about that is price price rule based decisions time decisions based on time and decisions

31
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.250
based on indicators.

32
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:40.910
Of course there are other rule based decisions always you can create these things and for example one

33
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.880
of them is funds you can base your rules around how much money you have left or how much money you have

34
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.350
earned.

35
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.780
And that's going more into money management.

36
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.590
But in this course we won't be talking about that.

37
00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.330
If you do want to find out more you're welcome to have a look at another course which I'm developing

38
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.740
at the moment and I'll be a bit more advanced or will be the next step from this course or it will also

39
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.480
be an algorithmic trading system.

40
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.390
But you will have much more depth to it.

41
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.910
So let's have a look at for example price base decisions.

42
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:34.110
Those these decisions involve or these rules involve very very well known domain of the forex trade

43
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.210
market for traders and that is patterns candell patterns so we'll just quickly go to the terminal and

44
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.410
have a look here.

45
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:53.000
So for example we could have a rule that if if we see a large candell like over.

46
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.750
So this one is 33 pips or from open to close it's 30 pips.

47
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.450
So Frisia a candle over 20 pips.

48
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.720
Then we make a transaction and say for example if the Cannell over 20 pips is bullish scandal so it

49
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.210
going up then we will Celso this case we would all just zoom in a little bit more in this case we would

50
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:22.350
sell and we could earn maybe around 10 pips or something like that and say if it's if it's a bearish

51
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.970
candle I'm just trying to find one here.

52
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.410
Here is a bearish candle.

53
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.360
We could we could say we buy and in this case would buy and maybe what are its own pips or maybe we'll

54
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.060
lose some money or maybe would go up.

55
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.370
So basically that's a very simple rule based decision.

56
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.630
Now I'll just switch over to candel you so we can better see the candles the white ones are going down

57
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:54.480
the black ones or the hollow ones are going up say we could have another rule that if if there's a candle

58
00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:04.650
at the top like a fractal like that if if we find a candle that is a turnaround candle then we sell

59
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.170
So for example here we have a candle going up then a candle at the top and then a candle going down.

60
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.770
So here we would sell meaning that would tell us that there was like a turnaround point or something

61
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.570
of that sort.

62
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.400
So basically prices and also prices decision don't only are not only limited to candell formations they're

63
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.240
also they can also involve like price levels.

64
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.380
So here is say we know that well let's have a look somewhere here this should be a price though of 1

65
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.080
3 1 3 6 0 0.

66
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:52.230
So here we can have a rule for example that if the price goes through this level here if the price breaks

67
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.490
through this resistance line then we sell.

68
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.320
And let's see what would happen.

69
00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.340
So if we sold here for example and we waited long enough we could earn like 20 pips.

70
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.780
And so that's another way of setting your price based decisions.

71
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.720
So let's go back to the presentation.

72
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:22.170
That's that's generally straight forward next step overrule those decisions that I would highlight is

73
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:31.020
time decisions based on time and they could be as simple as we do in our trade on Fridays and that's

74
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.630
not because Friday is the end of the week and everybody wants to go home and have a rest before or start

75
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.280
the weekend early.

76
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.900
Not at all.

77
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:50.220
It's it's a very legitimate it's actually a legitimate rule because the non-farm payrolls and unemployment

78
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.920
rates in the U.S. Those are two fundamental pieces of news.

79
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:03.780
They come out on every first Friday of the month and usually they cause very volatile movements on the

80
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:11.340
market and you probably don't want to trade during those volatile movements unless you have a specific

81
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:19.920
goal of trading those to market like those two releases on Market News.

82
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:27.510
So therefore I generally try to avoid trading on a Friday and post plus also that helps you prove prevents

83
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:37.340
you from having open positions going over the weekend and possibly getting like being affected by them.

84
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.120
Any gap in the market that can occur on a Monday.

85
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.020
We'll have a look at another example.

86
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.620
So it's not limited to that.

87
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:51.120
Let's for example look at the British pound dollar chart for a change.

88
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:58.100
So just switch that off and let's say you look at the charge you can really tell what some.

89
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:03.410
Is there any time related correlation or time dependencies here.

90
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:10.800
But if we switch on the period separators which will show us so every period between two periods it

91
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.130
should be 24 candles and that because we were on that is 24 candles and because we were on the one hour

92
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.310
chart that means that each period is one day.

93
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:26.010
If we look closely and we zoom it like let's actually stay at this level of zoom.

94
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.500
If you look at the start of every day there isn't much movement.

95
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.720
It's the market is generally flat at the start every day.

96
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.860
And the big movements always happen in the middle of the day based on this time zone where the trading

97
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.150
server is located.

98
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.430
And so here again you can see that most of the movements don't start right away in the beginning.

99
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:53.770
They they do sometimes but statistically they occur in the middle of the day.

100
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:59.730
So we could have a rule saying that we either do not trade in the middle of the day or on the contrary

101
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:08.030
we trade in the middle of the day and we look for movements there so we can tell our make trading systems

102
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:13.240
where system when it should and it shouldn't engage the market.

103
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.870
And finally indicate Well this is a very common one.

104
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:25.590
This is where we look at different price indicators and we base our decisions on that.

105
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.510
Let's have a look at the quick one.

106
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.520
Moving Averages is Fortune's fine.

107
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.050
I'll just make this a bit

108
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.300
bolder.

109
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:48.880
So that red line is a 14 bar moving average of the close price and we can have a rule when whenever

110
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:56.440
the price crosses the moving average then we open a transaction in the direction of the crossing.

111
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.430
So huge sell here.

112
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:07.640
We basically these are not favorable crossings for us but here for example the crosses and we buy is

113
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:15.690
another good one this is a basic rule so you would have to add some exceptions or filters to it so you

114
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:23.220
don't pick up all these noisy signals but say here you could if we buy here and we hold until it actually

115
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.150
crossed again we could earn some pips once once more.

116
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.340
And so that's a rule around indicators.

117
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.040
And those are basically the ones that we intend on working with.

118
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.180
I'm not sure yet how our strategy will play out.

119
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:47.630
I haven't finalized it yet but we'll we'll see how we go in the next two meals.

120
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:57.350
And finally I just want to show you a a blueprint of a trading system and this is not our trading system

121
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.650
will be talking about our trading system in the next.

122
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.690
But this is just a.

123
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:10.710
One of the trading systems that I worked on some time ago and as you can see here it has in it function

124
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:16.340
Deane it function and the star function without going into detail.

125
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:23.280
I just wanted to show you the way the rule rules play out so if you take this red sub algorithm here

126
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.980
you can see this these are rhomboids or these weird shapes here.

127
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.350
They ask a question and that is your rule basically that that is where you ask so it doesn't order exist

128
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.090
if an order exists.

129
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.680
Then just to up something if an order doesn't exist then do another check.

130
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.130
And here is the bid price Lesar below the red line.

131
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.420
Then if no then don't just do some updates if the bid price is below the red line then.

132
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.800
Then you open an order.

133
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:03.860
So basically that's your that's how a rule based decision looks in a trading system blueprint.

134
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.770
And so we'll be.

135
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:12.480
We will be doing a similar one up but a more simple one for our trading system.

136
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:18.260
But generally in the code this is where your if else statements go.

137
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:24.060
So if something then if it's a yes then do that if else.

138
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.290
Alternatively the alternative to if is the else statement.

139
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:35.220
Operator if so when you say else then that means no and then do this and then again if this you say

140
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.170
yes then do this.

141
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:43.120
If it's a no so else then do this and that's where that's where the power of the F and L statements

142
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.200
proves itself.

143
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:53.410
And that's why I mentioned that it's a very important part of this programming language.

144
00:13:53.430 --> 00:14:00.300
MKR for because on the forex market we have to make a lot of decisions and basically our trading systems

145
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:08.520
are all just full of these decisions when we when it tries to understand what's going on and what it

146
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.360
should do.

147
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.180
And so we'll we'll be seeing much more of those.

148
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.590
So that's that for today.

149
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:21.270
Basically we have we didn't call it anything just what we were preparing for the next step so we can

150
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:28.720
flow smoothly through the next Charles and I do hope to see you in our next session.

151
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.810
And until then happy coding.
