00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.830
So there's a bunch of stuff we can configure and what exactly can we configure there or what could

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.080
be interesting to us?

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.090
Well things like quiet allow you to change the way things get logged or output by the server

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.430
and if you feel like it's talking too much to you, you can control that with quiet

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.520
and obviously check out the official docs for more detailed explanations of all the options. Interesting

6
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:34.130
to us is the log path and also another setting, the db path which you can find a bit further down towards

7
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.390
the end of this list.

8
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.350
These two path allow you to configure where your data gets stored in the case of db path because

9
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.020
mongodb of course does write your data to real files on your system,

10
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.970
so the db path is where these files will live and the log path is essentially where the logs will

11
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.340
be written to and the logs are interesting because in the logs, you can then see for example warnings

12
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.370
of json schema validation, warnings

13
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.960
if you set the validation action to warning, what we did in a previous module. So log path and db

14
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.220
path can be set,

15
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.130
now how do we set this?

16
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.280
I'm in my mongodb folder and there, I got that bin folder

17
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.060
Now in this mongodb folder, I'll create a new path and I'll name it db and I'll create another

18
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.360
new folder and I'll name it

19
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.610
logs, you can name these folders however you want.

20
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.140
Now these are two new folders and I want to use the db folder for my db files and the logs folder

21
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.310
for my logs, the default setting for db is that it will use my root folder and there, the data db folder,

22
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.490
that is the default setting of mongodb

23
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.240
and if you start a mongod instance without any additional setting, it will use that folder

24
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.550
but you can tell it to use another folder. And the same is true for the logs,

25
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.220
you can tell it to not output its log messages in the window where you started the mongod's instance

26
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.410
but instead into a separate file

27
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.150
and I want to do these two things. Now on Mac,

28
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.200
I can get the path to my db folder by clicking on it with a right click and then get info and then copying

29
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.700
that path, on windows in the explorer,

30
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.700
you can of course just copy that url by clicking into it once it becomes a full url and

31
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.080
then copying that.

32
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.540
And now if I want to start my mongodb server with that path being used, I can run sudo mongod

33
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.040
or on Windows, it would just be Mongod --dbpath like this,

34
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.000
then a blank

35
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.620
and then the path. And now important, I just copied the path to my mongodb folder,

36
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.570
of course I should point to the slash db folder, on windows its /db. Hit enter and enter your

37
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.840
password if you have to

38
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.560
And this should bring up your mongod server as it worked in the past but now you should see that in

39
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.930
the db folder, it created a bunch of files because now it's storing the data here and therefore this is

40
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.290
now using a totally different database storage than it previously did,

41
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.130
it's totally detached from our old database path,

42
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.620
we have a brand new database set up now because we're using a different file storage for the database

43
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.430
files. Now logging would also be interesting,

44
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.350
so let me quickly clear the window to make it easier to read,

45
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.490
let me quickly rerun sudo mongod here with db path

46
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.220
but I'll set an additional flag separated with a blank and then --logpath

47
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.760
and now I want to use almost the same path,

48
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.960
this one,

49
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.270
however it should be /logs and and that's important to know, the logs, the log path needs the path

50
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.970
to a log file,

51
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.860
so here you could add log.log for example. If you hit enter,

52
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.770
this now starts the server but you see way less output here because now if you look into logs, you should

53
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.660
have a log.log file,

54
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.200
now all the output gets written into that file

55
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.860
and that of course can be useful because now this file will get saved and you can always come back

56
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.320
to it,

57
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.590
check your logs from yesterday,

58
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.720
go through it,

59
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.430
see any warnings or errors you might have in there, like this warning that access control is not enabled

60
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.330
which is the default right now, we got no authentication,

61
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.450
we'll add it later.

62
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.690
So this can be useful for

63
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.810
well persist and error searching or for simply persistent and auditing of your server.

64
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.250
So this now is how you can set a custom path for your logs and how you can set a custom path for your

65
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.370
database. What else can we do?
