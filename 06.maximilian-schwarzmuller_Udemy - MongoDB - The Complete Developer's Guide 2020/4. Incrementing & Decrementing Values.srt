1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,530
Now what else can we do with update besides setting some values?

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:14,610
Let's look into our users again and let's say Manuel got older, he's 30 but let's say we want to increase

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,710
that to 31.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,490
Now obviously, this is pretty straightforward to us,

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,910
we could use $set and set age to 31

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,720
but in a typical application, you will not know the age of all your users,

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,550
so it would be nice if you wouldn't have to find all users or the user you want to update first to get

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,210
the current age then recalculate the new age and then issue your update request, would be nice

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,150
if for simple and common transformations like this, mongodb would do that

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,270
and indeed it can. Incrementing a number,

11
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,500
so increasing it is such a common task that mongodb has a built-in operator for this.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,950
So let's quickly grab the ID or let's filter by name to mix it up,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,060
so let's filter for Manuel, db users update one

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,620
and then here, I'm looking for a name equal to Manuel,

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,880
this will find the first entry or the first document with a name of Manuel in the collection

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,570
and then here in a second argument, I don't use $set but I use the inc,

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,950
so $inc, by the way you can also combine this. You can have $inc

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,810
and then here you have some information which I'll add in a second

19
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,270
and then as a second element in this second argument, so in this object with the purple curly brace, you

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,450
can of course add $set and describe some other changes,

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,230
so you can do multiple different things in the same update.

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,950
But here I'll just use $inc and I will say that the age should be incremented by 1,

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,300
this is what this will do

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,990
and we could also increment by two,

25
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,410
so if I do that for example and I find all results, Manuel now has an age of 32,

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,600
it was 30 before.

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,040
Now you can also decrement with this method even though it's called inc,

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,680
you can also say -1 for example

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,270
and now it will be 31 as you can see here.

30
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,660
So with inc, you can go in both directions

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,700
and as I mentioned, you can combine it and just to show this because it's really important,

32
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,250
you can absolutely say increment by 1 and then $set

33
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:39,900
and for example set isSporty which is missing to false because Manuel doesn't have sports as a hobby.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,220
If you do that, then you see it also succeeded and it simply did both

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:53,130
and if we check Manuel again, he's now 32 and isSporty was added with a value of false.

36
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,610
Now of course you could also get fancy and you could try setting the same value you're incrementing,

37
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,310
so I'm incrementing age by 1 and then I'm setting age to 30,

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,040
now let's see what happens now.

39
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,360
If I do that, then I get an error,

40
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:16,140
I get an error that updating the path age would create a conflict at age because I simply got two operations

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,360
working on the same field

42
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,330
and this is not allowed here,

43
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,360
so it will simply fail.

44
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,410
So you can use inc and set

45
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,570
and the other operators I'll show you together but working on the same field will not be possible.
