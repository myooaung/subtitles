1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,440
So how can we create documents?

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:11,420
Well you already saw that but we basically have insert one and insert many as alternatives.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,280
The important thing to recognize here is that insert one takes a single document with the values you want to

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,970
insert and you can but don't have to specify an ID because if you don't specify one, you will get one automatically

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,980
and insert many does the same but with an array of documents,

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,900
so with a list of documents that gets inserted. Now there also is a third method, insert,

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,260
it's a bit more flexible because it takes both a single document or an array of documents

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,540
but I will not bother diving into that because insert was used in the past, insert one and insert many were

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,050
introduced on purpose

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,130
so that you have to be more clear about what you will do because with insert, your code if you are

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,560
writing an application could have been a bit harder to understand because it was not instantly obvious

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,690
if you were to insert one or multiple documents and it therefore might have also been a bit more error

13
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,240
prone because you could have ended up in a situation where you expected it to insert multiple documents

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,120
but you only inserted one. With insert one and many, due to them being fixed to one syntax,

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,280
so one document or an array, you'll get an error if you enter something incorrect

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,170
and they're also easier to understand if you see them in code,

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,560
so we will focus on insert one and insert many.

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,550
And then as I mentioned also on importing data, for that we'll have the Mongo import tool, we'll configure

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,790
it a bit like you see here

20
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,000
and I will explain what these options do and how it works.

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,170
So with that, let's dive into inserting documents

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:44,220
and let's quickly go over the basics again before I then talk about the a bit more advanced options or extra

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,210
things you should know.
