00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,340
Well let's run mongod --help

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,590
again. We obviously got many many many settings here, the

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:14,080
settings at the bottom for example are related to wired tiger which is our storage engine

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,730
and there we can basically use the default settings, you can change some configuration there if you know

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,740
what you're doing

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,780
but in the scope of this course we'll not dive into configuring our storage engine but simply go with its

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,660
default settings.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,850
You also get useful commands like repair which is a great idea to run if you have any issues connecting

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:41,780
and see warnings or errors related to database files being corrupted or anything like that, directory

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:49,760
per db would be a setting you can add to not have a db folder with your collection files stored all

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,730
in the root folder

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:58,130
but instead they would be grouped in sub-folders with one sub-folder per database in your database environment

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,930
so to say.

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,700
So if you have four databases, you would have four sub-folders and every sub-folder would contain its collection

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:11,330
and index files, we'll dive into indexes later in the course by the way. You can also switch the storage

16
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,140
engine,

17
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,620
the default is wired tiger and you should really use that. Theoretically mongodb supports multiple

18
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,210
storage engines

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,800
but wired tiger is the default one is a high performant one is a really good storage engine,

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:33,200
so unless you really know what you're doing and you've got a strong reason to change it, you should not

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,310
change the storage engine. SSL configuration is something I'll come back to in the security and authentication

22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,460
module, so we can ignore this for now

23
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,990
The same is the case for sharding and replica sets, I'll touch on these options later in the course

24
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,140
and therefore, we're pretty much done.

25
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,870
One setting is worth talking about though and that's the fork setting or the fork option, what does this

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,320
do?
