00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.910
Let's go back to our flight data, let's quickly find all the flights here,

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.190
this is our flight data

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.890
and now let's say we want to store the status for a flight. For this, I'll  use my flight data and I'll update

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.090
many elements,

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.140
I'll pass an empty document as a filter to target them all

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.090
and then here, we have $set

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.210
and then how we want to change them

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.160
and now let's say we want to add a status field but that status is not something like on time which

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.930
you could use

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.460
but let's say this is another document.

11
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.950
So here another pair of curly braces,

12
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.330
so this is now a value we set for status which we add to our flight data.

13
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.730
And now here you can enter anything which you can have in a document, multiple key value pairs, even

14
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.250
other nested documents if you want.

15
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:08.200
So here we could have a description field which is on time and maybe last updated which is one hour ago,

16
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.390
if we now hit enter here,

17
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.390
it updated both documents because we had no filter

18
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.030
and if I now output my flight data in a pretty way, we see these nested documents here and this is what's

19
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.630
called embedded document,

20
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.940
I use nested and embedded interchangeably here.

21
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.960
So this is an embedded document,

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.110
it's another json document within a wrapping json document.

23
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.340
We got two documents in the collection and each of these documents has a child document

24
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.550
and as I said, inside of the status, you could have another nested document.

25
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:56.160
So if I would repeat my command here and add another value with maybe details, that could be another

26
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:04.580
nested document, so another pair of curly braces, maybe this has a responsible field and there, I put my name

27
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.260
in there.

28
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.600
If I now hit enter and I output all the flights again,

29
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.530
now we see another nested document in there,

30
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.770
so a nested document or an embedded document in an embedded document in a collection document.

31
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.250
So these are embedded documents

32
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.270
and now we also can have arrays of data.

33
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.130
Let's have a look at that in the next lecture.
