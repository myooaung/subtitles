00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.960
How do we authenticate in stitch?

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.670
Well for authentication, we can dive into stitch again and then under users in the stitch console, under

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.270
providers you see different ways of authenticating users.

4
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.580
You can use third party providers like Facebook or Google, you can manage your own e-mails and passwords

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.910
and you can even allow anonymous authentication

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.870
and that is what I will turn on now by simply switching that.

7
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.120
So now if I save that, people can log in anonymously

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.460
and I'll show you how that works

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.180
and we'll switch to real users later too.

10
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.620
So I want to log in anonymously,

11
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.840
how does that work?

12
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.420
Well for that, I'll go back to the app.js file, in there where I initialize my app client, here

13
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.060
I also can log in. For that, I'll simply store the client which will be returned by the initialize default app

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.490
client method, I'll store the client in a constant

15
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:06.310
and now for anonymous authentication, I need to import anonymous credential,

16
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.910
that is something I need to import here,

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.680
anonymous credential from the mongodb stitch browser sdk. With that imported here, we can call

18
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.280
client.auth to access the auth features of the stitch sdk

19
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.460
and then here, we can call log in with credential.

20
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.160
Now to this credential, we can pass different credentials and the credential then depends on the

21
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.730
authentication methods you want to use and you unlocked in your console,

22
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.520
so in my case I only unlocked anonymous authentication for now,

23
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.490
so here I will pass the new anonymous credential. And for anonymous credential, we don't need to pass anything

24
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.670
else,

25
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.740
we can just pass it like this and this will log us in anonymously.

26
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.370
If we now save that and we let our app reload,

27
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.040
you see we don't get this error anymore but I still get another error,

28
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.930
I get a stitch request error saying that unexpected token in json add something occured while decoding

29
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.780
a response from stitch.

30
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.270
Now this error is stemming from the products.js file, line forty five

31
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.260
and if we have a look at that file, we can quickly see well it's coming from this console log,

32
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.020
so we get an error when we try to fetch products.

33
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.370
Now we are authenticated and still we get an error and that is related to the rules we need to set

34
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.470
up for accessing our database

35
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.200
because as I mentioned, by default nothing is accessible,

36
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.550
everything is locked down and you have to inform stitch which user or which authenticated entity because

37
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.110
right now we have that anonymous authentication but we still have an authenticated entity there,

38
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.870
what kind of access is allowed there?
