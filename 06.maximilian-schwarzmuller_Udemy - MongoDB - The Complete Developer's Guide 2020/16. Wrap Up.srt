1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,070
That's it for this module,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,000
again we learned quite a lot,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,640
we had a detailed look at update one and update many. Update one and many can be used to update

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,210
guess what,

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,610
one or more documents in a collection.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,350
As a first argument, these methods take a filter, a query selector which narrows down which document or

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,130
documents to update

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,570
and then in the second argument, you can describe the update with the help of update operators, like

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,360
$set.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,610
Now I didn't dive into it in this module but I covered it earlier in this course,

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,130
there also is the option to entirely replace a document with the old update method, so not update one

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,660
or many but just update or with replace one,

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,920
so if you have a use case where you need to replace the entire document and just keep its ID, you can

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,750
do that too.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,420
Now back to the update operators though, you learned about a lot of different update operators for updating

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,540
the fields, with $set, inc, min and so on.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,050
Now if you work with arrays, you should definitely take advantage of the different shortcuts like $,

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:18,240
$[] or dollar with the identifier and then the array filters key or configuration

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,880
you add to the third argument of update many or update one, where you could also add upsert and so

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,780
on.

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,590
So this is something you should keep in mind

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:33,330
and of course use the array update operators like $push or $pop. This allow you

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,110
to efficiently add or remove elements to or from arrays.
