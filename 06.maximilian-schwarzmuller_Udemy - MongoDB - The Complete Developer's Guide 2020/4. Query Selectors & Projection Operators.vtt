00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.070
Now with that, let's dive into query selectors and projection operators, this is what we'll work with in

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.710
this module after all.

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.500
For query selectors, we got a couple of categories,

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.460
we got comparison, logical, element, evaluation,

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.100
array and comments selectors and I will talk about these different categories,

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.210
what's inside there and how they differ and how we use them in detail in this module of course.

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.140
We also get geospatial selectors which allow us to work with location data and for example, find

8
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.590
out which place is nearest to some coordinates we have and we'll cover that in a special module, the

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.300
geospatial module.

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.280
Now for projection, we got $elemMatch so $elemMatch and $meta and

11
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.300
$slice and that is also something we will cover in this module

12
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.220
when we talk about projection operators. $meta will not be covered in this module but in

13
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.960
a later module because it is related to indexes,

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.850
so this will be covered in the index module.

15
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.580
With that, enough of the theory,

16
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.600
let's dive in and let's start querying our data, use these operators, filters and all these fun things.
