00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:09.970
Now being able to push new values is nice but due to my little example, we now got some duplicate data

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:18.520
here, hiking and good wine is in there too often. We can of course also pull data from an array,

3
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.560
so what I can do here is I can again update one document and that will be Maria,

4
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.270
so name Maria but here, I

5
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.760
then don't use push

6
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:40.270
but pull. Now pull takes an object where I describe how I want to pull or what I want to pull and here

7
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.610
I can say from the hobbies array,

8
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.300
I want to pull based on a condition which I then specify here,

9
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.810
I want to pull every element where the title is equal to hiking

10
00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.540
let's say. With this command, if I now hit enter, you see one document was modified 

11
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.040
and if I now find all documents, we see Maria has no hiking in there.

12
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.320
So of course we can now repeat that with good wine to get rid of that too,

13
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.860
just like this

14
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.080
and of course you could not just search for equality here, you could use greater than, all these normal

15
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.890
filter operators you know,

16
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.250
so now the good wine was also removed from Maria.

17
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.360
Sometimes you also just want to remove the last element of an array,

18
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:35.460
so you have no specific filter criteria, you just want to remove the last element. For that, let's mix

19
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.810
it up and let's update a document where the name is Chris and for Chris, you see the last element

20
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.550
is hiking,

21
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.440
so let's say we want to remove that and we can do that with the

22
00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.620
$pop operator here. You then simply define the name of the field of which you want to pop, hobbies

23
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.380
for example.

24
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.800
Now the value here defines if you want to remove the last element, that would be done if you add one

25
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.220
here

26
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.780
or if you actually want to pop off the first element which you could do with -1.

27
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.760
So let's do one, it modified one document

28
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.210
and if I find all users, you'll see that for Chris,

29
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.550
indeed there are only two hobbies and hiking which we previously had with a frequency of zero is gone.

30
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.730
So that is pop which is great if you want to remove the first or last item of an array.
