00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.580
Now to get started with the aggregation pipeline,

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.590
we need some data and I will use our persons data again,

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.290
you'll find it attached to this video one more time.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.840
We'll import it with mongo import and you should make sure that you run this command in the folder where

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.460
you store your persons.json file so that you can simply enter the file name and you're good to go

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.270
and then I'll store it in a database which I'll name analytics,

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.810
the name is of course up to you

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.840
and then a collection which I'll name persons.

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.260
I will also add the json array flag here, that is required because the persons.json file has an array

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.490
of documents. With that, I can now hit enter and this should import 5000 documents into the database.

11
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.970
Now let's connect to the database with our shell

12
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.370
and there, let's use our analytics database where we should see our persons collection.

13
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.970
Now just to bring this back in memory, a person looks like this,

14
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.220
we get quite a lot of data on a person including things like some dummy location and this is all random

15
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.180
data, just to stress this again,

16
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.420
so some dummy location, the age and some other data as you can see here.

17
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.800
Now let's see how we can use the aggregate framework on this.
