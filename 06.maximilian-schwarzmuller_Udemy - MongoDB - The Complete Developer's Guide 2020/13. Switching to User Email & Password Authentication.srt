1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,640
So time to work on authentication

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,680
and for this first of all, we can go to the app.js file and set the default auth mode to false.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,070
Now if everything reloads, we start on the login page and I want to start there

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,820
so that we can switch to sign up and create users and then log in with these users. Now stitch offers us

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,260
a simple way of adding real user authentication

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,660
and for that, we just have to go back to users and under providers,

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:39,640
we can now disable anonymous login and save that and instead turn on email password login,

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:48,090
so we enable this. Now email password login ships with confirmation and password resetting built-in,

9
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,560
now I'll not show the password reset part,

10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,790
you can learn all about that in the official docs,

11
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,730
it's really easy

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,890
but we need to enable e-mail confirmation so that anything works.

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,810
So for this, users should receive an email where they are forwarded to

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,180
localhost 3000 confirm account and you need to get that right.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,170
Your react app will run on this host if you deploy it onto a real server,

16
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,090
you should of course update this

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,630
and this is a page which I prepared, a route which I prepared which we then can work on to confirm the

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,410
account with stitch.

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,080
Now this last field here is optional,

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,150
you could enter the subject for the confirmation email as is this field.

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,960
This field is required and I will enter something there but this will not work.

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,020
Right, so this is not a route I added,

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,360
you could as a challenge do this on your own,

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,790
I don't need resetting in my app, I want to have or I need to have confirmation though.

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,090
So now let's save this

26
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,260
and now we enabled this user email authentication.

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,290
How do we now use that in our app?
