1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,170
You did it, you completed this course and you therefore should now be well prepared to work with

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,660
mongodb in your next projects.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,370
I hope you learned a lot about mongodb, the many features it offers, both for the database and now

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:22,210
towards the end with stitch, even outside of its core product, even outside of the database

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,740
and I hope that all the knowledge you gained here gives you everything you need to play around with it,

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,730
to dive deeper into mongodb and to use it of course in your projects. And I can really only encourage

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,670
you to play around, use the shell as a playground as we did it in this course basically, create a local

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,630
mongo instance and try out different things, insert data in different ways, update and delete it and then

9
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:54,340
try out all the different queries you have for narrowing down your data. Use indexes and measure their

10
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,150
performance,

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,390
use all these tools,

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:02,450
all these things I taught you in this course. And of course don't just try it in the shell, also build dummy

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,340
and demo apps that use mongodb, build a mobile app that uses

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,790
mongodb

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,030
or a web app using react or angular or a normal node app that renders its views or with PHP or with Python

16
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,350
or a desktop app, whatever it is,

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:23,750
build apps and use mongodb as your database. Possibly also use mongodb and stitch to not just work

18
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,850
with the database but also add user authentication and your server side code through stitch if you want.

19
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,560
So this is the practice practice practice part which is super important and which you have to do to

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,510
become a real expert with mongodb. Now which other resources besides this course can I recommend?

21
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,630
Well obviously dive into the official docs, they are

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,600
really good

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,350
and you can learn a lot there.

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,970
You find a detailed reference for every single operator, you find detailed docs on stitch, on the shell,

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,850
on how to set up sharding if you want to do that on your own,

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,710
so that's all in the official docs, definitely check these out.

27
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,810
Of course also dive into Stack Overflow for discussions or questions that are beyond the scope of this

28
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,710
course,

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,390
also dive into blogposts, google for problems you encounter and chances are you'll find a stack overflow

30
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:24,140
thread or an article in some blog that provides a guide on how to solve that or how other people tackled

31
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,780
something,

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:32,230
this is great to build an understanding of available patterns and best practices. And also use YouTube

33
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,100
and other courses to learn more about specific topics.

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,870
Want to learn more about stitch?

35
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,000
Check out stitch courses or YouTube videos.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Want to learn more about sharding?

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,650
Well take a database admin, a system admin course on mongodb.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,660
So these are the other resources I can recommend to you

39
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,010
and with these two building blocks, practicing and knowing the right resources as well of course with

40
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,950
all the knowledge gained in this course,

41
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm very confident that you are on the right way to becoming a mongodb expert and use it to its

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,430
fullest potential in your upcoming projects.
