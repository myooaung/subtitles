00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.780
Now before we continue with other operators, one more word about $set,

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.300
I only used it to change one field at a time.

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.450
Now Chris can still need some work,

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.490
we can add a phone number and an age,

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.350
so again I will take the objectId of Chris and then I will use update one again

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.520
and of course by the way, I could also use update many even if I know only one document will be affected

7
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.800
but update one is clearer about my intention

8
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.610
and since I filter for the ID,

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.510
it's pretty clear that there will be only one document that matches.

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.100
So I filter for Chris here essentially and I use $set again to describe the changes to that document

11
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:53.440
and now here, I will actually change multiple fields, so I will set the age to let's say 40 and I will

12
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.840
set the phone number to some random number, like this. If I now hit enter,

13
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.520
you'll see again

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.980
we found one document, we updated one document,

15
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.380
if I have a look at all my documents, you see age and phone was added to Chris now.

16
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.170
So $set is of course not limited to updating only one field,

17
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.480
it can update as much as you want on the document.

18
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.940
It can add arrays as you saw previously with the hobbies array,

19
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.130
it can add embedded documents as you saw with documents in the array,

20
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.730
of course it can also add embedded documents outside of arrays,

21
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.470
so it gives you the full flexibility

22
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.540
you also have in your inserting documents, just that it either adds a field or simply, well edits it.
