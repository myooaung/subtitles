00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.900
Now I talked a lot about replica sets, sharding and that we'll see something about that when we deploy

2
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.520
our mongodb server,

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.300
now it's finally time to do this.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.370
We want to get our localhost mongod instance into the web,

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.060
so we want to get it on a server that we can reach from anywhere and not only from well our inside our

6
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.530
computer. Now deploying a mongodb server is a complex task,

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.420
it's definitely more complex than just deploying a website because you need to do a lot of things,

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.550
a lot of configuration. You need to manage shards if you want to have sharding,

9
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.390
you need to manage your replica sets, you have to set up user authentication and with that, I mean authentication

10
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.250
to the database, not users

11
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.860
your application, your website might be using. You need to protect the web server and the network which

12
00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.910
is now totally unrelated to mongodb but a general web hosting task. You need to ensure that software

13
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.840
stays up to date,

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.760
general server software but also of course mongodb related software, that security

15
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.220
patches are applied. You want to set up regular backups for your data,

16
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.130
you might have replica sets and still backing up data to a disk might be an additional good idea in

17
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.340
case that everything goes down. And you also want to worry about encryption, both during transportation

18
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.930
and at rest.

19
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.540
So there are a lot of complex tasks that you have to manage when deploying this and I'll be very honest

20
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.250
with you, this is beyond the scope of most developers and beyond my scope too, I'm not a system administrator.

21
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.580
Therefore in this module, I'll show you a managed solution, mongodb atlas is a service provided by mongodb,

22
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.090
by the company behind mongodb

23
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.900
that gives you a scalable and best practice mongodb server running in the cloud which you can

24
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.760
configure through a convenient interface and which you can scale up, scale down.

25
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.560
There is a free tier available, so you can start for free even and it gives you all these things I mentioned

26
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.770
on the last slide automatically,

27
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.770
so it does all of that for you so that you don't have to worry about that.

28
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.090
So let's now take a look at mongodb atlas and let's see how we can deploy a

29
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.960
mongodb server there and how we then can connect to it.
