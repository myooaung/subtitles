1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,110
Now let's import some data

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:10,210
and for that, you need to exit the shell which you can do by hitting control C because you need to go

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,750
back into your normal terminal mode on your operating system.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,870
Then you should navigate to a folder where you find the file, the json file

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,940
you want to import, json files can be imported and attached to this video, you find a dummy file with

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,040
which we'll work.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:33,130
So make sure to download that file into a folder and then with the cd command, navigate into that folder

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,760
in your terminal, so in the folder where you stored that attached file.

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,230
I already am in such a folder, now in there,

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,780
you see I got a couple of files, we'll work with the tv-shows.json file which is the one you found the

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,220
attached and we can now import it with the Mongo import command.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,780
This should be globally available

13
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:57,500
since you added the path to your Mongo binaries to your path variables on your operating system.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,930
If you did not do that, you need to navigate into that folder where your binaries are, where mongod

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,000
and so on are, where you also find mongo import and then you can execute this

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,810
and then the first argument you pass here is the name of the file you want to import.

17
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,780
Now if you're not in that same folder as the file, you'll have to specify a full path on your operating

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,530
system,

19
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,130
since I am in the same folder, I can just specify the filename.

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,700
Then we can specify into which database you want to import that data

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,750
and here, I'll have my movie data database which should be created on the fly,

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,250
you specify the database with the -d command.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,560
You can also specify or you should specify into which collection you want to import your data then,

24
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,170
so in the movie data database, I want to import it into the movies collection and in the movies collection,

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,620
there all these documents should be added.

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,240
Now tv-shows.json happens to hold an array of documents, not just one document,

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,880
so you also should specify --jsonarray to make the mongo import command aware of this because

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,380
you could also use it to import just one document which is the default

29
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,150
it looks for, now with this we tell it hey there are multiple documents in that file.

30
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,340
Now the last thing I'll add is --drop,

31
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,620
this simply means if this collection should already exist, it will be dropped and then re-added

32
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,110
otherwise it we'll append the data to the existing collection and that might also be what you want

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,910
but here, I don't have the collection yet but if I had it, it would delete the old one and re-import the

34
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,270
data into the newly created one.

35
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:35,210
With that if I hit enter, it should connect to your running mongod process, so that still needs to be running,

36
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,810
it drops movie data movies if that existed

37
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,880
and then you see it imported 240 documents. And now we can fire up that shell again

38
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,130
and there, if I

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,710
have a look at my databases,

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,740
we see the movie data,

41
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:57,350
I can then switch to movie data and there, we should see a movies collection and if we quickly have a look

42
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,480
at that with find pretty, you will see a bunch of data in there.

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,300
Now here we have more than 20 records

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,270
which is why I have this output here and I'll come back to cursors in the next module by the way

45
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:17,210
but you see here we got some movie data for some series basically like supernatural, so series you

46
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,500
can watch on TV,

47
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,150
well we got some data on them here. So this is the data we'll also work with in the next module and Mongo

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,900
import of course is a helpful tool for getting data you want to start with

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,180
or you will have from an older database or whatever into your database in collection.
