00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,180
Thus far we already worked a bit with our data in mongodb and we always work with it from inside the

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,790
shell, that is also where we will stay in this course since you're a developer and you'll write code

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,540
and we do write code in the shell.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:21,950
But from time to time, you might want to peek into your database in a graphical user interface and mongodb

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,500
compass is such a graphical user interface which you can use. In this module,

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,980
I'll show you how to use mongodb compass, how to use it to insert data, to update and delete data

7
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,290
and of course how to view it and get a feeling for your data.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,690
Of course you can not just use the insert new data,

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,000
you could also open a database server where you have a couple of databases with data in there already,

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,460
that would work too.

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,630
So let's dive into mongodb

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,630
compass then.
