00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.430
So for this course, we will primally work in this shell, to see all the commands and the different ways

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.640
of using these commands because the shell is a great neutral ground for working with mongodb

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.500
because I don't know if you're building a php, a node, a C++, a python or whatever application

4
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.880
and I want to teach you something which you can apply to all use cases and that is the case with the

5
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.100
shell but of course in the end, you will build an application with a programming language where this

6
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.930
app should then issue these commands against the mongodb server. And for that, you can click

7
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.830
on docs on the official page and then on the doc page, click on mongodb drivers because these

8
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.540
drivers are packages you installed for the different programming languages your app might be written in,

9
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.800
as you see you got drivers for all kinds of languages and these drivers are then your bridges between

10
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.770
your programming language and the mongodb server

11
00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.010
and as it turns out, in these drivers, you use the same commands as I use in the shell, just adjusted to the

12
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.590
syntax of the language you are working with of course.

13
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.040
So for example, if we have a look at the nodejs driver and the python driver, let's see how we would

14
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.550
work with those. On the nodejs driver documentation, if we click on latest documentation,

15
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.390
we can quickly have a look at the quick start guide to see how our code would look like, if we use that, you

16
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.700
see how to start your mongodb database and so on

17
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.940
and what you will see there is that here, you also in the end just reach out to a database,

18
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.070
then instead of typing the collection name, you have a collection method to get access but you would

19
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.460
look into the official docs

20
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.900
of course when using the driver, so these are tiny differences which you quickly find out there

21
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.330
but then on the collection, you again run insertMany, we haven't seen that yet,

22
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.220
we'll see it in the course, this exists in the shell in exactly the same way and you insert data in exactly

23
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.020
the same way.

24
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.790
So these, the core features are exactly equal,

25
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.810
let's also have a look at python to prove that. Here I'm on the python driver page,

26
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.900
now let me quickly dive into the tutorial,

27
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.370
so that we see some code for that.

28
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.330
So here, you see for python, you would install a package called py mongo which is the official driver

29
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.360
for python,

30
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.310
you then connect and so on

31
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.590
and again, you in the end just get access to a database, then to a collection, here again by just using

32
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.180
that collection name

33
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.020
and then you simply insert one now using python syntax where you happen to write methods like this with

34
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.660
an underscore and this snake case but then you insert one post which is just such an object,

35
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.600
python map in the end.

36
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.920
So you see, the syntax of the languages obviously differs because well, they are different languages

37
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.970
but the general way of working with your data does not change at all,

38
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.290
you work in exactly the same way as in the shell

39
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.800
and actually, this is something we'll build later in the course. This is a complete node application using

40
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.160
mongodb and here,

41
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.440
you also see some code in action where I insert a new product

42
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.590
and this is something we'll build in the course so that I can teach you how to move from the shell

43
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.610
to the drivers

44
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.110
but I hope this makes clear why we work with the shell,

45
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.530
it's the neutral ground on which we all can agree so that you can take that knowledge on how to insert,

46
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.840
how to configure your inserts, how to query data, how to filter data, how to sort data, so that you can

47
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.880
use that knowledge with any driver you want and you are really flexible regarding what you built.
