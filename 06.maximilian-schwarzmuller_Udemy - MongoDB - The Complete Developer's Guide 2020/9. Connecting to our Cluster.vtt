00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.370
With my cluster up and running, we can now work with the cluster. On the cluster here, we get a couple

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.670
of options to migrate data into the cluster for example, to pause it, to terminate it,

3
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.130
you can check out general metrics about your cluster and see all kinds of information of what happened

4
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.010
on your cluster, how many reads you had and so on,

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.510
you can also dive into the collections your cluster has,

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.590
so you see databases and the collections in the cluster and some of these options might only be available

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.600
outside of the free tier by the way,

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.920
so I'll not dive too deep into that,

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.150
definitely just click around there and play around.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.790
For now, the interesting part is how can we connect to the cluster

11
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.870
and for this we can click on the overview page, we can click on connect here. Now

12
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.660
there you see the IP addresses that will be able to connect and you can also add an entry from here

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.240
but that's the same list we had on the IP whitelist page earlier

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.190
and then you should choose your way of connecting.

15
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.500
Now I will go with the shell, in another module in this course later we'll of course also connect from an application

16
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:11.400
so that we can really use that in an app as it could run on a real server, so I'll connect with mongodb

17
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.250
shell.

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.370
Now you can follow the instructions here for your operating system, download the shell of course,

19
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.160
we already have it

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.100
so you can skip that step and then connect with this command here.

21
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.520
So you should be able to just copy that command,

22
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.240
you'll need your password, so make sure you also have that saved somewhere,

23
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.810
copy that command here

24
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.100
and now let's switch to the shell again.

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.130
Now first of all you need to quit a running shell,

26
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.980
you can also quit a running mongod instance on your computer,

27
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.540
you don't need to run a server anymore,

28
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.090
we have one in the web now.

29
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.590
And now to connect to the mongodb cluster,

30
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.640
you can insert a command you just copied

31
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.720
and the important thing here is that we have now

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.060
mongo still

33
00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.540
but then we have this path here and this ensures that mongo does not try to connect to a locally running

34
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.900
mongodb server which would be its default behavior but that it instead tries to reach a server

35
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.120
at this address.

36
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.210
/tests here by the way defines the default database to which you connect,

37
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.020
so you can change this if you want, so you can also set

38
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.910
I want to connect to

39
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.660
let's say /products here.

40
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.700
You then need to add your username with --username and you can hit enter and you should be prompted

41
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.330
for your password then.

42
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.360
Now make sure you now enter the password you chose when creating the user with which you were trying

43
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.680
to log in

44
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.460
and it should then connect to your mongodb server running in the cloud,

45
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.450
so I'm now connected to this cloud.

46
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.480
If I show my dbs, we again is the admin config local there and now of course, I should already be in products

47
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.000
but we can also use that again or use shop maybe and then there, use db products

48
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:09.530
insert one and there I can enter a book and a price and if I hit enter, this is now inserted and everything here works

49
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.910
as you learned it in the course. This does not differ, it's a normal mongodb server in the end,

50
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.510
just one running in the cloud and not running on your computer and you can interact with it as you

51
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.560
did with your local server but now, you've got a perfectly configured, highly performant mongodb

52
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.120
server deployed in the cloud

53
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.710
and since it's in the cloud now, so on a server and not on your local host,

54
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.060
you can now use it from anywhere and not just your local machine.
