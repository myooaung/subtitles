00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.080
You could create an entire course just on stitch because it really is a complete different offering   

2
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.430
in addition to the mongodb database world.

3
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.970
This course of course is about the database which is why I only wanted to give a brief introduction

4
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:24.100
to stitch. Stitch really helps you build complete applications with everything you need, authentication

5
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.850
server side logic, even file storage

6
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.160
if you use a service like S3 then and of course, you have the entire mongo database, the entire database

7
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.540
world which you learned about in this course at your disposal too.

8
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.030
So if you're building modern applications and you want to focus on your code, on your logic, then using

9
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.910
a solution like stitch together with all the power and the cool features mongodb, the database gives you

10
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.080
is really a great approach that allows you to build amazing applications quickly.
