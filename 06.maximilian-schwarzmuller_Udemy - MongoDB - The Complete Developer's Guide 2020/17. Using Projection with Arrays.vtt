00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.110
Time for more interesting projections but now projections that work with arrays or are related to arrays.

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.370
I'll stick to my friends dataset for this,

3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.420
so let's quickly peek into it and let's work with the exam scores

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.530
now. Let's say you only want to output the first value of that array instead of all the exam scores,

5
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.330
so it's time for a projection of course.

6
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.910
So let's add a project phase here and in projection,

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:40.880
I'm not interested in the ID but I'm very interested in my exam score and I'll name it exam score

8
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.480
and not scores because I'll only output 1.

9
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.530
Now to output one, there is a helpful operator and this is of course the main thing I want to show you here,

10
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.000
the slice operator. The slice operator allows you to get back the slice of an array,

11
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.700
so how does the slice operator work?

12
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.230
It takes an array itself,

13
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.180
the first value is the array you want to slice and you could hardcode an array in here, that would be

14
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.480
possible but of course I will point onto a field with $examscores,

15
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.400
so I'm essentially pointing at this field. And now I only want to get the first element and for this, I

16
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.770
pass one as the second argument because slice takes in its basic form two arguments, the array and the

17
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.780
amount of elements you want to get out of the array

18
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.420
seen from the start.

19
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.550
So here with this, if I take this command and I execute it, you see now I only have my exam score or one

20
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.440
exam score per user and that is the first exam score, we can validate this with the last user,

21
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.440
the first one should be difficulty three and score 75.1

22
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.950
and that is the case here to. Now

23
00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.430
sometimes you want to you have let's say the last two, for this you can actually use a negative value

24
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.910
here, -2 because then we'll start at the end,

25
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.490
if I now paste this in, you see I get the last two scores per user,

26
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:20.620
so this also works or you want to get one element but starting at the second element, then you could

27
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.300
also use a different syntax with three elements in the array,

28
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.500
two and then one. This means start at position two and then give me one element and if I now execute

29
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.550
this, you see I get back some exam scores and which scores added,

30
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.130
well these are the last scores because indexes are zero based,

31
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.860
so if I start at two, I will skip 0 and 1,

32
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.210
so the first two elements, I start at the last element

33
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.300
therefore and then I take one element,

34
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.250
so I get back the last element.

35
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.510
So these are the different ways of using slice and that can be very helpful for transforming an array

36
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.750
or getting just the values of an array

37
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.270
you need.
