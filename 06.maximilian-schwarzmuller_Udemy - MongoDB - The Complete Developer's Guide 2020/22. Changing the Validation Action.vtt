00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.660
So validation works and it didn't add our incorrect post,

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.960
now let's play around with the additional settings we can set which I already showed on my slides. For

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.670
the settings to activate,

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.110
I would need to create my collection again and set up the validation again,

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.920
the problem is I of course already have my validation turned on here,

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.850
so what can I do? As a database administrator

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.160
and this is how you would add such settings like validation,

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.940
you can use db.runCommand in the shell here to run, well administrative command.

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.940
You pass a document with information about the command

10
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.570
and here, the command is that we set a collMod, that stands for collection modifier and we define the collection

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.470
which we do want to modify, posts

12
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.780
in my case and then we can again pass a validator.

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.860
So now we can pass exactly what we pass to create collection, so we pass validator and then the entire

14
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.720
schema below that,

15
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.770
so make sure to grab that portion of the file, go back to the shell. Now important, remove the closing

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.910
parentheses, add a comma and paste in what you just copied and then add another closing curly brace

17
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.540
and a closing parentheses

18
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.110
but we're not done here.

19
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.450
If I hit enter like this of course,

20
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.640
it works but now I just set the same validation again.

21
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.810
What I instead want to do is I want to change my validation settings, so I'll add a new file

22
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.660
which you also find attached to this video then in the finished form where I copy my create collection code

23
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.620
into.

24
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.920
Now here, we will have run command as you just saw, then we pass our opening curly brace,

25
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.220
collMod then holds the name of the collection we want to edit and then I need to remove that curly

26
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.970
brace here, can reformat.

27
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.220
This is now the command

28
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.560
and now here I got my validator

29
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.940
but now, I also want to switch an additional setting.

30
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.670
Now let's search for the closing parentheses of validator because we need to set our validator configuration

31
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.290
as a sibling to that validator

32
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.570
key here.

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.740
So for my ID, it comes in and highlights this, after this we can add validation level to control whether

34
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.330
all inserts and updates are checked or only updates to elements which were valid before

35
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.040
but I want to set a validation action here.

36
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.420
The default is error which blocks the action and throws an error,

37
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.380
I'll set it to warn. Let's copy that entire code,

38
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.690
again you'll find it attached to this lecture and execute it here, should be successful.

39
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.240
And now if I again tried to insert one post with my author being well or having a value of 12, which

40
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.410
is not an objectId, this actually succeeds

41
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.920
and the only thing it did is it will have written a warning into our log file and the log file is stored

42
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.960
on our system,

43
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.570
we'll have a look at this later lecture when we talk about configuring our server and so on.

44
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.270
So this is the difference,

45
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.920
now what you want to use here depends on your application and your requirements there.

46
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.640
It's good to know that you can configure these things and putting validation in place can make a lot

47
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.450
of sense depending on how your application works, how important it is for you to have one consistent

48
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.930
scheme of data and you also now saw that you can define that validation schema when you create the

49
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.940
collection or also thereafter with the help of run command.
