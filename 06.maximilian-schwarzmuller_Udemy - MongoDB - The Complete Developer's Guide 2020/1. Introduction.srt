Welcome onboard of this course, I am really happy to see that you join this course. Mongodb

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:14,260
is an exciting technology, an exciting database solution and even more than just a database solution

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,790
as you will learn throughout this course and you can use it in basically any project you're building.

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,360
If that's a website, a mobile app, a desktop app or if you're working as a data scientist, you're probably

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,050
working with some kind of data,

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,260
you need to store data,

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,360
you need to fetch data and you need to do all of that fast and efficiently without worrying too much

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,600
about database configuration, setup and data structures and mongodb is an awesome solution for

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,150
that.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:48,320
In this course, I'll thoroughly walk you through mongodb and teach you everything you as a developer need

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,960
to know.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,650
I'll teach you how to use mongodb, how to structure your data there, how you can depict relations

13
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,010
in a

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:01,340
mongodb world, how you can do configurations on your database and most importantly, how you can perform

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,750
efficient and powerful crud operations with mongodb in a broad variety of ways.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,640
This is a very comprehensive course on mongodb and I'm super excited to dive into it with you.

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,730
Now who am I?

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,510
My name is Maximillian Schwarzmuller,

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,850
I'm a freelance web developer and 5 star rated instructor here on Udemy.

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,380
I got a lot of courses and I got courses as well as free YouTube videos on my channel, Academind

21
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,820
where I do already use mongodb

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,820
but the complete course on it was missing and since it's such an awesome technology and such an awesome

23
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:41,360
database, it was about time to dive into it so that you can become a true mongodb master.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,060
Now this is a hands-on approach course, that means there will be slides, there will be theory because

25
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,310
you always need that but most importantly, there will be a lot of working with mongodb

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,280
or I work with mongodb and you can work with mongodb whilst following along in the videos.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,060
So that should be a lot of fun,

28
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,060
now let's dive into the course and let's start with the most important question,

29
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,550
what is mongodb?
