00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.350
So with all that talking in theory, we all want to get started,

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.690
so what's in this course? In this course,

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.290
we're almost done with the introduction and we'll then move onto the basics of mongodb basic

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.190
operations and most importantly, the basic crud operations, crud stands for create, read, update and delete

5
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.790
which are the core operations

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.480
basically any application will have to do. If you're a newcomer to mongodb,

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.250
you should absolutely start there,

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.780
well you start here but then this is the first real content module with which you should start.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780
After that, we'll have a look at data schemas and relations,

10
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.430
how do you model your data,

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.430
how do you find the right balance between having that flexible document schema and still using a schema

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.150
in your app,

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.370
how do you relate different documents,

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.920
we'll have a look at that in this module.

15
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.220
Thereafter I'll dive a bit deeper into working with the shell,

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.280
some different things you can configure there and how you can for example run that mongod server as a

17
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.550
service on Mac and Linux. And we'll then have a look at the graphical user interface, Compass, we'll not really

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.970
work with that throughout the course

19
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.640
but I still want you to know it and to understand that you can use that to look into your data.

20
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.050
Now after that, we're back to the shell and we'll dive deeper into create operations,

21
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.200
that is where you can start if you have some basic understanding,

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.240
so if you're not a total newcomer but you know basically what mongodb does, you could skip the other

23
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.730
modules if you want and dive into that. And we'll not just have a deep dive on the sea of the crud,

24
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.030
we'll also have a deep dive at reading,

25
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.640
so filtering and querying data and updating and deleting data,

26
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.120
so a lot of deep dives there to show you all configuration options, all filters and all the different

27
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.730
ways of getting that data you need.

28
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.740
Now thereafter we'll have a look at indexes, a feature that allows you to speed up your queries,

29
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.580
I'll talk about the advantages and disadvantages and how to use them.

30
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.710
If you're an advanced user and you know all that crud stuff already, this might be the entry point you

31
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.260
want to use,

32
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.530
so you could skip forward to that if you're pretty confident that the rest will be boring to you. Now after

33
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.340
indexes, we'll work with geospatial data because mongodb is actually really great at storing

34
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.670
locations and at querying that so that you can do things like I am here which is the closest restaurant,

35
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.980
that is really easy to do with mongodb as you will learn in this module. Now

36
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.170
thereafter we'll have a look at the aggregation framework which is a more powerful way of retrieving

37
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.290
data from your database and you learn how you can use that and how you can build complex aggregation

38
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.250
pipelines with the help of mongodb.

39
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.270
It's then time to work into a special kind of data, into numeric data,

40
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.720
I will teach you how to work with different kinds of numbers and what's special about that

41
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.990
in mongodb. Well and with that out of the way and with these core features covered, I'll dive into

42
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.740
a crucial feature, security and authentication.

43
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.600
How do you secure your mongo database, what's to that and how can users authenticate against it and with

44
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.080
users,

45
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.350
I mean database users,

46
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.490
so for example your application or you as a real person using the shell. Thereafter, we'll have a look

47
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.000
at performance, fault tolerance and deployments,

48
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.860
so how can you improve the performance,

49
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.190
what are important factors and how do you in the end get your local mongodb environment into the

50
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.830
web, into the cloud so that you can really use it from anywhere and not just from your local machine

51
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.820
which is great for practicing and for working or for developing but not really for running this in

52
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.740
production obviously.

53
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.990
Thereafter, we'll have a look at a cool feature called transactions which was added with mongodb

54
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.620
4.0 and we will learn how to move from the shell, so from the knowledge you gained with all the shell

55
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.460
operations to the drivers and we will build an entire application there, a node react application and

56
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.520
you don't need to know either to get a lot out of that module to learn how you can use the driver,

57
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.270
the node driver in this case and use the knowledge you gained

58
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.140
in the course to quickly create an amazing application.

59
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.270
Thereafter, I will conclude this course by diving into mongodb stitch which is this other offering

60
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.740
mongodb has with the serverless functions, the triggers and so on,

61
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.650
you will learn how you can use that to build together with the mongodb database a complete application

62
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.880
where you focus entirely on your business logic and data and you don't have to worry about creating

63
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.170
rest

64
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.890
APIs,

65
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.720
configuring service or anything like that.

66
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.600
So this is what's inside the course,

67
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.560
I hope you like it and I'm super excited to dive into it with you.
