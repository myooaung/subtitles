00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.080
Now you might remember that earlier when we created an index, it seemed like there already was an index.

2
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:15.850
Now we can always see all indexes that exist for a collection by using get indexes on the collection,

3
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.380
so db contacts get indexes in our case here and this gives us some information about the indexes that

4
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.060
we do have there.

5
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.680
And as you can see, we got two indexes on contacts,

6
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.990
the first one is actually one on the ID field and this is a default index mongodb maintains for

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.740
you and then come your own indexes but you have this default index out of the box for every collection

8
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.760
you create and therefore this is an index that will always be maintained by mongodb here automatically.

9
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.520
And this means that if you are filtering for ID or sorting by ID which is then the default sort order

10
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.900
or the order by which the documents are fetched, you utilize the index for that at least.
