1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:09,660
In the shell you can run show dbs to see which databases you have on this mongodb server

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,520
and as you can see, as I'm just starting out, I got no databases in there,

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,100
you might even just see admin and config here

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,440
if this is brand new

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,150
but that will be fine too,

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,740
you don't need to create any of these default databases.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,390
The default databases here simply exist to store configuration for this database server

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,790
or for example the admin database will allow you to create users and roles and how people can use and

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,390
interact with the database,

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,660
all topics we'll cover later in the course.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,870
So we got no database in here, we can switch to a database with the use command though and you can even

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,420
switch to databases which don't exist yet,

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,990
so for example here I want to start with some flight data, so I'll name it flights and you can choose

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,150
any name you want.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,100
If you hit enter, you see that we switched to the db flights

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,450
but if I type show dbs, we still don't see that

17
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,440
even though I did switch to it.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,220
The reason for this is that this database does not get created before we start entering data in there

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,330
but if we do start entering data, it will be created automatically and implicitly,

20
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,780
so we don't have to create the database in advance.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,990
Now as you learned on that slide, we store data in collections, so we don't just need access to that database

22
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,820
but also to a collection.

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:32,690
Now we get our flights database and in there, let's say we want to store some flight data.

24
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,680
You can reference the database you're currently in,

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,470
so in our case the flights database here with db and then you chain commands by typing a dot and then

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,950
the command and one command in quotation marks is that

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,720
we type the name of a collection we want to interact with.

28
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,030
Let's say we have a flight data collection named like this and this name is also up to you,

29
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,630
now this is a collection which also doesn't exist yet

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,200
but just like a database, it will be created on demand

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,180
once we start inserting data. Now to insert data, we type another dot

32
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,210
and now we can type some query commands, commands that allow us to get data out of the collection would

33
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,610
be higher right now because there is no data in it or commands that allow us to add data and there we

34
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,940
got the insertOne command for example. As the name suggests, this inserts one document into this collection.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,090
Now important, make sure you've got the casing and the name in general correct,

36
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,420
you don't have a typo in there,

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,450
it's one word with a capital O

38
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,920
and now between these parentheses at the end here, we pass the data we want to store.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,970
Now a document is always defined with curly braces,

40
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,270
if you're coming from a javascript world,

41
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,000
you will know this syntax, there you also create objects with curly braces. To be very precise,

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,840
we're not creating a javascript object here but a json document and json documents are also delimited

43
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,390
or surrounded by curly braces.

44
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,570
Now in that document, we now have key value pairs,

45
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,810
now let's inspect how that looks like and how that works

46
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,670
before we finally add our data.
