00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.290
We saw how we can insert, update and delete things in the last lecture and therefore our flight data are

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.720
now is empty as we can confirm if we run find, nothing is returned.

3
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.720
Now time to add something again

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.370
and there was this file you found attached earlier,

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.110
you can find it attached again to this lecture.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.630
It holds an array of json documents and now I want to use the entire array,

7
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.490
so make sure to copy the entire file content and then back in the shell,

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:39.100
let's again access our flight data and use insertMany now. insertMany now allows you well as the name suggests,

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.360
to insert many elements and this is actually not done by adding many elements separated by commas but

10
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.990
instead by passing an array,

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.210
so exactly the kind of data we got.

12
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.240
Let's delete the closing parentheses and paste that in

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.980
and then add the closing parentheses after the closing square brackets. And with that if you now hit enter,

14
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.900
you see

15
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.700
this was accepted and it inserted two IDs

16
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.790
and there you also see this order,

17
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.160
it automatically keeps which I mentioned. It's almost the same ID but the second ID has a c at the

18
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.410
end and therefore, it will be ordered after the first element which makes sense because it was the second

19
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.420
element inserted

20
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.030
so mongodb keeps the order here. And now if we again access our flight data and find it all and pretty

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.770
print it,

22
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.930
here is our flight data with the automatically added IDs.

23
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.860
So this is now insertMany and now you saw both, insertOne and insertMany,

24
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.530
you also saw updateOne and updateMany and deleteOne and deleteMany.

25
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.730
There is another thing I want to show you though and that is related to finding data.
