00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.950
So that's it for this module,

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.690
I hope this showed you how you can add

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.710
mongodb to a basic application,

4
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.430
in this case with the mongodb node driver.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.890
Can you improve that application? For sure

6
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.760
but it's not so much about the app but about how you connect to mongodb, how you manage that connection

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.720
efficiently

8
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.450
and most importantly, how you perform your crud operations and which kind of operation you would not

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.230
perform here,

10
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.100
for example creating indexes. You also saw that it's perfectly fine and what you should do to dive into

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.690
the official driver docs and find out how to use that driver, how to create a decimal 128 bit object,

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.870
how to create an integer 32. Definitely use the docs,

13
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.070
use the knowledge gained in that course because as you saw for inserting, finding and so on, all these operators,

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.190
all the logic is the same,

15
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.780
that is exactly what you learned in this course.

16
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.170
So with the knowledge taught in this course, the official driver docs and this module here, you hopefully

17
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.780
now have all building blocks you need to build amazing mongodb based applications.
