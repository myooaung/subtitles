00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.420
So let's take a break from the theory now and let's simply get started.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.490
Let's install mongodb

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.720
locally for now

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.550
and let's connect to it and see how we can work with it.

5
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.550
Now mongodb runs on all operating systems,

6
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.470
Mac, Linux, Windows, on all three operating systems,

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.760
you can go to mongodb.com and on that page, click on get

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.640
mongodb in the top right corner, that will allow you to download the mongodb installer and install

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.020
it locally on your machine.

10
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.000
Now there by default,

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.070
it selected this atlas thing,

12
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.580
that is something we'll dive into later in the course,

13
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.150
for now let's use the free community server.

14
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.800
Now the enterprise server would be your paid solution,

15
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.320
we don't want to use that, we'll use the free one which gives us everything we need,

16
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.640
the enterprise server just adds some enterprise level features like different kinds of authentication

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.680
and encryption which we don't need here,

18
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.640
so let's go with the community server and then there, choose your operating system in case it's not pre-selected

19
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.020
correctly.

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.220
Now there, you can go with the default version that is installed and then you can click the download

21
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.970
button,

22
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.930
by the way also always check the installation instructions where you find a link to here

23
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.930
if you're facing any issues. So now I'll download that

24
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.090
and you don't need to sign up here, you can just wait for the download to start

25
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.740
and once the download finished, you can on Mac and Linux simply extract that file that was downloaded,

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.550
on Windows you can start the installer. Now if you have that installer, simply walk through the different

27
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.790
steps there and choose custom

28
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.570
when you have the chance for it. Now there you can leave the defaults as they are,

29
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.970
I just want to inform you that on Windows, mongodb will be installed as a service as you can see

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.280
here.

31
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.700
Now you could uncheck this but this is fine,

32
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.230
this is a little different to how it will then run on Mac and Linux

33
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.500
but you can follow along, fine in both cases and I will of course show you how to connect to it

34
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.600
in both scenarios.

35
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.860
So simply click next and install and install it on windows in the destination you chose. On Mac and Linux,

36
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.020
you simply have that extracted folder here and now you can grab all these files in that folder and

37
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.600
copy them into any place on your operating system where you want to install mongodb so to

38
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.360
say,

39
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.930
so there, I will go to a folder I prepared and simply paste that into here.

40
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.250
Now the bin folder is the important folder,

41
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.380
this has all the mongodb related executables,

42
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.310
most of them you'll not really need for this course but we will work with a couple of them to start

43
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.890
our own mongodb server which then hosts our mongodb databases,

44
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.200
we'll also use the one for importing data at some point in the course and we will use the shell client

45
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.610
which is a client that allows us to connect to the mongodb database and run commands on it

46
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.150
and on Windows, you get the same executables in your installation path

47
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.680
by the way. Now with these files being placed in the path or in the place of your operating system where

48
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.470
you want them, you should do something else on Mac and Linux,

49
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.220
you should go to your root folder on your system and there, you should create a new folder named data

50
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.930
and in that folder, create another new folder named db and you can do that on Windows too if you want.

51
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.820
You don't need to but you should create that folder at some place in your operating system,

52
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.020
it can be anywhere,

53
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.100
doesn't have to be the root folder but it will be easier to follow along for the rest of the course

54
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.950
if you use that

55
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.590
but I will also show you how to start mongodb when you use a different folder or a different path.

56
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.440
So create that data db folder if possible in your root folder of your Macbook, of your computer, of

57
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.830
your laptop or create it in any other path,

58
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.170
I will show you how to make it work with both.

59
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.020
Now with that, start your terminal or on Windows, your command prompt

60
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.840
and this is where we'll work in for the majority of this course because there, we can run all these important

61
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.990
queries or commands to insert or to retrieve data but of course, I will also show you how to then apply

62
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.240
the knowledge you gain in here in a real app,

63
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.450
I'll actually do this in this first module already. Now in there,

64
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.470
try running mongo and you should get a command, not found error.

65
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.230
Now on Mac and Linux, you fix this by going into your user folder and then look for a bash profile file,

66
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.210
if you don't have that file, you can simply create it, .bash_profile,

67
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.940
you can then edit this with a text editor and in there, you need to change your so-called path variable

68
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.910
or you need to enhance it or you need to append something to it.

69
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:50.760
You do this by adding export, starting with a lowercase e, path equal and then use the path to the folder

70
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.510
where you placed your mongodb binaries in,

71
00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:02.670
so in my case this is in here and you can simply right click on that item, on that executable and copy

72
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.210
that path here if you want and move that path into here, starting with one slash

73
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.030
and in my case it's users, my user name, development, mongodb binary because that is the path I use

74
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:22.080
to place mongodb in. Now important on Mac and Linux, to make sure that all your other commands work,

75
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.690
you need to add a colon and then $path at the end and then save your bash profile file.

76
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.430
Now on Windows, you also need to set this and you do this with a so-called environment variable,

77
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.610
so simply press the Windows key and type environment and you should be suggested this option of setting

78
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.440
environment variables at some point. Open that and there under your user variables, you should also choose

79
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:54.090
the path variable, edit this variable and then add a new entry here which is the path to the directory

80
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.440
where you installed mongodb and there to the bin directory as well,

81
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.860
so always to the directory where all these executables can be found in. Simply copy that path and add

82
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.920
it to the path variable and then simply save that.

83
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.940
The same is true here for Mac and Linux, save that edited bash profile and thereafter, close

84
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.600
all terminal or command prompt instances

85
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.590
you need to restart both. Once you restarted your terminal or command prompt, you should be able to run

86
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.190
mongo

87
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.550
and it should give you an error that it can't connect,

88
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.270
on Windows it will connect because mongod is running as a service there already, so the mongodb

89
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.630
database server started as a background service because we checked this during the installation,

90
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.990
so on Windows, you now probably already are connected.

91
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.370
Now therefore on Windows, to also see how you could start it differently

92
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.040
and I will have a whole module in this course where I talk a bit more about this shell and connection thing

93
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.860
but on Windows, you can close that command prompt and start a new one as an administrator by right clicking

94
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.950
on the executable and choosing run as administrator

95
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:06.040
and there, you can now type net stop mongodb written like this and this will only work on Windows,

96
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.660
don't do it,

97
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.770
don't try it on Mac or Linux.

98
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.770
This will stop that background service and now we can also start the mongodb server manually

99
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.400
just as we do it here on Mac and Linux.

100
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.110
You can now start your server by typing mongod,

101
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.930
so mongo basically is a client which allows you to connect to the server and then run commands on

102
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.050
your databases,

103
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:32.610
mongod starts the mongo database server. So mongod is now a command you can use and when running it, it

104
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.960
might fail.

105
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.150
Now it might fail if you chose a different data

106
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.010
db folder,

107
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.130
I mentioned it would be easiest if you use your root directory so the C-Drive on Windows or if you use

108
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.940
that route directory on Mac and Linux for the data db folder.

109
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:57.030
If you use a different folder, you need to start your mongod instance here by typing mongodb

110
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:03.860
--db path and then the path to the place where you created your data db folder.

111
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.540
If that path includes some whitespace in there, you need to wrap it with curly braces,

112
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.430
so for example here, I could type data db, that is redundant though that is the default where it looks

113
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.610
for anyways and that is the path I'm using it here in my operating system, the default as suggested

114
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:25.350
and on Windows, you can of course also add it in the same way to make sure you point at the folder where

115
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.270
that data is stored. On Windows

116
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:33.630
actually, I need to change that because there, the default path is inside of the installation folder of mongo

117
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.400
database

118
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.380
and then you start the mongodb server like this.

119
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.900
Now if you type this, it should now start up,

120
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:46.790
if you still get an error on Mac and Linux, simply try running sudo in front of this entire command,

121
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.970
this will give you the right permissions to store data in that path.

122
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:56.190
You are prompted to enter your password then and then it should work, on Windows this is not required

123
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.170
and also not available.

124
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.890
Now with that, the mongodb database server is up and running. On Windows, you don't need to do that,

125
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.150
after restarting your system, the mongodb service should be running in the background again and you

126
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.330
can absolutely use that, it's same server, just automatically started in the background. On Mac and Linux,

127
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.250
you have to start it manually for now,

128
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.920
I have a whole module where I dive deeper into that and explain how to start it as a service on Mac and

129
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.890
Linux too.

130
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.740
So now with that up and running,

131
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:31.590
open a new window, a new terminal or command prompt window and leave the old one running,

132
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.960
you need to leave that process running as long as you work on it because that is your running database

133
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.500
server,

134
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.960
if you shut that down, you can't work with it anymore.

135
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:45.510
You can always quit it by pressing control c, this will quit and simply exit

136
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.060
but then you need to restart if you want to work on it again.

137
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:56.190
So in that new window, you can now run mongo and this will automatically connect to the running server,

138
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:02.940
so now you are in the mongo shell which is the environment where you can run commands against your database

139
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:08.410
server, where you can create new databases, new collections and most importantly, new documents.

140
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.220
And this is now what we'll work on in the next lecture.
