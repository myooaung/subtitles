00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.360
Let's explore fork and let me already say that fork only runs on Mac and Linux and I'll show a solution

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240
for Windows too of course,

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.000
so let's simply see what fork does.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.950
If I run my mongod instance with fork, like this and I can still pass dbpath and all the other options

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.640
if I want to

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.980
but if I run it like this, what happens is that I first of all get an error because one thing I need

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.440
to set here is the logpath and you'll see why in a second.

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.950
So I'll set my logpath, copy in the path to logs and then log.log and now what happens is this

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.470
starts my mongodb server as a child process and you can see it's now not blocking this window,

10
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.180
I can type other commands here again if I want to,

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.890
so I can type other commands here and the server is still running but now as a background process you

12
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.190
could say instead of a foreground process which blocks this window, it runs as a service put in other

13
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.480
words, a service in the background

14
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.350
and therefore I can run Mongo to connect to it because the server is up and running,

15
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.570
I can connect to it and I can work with it just as I did before.

16
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.190
That is also the reason why I had to pass my logpath, since it runs in the background,

17
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.660
it can't log errors or warnings to that front screen, it can't log it here into my terminal

18
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.970
instead it will write all the logs for the background server into my log file here.

19
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.530
This is simply how it works and how it runs and how I can run this as a background process if I want

20
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.360
to.

21
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.300
Now on Windows, the fork command is not available but on Windows, you can still start it as a service if

22
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.620
you checked that install as a service option during the installation which we did in this course.

23
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.960
So with that checked, you can start the mongodb service and you first of all need to make sure that

24
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.760
you quit all existing processes in all your command prompts.

25
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.800
You can start it by right clicking on the command prompt and running it as administrator

26
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.720
and then you can type net start mongodb and this will start up the mongodb server as a background

27
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.710
service.

28
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.140
Now the question of course is how can you quit such a running service and on Mac, you can easily do that

29
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.090
by connecting to that server with the Mongo shell and then switching to the admin database

30
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.950
and in there you can run db shutdown server,

31
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.370
so this method and this will shut down the server to which you are connected.

32
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.410
The exact same approach will work on Windows,

33
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.350
so this is one way of doing that.

34
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.070
On Windows you can also easily stop it by again opening a command prompt as administrator and running

35
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.020
net stop mongodb in there, written like this,

36
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.640
so this will also stop the service. And this is how you can use such a background service instead of a

37
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.880
foreground service,

38
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.770
what you use is up to you ultimately, up to your preference,

39
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.260
you got exactly the same service in both ways.

40
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.930
I just wanted to show the alternatives here.
