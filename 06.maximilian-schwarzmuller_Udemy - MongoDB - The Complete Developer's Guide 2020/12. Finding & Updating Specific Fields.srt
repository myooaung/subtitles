1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:10,560
The obvious question that remains is how can I now find a certain set of persons, a certain set of documents

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,260
and hobbies and only update those?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,680
Let's say we want to find all hobbies with a frequency greater than two,

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,670
so first of all we want to find all documents where the persons have hobbies with such a frequency

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,830
but thereafter, we also want to change the elements in the array.

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,530
Now let's first of all find the right documents again with the help of find, here

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,460
we dig into hobbies and frequency,

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:46,150
here we can use that dot notation, in the filter it's allowed and we look for a frequency greater than

9
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,520
2,

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,170
let's say. Let's pretty print

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,000
that and we see Maria has one hobby,

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,580
here we also get a hobby with a frequency lower than two and also one equal to two

13
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,300
which also does not make it into the greater than condition

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,540
but here is the one fulfilling our condition and you have to remember that one fulfilling document here

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,160
gives us the entire surrounding document because we're still looking for the surrounding document. Here

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,200
this is the winner

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,730
and here, this is the winner

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,810
and here both documents are greater than 2,

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,950
the frequency is greater than 2.

20
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,150
So with that, I now want to update all hobbies where the frequency is greater than 2,

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,820
so this one should be updated,

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,460
this should be updated,

23
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,730
this should be updated,

24
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,610
this should not be updated for example.

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,250
Now can we achieve that?

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:43,740
Well we do access are users and update many and now we first of all have to find the right persons,

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,910
so again hobbies.frequency

28
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:53,370
and here we look for a frequency greater than two, the same we had before.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,890
Now in the update mechanism, I want to set something because I want to add a new field

30
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:11,600
and now there, I can access hobbies.$ would give me the first matching element,

31
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,030
this gives me all elements,

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,940
now what I can do here is I can define an identifier here and the name is up to you,

33
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,200
like el

34
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,100
and then define what you want to set as a value.

35
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,040
Now I will first of all add a nested document because this will refer to one document in the hobbies

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,620
array,

37
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,370
so in there I'll add a good frequency field and I want to set that to true.

38
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,400
Don't hit enter,

39
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,240
this will not work right now because this part will not be understood by mongodb, this el thing is

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:50,190
something we defined because now we add a third argument to the update many method which also is a document.

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,310
This is the document where you could set upsert to true, where you could also add a write concern

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,350
but I will set an array filters key here.

43
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,710
Now array filters works together with this syntax, here

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,090
you can define some conditions by which you want to filter elements and these conditions can even differ

45
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,470
from these conditions here,

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,070
so they don't have to be equal.

47
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,290
You could be looking for something totally different

48
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:25,290
here like age greater than 30 and then still filter out certain array elements in this array and you could even

49
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:32,250
do that for multiple arrays because with the el here, you set an identifier for the condition you want

50
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,650
to apply for this update expression here. Now in array filters,

51
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,200
you therefore have an array

52
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,970
of the different filters for the different arrays you might be updating.

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,930
There you have multiple documents, one for each filter and then you have to repeat your identifier,

54
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,370
so in my case it's el, if you named this differently which you can,

55
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,480
you have to name it differently here too.

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,080
Now for us here, el is one element in hobbies which happens to be an embedded document,

57
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:13,160
so if I want to include or check some fields, some field in that embedded document, I can use el dot and

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,100
then frequency here as an example and then check whether frequency is greater than 2.

59
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,810
With that I'm rebuilding this query up here

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,160
but you don't have to do that,

61
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,910
you can have totally different queries here.

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,930
You could be looking for the age up here and still look for elements with a frequency greater than two

63
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,770
here.

64
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,860
Now here I am missing a square bracket to close that

65
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,040
and on the other hand, I don't need these.

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,760
So now if I hit enter, you see it modified five documents, all five documents that met this condition

67
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:53,000
and if I now look into my users, you see Maria has a good frequency here, Chris does only have it here

68
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,680
because these two indeed did not meet our condition of a frequency greater than two,

69
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,190
here it was updated but not for this document,

70
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,380
here it was updated for this but not for this document and for Max and that's interesting, it was updated

71
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,520
for both because both met this criteria.

72
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:16,230
So this is a nice syntax which allows you to be really flexible about filtering out elements in an array

73
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,370
that should change

74
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:24,080
and as I mentioned, here we had the same filter and then array filter, you could have totally different

75
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,620
filters.

76
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,680
So this filter by which you identify documents and the filter by which you identify array elements you

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,550
want to update

78
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,050
do not have to be equal.
