00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.540
Now that we did add encryption during transportation,

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.830
let's talk about encryption at rest.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.140
What is that?

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.140
Well encryption at rest simply means that the data we store, so the data which is stored on our mongodb

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.600
server in a file, that this of course might also be encrypted,

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.560
so all the documents we have in there

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.950
and there we can encrypt two different things.

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.000
We can encrypt the overall storage, so the files themselves

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.110
and this is a feature which is built into mongodb for enterprise.

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.630
There you can easily enable it and you'll find instructions on how to enable it 

11
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.640
in the last lecture of this module. The thing you as a developer can and should always do is that you

12
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.250
encrypt at least certain values in your code,

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.280
so for example if you're storing a user password, you should hash that password and not store the plain

14
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.870
text and that is a good pattern for any sensible data,

15
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.160
you could even go so far to do it for all data, so that you always have a way of encrypting that.

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.770
So you can encrypt and hash both your data as well as the overall file to have the most security possible.

17
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.680
Again the file encryption is built into mongodb for enterprise and can be found in a separate

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.900
article, that hashing of a password is something you'll see in the from shell to

19
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.620
driver module of this course.
