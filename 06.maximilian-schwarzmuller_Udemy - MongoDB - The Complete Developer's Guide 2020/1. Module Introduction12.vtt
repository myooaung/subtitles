00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.680
So let's dive into the core basics you need to know when work with mongodb, with the data or the documents

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.300
you store in there and let us also dive

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.190
and that's really important into all the crud basics,

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.690
crud stands for create, read, update and delete

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.500
and these are typical operations you do with your documents. You create documents, you want to well find,

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.510
retrieve or read them, you want to be able to update and change your documents

7
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.690
and obviously in a lot of cases, you also want to delete some data.

8
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.410
So we'll dive into all these core basics in this module, to be precise,

9
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.720
we'll have a look about the core basics or the core concepts about collections and documents and how to

10
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.050
work with these.

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.840
We'll have a look at the basic data types you work with in mongodb and how to well store different

12
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.590
data in your database and we'll have a look at these crud operations I was referring to.

13
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.180
I will show you which kind of queries you can run to insert data, to find data, to update or to delete

14
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.320
data and therefore by the end of this module, you'll have a very solid understanding of the core concepts

15
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.710
behind mongodb and the core concepts you need to work with

16
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.650
data in mongodb.

17
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100
So let's get started.
