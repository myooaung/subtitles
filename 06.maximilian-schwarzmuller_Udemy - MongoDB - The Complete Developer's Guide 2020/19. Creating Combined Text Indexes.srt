1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,660
Now I did mention that you can only have one text index per collection and that is true,

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:13,230
if we get the indexes for products, we see we have one text index down there and you see it assume

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,840
the default language of English,

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,150
we can change that by the way,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,200
I'll come back to that

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,550
but for now let's simply try to add another text index because in products if we find one,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,310
the title is of course also text.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:34,710
So we could say products create index and then say title should also be a text index like this,

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,270
now what we get here is essentially an error, index options conflict.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,300
Now this is a bit hard to read but in the end, it's tried to create the index which we already have because

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,770
you can only have one text index.

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,910
What we can do though is we can merge the text of multiple fields together into one text index,

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,320
for this I first of all need to drop my existing text index and now dropping text index is a bit harder,

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,330
you can't do title text,

15
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,870
this doesn't work as you can see but what you can do is you can drop it by the name, by the index name

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,630
so you can copy that index name you have up there with get indexes and then you can simply drop it by the

17
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,140
name,

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,680
we did drop by name earlier in this module too, whoops, needs to be in quotation marks though. So now

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,650
this is gone, now

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,660
this old text index is gone and if I repeat get indexes, we see we only have the default ID index now and now

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,020
we can create a text index again

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:42,440
but now we can actually merge together multiple fields by simply adding them like this, description text.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,070
Now there is still will only be one text index but it will contain the keywords of both the title and

24
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,620
the description field, so if I hit

25
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,790
enter, this works and now I can of course also search for items we have in a title.

26
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:02,820
So if I find one, you see for example I could search for book because I also have that here,

27
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,690
now we won't see a difference because we had book there before but now we will search for both. And I

28
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,980
can prove this by simply inserting a new product

29
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:26,410
with a title of a ship and a description of floats perfectly and as you see, we have ship only in the title,

30
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,820
not in the description.

31
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:37,660
So now with that added, we can of course reach into products and find with the help of

32
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,100
$text for a search term of ship

33
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,810
and again, the casing doesn't matter here. And I do find one document because ship is in the title and

34
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,730
I now have a combined text index.
