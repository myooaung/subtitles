00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.340
So now we're ready to dive in and now I just want you to get the most out of this course. To get the most

2
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.130
out of the course,

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.110
watch the videos,

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.930
this is obvious but watch the videos and watch them at your speed.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.340
You can slow the videos down in the udemy video player or you can speed me up and really adjust this to your requirements,

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.020
if I'm talking too fast, slow me down, am I going too slow, speed me up,

7
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.980
maybe skip lectures if you already know what I'm teaching in there,

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.280
it's an on-demand course so take advantage of that.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.610
Additionally, pause and code along

10
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.890
or type the commands along with me,

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.240
play around with mongodb,

12
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.870
since it's running locally you can't mess it up,

13
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.420
you can always delete that database folder you created and start from scratch

14
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.770
but play around with mongodb and follow along because being active always gives you more than just

15
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.990
passively watching the videos.

16
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.840
In addition, make sure you do the assignments,

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.050
there are a couple of assignments in this course which are there for you to practice. In the assignments,

18
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.290
I always show my solution for you to compare and being forced to solve a problem on your own

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.580
first of course gives you an opportunity to really see if you really understood a certain concept.

20
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.550
Now additionally I will point at the official docs very often because the docs are very good and detailed

21
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.500
and if you need some niche case or you just want to read something or you just want to look something

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.940
up which I explained somewhere in the course but you don't know where that was, dive into the official

23
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.190
docs and also use Google,

24
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.080
that's a great additional resource to this course because with that, you'll learn to solve your problems

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.820
on your own which is always the best way of learning,

26
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.510
you have to learn how to solve problems on your own.

27
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.160
Take the course, get the basic knowledge, get the advanced knowledge too but then also dive into problems

28
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.900
you're facing on your own and solve them.

29
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.980
Now if something is unclear at any point or there is a problem you can't solve,

30
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.470
also use the Q&A section of this course.

31
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.650
I'll do my best to reply there quickly but also please help other students there,

32
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.810
don't just ask,

33
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.040
also answer because by answering, you'll become a real pro because answering is so much harder than asking.

34
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.130
And if you answer something which is not entirely correct,

35
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.480
that's no problem, you'll be corrected and you'll learn again,

36
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.270
so really use this as an opportunity to also challenge yourself and grow.

37
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.510
And with that, we got everything we need,

38
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.990
we get the basic theory, we got everything installed,

39
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.340
let's dive into mongodb and learn how to use it to its fullest potential.
