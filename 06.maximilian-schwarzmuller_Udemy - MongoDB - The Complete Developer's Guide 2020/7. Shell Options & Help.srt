00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,860
So over the last lectures, we talked a lot about the mongodb server and its options. In this lecture,

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,790
I also want to touch on the Mongo shell, which options do we have on the Mongo shell?

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:23,450
Well just as you could type mongod --help, you can type mongo --help,

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:30,560
so now the help options for the Mongo shell and there, you see it has way less options because

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
it's just a connecting client in the end, not the server.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,230
You can for example run it without connecting to a database because the shell is based on javascript

7
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,240
so if you just want to execute some javascript code, you could do that,

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,120
you can also run it in quiet mode to output less information,

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,530
you can define a port and a host for the server to which it should try to connect,

10
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,200
by default it takes localhost 27017

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,510
but if you run your mongodb server on a different host and we'll do this by the end of the

12
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:02,840
course,

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,250
I will show you how to create a mongodb set up in the cloud or on a real server, not an our machine,

14
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,510
so if you want to connect to something like this then you can do this with port and host, so that you

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,840
don't try to connect to the local host.

16
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,690
You can set up some SSL settings which I don't need here

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,600
and later once we add authentication, we also can add our authentication information, we'll see that

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,450
later in the course too.

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,390
So right now, there isn't really an option

20
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,670
I would need to execute but there is also something interesting inside of the shell,

21
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:43,670
so after you started it and connect it. In there, you can type help like this and help will output a short

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,590
list of some important help information,

23
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,490
some important commands you can execute and you can even dive into detailed help like for example what

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,060
can I do as an admin by typing help admin

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,270
and now you see a couple of commands that might be useful when it comes to administrating the database.

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,440
Now back to just help, you see here are the show dbs and the show collections commands we used before,

27
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,040
you also see for example how you find all objects in a collection,

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,810
also not that bad to know

29
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:23,020
and you can also output help for a given database or a collection in a database, like here

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:31,280
if I have a look at my databases, I got no database set up here or no database besides the default databases.

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,810
Now if I use my test database and I type db help, I see commands that I can run here on the database

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,450
and you see there are a lot of commands you never saw before,

33
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,410
a lot of commands you don't really need but there also are commands like create collection which we

34
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,520
already did use in this course.

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,100
You see there also are commands for dropping the database for example or for getting all kinds of information.

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,770
Now these are commands you also find in the official docs if you want to learn more about them

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,200
and as I said a lot of them are commands you will probably never need but still nice to know these commands,

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,040
db run command is another command we saw earlier

39
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,520
for example.

40
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,030
Now we can also get help on the collection level,

41
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,830
let's say I would have a test collection in there,

42
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,620
I can run help like this

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,940
and note the parentheses which we also had to use on db help, so I can also run help on this and now I see

44
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,870
all the commands I can execute directly on the collection

45
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,440
and these are all the insert or find commands for example

46
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,930
but you also have some other commands like the stats for this collection

47
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,320
if you're interested in this.

48
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,850
So these are a lot of nice to know features,

49
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,460
you can definitely play around with them and just execute a couple of these commands, if possible in

50
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,700
a database and collection where it doesn't hurt

51
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,840
if you mess up things but you can play around with that,

52
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,540
this is how you can find help. And with that,

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,220
together with your log files and the official docs and Google as always, you should of course be able to get

54
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:10,640
the most out of mongodb and fix potential issues or find that special feature you're looking for.
