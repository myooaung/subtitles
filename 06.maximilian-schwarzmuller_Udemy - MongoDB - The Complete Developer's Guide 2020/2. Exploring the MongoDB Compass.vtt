00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.760
You can download mongodb compass from the compass page on the mongodb page. You can

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.100
find it on solutions

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.020
and there, simply compass.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.970
Now on that page, you can simply click on try it

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.850
now and there, compass should be selected,

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.100
your operating system should be selected

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.720
otherwise you can change it here and you simply download that and you'll get an installer through which

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.810
you can walk and this should be pretty straightforward.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.860
Once this installation process finished and I already installed it for me, you can start up compass

10
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.860
and you should start on a page that looks something like this, where you can connect to a host.

11
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.290
Now it's important that you have a mongod server up and running

12
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.990
and I do,

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.400
I'm also connected to it in the shell and you see, this is actually an empty server,

14
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.920
no databases, no data,

15
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.860
I cleared everything before this module by simply deleting everything in the db folder where the data

16
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.260
gets stored.

17
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.730
You could of course also have some data in there, doesn't matter

18
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.180
and I got a mongod instance running and that is the instance to which we'll connect. Now the default settings

19
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.920
actually already do suffice for connecting,

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.620
we want to connect to localhost and to this port, 

21
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.850
so if you didn't change anything here, you can just click connect and you're connected to your local

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.660
mongodb server.

23
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.280
Now you see the three default databases,

24
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.750
now here we could actually create a new database,

25
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.090
for example we could add some contact data with a contacts collection and click create database. In

26
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.140
the contact data,

27
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.300
we now have the contacts collection and as you see, we can even insert a document here and there, we could

28
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.890
insert a name, Max, we could insert an age, 29 and we can change the type of that too, we could say that

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.940
should be simply int32 for example. We can then add another field and that could be my location and

30
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.150
for location, I'll actually add an object which is simply a nested, an embedded document

31
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.120
and for the embedded document, I will add a special type of object which I'll explain a bit deeper later in

32
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.170
the geospatial module

33
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.240
where I'll set a type field to point, this is string, point. And then I'll add coordinates and coordinates

34
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.850
will actually be an array

35
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:28.480
and here the first value will be a double and that double let's say is 56.12 and then the second element

36
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.980
also is a double

37
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.400
and that is let's say 43.09.

38
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.850
Now let's click insert here and this was now inserted,

39
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.670
now you also see other tabs besides your documents,

40
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.740
these are all things which will make more sense once we progress through the course, for example the

41
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.500
aggregation framework module will show you how you can aggregate data in the shell but thereafter, this

42
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.510
page will make more sense to you because what you learn in the shell later in that module is something

43
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.660
you can also replicate in the user interface by then. Explain plan and indexes will make more sense after

44
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.780
the indexes module where you learn what indexes are and why we use them

45
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.470
and here you can explore which indexes are attached to your collection, which kind of index it is,

46
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.150
you can also create a new index and you can understand how your queries are executed.

47
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.960
Speaking of queries, you can execute queries here too, right now

48
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.930
I'm finding all documents as you can see.

49
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.290
Now you can also on this page of course filter for different things, you can write a query as you'll

50
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.140
learn in this course

51
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.920
and as you already saw it a bit,

52
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.420
you could for example search for age being able to 29

53
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.730
and of course you would find that same document, if I searched for age 30 though, I'll not find anything.

54
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.550
So you can play around with that and explore your data here

55
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.130
a bit to get a feeling for what's inside

56
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.910
and of course, you can not just insert data and view data,

57
00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.110
you can also edit and change it. So for example here, I could update Max to be 30 years old, simply click

58
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.970
update here and you're good to go

59
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.570
and if you want to get rid of a user suddenly, you could of course also delete this user and click delete,

60
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.490
now I'll not do that here but it would be as easy as that.

61
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.570
Now that location thing here, that object, this is just showing you that you can add a nested object as

62
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.820
well and an array

63
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.840
and this is actually a special type of object which you'll also learn more about in the geospatial

64
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.720
module.

65
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.370
So this is compass and this is a super short module obviously. Compass is a nice graphical user interface

66
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.490
which you simply should be aware of and even though I will not use it for the rest of this course because

67
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.500
this being a developer course, I'll focus on the code, you can always come back and log into your database

68
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.510
server with compass to explore your data, to easily manipulate it, to try out some queries and later in

69
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.310
the indexes module,

70
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.410
also explore indexes and explain tab and in the aggregations module,

71
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.110
play around with this graphical user interface.

72
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.830
This is mongodb compass,

73
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.430
now there's one other thing to mention and that is that this is the community edition.

74
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.850
If you are using mongodb enterprise, mongodb compass will have one cool feature and that is

75
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.340
the schema tab which we don't have here.

76
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.940
This allows you to explore the schema of your data in greater detail, so you can see how many documents

77
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.230
do have a string for a name or a string for age maybe if you have mixed data. For location data like this

78
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.890
one, you would also see a map and you could explore your entries on that map for multiple documents.

79
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.110
So with the enterprise version, you get a bit more features but for basic exploration and editing, the

80
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.080
community edition which comes for free should suffice.
