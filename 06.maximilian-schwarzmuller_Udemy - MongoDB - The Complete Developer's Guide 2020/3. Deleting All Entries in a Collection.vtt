00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.970
Now sometimes you also want to delete all entries in a collection,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.950
you can do this in two ways.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.680
One way is that you simply reach out to the collection and then you execute delete many and you simply

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.770
pass an empty pair of curly braces,

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.980
this simply is a filter that matches every document in the collection and therefore, if I now hit enter, all

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.170
documents are gone.

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.720
As you can see, if I find all documents, nothing is returned.

8
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.180
The alternative would be that you of course delete the entire collection. On a collection in the shell

9
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.650
here,

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.490
you can call drop. Now important, you as an administrator working with the shell might do that, later when

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.770
you build a real application like in our from shell to driver module towards the end of the course,

12
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.970
you will most likely not call drop from within your application code because you rarely have a situation

13
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.840
where your app, your website or whatever you're building should drop an entire collection. Adding collections

14
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.650
and deleting collections typically is more of a sys admin task,

15
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.420
still it's worth knowing how it works.

16
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.510
Well if you execute this, you'll see true if it succeeded and false if it did not, which it did in this

17
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.320
case because I already deleted it.

18
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.720
You can also delete the entire database with drop database, just on the database, so not on users but

19
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.870
drop database, this dropped the user database and automatically gets us out of the database

20
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.920
which is why I can now execute this and well, nothing was dropped because I'm not in a database,

21
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.850
I would have to use a different one to then drop that.

22
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.830
So dropping collections and databases

23
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.490
obviously also gets rid of the data in there but delete one and delete many are the more common methods

24
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.330
you'll use

25
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.510
also in your application side code. And writing queries is all you need to know to find documents you

26
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.460
need to delete.
