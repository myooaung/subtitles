00:01.280 --> 00:09.230
Even though Google algorithms are constantly evolving it's true that links back links from authorities

00:09.230 --> 00:15.060
sites have a big impact on your ranking particularly for the very highest crime gangs.

00:16.340 --> 00:23.090
It's difficult to see how Google could ignore these kind of links because if a high authorities side

00:23.390 --> 00:28.850
considered your site valuable enough to link to then it must be quite a site.

00:28.970 --> 00:31.850
It must have authority in its own right.

00:31.850 --> 00:37.820
Google cannot afford to ignore it because their commitment is to provide the very best quality sites

00:38.090 --> 00:39.230
for their users.

00:41.070 --> 00:47.800
It's largely true that the site with great quality content will not reach the very top of Google by

00:47.800 --> 00:48.650
itself.

00:49.650 --> 00:59.070
However even if the site has fantastic bottlings from authorities sites like CNN Wikipedia Forbes et

00:59.080 --> 01:05.610
cetera it will not reach the very top of Google search unless the call and the quality of the content

01:05.610 --> 01:07.050
is very very high.

01:08.390 --> 01:17.180
Ideally you need both a fantastic site with great paddlings.

01:17.320 --> 01:22.490
Now the case study that these lessons rely on don't rely on any bottlings at all.

01:24.080 --> 01:31.950
But I want to say a few words about back because they are important for any site who those search engine

01:31.980 --> 01:34.430
algorithms are constantly evolving.

01:34.770 --> 01:40.660
Links from an authority site do have a big effect on the ranking.

01:40.840 --> 01:48.140
It's difficult to see how Google could remove this element from his Reinking calculations.

01:48.150 --> 01:56.370
After all if an important site considers your own site to be a valuable resource it's a big sign to

01:56.370 --> 02:01.340
Google that they should rank it highly.

02:01.360 --> 02:06.290
It seems the quality rich content and bottlings go hand in hand

02:09.260 --> 02:17.740
while it is difficult to rank at the very top number one with good quality and no bottlings having great

02:17.750 --> 02:21.090
things some poor quality content doesn't work either.

02:22.230 --> 02:26.790
Ideally you need both.

02:26.860 --> 02:34.280
However backlit from powerful sites are still not sufficient to achieve the best rankings.

02:36.680 --> 02:44.860
Google knows the kind of activity that surrounds a new and growing site the algorithm takes into account

02:45.100 --> 02:50.010
social activity sharing and links from other sites or forums

02:52.540 --> 03:00.620
increase your activity as the site grows follows a known curve and any activity not following this curve

03:00.970 --> 03:05.450
this natural growth will be suspected and may be penalized.

03:09.110 --> 03:17.240
Although frowned upon by Google it is possible to create a natural looking back profile using the services

03:17.420 --> 03:19.280
of SEO professionals.

03:20.460 --> 03:23.830
However take great care.

03:23.970 --> 03:30.280
It's a very difficult area and it's probably worth waiting filicide to grow organically.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.760
Gathering by clinks naturally as it evolves.

03:35.870 --> 03:44.820
Create social profiles enough and create it or no follow it indicates to Google that your site has social

03:44.820 --> 03:45.610
reach.

03:48.120 --> 03:58.690
Create a Facebook page dedicated to the site join groups and be active posting interesting content regularly.

04:01.060 --> 04:09.160
Create a YouTube channel for the site and link back from the dashboard try to create at least one video

04:09.250 --> 04:14.830
a week with a link in the description to one of your sites in the pages of posts

04:17.640 --> 04:26.020
a great to do follow link can be created using cars as a video site that compiles play lists from YouTube

04:26.410 --> 04:29.070
Vimeo and other popular platforms

04:33.210 --> 04:40.380
simply search for videos related to your focus keyword and write a description containing keyword variations

04:40.830 --> 04:52.320
and then the real web site.

04:52.420 --> 05:00.340
The resulting back link is do follow imbeds the playlist on your site and it should be indexed on your

05:00.360 --> 05:08.350
site as it gets crawled by Google robots a really good way to get a strong back link approach similar

05:08.350 --> 05:14.460
size but not a competitor and ask if you can write a guest post for them.

05:16.480 --> 05:24.530
A link back to your site will be included in the article profile in the next video lesson.

05:24.640 --> 05:29.250
You see how my site ranked during the three months following its creation.
