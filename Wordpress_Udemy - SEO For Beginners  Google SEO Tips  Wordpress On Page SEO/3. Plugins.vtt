00:00.690 --> 00:06.410
The right plugins can greatly improve the efficiency and the look the functionality of your website

00:07.580 --> 00:10.090
the wrong plugins can give you problems.

00:11.460 --> 00:19.740
As a general rule only use plugins that are well-reviewed are compatible with your Thien and they are

00:19.730 --> 00:22.030
well supported.

00:22.110 --> 00:27.360
I only use free plugins and these fall into three broad categories.

00:27.420 --> 00:32.870
These are security c o m functionality.

00:34.750 --> 00:40.380
In the last video I talked about the need for protecting your site from hackers.

00:41.290 --> 00:44.320
I use three plugins to protect all of my sites

00:47.090 --> 00:51.270
word fence has a free and a Pro Plan.

00:51.510 --> 00:57.720
The free plan provides quite a high level of protection straight out of the box with its own default

00:57.720 --> 01:00.120
settings.

01:00.190 --> 01:08.460
It's got a 100 percent protection against brute force attacks for example the settings options are quite

01:08.460 --> 01:16.680
extensive and they're best explored yourself using the word friends help service on line.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.260
This is where they recommend optimal settings

01:21.870 --> 01:24.270
scrolling down to the bottom of the dashboard.

01:24.450 --> 01:29.070
You can see that this site has had hundreds of attacks every month

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
worldwide.

01:33.640 --> 01:38.290
The plug in blocks about 70 million attacks every single day

01:41.490 --> 01:49.890
I use a separate plugin to guard against X s s vulnerability attacks which protects against code script

01:49.980 --> 01:53.000
manipulation.

01:53.030 --> 01:58.020
Note we don't have to fully understand the precise nature of these attacks.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.050
The plugin is simply activated and forgotten

02:04.000 --> 02:05.160
lastly.

02:05.570 --> 02:11.050
I'm building a nice site depending on links to products that I affiliate.

02:11.360 --> 02:21.470
I use an empty click jack plug in click checking is when a hacker plays an I-frame over your page that

02:21.470 --> 02:23.680
is identical to it.

02:24.260 --> 02:37.090
When a user clicks on your banner it is redirected to the hacker site I see that click has been hijacked.

02:37.120 --> 02:45.740
Now we move on to SC O and SightSpeed is becoming more and more of a factor for Google search.

02:45.780 --> 02:51.980
The speed at which your site loads into a browser should be optimized.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.380
It makes sense for a service like Google which tries to provide the best experience for its users to

02:59.380 --> 03:07.650
give preference to fast sites a site that takes longer to load begins to lose visitors.

03:09.570 --> 03:13.590
50 percent of all visitors simply don't wait for it to load.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.980
Once this time exceeds something like 4 seconds

03:20.270 --> 03:28.430
using the following plugins I increase my site load speeds from 4.7 seconds to a little over 1 second

03:29.120 --> 03:32.480
which is a significant improvement images.

03:32.480 --> 03:40.170
Take time to load and display and normally images are processed even if they are not displayed yet.

03:42.510 --> 03:50.560
The A-3 lazy load plugging holes back on the image rendering until the user scrolls down and views them

03:51.610 --> 03:55.920
this saves the initial page load time.

03:55.930 --> 03:59.870
I have a similar plugin called lazy load for videos.

04:00.070 --> 04:09.110
It does the same thing to you too and that's a thumbnail image is displayed and the video code is only

04:09.110 --> 04:11.580
processed when the image is clicked.

04:30.180 --> 04:37.690
The plug in the SMERSH compresses the overall image size without reducing quality.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.040
This also improves Page Speed

04:44.210 --> 04:54.560
WordPress fastest cash delivers a cache file of your posts and pages this plugin alone should reduce

04:54.560 --> 04:57.740
your site load time by two to three seconds.

05:00.250 --> 05:09.400
Moving on to on page see who the plugin called all in one SD o provides a way of writing a targeted

05:09.400 --> 05:11.470
description for your posts.

05:13.420 --> 05:18.380
This is the title and description that Google will display in search results.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.920
So a keyword rich text will help enormously

05:34.840 --> 05:41.150
met a tag manager allows the addition of mental tags which are basically key words

05:45.050 --> 05:50.230
meta tags are not considered to be that important for Google search any more.

05:51.230 --> 05:57.050
But the main keywords in training here can reinforce the overall tone of your post.

05:58.700 --> 06:04.760
I usually add three or four main keywords if it's overdone.

06:04.870 --> 06:06.570
And you add too many.

06:06.570 --> 06:17.280
It could be judged as keyword stuffing which was common years ago because in those days it worked.

06:17.440 --> 06:25.940
The rest of the site is fairly standard with additional plugins used that help with administrative tasks.

06:26.140 --> 06:32.260
It's worth mentioning others that I used to enhance the presentation of clickable banners directing

06:32.350 --> 06:42.370
a user to my affiliate offers the sidebar has many uses and is generally the place where we put a search

06:42.370 --> 06:43.290
bar.

06:43.510 --> 06:51.750
Archived posts and categories these are placed in the form of widgets.

06:51.810 --> 07:00.930
It's a great area for one or two square Banus but with normal functioning there's a problem.

07:01.030 --> 07:06.620
Normally when the user scrolls down to read the post the band is lost from view.

07:09.140 --> 07:20.170
I use a plugin called Q to W3 fixed widget this plugin holds the banners in place once activated the

07:20.170 --> 07:21.550
widget containing the banner.

07:21.550 --> 07:26.790
Code can be selected as stickie.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.710
This means it will be on view the whole time when the user scrolls down the page.

07:51.020 --> 07:59.180
Using another plugin called widget context I can have several Banas each one laser targeted according

07:59.180 --> 08:05.350
to the post content.

08:05.590 --> 08:11.510
A box appears underneath the widget where you can select the posts where the banners are displayed.

08:21.790 --> 08:28.570
It may be from time to time that we want to run a special promotion and place a banner or some text

08:28.930 --> 08:30.870
in every post on the site.

08:32.690 --> 08:35.850
As your site grows this becomes quite a task.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.760
The plug in cold add inserter does this automatically.

08:43.410 --> 08:51.560
Ads can be inserted at the top of a post at the bottom or even two three or four paragraphs down.

08:52.580 --> 08:59.430
It's very flexible and saves a lot of time.

08:59.480 --> 09:07.910
It's fast becoming a requirement for Google that a Web site is labeled H.T. PBS which means that it's

09:07.910 --> 09:09.220
secure.

09:09.230 --> 09:11.940
It has an S S L certificate.

09:12.200 --> 09:17.510
I in the next video I'll show you how to install a free certificate for your site.
