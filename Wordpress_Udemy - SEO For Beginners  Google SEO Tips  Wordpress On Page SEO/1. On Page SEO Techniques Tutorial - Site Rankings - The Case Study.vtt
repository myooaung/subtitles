On Page SEO : SEO Techniques : SEO Tutorial. Now we're going to see how my site progressed through the rankings.

1
00:07.110 --> 00:14.340
I purchased the site on April 4th 2018 and started to build it just a few days later.

2
00:15.890 --> 00:23.090
For this case study I needed a means of tracking up to 100 key words. For this purpose

3
00:23.090 --> 00:32.200
I used the software called Serpfox.com and it cost $10 a month to track 100 keywords.

4
00:32.210 --> 00:38.230
This is the only time that I used a paid service at any time to rank my site.

5
00:38.250 --> 00:40.320
This is not strictly necessary.

6
00:41.710 --> 00:50.620
My strategy was to identify 100 key words closely related to my site content and to track them regularly,

7
00:51.030 --> 00:56.590
as I added content to the site.

8
00:56.600 --> 01:05.030
It's important to get your posts indexed in Google so I added the site to Google Search console and added

9
01:05.060 --> 01:08.530
the site map.

10
01:08.600 --> 01:15.700
There's a free plugin for Wordpress to generate the sitemap. You simply upload it to Google Search console

11
01:15.710 --> 01:18.910
to get the ball rolling.

12
01:19.090 --> 01:27.440
From this point on Google search bots will crawl your site regularly as you add content.

13
01:27.510 --> 01:32.160
You can also check how many posts are indexed in Google using this console

14
01:34.980 --> 01:41.510
You'll notice that there'll be more URLs indexed than there are posts on your site.

15
01:41.530 --> 01:47.950
This is normal, as it takes into account category pages and also tags.

16
01:47.950 --> 01:49.660
Tags are treated as separate.

17
01:49.660 --> 01:50.590
URLs

18
01:53.170 --> 02:00.850
Some experts say that tags shouldn't be overused, as it can lead to duplicate content penalty from Google

19
02:00.850 --> 02:02.690
search.

20
02:02.740 --> 02:04.100
I haven't found this.

21
02:04.360 --> 02:06.920
And anyway it doesn't make sense.

22
02:08.920 --> 02:16.180
Google search is sophisticated enough to understand that tag URLsdo not constitute intentional

23
02:16.180 --> 02:20.130
use of content to duplication.

24
02:20.240 --> 02:26.940
It's just the result of a content management system such as Wordpress.

25
02:27.130 --> 02:33.940
Even though Google may show a certain number of URLs, it may not decide to show all of them in search

26
02:33.940 --> 02:35.130
results.

27
02:35.140 --> 02:43.500
For example, currently my site has over sixteen hundred or so URLs indexed.

28
02:43.710 --> 02:50.580
But if I use the site: command for Google search, it shows considerably less.

29
02:50.610 --> 02:54.520
Five hundred ninety, or so.

30
02:54.640 --> 03:00.880
Even so, there are many more than the number of posts.

31
03:00.890 --> 03:04.730
My advice is to add 10 to 20 tags to each post.

32
03:05.600 --> 03:14.840
As tag URLs often rank and bring traffic. On the search analytics page for my site you can see

33
03:15.100 --> 03:26.200
the tag URLs a ranking.

34
03:26.360 --> 03:29.110
Even though the monthly volume is show zero,

35
03:29.150 --> 03:30.780
this is not true.

36
03:31.010 --> 03:32.690
It's just very low.

37
03:32.970 --> 03:37.460
But it's important to get traffic flowing and it will grow over time.

38
03:39.900 --> 03:43.180
Each week I track one hundred key words on Serpfox.com

39
03:43.200 --> 03:51.940
A good way to build this key word list is to add the focus keyword as you create a

40
03:51.940 --> 04:00.510
post, and then add four or five variations. About one month after site creation,

41
04:00.580 --> 04:05.680
my keywords started to rank. The keyword

42
04:05.760 --> 04:14.280
'What are subplots' entered quite strongly at position 27 and then dropped back before steadily climbing

43
04:14.280 --> 04:14.860
again.

44
04:18.380 --> 04:25.010
It reached page 1, position 8 on July the 3rd - three months after I created the site.

45
04:27.930 --> 04:29.960
Two related keywords,

46
04:29.970 --> 04:36.380
'Definition of subplots' and 'subplot definition' followed soon afterwards.

47
04:37.840 --> 04:42.800
This was particularly pleasing, for there are volumes of 1300 searches per month

48
04:42.940 --> 04:43.840
and are very interesting

49
04:46.840 --> 04:53.560
All of these keywords continue to move slowly upwards and it has to be noted that progressing through

50
04:53.560 --> 05:01.110
the top half of page 1 is much harder than the bottom half.

51
05:01.200 --> 05:09.970
Of course, any page one position brings traffic but the top positions bring much more.

52
05:09.990 --> 05:15.040
In addition, my site has more keywords on pages 2, 3 and 4,

53
05:15.120 --> 05:20.310
just ready to move up over the next month or two.

54
05:20.490 --> 05:26.280
I will be focused on promoting them and building back-links, to start moving them up to page 1.

55
05:29.250 --> 05:30.030
I'm confident

56
05:30.040 --> 05:32.210
this site will continue to grow,

57
05:32.490 --> 05:38.960
continue to bring traffic, and build a solid income over the coming months.

58
05:38.970 --> 05:43.140
Now it's up to you it's up to you to take action.

59
05:43.230 --> 05:45.620
Without action nothing can happen.

60
05:46.900 --> 05:52.840
Using the information and strategies that I've given you within this course you can build a very good,

61
05:52.840 --> 05:56.360
solid site and build your own online income.

62
05:58.400 --> 06:04.400
Even though it may take 3 months to rank anywhere near page 1, and something like six months to nine

63
06:04.400 --> 06:08.150
months after this to build that solid income,

64
06:08.150 --> 06:17.900
if you take no action now. within six months you'll still be wondering where to find extra income. Start

65
06:17.900 --> 06:20.790
now. Let me know how you get on.

66
06:21.050 --> 06:22.570
I'd love to hear from you.

67
06:22.970 --> 06:24.650
I hope you've enjoyed the course.

68
06:24.810 --> 06:25.410
