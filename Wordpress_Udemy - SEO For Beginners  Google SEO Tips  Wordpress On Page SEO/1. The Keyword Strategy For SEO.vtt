00:02.090 --> 00:06.170
This part of the research are you free to call.

00:06.200 --> 00:19.390
You both suggest after entering how to write a novel tool displays 894 phrases which are way too many.

00:19.390 --> 00:23.230
The next step is to filter out some words.

00:23.230 --> 00:30.340
I'll enter a positive filter so that only phrases with that word will appear.

00:30.500 --> 00:36.840
I will end to write a novel and click volume to display the key words with the highest volume

00:39.670 --> 01:04.010
copy the first 20 to 30 words before moving on.

01:04.230 --> 01:10.080
It's necessary to explore related keywords by drilling down into the subject.

01:10.530 --> 01:23.250
For example a novel has a plot superblocks dialogue genre and the theme so I can use each of these words

01:23.310 --> 01:25.400
as a basis for more research.

01:26.790 --> 01:37.060
Novels are also written in prose so prose is another phrase that I could use all of these form the basis

01:37.270 --> 01:43.870
of less competitive keywords that relate directly to the service that I promote.

01:43.980 --> 01:48.640
The services are all about writing courses helping people to write novels

01:51.220 --> 01:58.350
use each new keyword to produce more possibilities in you suggest.

01:58.600 --> 02:05.920
For this example I'll Alinta how to plot a novel and go through the same process to come up with another

02:05.920 --> 02:07.930
20 to 30 words.

02:31.400 --> 02:38.090
Remove key words that are obviously not relevant until you have a total list of 100 key word phrases

02:40.300 --> 02:45.600
these represent the titles and you aureoles of possible posts for your new site.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.910
However there's still a little more work to do and another tool to introduce

02:56.000 --> 03:03.560
the browser extension or add on called keywords everywhere is invaluable as a quick check on volume

03:03.770 --> 03:07.490
and competition.

03:07.540 --> 03:16.150
Once they add on is installed either on Chrome or Firefox into a phrase into Google search and it will

03:16.210 --> 03:19.860
instantly displace search volume and competitiveness

03:22.850 --> 03:26.650
keywords are rated from 0 to 1 to 1.

03:26.690 --> 03:28.100
Being highly competitive

03:31.510 --> 03:38.440
The numbers give some indication of the phrase popularity among advertisers who bid for ads on Google

03:39.160 --> 03:42.080
for this particular keyword.

03:42.210 --> 03:50.980
It's not sure about the volume or competition or strictly accurate but they do give a reasonable indication.

03:51.150 --> 03:53.830
I used two other methods a very occasion.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.250
I don't talk about these in a few minutes.

03:57.730 --> 04:05.870
At this point these focus keywords are indicative only the tools give us some indication of their competitiveness

04:06.140 --> 04:07.110
and their value.

04:09.610 --> 04:17.050
However it's a fact that over 50 percent of all the searches every day in Google have never been seen

04:17.050 --> 04:17.790
before.

04:17.970 --> 04:21.700
They are completely new to this.

04:21.700 --> 04:31.740
The fact that voice search is changing the way that Google is searched Voice Search tends to use question

04:31.740 --> 04:36.250
form in a much longer format than traditional text search.

04:37.080 --> 04:44.680
Also more and more older people are using the Internet older people tend to use much longer sentences

04:44.940 --> 04:51.630
in a questioning conversational tone even when they're writing text.

04:51.640 --> 04:57.850
This is why I say that the main focus keywords that we find using the method that I describe are just

04:57.880 --> 05:04.970
indicators only of course we would like to rank for these keywords because they are very good volumes

05:06.560 --> 05:12.890
but mostly the key words that we're looking for are enclosed in much longer search phrases that users

05:12.890 --> 05:15.920
tend to use with Google.

05:16.010 --> 05:22.510
It's these longer search phrases that we need to make sure are included in the text included in our

05:22.510 --> 05:23.870
site posts.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.710
Because of increased competitiveness it's in our interest to choose a keyword with a reasonable volume

05:31.980 --> 05:34.770
but with relatively low competition.

05:35.070 --> 05:40.530
This is becoming more and more difficult but helped by the fact that more and more searches are being

05:40.530 --> 05:49.460
used that are completely new in google many marketers focus on keywords with high volumes and therefore

05:49.460 --> 05:51.480
high competition.

05:51.500 --> 05:57.400
The logic is that if they get to page one with a high volume key word they will make a lot of money.

05:58.620 --> 06:05.150
But the sad truth is that with a competitive keyword it will take a long time to get to page one.

06:05.520 --> 06:13.240
If you get there at all so don't be too concerned if you have a post that is focused on a key word that

06:13.240 --> 06:18.170
maybe only has between 50 to 100 searches a month.

06:18.340 --> 06:22.660
First of all the tools that Google provides are not too accurate.

06:22.750 --> 06:27.320
So maybe you'll get more than 50 to 100 searches a month.

06:27.410 --> 06:35.750
And secondly if you have 100 posts on your website focusing on a keyword with 100 searches a month and

06:35.750 --> 06:44.380
they all reach the top half of page one Google search you will be making money.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.760
Now back to keyword verification.

06:47.930 --> 06:55.410
Once I have a key word in mind a focus keyword for one of the posts using the tool keywords everywhere

06:55.920 --> 07:06.920
I normally verify in two ways first enclose the query in inverted commas to show how many pages have

07:06.920 --> 07:09.600
that exact phrase.

07:09.770 --> 07:16.040
If the result is less than a thousand is probably a good candidate.

07:16.370 --> 07:22.930
Then I use another tool keyword revealer to check further.

07:22.950 --> 07:26.650
There's also a free planner limited to just three searches a day.

07:26.790 --> 07:28.430
But this is often sufficient.

07:47.750 --> 07:52.760
Simply click the button to see the Assessed competition.

07:52.800 --> 08:00.960
The tool also lists related phrases that you might not have thought of.

08:00.980 --> 08:08.410
I love a nice feature of the key word every word too is that it offers related suggestions which also

08:08.410 --> 08:10.600
show volumes and competition.

08:12.550 --> 08:18.730
Often this tool alone reveals interesting phrases with decent volume that you might not have thought

08:18.730 --> 08:22.180
of.

08:22.400 --> 08:28.790
Once you've chosen your domain name that includes your main key word and you have 100 key words that

08:28.790 --> 08:33.210
are the targets of your posts and you or else you can proceed.

08:34.200 --> 08:39.090
In the next video I'm going to run quickly through a basic WordPress installation.
