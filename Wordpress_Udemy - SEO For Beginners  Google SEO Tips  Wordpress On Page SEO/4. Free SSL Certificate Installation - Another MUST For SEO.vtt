00:01.250 --> 00:04.600
I'm pleased you're still here with me.

00:04.680 --> 00:11.430
The previous video was quite detailed and basic but I wanted to provide everything that I include in

00:11.430 --> 00:18.880
my own site so that you can maximize your success and copy exactly what I do.

00:18.880 --> 00:26.900
I love the fact that Google is very serious about privacy and security of the users on the internet.

00:28.540 --> 00:34.090
S S L stands for secure sockets layer and it's a protocol.

00:34.090 --> 00:41.160
The labels are very secure connection between the user's browser and the server where the Web site lists

00:42.240 --> 00:47.100
many internet users will not buy from a Web site that is not secure.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.640
I will not give their private information.

00:50.640 --> 00:58.800
The s at the end of h t t p means that the link between the sites the browser and the server is secure

00:59.340 --> 01:04.030
it is encrypted to a very high standard.

01:04.290 --> 01:11.370
One of my sites has an expired certificate so I install a new one to show you the procedure.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.310
I use SSL for free.

01:14.310 --> 01:16.140
Dot com.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.790
The certificates are free but only last for three months.

01:21.980 --> 01:30.870
You receive an email one week before expiry So it's not too much of a hassle to renew Here's my site

01:32.160 --> 01:38.220
and before I click next to the u r l in the browser bar a message pops up telling me that the site is

01:38.220 --> 01:39.640
not secure.

01:41.670 --> 01:49.490
Next up I'll go to the SSL for free dashboard as a previous client.

02:49.040 --> 02:58.040
We now need to create two folders using See panel 1 called Dot well known and ask me challenge

03:12.270 --> 03:14.020
after the files are uploaded.

03:14.070 --> 03:18.780

03:37.190 --> 03:42.320
Click the file manager and then public h t and l

03:45.110 --> 03:51.160
even though I previously create the folders required these are not visible.

03:51.590 --> 03:56.390
This is because files and folder names proceeds with a dot are normally hidden

04:00.330 --> 04:07.390
click Settings and take show hidden files to display the folder not well known

04:17.230 --> 04:26.630
the folder Acme challenge is inside this folder and the two files inside the folder can be deleted as

they have expired

04:30.290 --> 04:31.460
for a new site.

04:31.550 --> 04:35.530
You will create these folders ready to hold the verification files.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.390
Once the files are uploaded go back to SSL for free.

05:14.390 --> 05:17.870

07:29.800 --> 07:34.320

07:34.360 --> 07:35.860
The installation is complete

07:38.610 --> 07:40.540

07:40.590 --> 07:52.260
I can see that you are ill is preceded by h t t p s and the site is now secure before creating content

07:52.590 --> 07:53.840
in the next video.

07:54.030 --> 08:01.110
I'm going to go over a few points explaining and demonstrating what constitutes a good post for SEO

08:01.290 --> 08:03.330
