Before creating a post we look at some of the practices and elements that are important in the eyes

00:07.830 --> 00:17.250
of Google Search Google gives precedent to articles and post content that is highly relevant to the

00:17.250 --> 00:26.280
search phrase and also is the very best quality variations of the post focus keyword are called LSI

00:26.290 --> 00:31.450
phrases which stands for Latent Semantic indexing

00:33.980 --> 00:37.020
So robots are becoming very sophisticated.

00:37.340 --> 00:44.540
They can even tell if your article is written in a light hearted manner whether it's serious or it is

00:44.630 --> 00:46.190
academic approach.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.810
However they can tell if the text or the page is interesting to a visitor.

00:55.010 --> 01:00.860
The only way they can really tell is how long the visitor stays on the page and how he reacts to the

01:00.860 --> 01:03.310
content on that page.

01:04.010 --> 01:11.930
Posting long articles of 3000 words helps to keep visitors but it must be attractively laid out and

01:11.930 --> 01:17.900
broken up with other page elements also combined with rich content.

01:19.930 --> 01:27.860
Rich content includes video sound text and pictograph images.

01:27.950 --> 01:31.770
You learn how to create long content in the next video.

01:32.090 --> 01:36.100
But for now we're going to look at how such a post should be structured.

01:39.410 --> 01:48.990
The first opportunity to tell search box what your post is all about is in the post you are el by default.

01:49.020 --> 01:54.100
This is a month stroke data type of format and is quite ugly.

01:55.460 --> 02:02.720
Changes are setting in the Wordpress dashboard to the domain dot com or whatever your extension is.

02:02.960 --> 02:13.770
And the key word this looks shouldn't be too long and contains the Post's focus keyword a variation

02:13.770 --> 02:20.720
of the keyword is a longer phrase and is then used for the title words Press codes.

02:20.760 --> 02:27.520
The title has H-1 another variation can be used as a subtitle.

02:27.540 --> 02:33.610
Further on down the page and this is tagged page to.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.570
You can carry on and do the same with age 3 and 8 for attacks.

02:42.020 --> 02:49.050
The main focus keyword can be inserted in the first 100 words and then the final 100 words.

02:49.050 --> 02:50.180
And this is sufficient

02:53.250 --> 02:57.640
so so-called keyword density is not important.

02:58.130 --> 03:00.280
But LSI keywords or

03:04.750 --> 03:14.950
lxi stands for latents semantic indexing these keywords are not just synonyms although they can be that

03:15.050 --> 03:20.870
they are words and phrases frequently placed within text relating to your focus.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.890
Keyword.

03:23.090 --> 03:28.660
This is how Google decides how relevant your page is to any particular search phrase.

03:29.150 --> 03:34.350
And it also serves to remove ambiguity is.

03:34.510 --> 03:44.020
For example if the main focus keyword is best auto paint is possible that the word auto couldn't be

03:44.110 --> 03:45.880
automatic.

03:46.150 --> 03:49.270
The sewage robots just don't know.

03:49.330 --> 03:57.920
They decide by searching for latent semantic indexing words throughout out the text.

03:58.100 --> 04:07.960
If they're a reference to bodywork to cars or body shops in your article then it's safe to assume that

04:07.960 --> 04:11.120
it also refers to automobile

04:14.120 --> 04:21.990
don't worry about LSI keywords any well-written article is filled with them particularly when treated

04:22.010 --> 04:24.750
in the way that I'm going to show you later on.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.590
Use plenty of images to break up the text and spread out the text with plenty of spacing above and below.

04:36.650 --> 04:40.050
Short paragraphs.

04:40.270 --> 04:48.160
You could also use the quote function in bold and italic fonts to enhance the text appearance.

04:48.160 --> 04:54.930
This adds variety blocks of text are difficult to read and not easy on the eye.

05:00.250 --> 05:07.230
Rename images before uploading so that they contain variables of the focus keyword in the filename

05:09.800 --> 05:43.460
another keyword variation or LSI can then be added to the Olt text field for that image.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.670
In general images should be large relevant and eye catching.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.350
Pictographs are great.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.060
They contain info in picture format.

05:55.060 --> 05:59.560
The visit is really like so they tend to stay longer on the page

06:02.950 --> 06:07.600
always add at least one YouTube embedded video to your posts.

06:09.030 --> 06:17.740
If possible the title and the description should contain the focus key word or a close variation.

06:17.800 --> 06:24.000
We will revisit the subject of videos where we create post content in the next lesson.

06:24.010 --> 06:32.620
Google loves to find rich content on your post which content is different styles of content like MP

06:32.620 --> 06:34.380
3.

06:34.470 --> 06:41.930
You can convert the video they have to embed to an MP 3 file and also embed that underneath the video

06:46.360 --> 06:50.680
create a PTF file of the text and load it to the post.

06:59.870 --> 07:08.210
In total linking to other similar posts on your own side re-inforces relevance and two or three links

07:08.210 --> 07:09.160
to every article

07:12.290 --> 07:18.440
are two links to Authority Web sites.

07:18.440 --> 07:26.030
Normally I would enter my focus keyword into Google and link out to one of the top three results.

07:26.030 --> 07:27.830
Unless they are competitors of course

07:33.050 --> 07:36.830
into 10 to 20 related keywords as post tags

07:43.120 --> 07:45.590
a significant amount of traffic can come through.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.900
Tag you or else

07:50.440 --> 07:57.610
I also add three to four keywords as meta tags using the meta tags manager at the bottom of the post

07:57.700 --> 07:58.500
edit page

08:25.390 --> 08:33.880
and Leslie and add social sharing Botham's social traffic is a good indicator of post popularity for

08:33.880 --> 08:42.660
Google search and then the next video I'll show you how to create unique content of between two to three

08:42.660 --> 08:44.910
thousand words in even with our.
