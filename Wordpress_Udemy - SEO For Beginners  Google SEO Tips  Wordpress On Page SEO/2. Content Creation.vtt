00:00.520 --> 00:08.340
At the beginning of this training I said that we would aim to have a site with about 100 posts to start

00:08.340 --> 00:09.410
off with.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.160
That's a lot of posts.

00:12.390 --> 00:15.930
If you had to write one a day it would be a lot of work.

00:16.230 --> 00:23.330
Given that each one needs to be unique focused on a particular keyword and relevant to Google Search

00:24.740 --> 00:27.730
paying for high quality articles is not an option.

00:27.800 --> 00:35.520
Because it's too expensive and even the best articles spinning has no place on a quality web site like

00:35.520 --> 00:37.520
yours is going to be.

00:37.710 --> 00:44.790
The answer is to use YouTube video transcripts the transcripts and the videos are publicly available

00:45.510 --> 00:52.270
and it's breaking no kind of rule or ethics to publish the content on your own site.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.910
In fact it provides extra exposure to the video creator.

00:57.600 --> 01:02.120
Particularly if your post goes to the top of page one.

01:02.280 --> 01:08.310
In addition to the video embed I also link out to the creators channel as an extra Thank you.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.460
Into your focus Keywood into youtube search

01:24.760 --> 01:32.470
choose a video with a title that contains that key word or a very close variation of it and click it

01:32.470 --> 01:40.120
to view.

01:40.290 --> 01:46.730
Click on the three dots underneath the video and choose Open transcript.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.390
The text will appear on the right hand side

01:52.220 --> 02:01.010
default settings is to display the timestamps click toggle time stamps to remove them

02:04.740 --> 02:08.420
copy all of the text and paste into a word processor.

02:19.810 --> 02:29.550
As you can see the text is truncated into half sentences with double spaced lines between click Edit

02:29.670 --> 02:31.820
and choose Find and Replace

02:34.840 --> 02:37.640
set the find field to the oldest.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.080
And enter a space in the replace field

02:45.250 --> 02:48.910
click replace all and the text will be normalized

02:52.280 --> 02:52.580
now.

02:52.580 --> 02:58.900
Set the text size to 11 on the font to Colibri before continuing.

03:03.170 --> 03:09.060
We need to verify the uniqueness of this text in Google.

03:09.090 --> 03:16.680
You can use an online plagiarism checker or simply choose two or three short sections and copy paste

03:16.680 --> 03:18.570
them into google search

03:25.440 --> 03:30.850
surrounded by speech morgue's and click for the results.

03:38.220 --> 03:41.370
If no results are found you can proceed.

03:50.130 --> 03:57.390
The last stage in preparing the takes ready for posting is to punctuate and separated into short paragraphs

03:57.600 --> 03:59.370
of a few sentences each

04:16.860 --> 04:23.360
the punctuation phase is the most time consuming but with a little practice it becomes quite quick.

04:24.640 --> 04:30.890
In the next lesson we're going to take this text and create a structured post using the lessons for

04:30.910 --> 04:33.570
s c o that we learned previously.
