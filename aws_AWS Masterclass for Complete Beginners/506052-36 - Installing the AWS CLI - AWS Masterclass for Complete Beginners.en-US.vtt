00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.570
In this section I'm going to be going over how to install the AWS CLI for Windows,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.415
Mac OS, and Linux.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.750
I've put all of this into one single video because it's, it's pretty quick.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.980
For all of them.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.825
There is no long process.

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:20.505
In fact, it's so easy that I probably didn't even need to record this video.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.530
But I just want to be thorough.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.400
So you can skip ahead to whichever OS you're using.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.910
Or you can just stick through this whole video just so you can learn how to do it.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.280
Especially if you're working in an environment where you're not really sure

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.005
if you're going to be needing to install this on Windows or Mac OS or Linux.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.625
So it doesn't hurt.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:45.050
Obviously, we're starting with Windows and we're going to be ending with Linux,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.840
because I'm going to be actually using Linux myself.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.625
And I'll have hands-on for both the Windows and Linux parts of this video,

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.870
but not for the macOS because I do not own a Mac and I do not want to own a Mac.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.215
And I frankly, you know, there's no need.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:02.540
If it was a long complex process,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.720
then I would have sought out a friend with a Mac or some like that.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.400
But at any stage,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.670
so that this video, if you do encounter problems installing the CLI,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.940
just search for the ADOS documentation on how to install AD or CLI.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.070
It's very thoroughly documented.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.705
You shouldn't have any problems.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:25.025
Keep in mind, we will be using AWS CLI version 2,

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:27.320
version 1 as a recording this video there's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.400
only one and versions 12 will be using Version 2 only.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.165
And with that, let's get started with how to install the AWS CLI on a Windows system.

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:40.775
I'm just some very quick prerequisites.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:44.855
You should have a 64 bit version of Windows XP or later.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.610
So if you don't,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.440
you're kind of out of luck.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.665
But yeah, so that's just a prerequisite.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:54.950
And then you should have admin rights to install software, right?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.720
If you're a college student,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.390
you're using the laboratory at scores on like that.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.310
The computer lab, it might not work.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.155
So you do need to contact whoever does have admin rights to let you install the CLI.

00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:14.645
So with that, you will download the latest AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows 64-bit.

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:16.610
And the link for that is right here.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.605
You can just type that in. It's really easy.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:26.540
Cli dot amazon, AWS.com slash AWS CLI V2 in capital letters dot MSI.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.735
So this will download the latest version,

00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:32.390
meaning if by the time you're watching this video,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.775
there is another version out than the version I'm using here. It can download that.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:42.275
So there are ways you can specify in the URL

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:47.630
which version specifically you want to install or to download.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.715
And if you're interested in that,

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:54.035
just go look up the documentation on AWS and they'll show you how to do that.

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:56.135
Now, once you download it,

00:02:56.135 --> 00:03:01.280
you will run the downloaded MSI installer and follow the onscreen instructions.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.655
I will be walking you through all of this shortly.

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:09.935
So by default data versa installs to Program Files,

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:13.085
Amazon AWS CLI v2.

00:03:13.085 --> 00:03:13.625
Okay.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.875
And you can change the uninstalling,

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:20.810
but I don't see any reason you need to.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.970
So we're just going to stick with the default.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.920
And to confirm the installation,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.160
you will open the Start Menu search for cmd,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.500
which is the command prompt, right?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.900
And open up the command prompt window.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.475
And at the command prompt,

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:39.260
use the command AWS and dash dash version.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.300
So I'm going to be showing you this as well.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.250
Essentially, this is the output you're looking for or something along these lines.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.190
And it might not be 2.1.24,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.190
it might be 2.2, whatever, right?

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.470
And then the Python version will be different,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.580
and so on and so forth.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.925
But essentially, you want there to be some sort of

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:03.785
output here to confirm that AWS CLI has been downloaded.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:07.385
If you get some sort of area or command not found or something like that,

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:10.280
that means that something went wrong in the process.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.565
So just you have to troubleshoot on your own.

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:15.740
Just look through the documentation on AWS.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.300
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.660
Essentially, all the commands we are going to be running on AWS,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.440
CLI will be run using AWS, right?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.200
And then we'd specify either the tags,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.675
which are the options, or additional commands.

00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:32.120
So we're going to be learning about that later on in this section.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.225
So that's, that's it for installing Windows.

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:39.200
Let's jump into the hands-on where I will

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.270
actually do all of this for you so you

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.655
can see it and you can follow along with me as well.

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:46.085
So here we are in the browser.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.980
I have my Chrome browser open,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.015
and I just happened to be on AWS homepage.

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:59.705
But I've pasted the URL to the MSI installer,

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:06.620
the one that you need in order to install the Amazon CLI onto your Windows computer.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.965
So when I press Enter here,

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:12.455
it's gonna go ahead and download.

00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:18.320
Now keep in mind that we are using AWS CLI version two and version one.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.735
You should also be using Version 2.

00:05:20.735 --> 00:05:23.180
There is no reason for you to use version one,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.445
especially if you're following along with me.

00:05:25.445 --> 00:05:27.320
Maybe by the time you're watching this video,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.820
there might be a third version or something,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.795
I don't know, but just know that I'm using version two.

00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:33.800
And there we go.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.705
The installer has downloaded.

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:39.185
Let's go ahead and click it to munch it.

00:05:39.185 --> 00:05:43.050
And once it launches,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.530
let's just give it some time.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.620
There we go. Now it's actually completely finished installing.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.390
So now we can click it and it will launch prepared to install.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.320
We're just going to go with the defaults for everything I do accept.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.829
Just go next and install.

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:10.060
And we're going to need to give it permission.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.760
And it's installing.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.480
So it's a pretty quick process.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.725
There shouldn't really be any complications if you do encounter any issues,

00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:26.575
just go ahead and just search AWS CLI for Windows,

00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:28.690
how to or something like that.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.565
And it always has some very thorough documentation on any of the different.

00:06:32.565 --> 00:06:40.985
Issues that you might encounter when trying to install AWS CLI until Windows machine.

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:42.905
And there we go, that's it.

00:06:42.905 --> 00:06:44.750
Click Finish.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:51.440
And now if we open up the command line, like so,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.305
we have access to,

00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:58.490
we can check if we have 80 versus properly installed by

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.440
typing in AWS slice or dash, dash version.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.390
And there we go.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:12.020
We do in fact have AWS CLI version 2.1.27 installed.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.890
And it's using Python 3.7.9 in the backend to actually access the API.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.845
The diversity was APIs.

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:26.345
So this is working like a charm.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:32.885
You can now use any of the AWS CLI commands from the terminal.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:36.380
We're going to be getting into those later on in this section.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.820
But that's, that's it.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.740
It's nice and quick.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.640
That's how you install AWS CLI for Windows.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.560
So we just installed the AWS CLI on Windows.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.505
Now I'm going to be quickly showing you how to do it on MacOS.

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:56.900
However, there will not be a hands-on section to this part of the video.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.090
As I mentioned in the beginning of the video.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.630
So let's just go right in the prerequisites are

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.145
that you have an Apple supported version of 64-bit Mac OS,

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:09.515
and that's pretty much it.

00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:13.670
So the first thing you'll do is you'll go to your browser and download

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:19.850
the pk file of the latest version of the AWS CLI.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.730
Again, that will be version two.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.950
And this is where you can find it,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.430
just like we did in the Window section of the video.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.630
And then you double-click on the downloaded file to launch the installer.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.745
Follow the onscreen instructions.

00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:38.439
You can install to any folder.

00:08:38.439 --> 00:08:42.745
But if you just go with the defaults which I recommend,

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:44.590
just so you don't mess anything up.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:51.640
It will choose the default folder of slash users slash local slash AWS, CLI.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.970
And by default, this will install for all users.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.080
And if you do want to install for only the current user,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.895
you can just look up the documentation on AWS and you can do that as well.

00:09:06.895 --> 00:09:13.990
And then to verify that the shell can find and run the AWS command in your path.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.000
You will use the following commands.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.154
So you can just type which AWS and that'll show you its location.

00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:24.980
Then you can type in AWS dash,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.985
dash version and you should get an output like this,

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.470
something similar to that end.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.675
If you do, again, get something like command not found or errors,

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:39.050
that means you did something wrong in one of these steps.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:44.345
So just try to redo it if not troubleshoot using the AWS documentation.

00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:46.925
So that's pretty much it.

00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:50.930
Just as easy, just as straightforward as installing on Windows.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.115
Now let's see how we can do this for Linux.

00:09:55.115 --> 00:10:03.200
And finally, let us learn how to install the AWS CLI on a Linux system.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.300
This is also very straightforward.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.115
And generally, you know, as,

00:10:07.115 --> 00:10:08.480
as you probably know,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.285
it's easier to install it on Linux anyway.

00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:13.670
So it's best saved for last.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.285
And again, let me remind you that I will be using

00:10:17.285 --> 00:10:23.030
a Linux system for my AWS CLI for the duration of this course,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.330
even though I do have a PC,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.605
I'm going to be choosing to use an AWS CLI for this course.

00:10:30.605 --> 00:10:38.400
So the prerequisites are you must be able to extract or unzip the downloaded package.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.530
If you're operating system doesn't have a built-in unzip command,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.525
use an equivalent, okay?

00:10:43.525 --> 00:10:47.170
The AOCL librarian to uses G lib,

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.240
c, graph, and less.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.545
These are included by default in most major distributions of Linux.

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:55.255
So you shouldn't have a problem.

00:10:55.255 --> 00:11:01.645
I'm going to be installing the AWS CLI on an Ubuntu 20 kernel.

00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:04.570
So that's not going to be problem.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:11.380
And 64 bit versions of recent solutions of Santos,

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.710
Fedora, Ubuntu, and the Amazon Linux distributions as

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.160
well are what are compatible with AWS CLI.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.715
So just make sure you have one of these.

00:11:20.715 --> 00:11:24.470
Otherwise, you might have some problems.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:30.740
And you can also install the aid of a CLI on 64 bit Linux ARM,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.570
which I will not be showing you how to do,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.760
but it's going to be pretty similar.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.210
Just the installer, the link for the installer is going to be different.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.950
So you'll have to look that up as well.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.125
Again, just use eight hours documentation.

00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:48.080
They have everything very clearly explained and presented there.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.320
So the first thing you're gonna do is in the terminal you're

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.035
going to run curl and then this link.

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:59.210
So this is essentially pretty much the same way we,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.255
we installed for Mac OS and Windows.

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.890
It's just a lake that has installer.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.190
In this case, it's zipped and we're using

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.270
curl to just fetch that from the URL in the terminal.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.700
So you're going to do this in terminal and we're going to save it

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.885
to your native OCL CLI, V2 dot zip.

00:12:17.885 --> 00:12:21.380
And we're going to unzip it like so.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.390
And then just run sudo dot-dot slash AWS slash install.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:30.590
And that will basically initiate the installment or the installation.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.050
And then that's pretty much it.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.625
And you're ready to go. So let's jump straight into a terminal and do that ourselves.

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:44.770
So here we are in an Ubuntu terminal and

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:50.410
we can just go ahead and just check very quickly to see if eta versus installed.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.765
And we can see that it has not been installed.

00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:57.115
And we're gonna go ahead and first download the installer,

00:12:57.115 --> 00:12:58.705
which will be a zip,

00:12:58.705 --> 00:13:00.925
which were in the form of a zip file.

00:13:00.925 --> 00:13:04.600
And we're going to save it into AWS CLI V2.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.250
Let's go ahead and do that.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:13.360
So it's downloading the installer for the CLI for Linux.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.255
And let us, let it do that.

00:13:16.255 --> 00:13:17.800
It shouldn't take too long.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.670
There we go.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:25.890
And then we can go ahead and unzip and AWS CLI, V2 dot zip.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.650
For unzipping again, you need to have

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.300
units we're able to extract or unzip the downloaded packet.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.729
So if you don't have unzip,

00:13:37.729 --> 00:13:41.120
you can have, you know, you can do something else as well, just install unzip.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.044
And then finally we're going to run the installer,

00:13:44.044 --> 00:13:48.810
pseudo dot slash slash install.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.530
And there we go.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.760
We should have it installed.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.415
And how do we check? Let's go ahead and clear.

00:13:55.415 --> 00:14:00.740
How do we check AWS dash version?

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.700
And there we go.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.670
We have AWS CLI 2.1,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.190
27 installed using Python,

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.190
3.7.3, et cetera, et cetera.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:17.420
Okay, so that's how you install the AWS CLI on a Linux system.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.470
And in the next video I'm gonna be showing you how we can now

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:26.390
configure this so that we can start using it, right?

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.890
Because right now the CLI is installed and all of our systems,

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.300
but it doesn't know which account we want to access and that kind of stuff.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.010
So we're going to be configuring that,

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.605
all of that in the next video.

00:14:39.605 --> 00:14:41.135
So I will see you then.

00:14:41.135 --> 00:14:42.690
Thanks. Why.
