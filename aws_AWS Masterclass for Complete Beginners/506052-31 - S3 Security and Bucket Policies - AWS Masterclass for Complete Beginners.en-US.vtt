00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.295
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:06.870
And in this video we're going to be discussing S3 security.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.830
So this is also very important topic, right, for S3.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.945
Because whereas with encryption,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.160
we defined data security in terms of who

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.570
was actually able to read the data once they've been able to acquire it.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.160
But with security, we're limiting who can actually access it in the first place.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.055
So they both play a crucial role in securing your S3 data and your S3 services.

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:38.840
So a very common way of securing S3 object is through policies.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.885
And policies are defined as JSON objects,

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:44.810
just like with any other service on AWS.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.175
And I'm gonna be showing you how to,

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:50.960
how we can create as two policies without really knowing how to structure.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.995
These are objects in the hands-on section of this video.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:59.674
And these policies can be set at two different levels.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:02.885
They can be set at the resource level.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:09.814
So you can have an S3 bucket policy or a KMS key policy.

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:12.620
Or they can be set at the identity level.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.270
So you can have an IAM policy and determine how

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.140
different identities are able to access your S3 buckets and objects.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.625
A resource-based policies defined per S3 bucket,

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:34.759
namely bucket policy or KMS key, key policy.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.845
Whereas an identity-based policies defined per IAM user or role,

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:42.440
I'm not going to be going into defining

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.985
identity-based policies for S3 buckets in this video,

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:53.360
because that's more of an IM or more of a general policy topic.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.010
And here we're just here,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.540
we're just talking about S3 security.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.810
So we know that just like we could create policies

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.565
for any other service on AWS for an AIM user or role.

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:07.535
You can also do that for S3 as well.

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:10.190
So in this video, we're just going to be mainly focusing on

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.379
the resource level policies or more specifically the bucket policies.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.940
And you can remove public as access from all your S3 bucket unless it's

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.530
necessary in an exception would be that buckets contain public data,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.705
you know, if it's a website or something like that.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:30.425
And this is best practice.

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:34.445
There have been issues in the past where leaks have occurred

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:38.330
due to buckets being public by default,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.055
but AWS has changed that.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.490
So just make sure that unless

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.080
the use of your S3 bucket is for specifically for public access,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.635
just make sure that you do remove all public access from your S3 buckets.

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:53.780
And definitely follow the principle of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.690
least privilege when configuring access to as the what gets you.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.460
That's a very standard practice,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.420
best practice for security of all types of systems.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.465
But the same applies for S3 as well.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:10.520
And always use encryption to encrypt files and the S3 bucket itself.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.950
So we learned in the last video.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.035
How to encrypt both as S3 files as well as buckets.

00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:21.800
So just do that by default, it doesn't hurt you.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.380
It doesn't really affect anything.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.530
It doesn't have, the cost doesn't change,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.585
the speed doesn't change.

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:30.860
Nothing really changes.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.080
So it's, you know,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.090
there's really no reason to do it.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.930
In the worst case is pick the default SSE, S3,

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.230
the default option, so you don't even have to deal with keys and that kind of stuff,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.660
but always encrypt your files.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.050
That's generally accepted best practice.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.820
And it's recommended to enable S3 bucket logging and all S3 bucket.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.200
So if, if a breach does happen or some sort of

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.090
issue arises with encryption and security or data access

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.260
or data lakes or something like that.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.450
You have, you know,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.565
kind of a trail that lead you to where the problem arose from,

00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:11.900
what the issue was,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.210
the cause of bridge, so on and so forth.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.300
But again, we're not going to be covering anything

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.960
except S3 security pocket policies in this video.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.155
So but it's worth mentioning.

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:27.230
Now, when it comes to S3 bucket policies,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.020
they are basically a Resource-Based AWS Identity and Access Management policy.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.490
So they are JSON objects and you have complete control over basically everything.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.220
So that's the reason that JSON objects because there's so many different possibilities,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.770
so many different combinations of an options that you

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.700
can basically implement when it comes to security policies.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.150
So by default, all Amazon S3 buckets and objects are private.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.900
So again, before that was really the case,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.050
and breaches happen and leaks happen, so on and so forth.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.035
So now by default are all private.

00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:12.710
Only the resource owner and the Ada was account that created

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.135
a bucket can access that bucket any object that contains by default, right?

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:20.510
So if you want it to be different, right?

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.020
If you want it to be viewable by somebody else or something like that,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.075
you're going to have to change the policy, changes the settings.

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:34.670
And like I mentioned, they are JSON based policies consisting of resources.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.920
So in a buckets and objects,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.290
actions in a set of API to allow or deny something.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.630
So when you're setting the policy,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.350
you can allow for something or denied for somebody.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.060
I'm going to show you an example in the next video.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.530
It's going to make more sense.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.740
And then the effect, again,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.890
allow or deny and the principal,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.460
the account or user to which the policy is applied.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.085
So you can set certain policies depending on the account or the user.

00:06:07.085 --> 00:06:09.755
And policies are very deep topic.

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:11.990
It's not something we can just cover in one video,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.360
but I'm going to be showing you how to create

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.985
just a very simple policy for us through security.

00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:25.790
But everybody is going to have different needs when it comes to security policies.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.905
So generally, you know,

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:30.680
you can just search on Google like for

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.830
your particular need and how to create a policy for us three,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.005
and then you most like a fine some AWS doc that

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:40.715
Explains to you exactly like

00:06:40.715 --> 00:06:43.850
the different headers and different key values in that kind of stuff that you need

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.650
to set in your policy in order to achieve what what you're seeking to achieve.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.330
So don't expect to be an expert in security policies to be able to use this right,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.675
just use Google, use a demo stocks to be able to find what you need.

00:06:56.675 --> 00:06:59.120
So let's just jump straight in and I'll show you how

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.015
to create a security policy for us three.

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:06.605
So here we are within our bucket,

00:07:06.605 --> 00:07:11.000
and from here we can go into permissions.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.650
And under permissions, we have bucket policy, okay?

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.710
The bucket policy written in JSON provides access to the objects stored in the bucket.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.740
Bucket policies don't apply to objects owned by other accounts.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.340
Okay.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.250
So these are Bucket policies, right?

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.840
It's in the name bucket policies.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.365
So you're going to have to create a different policy for each bucket, right?

00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:38.855
It's not it's not a county-wide.

00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:41.225
And so let's go ahead and edit.

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:43.280
And you can click here.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.445
And this will take you to a link on Amazon dogs

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:49.880
just as examples for backup policies and that kinda stuff in.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.350
And you can read through this.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.200
And like I said, this is a very complex topic.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.840
And it's not the topic of this video or this section.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.510
But if you're interested in further examples,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.400
you can even go on and on.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.535
You can find that link from here.

00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:09.920
But we're going to just use the policy generator.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.110
So Amazon S3 or Amazon actually from

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.420
hazards for use for policy generator that you can use for different types of services.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.595
So you can use it for SQS,

00:08:22.595 --> 00:08:25.850
S3, VPC, IAM, and SNS.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.870
So these are all different services on AWS that require, um,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:36.140
or they don't require what they are able to use JSON policies.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.780
And so you can generate the policies here so you don't have to write up

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:44.210
a JSON code or the JSON file buyers by hand.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.625
So we're going to select policy type,

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.830
we're going to select S3 bucket policy because

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.110
that's what we're focused on. In this section.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.210
We're working with S3.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.300
And we want to create a policy, security policy type,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.850
security policy for S3,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.385
for S3 bucket specifically.

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:05.180
And, and then we define the statements.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.645
So for this example,

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:13.130
we're going to deny any file being

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:18.335
uploaded into our bucket that is not encrypted using SSE S3.

00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:22.520
Again, it's a fairly straightforward example,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.710
probably applicable to a lot of people.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.915
If you want to basically enforce the policy

00:09:29.915 --> 00:09:36.275
that the objects being uploaded onto your bucket need to be encrypted.

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:41.465
And not only that, they need to be encrypted using a certain type of encryption,

00:09:41.465 --> 00:09:43.640
then that's an example,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.860
very specific security policy,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.425
um, that I wouldn't that wouldn't really make sense to have

00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:50.930
options for within the visual, right?

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.040
The web console.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.525
So that's why.

00:09:53.525 --> 00:09:58.595
Power of JSON comes into play because you can define any combination,

00:09:58.595 --> 00:10:00.680
any type of policy.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.720
And so let's go ahead and do that.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.500
So by the effect is denied because we're going

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.310
to be denying file uploads for certain conditions, right?

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.710
So deny.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.205
And the principle is,

00:10:16.205 --> 00:10:18.274
if you remember from the slides,

00:10:18.274 --> 00:10:21.560
the account or user to which the policy is applied.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.485
So we're just going to use a star here.

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:27.680
Because this should be applied to everybody by default,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.325
we're going to specify any certain type of user account

00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:36.075
in anybody who's using this bucket should have this policy apply to them.

00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:39.520
And then under Actions,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.840
we can select it.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.220
You can see that there are a whole bunch of different actions you can select from.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.370
And you can apply policies to each other,

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.170
any, any one of these actions.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.350
So you can take your time to go through and just familiar,

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:57.790
familiarize yourself with the different actions

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.460
that you can use in your security policies.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.610
It's quite detailed.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.160
You have control over quite a lot.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.314
But we're going to be basically using,

00:11:10.314 --> 00:11:14.724
Let's find it. Put object.

00:11:14.724 --> 00:11:19.045
So we're going to be denying the put object action.

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:23.500
So putting an object into our bucket,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.645
that's what we want to apply this to.

00:11:25.645 --> 00:11:28.600
And then here we have to,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.990
we reference using the Amazon resource name,

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.850
the bucket that we want to apply this policy to.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.680
So if we go back into

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.020
the S3 management console where we clicked on policy generator here you can see that

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.640
they've conveniently provided for us

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.340
the bucket ARN because they now we're going to be using it when regenerating a policy.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.040
So we'll go ahead and copy this.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.580
And we'll go ahead and paste that into here.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:03.730
And something that you should definitely watch out for is that here we have

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.040
to write slash star

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.660
because these policies will be applied to the objects within the bucket.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:15.850
So basically we're, we're referring to all the objects within that bucket,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.350
not the bucket itself.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.590
And so you need to refer to that using slash star, okay?

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.660
And then we're going to set the conditions, right?

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.975
Because if if you just had this as a policy,

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:27.835
it will just deny everything.

00:12:27.835 --> 00:12:31.150
Anybody putting any type of object without any conditions.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.665
So we have to add a condition.

00:12:32.665 --> 00:12:33.850
Now.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:39.415
The first condition we want to add is the null condition

00:12:39.415 --> 00:12:46.510
for the AWS or the story,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:54.325
I'm sorry, S3 x AMC server-side encryption header when it's set to true.

00:12:54.325 --> 00:13:00.490
Okay, so essentially we're setting the condition that when this header,

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.785
which determines whether or not,

00:13:02.785 --> 00:13:06.415
whether or not the encryption exists or there's encryption

00:13:06.415 --> 00:13:10.750
being applied to an object or a bucket when it's null.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.920
So when it doesn't exist,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.040
basically, we want this to trigger here.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:23.680
So this denying the put object action for this,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.730
for the, for the objects or for, for this bucket.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.730
This air and so we want that to trigger when this condition is met.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.105
So we can go ahead and add the condition.

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:40.550
And for some reason okay.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.715
This I hadn't the sediment properly copied.

00:13:43.715 --> 00:13:46.520
So I just went ahead and read it.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.380
And now it's, it's okay.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.020
So I just copy slash star.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.890
And now you can see that statement is available

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.550
so we can go ahead and add that statement to our policy.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:04.895
And then we're going to be applying one more condition.

00:14:04.895 --> 00:14:07.370
And we're going to deny condition.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.565
We're going to be applying it to everybody who's using this bucket.

00:14:10.565 --> 00:14:15.844
And again, we're going to be using the put object action.

00:14:15.844 --> 00:14:25.940
We have to find it put object here and the same ARN slash star.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.265
And we're going to be adding a condition.

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:33.095
And the condition is going to be, in this case,

00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:38.930
string not equals the same header.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.084
So server-side encryption.

00:14:43.084 --> 00:14:49.580
And when it's not equal to AES 256.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.380
Now, this is basically the value that this header will have if

00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:00.230
the encryption type of upload object is SSE S3.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:06.620
So essentially here, the point of this whole policies to limit or to prevent

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:13.280
people from uploading any objects to the bucket unless the object has SSE S3 encryption.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.585
Now you might be asking,

00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:16.550
how am I supposed to know?

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.035
Aes-256 means SSE S3 and so on and so forth.

00:15:21.035 --> 00:15:23.330
Again, expected to know

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.920
all the different possibilities of

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.965
all the different ways you can write security policies with JSON.

00:15:27.965 --> 00:15:29.855
Now at this level obviously.

00:15:29.855 --> 00:15:32.510
Now, so when you do need something, you're just going to Google it.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.020
So like what did I do when I wanted to create this policy?

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.860
I googled.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.495
How do you create a policy to limit?

00:15:41.495 --> 00:15:44.480
However you search for that kind of stuff.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.970
Basically, you know, you can be more specific like prevent,

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.500
put object for us, three,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.720
for encryption or something like that.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.200
And you'll find an AWS doc that basically walks you through it or gives you

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.535
the key points like the values and the different headers that are used.

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:05.915
And you know, after defining a couple of policies on your own, right,

00:16:05.915 --> 00:16:07.250
There aren't that many headers actually,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.945
so It's going to become pretty intuitive for you to kind of experiment and figure it out.

00:16:11.945 --> 00:16:14.195
And when you do have a question about one of these,

00:16:14.195 --> 00:16:16.730
you know, it's easy to search and find them in the docs and that kind of stuff.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.405
So anyway, let's go ahead and,

00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:23.375
and others condition at the statement.

00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:28.280
And now we have the two statements that we want in our policy.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.725
And we can go ahead and generate a policy.

00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:35.210
And you can take your time to kind of read through this and understand it.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.480
But there's really no need our maximum point of the parser generator.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.100
So let's go ahead and go into our S3 management console.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.355
Let's go ahead and paste that policy.

00:16:46.355 --> 00:16:49.410
And let's save changes.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:55.730
There we go. We now have a bucket policy that is supposed

00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:02.074
to prevent any uploads into the bucket of objects that are not encrypted.

00:17:02.074 --> 00:17:04.280
First of all, that's the first condition, right?

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.025
That are not encrypted, that automatically denied.

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:08.420
And then after that,

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.590
even if they are encrypted,

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:13.310
it'll check to see if they're SSE S3 encrypted.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.965
And if not, it will deny those objects as well.

00:17:15.965 --> 00:17:20.550
So let's, let's go into our permissions.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.389
Sorry, let's go to Properties.

00:17:23.389 --> 00:17:26.570
And that's turned off default encryption.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.629
Disable Save Changes.

00:17:29.629 --> 00:17:32.910
And let's go back into our bucket.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:39.215
And let's go ahead and try to upload a new version of the file.

00:17:39.215 --> 00:17:45.050
And this time, right, encryption is disabled.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.464
We can go ahead and turn upload.

00:17:47.464 --> 00:17:52.970
And we see that the upload has failed and the air is access denied.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.660
You do not have permission to upload files and folders.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.990
So the policy seems to be working, right?

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:04.535
We're not able to upload this file or this object even past,

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:08.525
because there is no encryption applied to it.

00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:11.000
So Let's exit.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.775
Let's try to upload another one.

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:17.810
This time, applying encryption to it.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.910
So upload options enable encryption,

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.760
SSE as three, okay?

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.025
And upload.

00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:29.510
There we go.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.635
We were able to upload it.

00:18:30.635 --> 00:18:38.990
We have received no error because the encryption of this file is for heading click on it.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.845
I says E, S3, service encryption.

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:44.645
So there is encryption.

00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:46.805
So that's the first condition, right?

00:18:46.805 --> 00:18:48.050
But fails.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:56.075
And then the second condition I fails is that it not being AES 256 or SSE S3.

00:18:56.075 --> 00:18:59.465
So because those two conditions fail, the policy fails.

00:18:59.465 --> 00:19:02.900
And then so we're able to upload this object.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.160
Now.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.380
If instead we were to upload the object.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.940
And this time again, we,

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.460
we encrypt it, but we encrypt it using,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:22.025
let's say SSE KMS and which are uploaded.

00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:24.020
It's going to fail again.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.550
And the same air,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.010
you do not have permission to upload files and

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.419
folders because the encryption type is not a CSS3.

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:33.815
So basically that header,

00:19:33.815 --> 00:19:36.590
although we are implemented in the policy,

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.975
the US a3x, AMC,

00:19:38.975 --> 00:19:43.475
I'm server-side encryption header is not equal to the value of AES 256,

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:48.950
which would be the value we need to be equal to in order for the encryption to be SSE S3.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.365
Okay, so that's how,

00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:55.190
that's a very simple example of how you can implement a security policy.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.990
Again, depending on your needs,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.900
you'll just have to do some researching how to find

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.920
the particular headers or

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.175
the particular conditions and that kinda sad they're associated with a policy.

00:20:04.175 --> 00:20:06.980
But essentially everything else is basically the same.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.505
You have to define your resource in deny their action.

00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:14.720
What is it that you're going to be allowing or denying the put object,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.130
get object, et cetera.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.870
And then the effect right.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.240
Are you allowing or denying that action?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.815
And then the principal,

00:20:21.815 --> 00:20:25.820
which is the account or the user to which the policy should be applied to.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.250
Now, that's how you define a security policy,

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:34.010
but there are other ways of securing your S3 buckets as well.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.040
And so we're not going to be going into them,

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:42.815
but like if you go into permissions for example, right?

00:20:42.815 --> 00:20:47.075
You have block public access is a bucket settings and these are set by default.

00:20:47.075 --> 00:20:50.300
So you can essentially edit this and determining

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.005
detail like what exactly should we blocked and so on and so forth.

00:20:54.005 --> 00:21:00.680
You can also go into ACL or access control list.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.585
And this is basically determines or defines the object read rights,

00:21:05.585 --> 00:21:07.775
permissions like read-write permissions.

00:21:07.775 --> 00:21:09.635
I'm at various levels.

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:12.980
And again, this is not really important for the exam,

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.330
so I'm not going to really be going into it.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:20.405
But, you know, you can essentially determined all that on the bucket level.

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:24.650
And you can also block everything on the account level.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.245
So block public access setting for account.

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:31.384
So, you know, even though security policies only apply to buckets,

00:21:31.384 --> 00:21:35.090
if for some reason wanted just shut off access to all your buckets, right?

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.960
It's, you know, it's important to have that kind of that option.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.820
You know, if something is happening,

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.490
some breaches happening or whatever,

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.090
it's going to take you some time to figure out you can just block

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:52.475
all public access to all your pockets by default across the account.

00:21:52.475 --> 00:21:55.415
And then so, yeah, and yeah,

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:58.070
so remember that this is not turned on by default,

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:03.170
but the block access for each bucket is turned on by default.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.975
And that is just generally a good practice.

00:22:05.975 --> 00:22:09.260
When you're creating an, a bucket.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.680
You have the option of, of disabling this,

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.065
but by default it will be on.

00:22:15.065 --> 00:22:17.045
And that's, that's pretty much it.

00:22:17.045 --> 00:22:18.005
For this video.

00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:19.100
I will see you in the next video.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.460
Thanks.
