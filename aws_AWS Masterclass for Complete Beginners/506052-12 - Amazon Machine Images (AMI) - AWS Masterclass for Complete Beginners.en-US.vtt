00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
Welcome back.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.950
In this video, we're going to be going over Amazon machine images or AMI for short.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.995
You had some exposure to this already.

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:13.620
When you were launching your own instances,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.520
we were using ready-made AMIs or AMIs that had already been prepared by Amazon for us.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.515
But now we're going to learn how to create our own and how to copy them.

00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:31.530
And how to essentially streamline any work that you might need to do in terms of

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:38.120
preparation or pre loading or pre installing any anything onto your instances,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.705
we were able to achieve some streamlining in that regard using user data.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:47.570
But that's still involve some work we had to

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.040
still copy and paste whatever script we wanted to run,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.480
and so on and so forth.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.850
And for more complex applications,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.865
you might not even be able to do all of that, right?

00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:01.925
You might, there might be some configurations and

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:06.590
some other stuff that you can't really achieve easily using a script.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.500
And so AMIs will allow you to overcome that.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.160
And we'll see a little bit and I'll show you what I mean in a little bit.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.639
So basically, AMIs provide the information required to launch an instance.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:27.050
So when you even using an AMI linux, Amazon Linux 2.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.210
So essentially it's just a piece of software and operating system that's,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.810
that's had some stuff preloaded onto it, pre-configured,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.965
preset, maybe the security, other aspects.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:44.555
And you just basically using that image to launch a new instance.

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:45.995
Okay?

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:49.834
It must be specified when the instance is launched.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:53.375
Since the instance will be launched based on that image,

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.430
it's not something you can modify after launching.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.165
The instance is too late.

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:59.740
And you can launch multiple instances from

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.865
a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration.

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:05.380
Okay, This is very important.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.055
Imagine that you're building web apps and all your web apps require NodeJS and,

00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:14.200
and darker and other stuff like that.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.575
And they need a particular configuration in order to work with

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:22.075
your application or your ecosystem or whatever the situation may be.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.895
And you're going to be large in quite a bit of instances that

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:28.300
require this exact same configuration, exact same system.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.970
And so all you have to do is configure this once and create an image from that.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.460
And then you'll be able to launch an unlimited amount of

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.075
instances using that image with the same configuration.

00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:44.050
And you can use different AMIs to launch instances.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.065
We needed instances with different configurations.

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:51.850
So you could very well have a list of different AMIs,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.520
whatever configurations that you can

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.210
use to launch you into your instances based on different needs.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.250
And this could be,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.300
you can have an AMI that's configured for a certain database setup you have,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.510
and then you can have an AMI that's configured for certain in

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.140
a rest API setup that you need for your app, so on and so forth.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.900
And whenever you need a particular configuration,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.740
you just use that particular AMI to launch your instance in

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.900
your instances ready to use. And this is.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.965
Sort of the process that is taken by AWS when you create an AMI.

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:32.855
And so it's registered and you have the registry if you want to delete it.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:34.190
And you can launch from there,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.115
you can copy an AMI into another AMI.

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:41.360
So like across regions and so on and so forth.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.270
Now, just so you know,

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.430
it's very clear exactly what AMI is.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.815
I'm going to be trying to explain to you.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:55.220
I added this extra slide of

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.810
some more descriptions of what an AMI is so you get a better understanding.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.400
So it's essentially a template that contains a software configuration.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.015
For example, a particular operating system, like in our case,

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:10.160
we have a certain configuration of

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.570
the Linux operating system and a particular destroy that system.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.420
And we're able to just launch it

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.125
directly by click on the next Amazon Linux 2, for example.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:26.105
Or it could be an application server or just applications in general,

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:29.390
web applications, whatever it may be that you're developing.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.660
So any particulars African federation

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.270
that's specific to your needs that you yourself have configured.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.095
You can convert into an AMI image and later used to launch instances from from it.

00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:45.410
So from an AMI you launch an instance which is a copy of

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.775
the AMI running as a virtual server in the Cloud.

00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:52.730
And you can launch multiple instances of an AMI.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.725
And like we said, and this shows you how you can have one AMI image.

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:03.740
And you can have one instance here and then you can have multiple instances, like so.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.845
Now you can, so by default,

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:08.960
the AMIs you create will be private,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.955
and I will show you how to make them public or to at least share them.

00:05:13.955 --> 00:05:18.740
But essentially public AMIs can be found on the Amazon marketplace.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.835
So I'll show you how to find the Amazon marketplace as well.

00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:26.810
You should be careful when using the Amazon marketplace.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.890
And the reason for that is because essentially

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.850
you're basically launching an image that somebody else prepared.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.310
So there might be malware on it,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.850
then there might be either some malicious software.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.515
So you just got to be careful.

00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:43.910
And, you know, honestly,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.000
I don't think you should trust public AMI is to offer and this is from

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.210
a trusted source or it's from somebody that you know are.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.270
And there might be hourly charges for some public MIs,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.780
because it might be a very customized configuration of

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.920
some software or just something that really streamlines your,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.810
your production or something like that.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.725
So the creator of the M, I might charge you.

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.795
So you're gonna watch out for that.

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:13.175
And yeah, definitely check the ratings of your AMIs,

00:06:13.175 --> 00:06:16.070
make sure that they have good ratings and there's

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.180
no suspicious software, anything that's on it.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.580
And again, don't use public AMIs without checking for malware, like we discussed.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.605
So definitely there will be advantages of creating your own custom AMIs like I mentioned,

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:37.010
you avoid charges and you'll avoid the threat of malware and that kinda stuff.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.745
And you can also pre-installed a needed packages, right.

00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:42.920
It's highly unlikely that somebody else would

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.515
have solved the exact same package that you need.

00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:47.270
And maybe they might have,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.790
they might have also an extra package that you don't need.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.325
So when you create on your own customer,

00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:57.560
you're completely in charge of what you're creating and there are no malware threats.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.410
The boot times will be much faster.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.870
No hourly charges make maintainable over time since you're the one I created it.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.740
So that's highly advisable.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.485
Now, when it comes to AMI storage,

00:07:12.485 --> 00:07:16.700
the root device for your instance contains the image used to boot the instance.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.835
So an Amazon Machine Image is

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:23.570
essentially stored in an S3 bucket that we are going to be covering later on.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.315
And so it is not directly accessible.

00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:29.210
It's just met for storage then the STM bucket.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:36.365
And so your AMIs will be configured and specific to your account in region.

00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:40.925
And so when you create an AMI within an account and within a region,

00:07:40.925 --> 00:07:44.345
that AMI will not by default be accessible

00:07:44.345 --> 00:07:48.560
within another region in that account or from another account.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.310
You'll have to go in and edit that and I'll show you how to do

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.585
that in order to make it available across regions or across accounts.

00:07:56.585 --> 00:08:00.035
And since they're restored in an S3 bucket,

00:08:00.035 --> 00:08:02.299
AMIs and not very expensive.

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:07.850
So as to the S3 charges are very minimal because this is long-term storage.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.300
And so that shouldn't really be a problem.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.910
And do make sure to remove AMIs.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.020
We should not have any use,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.020
so you'd have to de-register them and I'll show you how to do that as well.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.840
There's no need to keep them around if you're not going to use them.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.610
And let's go in and get some hands on creating,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.490
hopping and sharing some AMIs.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:35.930
So here we are in our instances dashboard and we currently have no running instances.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.365
If you remember, we deleted the instances in the last video.

00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:41.405
So let's go ahead and first,

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.535
let's launch an instance.

00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:45.395
And while we're launching,

00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:46.940
let's make note of

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.960
this first page before we were just skipping through this very quickly.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.340
Just select Amazon Linux 2 and just click select and go on.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.525
But now let's pay some close attention to what's actually on this page.

00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:05.060
So this step is called choose an Amazon Machine Image, AMI.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.720
So this is where the AMI or

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.950
the Amazon machine image that your instance will be based on is selected.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.200
And these are all pre-existing ones that Amazon has prepared for us.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.580
And they're all images,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.365
they're all essentially AMIs.

00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:24.755
And it's even in the name Amazon Linux 2, AMI.

00:09:24.755 --> 00:09:31.040
And so this means that this comes with a particular configuration of software, right?

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.285
So it provides a Linux kernel.

00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:36.500
So that's one particular piece of software

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:42.050
that is 24 tuned for optimum performance on Amazon EC2.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.270
So there's been some configurations of status.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.530
Done on it.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.330
It has all of these other piece of software, so on and so forth.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.290
So Amazon has essentially created an image for you

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.565
that has certain configurations and certain piece of software that make your life easier.

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:02.420
And they've saved it into an AMI and they let you access it.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.280
And so now you can base your instances off of this without having to create like

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.740
a fresh Linux instance and then have

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.695
to do all of these configurations and installs on your own.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:16.910
Now, when we create our own AMI,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.335
it'll show up here.

00:10:18.335 --> 00:10:19.790
Under my AMIs.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.830
Currently we have no AMIs.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.750
You have not created any AMIs.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.720
You can launch instances using AMIs provided by AWS,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.750
our user community, or through the Amazon marketplace.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.360
So the Amazon marketplace is found here.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.980
And here you can browse through a bunch of different AMIs based

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.380
on your particular domain or your particular line of work.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.740
You could find some AMIs on block that have pre-installed

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.610
block chain piece of software or whatever.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.545
Whatever the case may be.

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:53.840
You know, data analytics, there's over nine hundred,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.910
nine hundred different AMIs that come with some sort of configuration that

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:06.800
makes data analytics easier or faster production or whatever, right?

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.170
So you can just go ahead and explore again.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.360
Watch out for the ratings, right?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.445
This is pretty poorly rated.

00:11:13.445 --> 00:11:18.935
You know, just make sure this is directly from the company.

00:11:18.935 --> 00:11:20.915
And it has a very high rating.

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:22.955
So this shouldn't be too risky.

00:11:22.955 --> 00:11:25.565
But again, don't forget that there will be

00:11:25.565 --> 00:11:30.740
hourly charges on the high-quality ones, like this one, you know,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:37.445
it starts from almost $2 an hour and it's going to be like $15 thousand a year,

00:11:37.445 --> 00:11:40.265
then most probably basing their price off of the yearly,

00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:42.575
how much they actually sell their software for.

00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:45.635
But anyway, so watch out for that.

00:11:45.635 --> 00:11:49.250
So right now we don't have any customer.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.859
We don't have any of our own AMIs.

00:11:51.859 --> 00:11:55.550
We don't want to work with Amazon marketplace for now.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.500
And Community AMIs, right?

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:05.630
You've got to be extra careful here because this is a free for all.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.390
But we don't have anything right now.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:14.315
So we're gonna go ahead and just continue with what we know what to do.

00:12:14.315 --> 00:12:19.415
And just so we don't waste time configuring the,

00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:25.040
the the instance on our own because we've already done that.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.210
There's no need to repeat that out.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.610
I'm going to copy and paste the same script we use in

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.610
the previous videos right into here.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.555
This is where we had the same script we used

00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:41.810
for installing Docker and then starting up the Docker daemon,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.480
installing Git, installing a what,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.690
the Apache web server starting it and then

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.410
having it display helloworld from and the host name of the instance.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.040
So this is the same exact script that we used in that video.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.920
If you don't remember, go back and re-watch the userData video where we go over this.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.840
I'm not even the one before that where we do this

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.390
manually within the instance after launching it.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:13.130
And so, so remember usually data means that this will be run when launching the instance.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.160
So we won't have to do all of these on our own manual.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.210
Let's go into review and launch.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.810
But that's actually configure security group.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.840
Let's assign from an existing security group,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:33.860
Let's assign the HTTP HTTP access and the SSH access security groups to this instance.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.920
We'll review and launch,

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.710
uses him existing key pair that we've been using this whole time.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.860
And then we can just jump right into the instance.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.135
Let's click on it.

00:13:48.135 --> 00:13:50.600
Refresh.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.960
So it's pending.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.060
I'm going to jump to and when it's running,

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.700
okay, now the instance is running.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.760
If we refresh it,

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.050
still initializing, so it's still running our EC2.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.560
It's still running our user data code.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.070
So it's installing Docker and good,

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.090
and setting up the web server and all that.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.550
So let's give it some more time.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.410
And there we go.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.985
The checks have been passed.

00:14:24.985 --> 00:14:28.705
So let's go ahead and check that I use data worked.

00:14:28.705 --> 00:14:32.375
Let's connect, for instance.

00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:35.510
And in fact, we don't even need to connect.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:40.805
What we could do is we could even just go into,

00:14:40.805 --> 00:14:46.760
we can just copy the public IP address and paste it into here.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.490
And if we see the webpage and there we go, We say,

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.445
we see helloworld from and this is the,

00:14:52.445 --> 00:14:55.010
the host name of the instance.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.200
So this means that the web server is working,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.735
but we can still check to make sure that darker

00:14:59.735 --> 00:15:03.275
has been installed and good has been installed the app.

00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:04.790
So there we go,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.290
our user data worked.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:13.340
So essentially what we did here was basically configure this instance, right?

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.990
We added our own software,

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.375
we added darker, we got it running.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:21.050
We added, we added a web server,

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.235
we even added a very,

00:15:22.235 --> 00:15:25.100
very simple custom webpage, Okay?

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.270
All of that has been installed and configured on this instance.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.080
Now, if we were to terminate this instance and start up a new one,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.065
we'd have to go through that whole process once again.

00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:41.254
So instead, we can just click on our instance, go to Actions.

00:15:41.254 --> 00:15:43.235
Under Image and templates,

00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:45.350
we create an image.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:51.350
So we can go ahead and call this image web server.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:57.740
And the description comes with good,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:03.380
darker and Apache web server.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.430
And then we can just go ahead and click Create Image.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:15.690
And now when we jump into AMIs,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:25.085
we will see that there is an image being created and its status is pending.

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.335
It has its own AMI ID.

00:16:27.335 --> 00:16:29.030
We call the web server.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.915
Down here.

00:16:30.915 --> 00:16:35.995
And we see that it comes with get darker in Apache web server.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:41.930
And so let's wait till it finishes loading.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.275
So let's wait, it finishes being created.

00:16:47.275 --> 00:16:49.150
And there we go.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.405
The image has been created at statuses available.

00:16:52.405 --> 00:16:56.394
And now we can use this to launch our own instances.

00:16:56.394 --> 00:17:01.345
Let's go back into running instances.

00:17:01.345 --> 00:17:03.190
We have one that's running.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.665
Let's terminate this query and terminate this instance.

00:17:08.665 --> 00:17:10.615
So that's shutting down.

00:17:10.615 --> 00:17:11.905
It's going to be gone.

00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:21.685
Okay? And now if we go into AMIs and we click our instance,

00:17:21.685 --> 00:17:26.350
we can do a number of different things with this instance, okay?

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.140
Again, but before we go into all of these,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.980
let's go ahead and see how it is launching an instance from this image.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:40.060
So when we go into our AMIs and we right-click,

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.880
we see a number of options before us.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.980
The first one is launch.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:51.445
If we click on it, we end up right back in this familiar wizard, launch wizard.

00:17:51.445 --> 00:17:56.385
And we can see that over on step 2 because in step one,

00:17:56.385 --> 00:18:00.319
essentially, normally when we would always start from the QuickStart.

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:04.925
Now we're starting from my AMIs and we have an AMI here,

00:18:04.925 --> 00:18:06.695
which is our web server,

00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:09.590
comes with get darker and Apache web server.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.450
And this is the one we select.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.545
It's automatically selected because we came in here through that image.

00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:17.405
And then we can just,

00:18:17.405 --> 00:18:20.150
you know, Next Configure details.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.130
We don't need any user data because everything that we

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.665
want installed already installed on this image.

00:18:24.665 --> 00:18:28.025
And then we can continue.

00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:34.595
Let's go ahead and add HTTP and SSH access as a security groups.

00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:37.110
And we can launch this.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:44.690
And just to make sure that it is different than the one we're just terminating.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.070
Now let's go ahead and add a tag.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.670
Image web server.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.335
So it comes from the web server.

00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:56.370
Image was added a tag and we can review on Launch.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.650
And now when we go into our instance,

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.085
it's pending, is currently being launched.

00:19:04.085 --> 00:19:07.039
But this is a brand new instance.

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:11.645
It's different from the one we just terminated.

00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:15.500
And we can clarify that by tapping on tax.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.770
So it's from image web server and it's running.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.175
Let's wait for its status checks to pass.

00:19:25.175 --> 00:19:29.495
Now keep in mind that this will be faster to launch.

00:19:29.495 --> 00:19:31.880
Then what we do with our user data,

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.035
because what happens when you use user data is you,

00:19:36.035 --> 00:19:39.440
the Instance launches and then your script is

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.505
run and each command is as put into the terminal.

00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:48.845
And piece of software is installed and everything in luxury specified happens.

00:19:48.845 --> 00:19:51.245
And so that's time-consuming.

00:19:51.245 --> 00:19:55.520
But in this case we have everything baked into the image.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:01.115
So it's very straightforward for the image to launch and doesn't have to run any code.

00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:04.020
And so it's going to be quicker.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.845
And there we go, the status checks have been passed.

00:20:09.845 --> 00:20:14.840
Now, let's go into the details and as you can see,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.960
we have a completely new public IP address.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.325
Let's see if this is work. And there we go.

00:20:22.325 --> 00:20:27.890
We are able to see the HTML page that displays the host name for the instance.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.170
And this means that even though we didn't do

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.855
any configuration for this particular instance,

00:20:32.855 --> 00:20:35.060
because it's based on an image that has

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.700
the web server installed, everything configured properly.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.090
We just launched it and automatically we had access to the web server.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.040
And if we go into it, if we connect to it,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.850
you'll see that we have and darker and get also

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.020
installed when we did not have to specify any user data or

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.380
we do not have to even go into the instance and

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.360
manually do any configuration or installation.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.115
So that's very cool.

00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:02.195
Okay?

00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:05.240
And now, now that you have is image,

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.620
right, you no longer have to do all that manual work.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.525
And that's very powerful.

00:21:11.525 --> 00:21:13.400
But what if you have another account or

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.410
another client and you want to share this image with them,

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:19.805
or what if you want to launch instances in other regions, right?

00:21:19.805 --> 00:21:24.050
This image was created in the Ohio region.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:30.545
And we want, maybe you want to have it also be creating the Hong Kong region.

00:21:30.545 --> 00:21:38.075
So what we can do is we can right-click and we can go into copy AMI.

00:21:38.075 --> 00:21:42.860
And from here you can copy into any other region you want.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.520
And you can give it another name and another description.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.855
And essentially you copy that AMI into any other region.

00:21:50.855 --> 00:21:53.360
And you just press Copy AMI.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.605
You could also modify the image permissions.

00:21:57.605 --> 00:21:59.855
So currently it's private by default,

00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:03.560
you can make it public just like or

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.460
you could specify which other accounts have access to it.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.100
So if you have more than one AWS account for,

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.110
if you have multiple clients or something like that,

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:17.390
you can type in the account number for the alias for the other account,

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.260
and you can add a permission for them to be able to view this image.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.525
So that's how you can share it as well.

00:22:23.525 --> 00:22:25.745
So that's it for this video.

00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:27.830
Don't hesitate to experiment and play around.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.155
Go ahead and copy this into another region.

00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:33.185
Go ahead and show this world in our friend or something like that.

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:36.245
And just create as many instances as you want.

00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:41.430
And yeah, just, just play around and I'll see you in the next video.
