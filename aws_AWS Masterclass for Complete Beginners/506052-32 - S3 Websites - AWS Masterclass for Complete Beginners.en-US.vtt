00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.685
In this video, we're going to be doing something a little bit more fun.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:11.700
We're actually going to be hosting a website on S3,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.005
which is something if you didn't know what's possible.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.630
Now you know, and it's pretty cool,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.730
pretty quirky, but it's,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.255
it's very useful as well.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:26.520
And this is primarily for static websites.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.820
So you can use Amazon S3 to host the static website.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.380
On a static website,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.820
individual web pages include static content, right?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.250
So it's not dynamic on,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.730
but they might also contain client-side scripts as well.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.415
But that are dynamic in the sense that

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.820
a dynamic website relies on server-side processing.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.430
So you need to have a server that's actually running.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.820
Because there'll be server-side scripts such as PHP,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.555
DSP, or ASP.net or something like that.

00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:03.530
And Amazon S3 does not support server-side scripting,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.070
but obviously there are other resources on AWS for that like EC2 or so on and so forth.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.810
So as you know,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.439
it's not really a website hosting service.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.485
A diverse already has services for that,

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:22.685
but it is a file hosting service and sends statics.

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:25.760
Static websites are essentially files.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.130
It makes sense that we should be able to use it for posting satisfy static website.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.190
So with that, let's go ahead and start this.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.130
I'm going to create a new bucket just for this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.840
because we're gonna be kinda playing around with some of the settings.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.035
And we just want to leave the old bucket as is for now.

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:50.090
So let's call this bucket number one AWS course website.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.240
Okay? And then we'll just go ahead and we create this bucket.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.125
So now that we've created our bucket,

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:05.455
let's go into our bucket.

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:11.420
And the first thing we have to do is under Properties.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.230
And we're going to go all the way down.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.100
And there's this section here called static website hosting.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.260
And it's currently disabled.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.420
We were going to have to enable that.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.685
So edit, Enable.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:28.930
And we're going to stick with the host a static website option.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.245
And then we have to specify an index that an error document,

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:34.330
air document is optional,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.325
but we have to specify it in next document.

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:41.430
So this will basically be the name of the file that we want to be the next document.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.840
We can just we haven't created our next document yet,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.700
but let's just call it an XHTML and let's add an error one as well.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.429
Even though it's optional, it's good to just gracefully handle errors in any situation.

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.610
So save changes.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.430
Now, our bucket is now enabled for hosting static, static website.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.285
And it has this endpoint here. Okay?

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:13.235
So this means that this is basically the URL of the website until,

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:15.470
you know, obviously you can add a domain name

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.720
to it using Route 53 or something like that.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.025
But right now this is the URL and this is what we can use to access the website.

00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:23.270
However.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.170
We get a 403 Forbidden in Access,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.750
denied kind of message.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.030
And the reason for that is,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.480
if you remember by default the permissions of

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.859
a bucket are such that all public access is blocked.

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.005
So we have to change that.

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:43.520
Let's edit that.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.549
Let's uncheck this and save changes.

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.475
We have to confirm because we're basically exposing our bucket to the public.

00:03:52.475 --> 00:03:55.460
And now if we refresh this,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.215
again, it's not working.

00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:04.714
And the reason for that is we have to add a bucket policy that allows public access.

00:04:04.714 --> 00:04:05.615
Okay?

00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:07.310
So let's go in here.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.095
Let's create a bucket policy.

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:10.894
Scope of the policy generator.

00:04:10.894 --> 00:04:13.250
By now are familiar with this.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.565
We're creating a bucket policy for S3.

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:19.160
And now we're not denying anything.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.520
In fact, we want to allow all access.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.500
So the principle is everybody is allowed access.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.685
I'm in the action now instead of put bucket is actually get.

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:35.885
Instead of put object will be getObject.

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:45.395
Okay, we're allowing everybody to get objects from this bucket here.

00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:47.975
Don't forget the slash star,

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:53.930
meaning all the objects within that bucket will have a policy applied to them.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.090
And even go ahead, add statement.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.520
And then we can generate policy.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.760
We don't need a condition because we're just allowing all access.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.965
It's unconditional access.

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:06.815
And we'll just paste this into here.

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:08.960
Save changes.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.850
Now when we refresh this,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.555
we no longer get the error,

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:17.945
the 403 error, but we get a 404 not found.

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:23.690
And it refers to the index.html Saying that the specific key,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.480
remember key just means objects per file.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.510
It does not exist, no such key.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.800
And the reason for that is because we haven't uploaded that file yet.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.100
Now, we're going to pull that in a second here.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.135
But notice that now,

00:05:38.135 --> 00:05:40.475
like there's a lot of red that's showing up, right?

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:42.830
Public access, access, public.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.140
That's just, that confirms that now this bucket has public access.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.190
So that's one way to check whether or not you're able to give public access.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.830
It just in red because it wants to make Ada was wants to make sure that you know,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.840
that there's public access to this bucket just in

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.005
case you didn't know and they're sensitive information on there.

00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:06.770
Now let's go ahead and create an index.html file

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.120
so that we can actually do a page on our static website.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.135
If you don't have, you know,

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:22.445
you can just create a very simple HTML page we can just copied from somewhere.

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:25.715
I'm, I create a one here.

00:06:25.715 --> 00:06:28.010
I'm just going to paste it in.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.945
Okay, it's very simple.

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:32.345
You know, my website, homepage.

00:06:32.345 --> 00:06:33.680
Welcome to my website.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.135
And there's some texts called now house or Amazon S3.

00:06:38.135 --> 00:06:39.995
So we can go ahead and save this.

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:44.270
And I'll save it into the images folder that we've been using for the images.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.885
All files, we have the poppy, we have burger.

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:51.110
We're going to call this index.html.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.580
Okay?

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.200
Now when we go into here,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.130
let's refresh this just so the layout fixes itself.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.210
We can upload now the index.html file.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.310
It's here as you can see.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.460
And we can upload it.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.490
And now when we come here and we refresh,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.595
we can see that welcome to my website now hosted on Amazon S3.

00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:27.830
So that's very cool right now, your,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.145
this is your own bucket on your own account and now it's functioning static website.

00:07:34.145 --> 00:07:36.560
So currently it's very simple,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.290
but you can add any sort of HTML here,

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.395
make colors and links and so on and so forth.

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:46.595
And it's a fully functioning website that hosts on S3 without a server.

00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:49.370
So I'd say that's pretty cool.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.480
Now let's actually create an error page.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.090
So let's just, let's,

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.730
let's arm to the test.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.990
Call this error.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.940
And then we'll just give it some colors,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.759
make it a red. Nothing too fancy.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:21.560
And we're gonna save this as Air dot HTML.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.195
And remember, when we were back in

00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:33.800
properties for static website hosting,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.790
we define air dot HTML to be the air documents and whenever there's an error,

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.860
we want this to show, right?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:47.120
So let's go ahead and put an a why the formatting does.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.310
But let's go ahead and upload.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.890
Here dot HTML.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.855
Upload.

00:08:56.855 --> 00:09:03.275
And now say we did like slash some unknown page.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:08.390
It's going to show us air. So anytime it's not able to find the page we're looking for,

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:14.930
it's going to direct the user directly to the air dot HTML page.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.030
So whatever error page you have here.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:22.800
And one last thing we can do is we can pull up,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.300
pull up the index.html page,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.625
and we can add an image.

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:43.920
So let's make an image source, puppy dot JPEG.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.070
And let's save this.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.430
And let's go back into our bucket.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:03.030
And we want to re-upload index, index.html upload.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:08.075
Now when we go to our website,

00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:11.495
there should be an image here, but we didn't upload the images.

00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:15.935
So we have the error 87 index.html.

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:19.355
And now we can upload an image.

00:10:19.355 --> 00:10:23.010
And let's go ahead and put the puppy image.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.375
And let's refresh this.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:29.810
And there we go, we have our poppy image and that's,

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.700
it's being pulled directly from the bucket because all the files are within here.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.420
And obviously, you know, you can create a folder instead called images and

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.800
then put your images into there and then you'd have to fix this here.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.470
It will be images dot, slash, so on, so forth.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.040
So this is just meant to be a very quick example,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.900
but it's pretty cool.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:57.320
You know, I, myself have never had to use a street to actually host a website here.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.755
But I guess it's useful to know that it's possible.

00:11:00.755 --> 00:11:02.480
And that's, that's it for this video,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.650
I will see you in the next one. Thanks. Bye.
