00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Welcome back to yet another quick video on EBS encryption.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.460
Are these are just quick videos after the main video in which

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.390
we went through AWS EBS volumes.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.195
Because these are all just additional features.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:19.109
Just like how with every service and Henry fear functionality,

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.870
there is a bunch of a bunch of

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.410
available features and customization and so on and so forth.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.200
So, you know, I'm just trying to expose you to as

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.125
many little options and features as possible.

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:38.120
And so that you can further delve into any details if you want to.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.195
So Amazon EBS encryption,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:47.150
you can encrypt both the boot and the data volumes of an EC2 instance.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.720
And encryption decryption are handled transparently,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.040
so you have nothing to do with it.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.485
You know, Amazon takes care of it and EBS encryption keys from KMS,

00:00:57.485 --> 00:00:59.345
which we'll be covering later on.

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:02.060
So AES dash 26, 56,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.910
and when you create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.865
The following types of data are encrypted.

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:14.330
The data at rest inside the volume.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.979
All data moving between the volume and the instance.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.565
Snapshots created from the volume of volumes created from those snapshots.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:32.960
So to encrypt an encrypted snapshots, you can't encrypt.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.815
So essentially if you have a volume that's wasn't encrypted,

00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:38.660
and then you create a snapshot from it.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.210
And then you want to create a volume from that snapshot.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.210
You can encrypt, you can encrypt that volume.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.580
But there is a work-around.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.860
You can copy that volume.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.500
I mean that snapshot and then create a volume from that snapshot in an encrypted way.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.180
So I'm going to show you how to do that.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.025
And encryption has minimal impact on latency.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:06.080
So you shouldn't really hesitate to use it.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.505
Snapshots of encrypted volumes will also be encrypted, okay?

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.860
So Amazon EBS encryption is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.140
a straight-forward encryption solution and you aren't required to build,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.215
maintain, and secure your own key management Infrastructure.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:25.580
Amazon EBS encryption uses AWS Key Management Service,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.970
which is AWS, KMS,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.005
and customer master keys. Cmyk.

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:35.404
When creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.

00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:39.560
And encryption operations occur on the servers that host EC2 instances,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.980
ensuring the security of both data at rest and data

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.730
in transit between an instance and it's attached EBS storage.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.240
You can attach both encrypted and unencrypted volumes to an instance simultaneously.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.985
So there isn't really much else to it.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:59.389
Again, depending on your particular situation,

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.505
you might need more information on exactly how this works.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:09.380
In that case, you can consult the Amazon documentation pages.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.285
But for the rest of us,

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:14.120
let's go ahead and do some quick hands-on.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.145
What EBS encryption.

00:03:16.145 --> 00:03:18.680
So here we are again.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.370
And we have no volumes,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.440
but when we create a volume,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.140
we can select to encrypt this volume.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.295
Okay, so let's go ahead and create one.

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:35.270
And that's just pick the default.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.520
And we create a volume.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.140
Let's refresh.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.965
Now.

00:03:42.965 --> 00:03:49.890
From here, we can go into actions and we can create a snapshot.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.060
Test snapshot.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.075
Snapshot, we can add a tag here if you want.

00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:00.274
I'm Create Snapshot close.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:02.240
Now and we were under snapshots.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.735
We have this new snapshot that we just created a test.

00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:11.069
Let's go ahead and delete these. Delete.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:20.930
And so apparently there is an AMI that's using the snapshot.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.690
Let's go into AMIs that's delete.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.850
This is a web server,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.910
so this is the AMI that we created.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.095
So it's using that volume or that snapshot.

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.945
It is basically a snapshot for that AMI.

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:37.460
So we can't delete it,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.750
so we'll just go ahead and leave it.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:47.120
Let's call it web server. Okay?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.010
And this is our test.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.584
And when we click on Test down here,

00:04:56.584 --> 00:04:59.120
we can see that it is encrypted.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.295
And so if we are,

00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:07.040
if we were to create a volume from this,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.545
it would be encrypted by default.

00:05:09.545 --> 00:05:12.049
It will be unencrypted.

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:15.650
Okay, now let's create another volume and this time,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.000
let's not have it be encrypted.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.895
So let's create unencrypted volume.

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:24.770
By the way, here, when recruiting creating volume,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.185
we can just select snapshot from here as well.

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:29.465
Instead of going into,

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:32.030
into snapshot and creating from there,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.785
Let's not encrypt this one.

00:05:33.785 --> 00:05:35.910
Let's create the volume.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.120
And now we have another volume that we just created.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.980
So let's call this the first 1. First test.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.300
First, and this is second.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:04.220
Now let's create a snapshot from this test2 and it's not encrypted.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.335
Crates. Now shot close this kind of snapshots.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:11.630
Let's click on Test,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.090
this rename this test 2.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.285
Let's go ahead and create a volume from this.

00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:28.340
And we can now encrypt this volume even though it was unencrypted originally.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.030
So test 2 was unencrypted.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.590
And it's from this volume here.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.860
So we can go directly to the volume and we can see that it's this is not encrypted.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.895
However, when we go into the snapshot,

00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:49.730
we can see that when we are creating the volume, we can now encrypt it.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.130
Now, this is new.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.794
Previously you weren't able to do that and you would have to use a workaround.

00:06:56.794 --> 00:07:02.165
But now you can, so that's basically what encryption is you can create.

00:07:02.165 --> 00:07:06.830
So encryption you can any image that you create from

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.770
an encrypted volume for any value clip from an encrypted snapshot will,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.765
by default be encrypted.

00:07:14.765 --> 00:07:17.480
If it's unencrypted, you will have the option to encrypt it,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.880
but you can encrypt it unencrypted after.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.440
However, if you wanted to,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.415
you could copy this, copy the snapshot.

00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:27.230
And even when you're copying it,

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.290
you are not able to unencrypted.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:38.495
So that's just a quick look at encryption with AVS.

00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:42.530
Again, these services change quite frequently and things that were

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.850
not possible before now possible things that were possibly for sometimes aren't possible.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.630
So that's the importance of keeping up to date with the documentation.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.255
And if you're after the certifications,

00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:56.525
you have to really be on top of that anyway because you

00:07:56.525 --> 00:08:00.080
have to renew their certification to every two or three years.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.240
So I'll see you in the next video.
