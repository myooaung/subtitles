00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.685
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:08.340
So there is something called an Amazon EC2 instance store.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.250
And this basically provides temporary block level storage for your instance.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.705
The storage is located on desks that are physically attached to the host computer.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:28.410
And instance stores ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.430
such as buffers, caches scratched data,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.155
and other temporary content.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.380
Or for data that is replicated across a fleet of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.470
instances such as a load balanced pool of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.110
web servers and store consists of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.265
one or more instances store volumes exposed as block devices.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:47.810
The size of an instance store,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.135
as well as the number of devices available,

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:51.995
varies by instance type.

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:58.265
So not all instance types actually have the option for an instance store.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:01.010
And the virtual devices for instance,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.735
two volumes are basically in store, are ephemeral.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:13.510
So it's just temporary data and can only specify In Store volumes.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.330
For instance, when you launch it.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.940
You can not detach an ancestor volume from one instance

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.325
and attach it to a difference in so it's not like EBS at all in that regard.

00:01:27.325 --> 00:01:30.984
And data in an instance store persist

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:34.000
only during the lifetime of its associated instance.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.025
If an instance reboots,

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:39.010
whether intentionally or unintentionally,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.545
data in the essence store persists.

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:44.515
However, data in this store is lost.

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:49.465
In cases such as underlying this dry fails instance

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:54.615
stopped when essence stops on essence hibernates when the instance terminates.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.390
So in these cases,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.350
the data in this store is lost and therefore do not

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.865
rely on instance store for valuable long-term data.

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:09.110
Instead, use more durable data storage such as Amazon S3,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.990
amazon EBS, which we just covered,

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.965
or Amazon EFS, which we will cover in the next video.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:19.070
When you stop hybrid entertainment, terminate an instance.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.965
Every block of storage in the instance store is reset.

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:26.915
Data cannot be accessed through the instance store of another instance.

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:30.020
So essentially, there are

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.675
certain instance types that will allow you to create an instance, store them.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:37.910
These, you know, there's a long list of them.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.175
You can look it up.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:43.490
But essentially the ones we were using from

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.380
the T type instances and we are creating to not support it.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.670
The C type supported the, the D types,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.980
FG, I component, the T's.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.450
And so essentially, so keep in mind that it is

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.420
a physical disk that is attached to the computer.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.560
Unlike EBS where it's a network drive at a network desk.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.905
So there is no network in instance store.

00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:20.754
And that's why the IOPS and the speed at etc.

00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:22.525
is incredibly fast.

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:25.705
And so in cases where you do need that,

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:26.950
you can definitely consider it.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.230
So let's just jump straight into

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.705
the AWS console and experiment a little bit with Amazon EC2 instance store.

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:38.110
So here we are in the EC2 dashboard.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.169
And now we can go ahead and create or launch a new instance.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.020
And here on the instance types,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.660
you can see that there's instance storage, EBS only.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.540
So the instance types that the instance types that we've been using up until now,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.959
you know, the t2 micro do that or the other T types only allow for EBS storage.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.850
So we have to go quite the way down until we see

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.474
that we have instance store available.

00:04:16.474 --> 00:04:21.410
So let's go ahead and select this one for example.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.340
And let's go into next,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.670
configure instance details, add storage.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:37.554
And here you can see that there is a default EBS volume or volume attached.

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:38.425
Okay?

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:42.145
It's, uh, GPT-2, EBS volume.

00:04:42.145 --> 00:04:44.140
And the default that's, that's attached to

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.940
all other instances that we've been dealing with.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.125
But on top of that here you'll note that there's a femoral 0.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.940
So the labeling of

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:00.805
these instance store discs start from FMR ephemeral 0 and they can go up to a femoral 23.

00:05:00.805 --> 00:05:01.675
Okay?

00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:04.255
So these are the instance stores.

00:05:04.255 --> 00:05:09.265
You can see the size and its hardware encrypted.

00:05:09.265 --> 00:05:12.135
It's physically attached to the instance.

00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:16.760
So you can still add additional EBS volumes.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.715
But essentially now we have an ephemeral store.

00:05:19.715 --> 00:05:22.655
I'm not going to launch this because I don't want to pay for it.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.685
But that's essentially what an instance store is.

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:28.475
And that's how you would create an instance with it.

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:30.590
Again, not all instances supported.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:39.275
And again, do not use it for sensitive data or for valuable long-term data.

00:05:39.275 --> 00:05:41.910
I'll see you in the next video.
