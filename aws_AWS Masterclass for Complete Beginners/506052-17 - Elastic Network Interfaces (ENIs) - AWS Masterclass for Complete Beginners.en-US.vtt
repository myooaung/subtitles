00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
Hello and welcome to the last video in this section

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:08.420
where we'll be going over elastic network interfaces or ENI.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.435
And now this is normally somewhat of a more difficult topic for people to grasp.

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:19.590
But now that you've had exposure to IP addresses

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.260
and the idea of elasticity when it

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.380
comes to allocating elastic IP, then that kind of stuff.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.355
Um, it shouldn't be too hard for you to wrap your head around.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:33.060
And in fact, we've been dealing with elastic net network interfaces or

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.620
ionize indirectly for quite some time now we just haven't realized.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.740
And so an elastic network interface is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.120
a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card, okay?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.565
It can include the following attributes.

00:00:49.565 --> 00:00:52.355
A primary private IPv4 address,

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:57.755
one elastic IP address per private IPV4 address,

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.410
one public IPv4 address,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.915
one or more security groups,

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:06.050
et cetera, et cetera, MAC addresses.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
And it can include a description and a lot more.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.020
But you can create and configure network interfaces in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.995
your account and attach them to instances in your VPC.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.935
Now, what's the point of that?

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.005
You can create a network interface,

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:22.190
attach it to an instance,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.810
detach it from an instant,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.250
and attach it to another instance.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.595
And what happens is the attribute of a network interface,

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:33.905
follow it as it attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:41.465
So just like how we were able to manage failure and that kinda stuff by allocating,

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:44.630
by associating and disassociating elastic IPs,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.550
you can do that on another level using elastic network interfaces.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.980
So instead of allocating or instead of associating,

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.935
dissociating elastic IP directly to the instances,

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:58.160
you can have elastic network interfaces that have

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.460
their own public and private IP addresses.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.310
They have their own Elastic IP addresses, so on and so forth.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.790
And then you just associate that with an instance.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.350
And all of a sudden, all the attributes are now associated with that instance.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.660
So if you're using a private IP address,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.400
now you can use it on that instance.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.050
If you're using a public IP address,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.870
elastic IP, whatever it is in a MAC address.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.155
Now it's associated with the new instance.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:30.020
So it's, it's like a larger or more high-level version.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.355
You know, the concepts that we've been working with now.

00:02:34.355 --> 00:02:36.770
And network interface is moved from one instance to another.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.010
Network traffic is redirected to the new instance.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.975
So that is the main advantage of ENI.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:51.335
And you have to keep in mind that they are bound to a specific availability zone.

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:52.835
So keep that in mind.

00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:55.970
Okay, Now let's just jump straight into AWS,

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.170
forced to some quick exposure to elastic network interfaces.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.890
So here we are. In our EC2 dashboard.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.155
We have our elastic IP, we have our

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:07.790
Running instance.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.855
And now we want to create ENI,

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:15.020
which is an elastic network interface.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.520
And to do that,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.570
we can go into here under network and security.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.510
But before we do that, let's go into our instance.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.910
And that's opened up.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.510
And we can see,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.500
and let's go into networking.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.980
And here we can see the EMI that is associated with our instance.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.080
So since we have,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.605
when you launch an instance,

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:56.210
I knew ENI is automatically created and is associated with your instance.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.230
And that's where your instance gets its public IP address,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.660
as well as its private IP for a private IP address.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.020
So essentially this ENI or this network interface is associated with this instance.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.990
And that's where this instance is getting that from.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.695
Now.

00:04:15.695 --> 00:04:20.070
Now, if we were to go ahead and launch a new instance,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.370
and let's just use our image that we created.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.510
We will now have another ENI that has been

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.850
created that is now associated with this new instance and that we can see here.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.195
So if you compare the two,

00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:47.120
you'll see that they are different.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.325
They have different ideas.

00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:53.870
And they essentially have different public IP addresses.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.914
They have the different private IP addresses,

00:04:56.914 --> 00:04:58.595
and so on and so forth.

00:04:58.595 --> 00:05:03.320
And each of them belong to a different instance.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.650
Now they also, I mentioned the slides that they

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.950
can also have a security group associated with it.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.810
So this ENI, for example,

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.750
has this security group associated with it.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:22.140
If we were to go into our instance and go into security,

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.200
we will see that it also only has port 22 associated with it.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.900
So let's change security groups.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.470
That's also add HTTP access at Security Group Save.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.080
And let's call it networking.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.570
And let's go into ENI.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.775
Let's click on that security group.

00:05:43.775 --> 00:05:50.280
It still only has access to the SSH, okay?

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.660
Whereas our instance has access to the port 80.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.610
But we can also assign the security group to the ENI as well.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.160
Now, here's the thing.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.635
Now, when we go into networking,

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:11.060
if we click on the ENI and we come here,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.940
we can see that we have to ENI is why,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.515
because we have two instances.

00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:18.050
And these guys were created for those instances.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.080
Now, where it gets really interesting is we can actually create our own eyes.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.530
So here we can create a second ENI.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.050
And, you know.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.830
We'll just pick any subnet.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.875
And we want to assign to it HTTP access and also SSH access.

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:49.655
And we can go ahead and create our network interface.

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:53.420
And now we have our second ENI here.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.955
It's available, it's not in use and it hasn't been assigned to any instance.

00:06:58.955 --> 00:07:01.910
And therefore it does not have a public IPv4 address,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.160
but it does have a private IPv4 address.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.000
So now if we click on this and we're going to actions and we can associate for that.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.200
We can attach the one thing that you have to keep in mind that we did not keep in

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:26.225
mind is that I mentioned in the slides that are specific to certain availability zones.

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:29.210
This means that you can associate

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.885
any ally to an instance that is in a different availability zone.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:38.645
So the mistake we made here was that we created this ENI in the US dash,

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:40.790
dash to be availability zone.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.935
Whereas my other two instances are in

00:07:42.935 --> 00:07:47.645
two other availability zones even if they're within the same region.

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:57.230
So let us go ahead and delete this guy.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.004
That's alright, We're just getting more practice.

00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:03.230
And now we can pick, for example,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.325
this subnet that belongs to this availability zone.

00:08:07.325 --> 00:08:10.650
And we'll just call this again second.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:19.280
And so you can actually assign it a custom private IP address,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.170
but we're just going to let it auto sign.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.145
And we're not gonna go into elastic fabric adapter in this section.

00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:30.320
But we can associate with an HTTP access, SSH access.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.065
Let's create the interface.

00:08:33.065 --> 00:08:36.950
And there we go. It's the second E and I.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.645
We call it, right?

00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:42.260
And you can see it's a completely different network interface.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.810
And it has its own private IP address,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.105
but it has no public IP address because it's still available.

00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:51.740
Now, let us attach it and we can choose an instance.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:57.185
The only instance within the same availability zone is as this one.

00:08:57.185 --> 00:09:01.145
So we can click on it and we can attach it,

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:03.590
but it doesn't detach the other one.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.835
So if we go back into our instance,

00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:13.184
this is the instance we go into networking.

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:18.610
First of all, here we see right off the bat that we have two public IPV,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.890
private IP addresses now.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:27.790
And down here we have two network or plastic network interfaces associated with it.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.090
And there's only one public IP associated with it.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:36.070
But it does get a second private IP address from it.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.015
And so now, essentially,

00:09:40.015 --> 00:09:44.814
what we can now do is we can create another.

00:09:44.814 --> 00:09:49.195
If we had another instance within the same availability zone,

00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:55.320
we will be able to detach this from this instance and attach it to the other one.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.680
So let's go back into here.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.055
Right now. This is attached

00:10:04.055 --> 00:10:08.600
to this instance and this is also attached to the same instance now,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.820
so if we were to,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.500
let's go into instances.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:21.300
Let's delete correlates, terminate this one, terminal instance.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:28.925
Let's launch a new instance. This time.

00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:34.440
Let's make sure that it's launched in correct availability zone.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.375
Wanted to be loved in this availability zone here.

00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:41.300
So let's review on launch,

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:48.920
launch, launch instances, new instances.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:55.925
Now we have two instances now that belong to the US dash,

00:10:55.925 --> 00:10:57.950
dash two availability zones.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.160
That's, let's call this 11.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:10.640
And we'll call this 12 from that one is terminated.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.750
Now, if we go into network interfaces,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:20.870
we will see that we have put refresh this.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.465
There we go. We have now three.

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:28.235
Eni is, this ENI is the one for the new instance that we just created.

00:11:28.235 --> 00:11:33.545
This is the one, the original one for the last one,

00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:38.720
the first instance, and this is a second for the first instance.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.380
Okay?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:48.530
So this means that this instance here has two AN ions and therefore to IP,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:56.690
private IP addresses and to have everything basically because of the two EN, eyes here.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.855
And this one here only has one.

00:11:59.855 --> 00:12:02.480
And it was freshly created.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.030
What we can now do is we can detach this ENI from

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:13.550
this instance and attach it to this one here.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.900
Okay?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:21.780
And how we do that is we select the second year and I we detach it first.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.795
We have to wait for to detach.

00:12:26.795 --> 00:12:28.130
And there we go.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.819
It's now available and no longer has a public IP address.

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:37.940
And now it's detached from this one, from this instance.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.080
So if we refresh it,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.630
not working, there we go, it's no longer there.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.255
Now we want to attach it to this instance here.

00:12:47.255 --> 00:12:51.260
So 587587.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.090
So we want to attach this one to this.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:13:04.190
So we can now go ahead and attach this ENI to our second instance starts with 058058,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.675
and we can see the name of it here.

00:13:05.675 --> 00:13:09.860
So it's instance to and reattach it.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:15.740
And now there we go. We have now this secondary and I attached to our second instance.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:21.845
So if we refresh this and we go into networking,

00:13:21.845 --> 00:13:25.010
we should see that we have our second NI attached.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:31.460
So this gives you a lot of flexibility and control and allows for high availability.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.320
In your applications.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:41.900
You can just build your networking on ENI and then just use those to associate with SSE.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.260
So this essentially allows your instances to be expensive,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.790
especially if you're using images or containers in that kind of stuff.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:55.220
So it really gives you versatility and robustness in your,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.170
in your infrastructure and your architecture.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.860
So if we're done with this ENI,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:06.230
who we can go ahead and detach it and

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:12.930
then wait for it to get detached and to be available.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:18.740
And then we can go ahead and delete this here.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.060
And there we go.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:25.625
We're or back to our default DNI Is that came with our instances.

00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:28.474
So that's the end of this section.

00:14:28.474 --> 00:14:31.440
I will see you in the next section.
