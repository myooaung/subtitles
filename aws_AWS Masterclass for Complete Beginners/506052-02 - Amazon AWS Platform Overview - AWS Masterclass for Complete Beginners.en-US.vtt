00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.714
In this video, we're going to go over the Amazon AWS services platform.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.185
So as you can see here,

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.139
we're on the website AWS, amazon.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.465
And this is really giving you here an overview of what AWS is all about.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:19.785
And simply put, AWS stands for Amazon Web Services

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:24.390
and is a secure cloud services platform offering compute power,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.909
database storage, content delivery,

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.275
and other functionalities to help businesses scale and grow.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:34.975
And so what this platform and what AWS SSO about,

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.175
It's about the Cloud, right?

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:40.670
Being able to host, create, setup, right?

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.445
Different type of cloud infrastructure, right?

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:47.570
Think about different IT departments that have

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.565
physical IT servers that have different types of data, right?

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:55.760
They are typically putting all of their data and in

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.630
particular IT storage room where they have all these different servers, right?

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.790
To have maybe virtual servers in there.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.855
But they're essentially having everything in a physical manner, right?

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:09.860
Where now a lot of companies are transferring all of

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.135
their data directly to the Cloud because it's easier to manage.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:16.220
There's less moving pieces, right?

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.300
You don't have to have as many people actually working with an IT department.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.350
So it really helps minimize the number of people involved in the process

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.580
to manage an IT infrastructure, IT department, right?

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.540
You can build up different applications, different servers,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.470
different websites, all through the AWS platform,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.075
right, so very, very powerful.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:41.494
And so let's go down here and take a look at the various industries.

00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:44.045
You can see here, advertising and marketing,

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:46.160
financial services, Game Tech.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.880
And honestly, there really isn't a industry that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.340
AWS will not be able to work in because of how easy,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.095
how efficient on their platform is and how simple it is for you to work with.

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:04.115
Once you get a fundamental understanding of how the different tools work, right?

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:08.510
It's going to be very easy for you to come in here and set up a server,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.715
set up different applications, right?

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.490
And we're going to walk you through exactly how to do all that.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.880
So here we look at the technology categories, right,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.290
where you can work within machine learning,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.845
analytics, creating data lakes, right?

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:25.820
Internet of Things, serverless computing containers,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.250
enterprise applications, and storage.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.240
I know a lot of different companies out there that use AWS simply

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.220
for their storage and to host various applications, right?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.400
You'd think about social networking platforms out there.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.570
The majority of them are hosted on the AWS platform, right?

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.465
So very, very powerful here as far as what the AWS capabilities are, right?

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:54.770
And so I recommend you come in here and take a look at in a little bit

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.095
deeper as far as the AWS homepage and take a look at the different services here, right?

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:03.665
We're going to cover some of these in this particular masterclass here.

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.675
We're going to go over the EC2.

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:07.760
We're going to go over the S3, right?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.350
And so we're gonna go over a lot of

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.770
these different sections in this particular masterclass.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.390
And so now let's go ahead and take a look at

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.310
the AWS Certified Solutions Architect associate program.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.575
So this particular mass requests here is really centered around getting you

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:27.350
a fundamental understanding of how to

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.105
become somebody who has the skills of a solutions architect, right?

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:35.450
Obviously, this course is not going to cover from a to Z as far

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.230
as you being able to pass the actual test,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.170
because that would require a very,

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.565
very lengthy course, and it would require tons and tons of contents.

00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:52.070
This course here, this masterclass is really giving you a foundational understanding so

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.575
that you can get to know how the certified solutions architect program works,

00:03:57.575 --> 00:03:59.960
the different lessons that are going to be involved.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.170
So that if you really want to take this serious and actually get

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.485
certified as a solutions architect, right?

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.140
Then you're going to want to expand your learning.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.160
But this course here is really going to be that foundational,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.170
absolute beginners understanding so that you can take this information and then continue

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.215
your education as far as being able to fully

00:04:21.215 --> 00:04:24.770
understand what the certified solutions architect is all about,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.920
because the particular exam is actually

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.790
quite lengthy and there's a lot of questions and there's a lot of content.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.670
So this court has really giving you, like I said,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.980
that foundational understanding because a

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.815
lot of what you're going to learn in this course,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:44.240
going to set up that foundational structure for you to have so

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.770
that everything else at actual course or the exam is going to cover.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.920
You're going to be able to easily digest that.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.000
And it'll make a lot more sense because you'll have that foundation already said.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.210
So I'm excited for you to get started and we'll see you on the next one.
