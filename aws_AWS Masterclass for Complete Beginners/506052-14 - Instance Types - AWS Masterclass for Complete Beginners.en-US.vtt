00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
In this video, we're going to be briefly talking about instance types.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.110
And there are quite a lot of instance types and you are

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.440
expected to know quite a bit of them for the exam,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.635
I would advise you to just go ahead and memorize as many as you can.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.310
There is a system to how they are named and how they're,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.800
you know, the letters that I use and so on and so forth.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.740
So just, just go ahead and try to memorize

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.235
as many as you can at least be aware of which ones referred to,

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:29.085
which sizes and that kinda stuff.

00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:32.220
So before it can margin instance,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.169
you must select an instance type to use for up until now we've been selecting.

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:41.215
And this is after we select the image that we're using, the AMI image.

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:43.190
So we select Linux, Amazon,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.380
Netflix to as the AMI image.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.195
And then we go into the next step where we select the instance type.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.945
Up until now we've been selecting t2 micro.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:58.265
And that's because that's included in the free tier.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.860
And we just want to stick with what's free for now.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.525
We don't want to waste any money.

00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:04.070
And so that's what we've been using.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.240
However, obviously, depending on your use case,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.320
depending on your application,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.845
depending on your company or whatever you're using AWS for,

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:18.905
you're going to have to pick an instance type that is best suited for your use case.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:23.570
So this might depend on your requirements.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.180
And some of the requirements might be availability zone or the region.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.270
Not all instance types might be available in all zones or all regions.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.675
And so this might be a deciding factor in which instance type you choose.

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:45.020
And also the computational power, um,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.065
how much juicy require from the machine and how computationally intensive

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:57.365
is the work you're doing or the application you'll be launching. Memory.

00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:59.660
Likewise, some applications don't

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.960
require as much memory is some require a large amount of memory.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.720
Maybe you're doing some work,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.570
some deep learning work or something like that that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.180
requires memory as opposed to hard disk space and so on and so forth.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.025
Networking.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:18.770
Even the pricing, right?

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.110
In our case, pricing was the deciding factor because that's the reason we pick T2,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.350
that micro, it was free for us and storage, right?

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.090
So again here there's really not much to learn aside from just you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.609
getting just opening up AWS and just memorizing.

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.375
You know, there's, there's nothing much else to do here.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.970
It's going all depend on your particular use case.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.470
If you're studying for the exam again,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.955
you have to memorize these, but, you know,

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:50.810
I'm I'm trying to give you more of a practical know-how.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.390
And so when you're about to go into project in of assess the requirements

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.880
of your project and then go and search for

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.970
an instance type that will best suit your project.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.340
So let's jump into

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.690
the AWS console and I'll show you very quickly how you can view instance types.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.865
So here we are in the EC2 dashboard.

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:23.285
And on the left here we're going to go into instances, instance types, okay?

00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:25.580
And click instance types.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.790
And here you'll see a complete list of

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.060
all the different instances that are offered by AWS.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.365
There are 331 different instance types.

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:41.915
So you can page through them here.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.165
And by memorizing, I don't mean to memorize

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:47.015
in item item I'm not telling you to memorize 331.

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:50.090
There is a system in a way they're named in or you can notice that these

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.915
are all t and these are all a.

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.000
These are our C and those dot,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.760
dot, dot to extra-large, so on and so forth.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.050
So if you do need to memorize it,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.200
you can use the system to memorize it.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.610
Or at least be familiar with the different naming conventions that are used.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.220
So in general, what will change will be the CPUs,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.610
the memory, then our performance, for example,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.340
immediately you can see that these ones here, T2,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.830
that nano through T2 medium or

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.675
even T2 dot at-large have low to moderate network performance.

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:41.690
And you'll also see the on-demand Linux pricing were not considered two windows pricing.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.895
But here you are able to see and you can filter by the cheapest.

00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:50.870
So the cheapest would be T4a dot Nano.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.450
This might change based on region and based on availability zone,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.310
just based on Amazon.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.035
So keep that in mind.

00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:04.040
You can filter for the best network performance.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.830
The C5 and that 806 large, and so on and so forth.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.575
So this is where you can really explore the different instance types.

00:05:15.575 --> 00:05:25.590
Now, the way that AWS breaks this down is in terms of general purpose.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.785
Instance types.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:36.425
So like resemble the T. The T's are in general intended for general purpose EMS.

00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:44.914
The ones starting with M are also M5 would also be like general purpose.

00:05:44.914 --> 00:05:51.275
And then, and then they have compute optimized.

00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:54.215
So the ones that start with C are compute optimized.

00:05:54.215 --> 00:05:56.149
And then like memory optimized,

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:57.290
the ones that start are,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.345
you can think of it as in a RAM,

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:02.240
are Haram or even the acts,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.370
the new ECS instance types,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.105
there are memory optimized and then you have accelerated computing.

00:06:08.105 --> 00:06:12.215
Instance types, the P3, that G3,

00:06:12.215 --> 00:06:15.650
the F1, and then the storage optimize,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.219
which would be one d2, I3.

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.645
So that information is very easy to look up,

00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:28.910
but that's how a diverse breaks down their instance types.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.820
General purpose compute optimized memory,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.420
optimized, Accelerated Computing, and storage optimized.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.310
So depending on your use case,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.375
you'll just have to look it up.

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:42.980
You know, obviously you can't expect to memorize 331 differences types,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.400
but be familiar with the different abbreviations.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.775
And again, as long as you know,

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:52.130
if you're studying for the exam, that's another story.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.025
But if you're going to be using it obvious for practical purposes,

00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:58.040
you know, people like to pretend

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.310
like they can't google anything and they happen early on the spot.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.925
But seriously, like when you're going to use when you're,

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:09.560
when it's actually crucial for you to decide on an instance type is not too hard for

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.240
you to lock it up and find different websites for comparisons.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.890
In fact, it's a very common one.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.685
And this is, this is it in-situ essences, our info.

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:26.045
And here you can get a more, I guess,

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:29.240
an easier way for you to filter and compare that to,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.205
for instance, type is a very famous website.

00:07:31.205 --> 00:07:33.980
In fact, this was around before.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.630
Aws even had a mechanism for showing all the options.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.630
So you can very easily look through and,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.450
and explore your options

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:57.305
and look at the full names of each instance type.

00:07:57.305 --> 00:07:59.420
You can compare the selected ones.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.830
So you can compare these two,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.465
for example, if you selected it.

00:08:02.465 --> 00:08:04.895
So this one has a ridiculous amount of memory.

00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:08.180
It has flex some deep learning are some image processing or something.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.880
And it's also ridiculous expensive.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.760
That's on-demand cancers are, of course,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.330
that's going to depend on your purchasing options,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.130
which we'll go into in the next video.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.890
But then, yeah, so this is a website you can use to refer

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:30.605
to different subtypes and it's easy for you to filter by region as well.

00:08:30.605 --> 00:08:33.350
Keep in mind this is not affiliated with AWS.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.730
So you, you're always keep in mind that information might

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.740
not align a 100 percent or the AWS information.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.635
So just when you do decide on an instance from here,

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:52.130
go ahead and make sure that it's correct using the AWS console.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.750
So again, you know,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.970
I was even thinking of skipping in this video,

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.625
in this section because it's really not,

00:08:57.625 --> 00:08:59.960
there isn't really much theory we can go into,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.120
but I just put it in there as,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.780
you know, some extra material,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.180
so keep that in mind.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.770
Um, I will see you next video.
