00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.324
Hello and welcome to this section on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud,

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:09.690
also known as Amazon EC2 or just EC2.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.365
This might be the single most important instance.

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:20.130
I mean, this might be the single most important service in all of AWS.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.685
And that's because this was one of the original services.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:28.700
And a lot of the current existing services are built on ec2.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.115
For example, light sail uses EC2 and its back-end, so on and so forth.

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:36.680
And EC2 is really the core of AWS.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.040
This is where you create all your this is where the servers are created basically, right?

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.050
And the whole point of it is to create servers. Most of the time.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.110
There might be other applications like people just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.900
using it for machine learning or other stuff.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.074
But at its core,

00:00:56.074 --> 00:01:02.600
it is a Cloud computing platform or cloud computing service.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.535
That's what AWS was created for and that's what it's intended for in terms of use.

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:10.565
So ec2 is at the very center of that.

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:16.265
And even if your application or

00:01:16.265 --> 00:01:22.700
your intent for AWS is not centered around virtual computing or cloud computing,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.160
you can escape learning EC2.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.400
Ec2 is the first real service that's ever taught in any AWS course.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.210
And it's something that will always come up in all the exams.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.134
Like I said, it's one of the most fundamental services

00:01:38.134 --> 00:01:40.640
we learned about another service, right?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.335
We learned about IAM.

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:46.040
But that's just an additional or

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.520
an extra service that is just there to facilitate the other core services.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.880
And a main of those core services would be easier too.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.665
So having said that,

00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:01.865
let's go ahead and get introduced to EC2.

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:05.210
So essentially c2 is

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.895
a Cloud computing service offered by AWS and provide scalable computing capacity, okay?

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:18.589
And there's a lot of advantage to using inner scalable computing

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:24.020
as opposed to using other services like digital ocean or,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.100
or whatever other hosting provider you might use.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.335
Host a website or something like that.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:34.595
Because then you have to actually manage your scaling.

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:39.695
You have to project your traffic and that kind of stuff.

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:43.355
But with AWS, all of that is very easy to manage.

00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:50.210
And huge companies like Netflix depend on AWS solely for all their server needs.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.560
And so, you know,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.510
EC2 at its core might be just a very simple web servers.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.665
You're just generating a new Linux instance, let's say.

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:03.800
But you know, it has the potential to scale up

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.310
all the way to the scale of something like Netflix.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.380
With all their video streaming.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.995
That's going on live at the same time all around the world as we speak right now.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:17.650
All of it has EC2 in the back-end.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.325
So it eliminates the need to invest in hardware upfront.

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:25.615
So you can deploy and develop applications faster.

00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:33.085
And this is very, very important right before the introduction of Mino,

00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:36.415
Cloud services, like AWS,

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:42.790
companies or start-ups, had to invest in hardware upfront.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.940
That means that if you have an app that's coming out in a,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.905
you were expected to guess how much traffic you'd be receiving.

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:54.320
And based on that,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.610
you'd you'd be expected to buy all the hardware, the servers,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.790
everything you would need to manage that traffic, even if,

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.720
you know, you wouldn't be hitting that traffic and go for a long time.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.450
Or even if it would have,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.265
maybe you don't get that.

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:13.820
Then I'm on traffic at certain times of the week or the month,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.815
but you would still have to account for all of it.

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:21.800
You'd have to account for the maximum expectation plus some just in case.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.080
And then as traffic increases,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.410
you'd have to keep scaling up your hardware.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.105
And you needed a place to manage all,

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:33.980
store all that hardware and have people manage it, so on and so forth.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.490
So it was a very difficult operation,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.880
very difficult way of starting up a company,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.580
especially when you're just starting out and you don't know,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.525
your ID is going to be successful and you still don't have profits rolling in.

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:52.190
So basically eight of this eliminates the need for all that.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.480
You know, if you're taking this course,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.755
you probably know all of this.

00:04:54.755 --> 00:04:58.040
There's no need for me to go into the advantage of

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.955
using a Cloud service provider like AWS.

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:04.640
You probably know by now it's pretty well

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.420
established the benefits of using something like AWS.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.625
And so, you know,

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:13.925
if not, go and read about it.

00:05:13.925 --> 00:05:20.030
But it's, it's been a huge game changer for companies and anybody who

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.490
wants to get into developing

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.675
their own app or their own large-scale servers or whatever it may be.

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:31.100
So you can launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.810
Configure security and networking and manage storage and all you all from AWS.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.710
So you might still need to hire them up as DevOps engineers,

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.130
for example, if you're setting up a company and that kinda stuff,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.339
but now it's all more easily manageable.

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.295
You know, they just managed other AWS.

00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:52.040
Aws takes on the responsibility of ensuring

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.395
that your servers are up and running and all that.

00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:58.970
And enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.650
requirements and our spikes in popularity reducing or need to forecast traffic.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.470
So that's also something very important even if you did have the means to buy

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.470
all your hardware upfront and to be able to sustain your regular traffic.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:22.370
You can never account for or never prepared for the big spikes in popularity or traffic.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.535
Let's say you have, I don't know, some,

00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:28.924
some sort of sports news website and writer on the Superbowl,

00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:30.770
you're gonna get a huge amount of traffic

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.720
that you probably never see again for the rest of

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.535
the year that you can't be expected to.

00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:41.480
Have hardware to deal with that spike in

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.280
traffic when it's only going to be for the span of a week maximum at say.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.630
So.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.880
You're able to deal with all that Readable?

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.180
Yes.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.170
You just allocate servers as you need whenever there are spikes.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.570
And then when the traffic goes back down,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.295
you can just let go of those instances and go back to using irregular servers.

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:04.070
And this way you can really minimize your costs and really

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.120
manage your servers or your product or whatever,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.370
it may be much more efficiently.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.665
So that's the advantage of EC2.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:19.760
Some of the features that EC2 offers our instances.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.435
So instances are basically virtual computing environments.

00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:33.350
You know, more traditionally known as servers or virtual machines or something like that.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.150
But the modern terminology,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.600
the instance or virtual computing environment and

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.095
then Amazon machine images or AMIs as they're known.

00:07:45.095 --> 00:07:48.215
And we're going to go into more detail on this later on.

00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:53.210
But those are basically preconfigured templates for your instances.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.059
And they're known as AMIs.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:08:00.515
And they package the bits you need for your server,

00:08:00.515 --> 00:08:05.734
including the operating system and additional software.

00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:11.059
So we also have instance instant types.

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:15.965
So incent types are various configurations of CPU.

00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:19.595
So when you're first generating your instance and you can,

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:21.620
you can select the type you want.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.815
And they have various configurations, nudges of CPU,

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:30.140
memory, storage, networking capacity, and that kinda stuff.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.740
So you can select an instance type based on your need.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.420
You can select different types,

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.085
so on and so forth,

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:39.785
and then key pairs.

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:44.585
So essentially secure login information for instances.

00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:51.380
Aws stores the public key and you essentially sort of the private key in a secure place.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.695
So this makes everything very secure.

00:08:54.695 --> 00:08:58.100
You know, even AWS is not able to access it.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.465
Instance store tie, instance store volumes.

00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:09.230
So these are storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.720
hibernate or terminate your instance.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.450
And those are like different stages in the instance lifecycle,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.760
which will be going into more detail later on.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.400
So these are just temporary and then there's

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:27.260
persistent storage volumes called EBS volumes or Elastic Block Store,

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.630
Amazon Elastic Block Store.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.970
And these allow you to persist your data in

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:41.225
your applications or in whatever your use case is for an EC2 instance.

00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:44.045
And then, you know, your,

00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:47.570
your variable regions and availability zones are so easy to

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.424
does allow for multiple physical locations first, for your resources.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:56.000
And these include both for your instances and for Amazon EBS volumes.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.540
So this allows you to really ensure that you can build.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.395
Highly available and fault tolerant system.

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:09.800
So you can have your systems or

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.320
your servers and spread out across

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.220
different regions or any even within regions across different availability zone.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.365
So you can specify all of that,

00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:23.310
all the way down to actually the,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.850
the, the racks within the data multi-zone, zone.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:33.770
So you can specify and will learn this when we're learning about, about placement groups.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.060
But, you know, you can even specify whether or not your instances should be located on

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.500
the same same racks within your,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.005
within the data warehouse.

00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:50.600
Our datacenter, where the availability zone is located.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.480
Um, so you have complete control over everything to do

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.555
with where your instances are located.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:11:00.230
And this can allow for highly available.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.900
Remember, high availability means

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.920
accessing in being able to access from anywhere in the world.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.530
And fault tolerant, which means that,

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.555
you know, it's highly,

00:11:11.555 --> 00:11:13.520
even if things go down,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.410
you have you saved versions are other versions elsewhere.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.830
And so it makes it very robust applications.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:27.545
And then we have another feature called security groups.

00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:33.455
Security groups are basically a firewall that enables you to specify the protocols,

00:11:33.455 --> 00:11:37.280
port, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.370
So traditionally, right, you need like a Linux admin to be able to manage all of that.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.050
And it will get very,

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.560
you know, Linux has a pretty good job of allowing you the manager.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.985
But still, you know,

00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:52.415
nowadays with AWS, you can do this.

00:11:52.415 --> 00:11:55.970
I'll just visually drag and drop select, so on and so forth.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:00.650
And you don't need to go into your actual Linux instance,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.980
instance to specify all of these details.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:09.275
Elastic IP addresses, we're going to also be covering this in depth later on,

00:12:09.275 --> 00:12:11.975
also abbreviated as VIPs.

00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:16.265
So these allow you to basically so like,

00:12:16.265 --> 00:12:19.280
you know, I'm gonna be covering this in more detail later on.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.970
But essentially when, when an instance is created,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.435
it'll have a temporary public IP and whenever it restarts,

00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:29.390
it'll get it, it'll be assigned a new public IP address.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:36.620
So elastic IP addresses are static IPv4 addresses for dynamic Cloud computing.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.455
So you can assign a stationary,

00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:43.850
fixed, static IP address to your instance.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.185
And this is very important,

00:12:45.185 --> 00:12:48.380
especially if you want to be able to be accessed

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:54.050
from the Internet or from somewhere outside your VPC.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.525
Virtual private cloud.

00:12:56.525 --> 00:13:03.410
And also very useful for managing downtime on servers.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.760
So if one of your servers goes down and you do have a backup server,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.790
you can assign the Elastic IP to the other server.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.880
And you know, while you're fixing up the other server

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.240
and the user, there's no difference.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.795
There's accessing the same app through the same IP address.

00:13:20.795 --> 00:13:25.670
But in the back-end, you're managing downtime.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:31.310
And but tags are basically metadata that you can create

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.860
an assigned to your Amazon EC2 service resources pretty

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.920
similar to what we did with IAM users.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.340
And then virtual private clouds or VPCs.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.285
And these as virtual networks you can create

00:13:44.285 --> 00:13:48.350
that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS Cloud.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.555
So they belong to basically you.

00:13:50.555 --> 00:13:56.540
And you can optionally connect these to your own network.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:03.349
And so, yeah, this is all very important for EC2.

00:14:03.349 --> 00:14:06.635
Now, let's, before we go further in,

00:14:06.635 --> 00:14:09.410
EC2 is a huge topic and there's a lot to cover.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.050
Before we go further, let's get our hands dirty.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.660
Let's go and create an instance of

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.860
k. And then throughout the rest of this section will go back in

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.590
and we'll learn all the other stuff

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.880
like all the other details and settings in that kind of stuff when it comes to EC2.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.120
But for now let's just go and do some hands-on.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.540
And let's create ourselves an EC2 instance.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.890
See you in the next video.
