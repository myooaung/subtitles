00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.295
Welcome back. I'm going to be briefly talking about public and private IP addresses.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:07.755
But this is not an IT course.

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.100
So I will not be going into

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.175
anything serious when it comes to

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.010
public and private IP address and how they're structured and what they,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.265
how they work and how network networks work in that kind of stuff.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:22.050
And this is an AWS Core.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.775
So I will just be showing you what matters in relation to AWS.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:30.585
And we'll be also focusing mostly on a surface or,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:37.335
or a feature within EC2 that AWS provides called elastic IPs.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:42.490
But let's briefly get acquainted with public and private IP addresses are.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.555
So a public IP address is the address that is assigned to a computing device,

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:49.444
or in our case, an instance,

00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:53.900
which is a computing device to allow direct access over the Internet.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.270
So if a computing device or an instance wants to be accessible over the Internet,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.650
for example, in our case,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.375
the instances that we launched,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.595
if we want people to be able to access it through the Internet,

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:08.120
or even if we want to access and ourselves over the Internet.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.850
So this could be through an HTTP protocol or it could be through SSH, right?

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.650
Like we've been doing whatever the case,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.170
maybe it needs to have a public IP address so that it can be referenced.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.590
It can be referred to on the public network.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.930
A private IP address, on the other hand,

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.100
is assigned to devices within a private network.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.260
And that private network is local and it's private and it's not directly exposure.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.835
It doesn't directly expose all the devices with its local network to the public.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:44.930
And so the local devices can

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.845
have IP addresses that in other devices in the world might also have.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.960
But since they're not exposed over the internet,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.775
doesn't matter if they're unique or not.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:55.550
As long as they're unique within the local network.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.725
And so this allows,

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.015
for example, in our case,

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:01.580
allows instances to communicate with each other within

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.050
the same VPC and without being exposed to the public.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.920
So you can, you could have your port a closed.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.640
You can have your port 443 closed so people can access the instance over the Internet.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.780
But you would still have a private IP address that can be

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.055
used within instances that are also located within that same private network.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:27.470
So again, I'm not going to be going into details on

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.115
how these IP addresses are structured,

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:34.340
different ranges that exist on and so forth.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.710
Because this is not in a working class,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.210
it is not an IT class.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.405
So if you are curious about that,

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:44.450
you can go and there are a lot of resources online.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.735
But I'm just going to be talking about what concerns us when it comes to AWS and EC2.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:03:01.100
Now, a EC2 and VPC support both the IPv4 and IPV6 addressing protocols.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.415
And again, I'm not gonna go into the differences between them.

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:07.790
Ipv6, the newer addressing protocol.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.220
And it's meant to help alleviate the the short.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.860
Supply of IPv4 addresses.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.305
But in our case,

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:23.240
and by default, IP 4s is used by Amazon.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.145
And we, in our course,

00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:28.160
we are only concerned with IPV4 as well.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.665
So don't bother with IPV6.

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:32.720
Pure carries out the difference.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.550
You can go and look it up, but by default,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.250
it's IPV4 that's used both by Amazon,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.670
easy to end by us in this course.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.250
Now, private IPv4 addresses are what allow you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.920
to communicate between instances within the same VPC.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.315
And these are, you know,

00:03:56.315 --> 00:04:03.485
you can assign or allocate more than one private IP four address to your instance.

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:07.940
But the primary one is allocated at launch.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.625
So launch your instance comes with a private IP address.

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:17.240
Now, this private IP address remains

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.095
associated with the network interface when essences stopped and started,

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:25.010
or hybrid and started and is only released when the instance is

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.470
terminated because that's when

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.335
the instance is dead anyway and you come back, come back from it.

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:34.100
So there's no need to preserve the IPP.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.640
So there's no need to preserve the private IP address.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.454
Now when it comes to public IP addresses,

00:04:42.454 --> 00:04:47.510
you can use public addresses for communication between your instances as well, right?

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.660
You have to rely on private communication.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.340
You can, if you realize,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.575
modularize your application instances and allow for plug-in type of modules and units.

00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:04.460
Then you can just, you can prevent any private communication between

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.545
your instances and solely

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:10.010
require them to communicate through a private and public network.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.650
But additionally, now, they have exposure to the Internet as well,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.620
to other users and others who want to access it.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.775
And public addresses are also assigned by default on Launch.

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:31.565
And it is assigned to your instance from a pool of public IPV4 addresses.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:36.020
And these addresses will not be associated with your AWS account.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.350
Meaning there are situations in which they might be released.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.960
And when they are, they just return back to

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.535
Amazon's pool to be reassigned to somebody else later on.

00:05:49.535 --> 00:05:52.100
And when an IPV,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.530
when a public IP address is this associated from

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.760
your instance in it's released back and you can't reuse it.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.130
So you have no ownership or write to that IP address.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.500
And you cannot manually associate or disassociate a public IP address from your instance.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.130
So that's just done by AWS.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.345
It's associated on Launch and in certain situations,

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:19.910
It's just released from you.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.470
And I'm going to go over those in

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.920
the next slide in which situations the public IP address will

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.750
be released from you and you have no control over Association and the Association.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.090
So that means you can't really depend on

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.494
your pipe public IP address for anything long-term.

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:39.390
And that's where the elastic IPs come in.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.650
So in certain cases, the public,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.550
public IP address from your instance is released or a new one is assigned.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:53.585
And those are when your instances either stopped, hibernated or terminated.

00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:55.655
So in any of these situations,

00:06:55.655 --> 00:06:59.600
in the public IP address and will be released and it stopped

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.339
or high rated instance receives a new public IP address when it is restarted.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:09.260
So this is very important in this era, communist stake, right?

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.040
If you have like a web service that's running

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.255
on an instance and you expose it through to the internet.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:22.310
And you pass out your public IP address for people to access it,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.680
you might find that all of us underlie, relaxes it.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.265
Why? Because you've rebooted your instance,

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:30.440
you know, you've stopped it or you restarted or something.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.550
And so the public IP address has been released, a new one assigned.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.910
So that's something to be careful about.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.270
If it's crucial that you have a stationary public IP address.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:46.280
You need to allocate an elastic IP or use another type of solution where you have

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.760
Internet gateway and not communicate directly

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.570
with through private IP address with your instance or something like that.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.680
And another situation in which your public IP addresses are

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.670
released is when you associate an elastic IP address with it.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.160
So you can associate an elastic IP address with

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.300
an instance and then an associated with it

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.450
in a remove the elastic IP address and expect to keep

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.410
its current public and keep it same public IP address.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.700
So when you disassociate,

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.345
it receives a new public IP address essentially.

00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:23.870
So if you require persistent public IP address that can,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.815
that can be associated to and from instances as you require,

00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:29.810
use an elastic IP address instead.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.510
And that's the topic of our next slide.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.510
So elastic IP addresses will save

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.845
you in the situations where you need a persistent public IP.

00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:46.820
So it's essentially a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.855
and allows you to mask the failure of

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:52.580
any instance or software by

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.430
rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:00.350
So essentially, if the port of

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:06.605
entry or the reference address to your web service or whatever you have on your instance.

00:09:06.605 --> 00:09:10.699
For the public is your elastic IP address.

00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:12.680
And that's the only point of communication,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.795
is only point of entry into your instance.

00:09:14.795 --> 00:09:20.240
You can essentially take away that instance and put another instance in

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.580
its place and associate it with

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.585
the same elastic IP address and the user would not know the difference.

00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:29.930
So this means that if you have an elastic IP address,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.270
which is something you control,

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.195
you control which instance the associate it with.

00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:37.940
If something happens to your instance and it goes down,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.475
you can easily replace it with another instance.

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:45.935
And the user will still be accessing your servers through the same IP address.

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:48.650
Whereas the public IP address,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.945
it's going to be associated with a new public IP address which the user is not aware of.

00:09:53.945 --> 00:09:57.050
And so you have to reissue the ER.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.440
Inform them about the new IP address.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.270
So that's the use of an elastic IP address.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.930
And IP elastic IP address is unlike public,

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:15.170
IP addresses are allocated to re-dose account and it is yours until you release it.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.350
And you do have to release it.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.700
It's not enough.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.960
Disassociating the Elastic IP from an instance.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.750
Once you allocate one,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.855
even if you don't associate it with an instance,

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:31.145
it remains on your account.

00:10:31.145 --> 00:10:34.175
So you will have to actively, you know, yeah,

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:38.285
you have to go in and release it if you no longer want it.

00:10:38.285 --> 00:10:46.130
And it essentially gives you a public IP address that is reachable from the internet.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:52.550
And, you know, just to keep the service manageable and to

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.455
avoid people like hoarding

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:58.670
the IP elastic IP address is because they are a limited resource.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.525
Aws does charge you for

00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:07.160
Keeping an elastic IP address if it's not associated with a running instance.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.670
So as long as you allocate your IP address and then associated with a running instance,

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.280
you're fine, It's free. You're not charged.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.300
But if you just hoard elastic IP addresses,

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.640
so you just allocate them and they're just sitting there in

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.165
your account and they're not associated with any running instance.

00:11:23.165 --> 00:11:26.780
In that case, you will be charged and the batches

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.800
to incentivize you to release them back.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:39.575
And so that this limited resource who can be used by others who do need to end. So, yeah.

00:11:39.575 --> 00:11:45.045
So you're not charged for it as long as your instance is running.

00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:48.355
And you, again for the same reason,

00:11:48.355 --> 00:11:52.420
because they are in IPV for a public,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.455
IP for Internet, addresses are a scarce resource.

00:11:56.455 --> 00:12:02.515
So you are limited to five per account per region.

00:12:02.515 --> 00:12:06.130
Even if you're willing to pay for Ada vs.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.760
Now allow that because that will definitely cause problems

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.600
and people that are willing to

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.530
pay lots of money for just hoard IP addresses and never cause a problem, right?

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.375
So you are limited.

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:22.720
So let's jump right back into the AWS console

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.990
and I'll show you how to allocate Elastic IP addresses.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.955
Here we are in the EC2 dashboard.

00:12:31.955 --> 00:12:36.844
And right away you can see that we have 0 elastic IPs.

00:12:36.844 --> 00:12:38.840
We do have the replacement groups.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.880
Remember, we created a three different placement groups and we have five security groups.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.125
Some of those are leftover from terminated instances.

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:51.170
But we do not have any elastic IP.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.530
So we can either click here or we can go under

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:59.180
network and security and click on elastic IPs right here.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.860
We've gone into security groups,

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.440
who are the placement groups we know about key pairs.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.765
I will do network interfaces the next video,

00:13:05.765 --> 00:13:09.185
but now we're at elastic IPs here.

00:13:09.185 --> 00:13:13.205
And we can allocate Elastic IP address,

00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:15.830
but we are going to be charged for as

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.380
long as it's not associated with a running instance.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.400
So let's go into instances and let's quickly create for

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.140
ourselves or launch an instance for ourselves.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:34.490
And in fact, we can just go into my AMIs and just launch from the AMI that I created.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.725
Instead of going through all these steps.

00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:39.680
Once again, remember we created this web server,

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.725
AMI that comes with get darker and Apache server.

00:13:42.725 --> 00:13:45.170
So we're just going to select that,

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:51.780
Review and Launch, skipping everything and just launched directly.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.915
And now we have an instance that is being launched.

00:13:56.915 --> 00:13:58.595
Its pending.

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:03.050
It'll be running soon and then it'll go through its status checks in the meanwhile,

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.170
let us, okay, so it is running now,

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.010
if we click on it, we will see that it has been

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:16.175
allocated a public IP address and a private IP address.

00:14:16.175 --> 00:14:18.845
So this is what can be used within

00:14:18.845 --> 00:14:24.500
the VPC virtual private cloud to communicate with this instance, right?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.350
If you have another instance within the same EPC,

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.480
within the same region and A-Z,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.420
then you can use this to communicate with it,

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.795
even if it's not exposed to the public in any way.

00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:38.375
Now to access it through the public network,

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:40.715
through the internet, we'd have to use this IP address.

00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:47.120
And again, you can go back into the slides and review of when these are released in

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.690
a private IP address will stay with this instance as long as

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:55.025
that instance is an existence in until it's terminated.

00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:59.405
But the public IP address has a high chance of being released.

00:14:59.405 --> 00:15:02.825
If it stopped, it will be released and so on and so forth.

00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:09.185
Now, we want to access this instance from the browser.

00:15:09.185 --> 00:15:10.925
And because we used our image,

00:15:10.925 --> 00:15:13.070
the AMI image that we created a web server one,

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.590
we know that this has an actual web server running on it, right?

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:24.199
So if we go into the instance and go into security,

00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:27.630
it's exposed through port 22.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.700
However, it's not exposed from port 80.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:37.500
So let's go in to the instance.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.605
Go into actions, security chain security groups,

00:15:42.605 --> 00:15:49.710
and assign it the HTTP access security group. Let's save it.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.675
And the checks had been passed.

00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:58.650
This means that now using the public IP address,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.020
we can on port 80.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.610
So HTTP, we can actually access our instance.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.260
And let's just let that load.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.680
Let's check to make sure we have the right port.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.505
Okay, So for some reason we did not save.

00:16:22.505 --> 00:16:27.155
Apparently, we didn't click Save, I guess so.

00:16:27.155 --> 00:16:29.135
Let's just add HTTP access.

00:16:29.135 --> 00:16:31.685
We didn't add add security group. That was our mistake.

00:16:31.685 --> 00:16:37.139
So you gotta, you gotta click Add security group, click Save.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.590
And now if communist here, there we go.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:50.105
We have access to our instance through the internet on its public IP v4 address.

00:16:50.105 --> 00:16:52.820
But again, this one doesn't work, right?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.260
The private one will not work.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.835
That's not going to work, right?

00:16:58.835 --> 00:17:04.325
So okay, let's copy the old address,

00:17:04.325 --> 00:17:06.570
so we have it on hand.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.660
Let's stop this instance not terminated.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.440
Let's stop it.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.199
And it's been stopped.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:27.270
Let's now start the instance backup.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.410
We have to wait to finish stopping.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.555
Now that the instance has been stopped,

00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:35.250
we can start it back up.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.155
It's pending.

00:17:39.155 --> 00:17:40.025
Block.

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:41.390
Sense It stopped.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.910
It no longer has a public IP address.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:50.435
That public IP address has been released back into the AWS pool of IPV,

00:17:50.435 --> 00:17:54.890
public IPv4 addresses for other people to you.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.380
So now you can see that we have

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.350
a completely different public IP address that has been associated with this instance.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.615
And what this means is,

00:18:05.615 --> 00:18:09.920
if we try to use the old IP address is not gonna work.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.055
Okay, this was the old IP address is not going to work.

00:18:13.055 --> 00:18:15.440
We have to copy the new one.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:22.190
And then we have to use that to access the same instance.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.940
As you can see, the IP, the private IP has stayed the same.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.620
So this is a problem, right?

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.010
How do you expect to have a service running on your instance?

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.000
If, if, if it's going to have a new IP address every time it goes down,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.395
every time it's rebooted.

00:18:36.395 --> 00:18:38.030
So how, how do we solve that?

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:42.065
We saw that using elastic IP address is right now we have no elastic IP address

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:46.205
associated with this instance. Let's change that.

00:18:46.205 --> 00:18:49.265
Let's go into elastic IPs.

00:18:49.265 --> 00:18:53.195
Let's allocate for ourselves an elastic IP.

00:18:53.195 --> 00:18:57.350
So we want to allocate Elastic IP.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.915
And there we go, it's allocated.

00:18:59.915 --> 00:19:03.545
We now have an elastic IP,

00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:06.440
which is a public IP address.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.135
And this is the address,

00:19:08.135 --> 00:19:13.760
and it's been allocated to our AWS account.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:20.285
So now we are the owners of this IPv4 address, if you will.

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:23.375
However, it's not associated.

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:28.085
If we click on it, it's not associated with any instance.

00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:30.890
There's no evidence that's been associated with it.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.145
And this means that if we do not associate,

00:19:34.145 --> 00:19:35.630
continue keeping it like this,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.105
we will incur charges.

00:19:38.105 --> 00:19:42.425
And that's to motivate us to release it back.

00:19:42.425 --> 00:19:43.985
But we want to,

00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:45.980
we want to associate this with an instance.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.180
We don't want to get charged for it.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.335
So let's go ahead and click associate elastic IP address.

00:19:51.335 --> 00:19:52.790
And then we select,

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.070
select the instance we want to associate with.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.275
Right now we only have one instance,

00:19:57.275 --> 00:19:59.885
and so it's easy to pick.

00:19:59.885 --> 00:20:04.190
And then in all we could pick based on the private IP address of that instance.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.365
So it doesn't matter, it's the same thing.

00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:11.089
And then we want to allow this IP,

00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:14.450
IP, this elastic IP address to be re-associate it.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.010
So this means that, you know,

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.665
if you're, if you terminate your inventory,

00:20:18.665 --> 00:20:20.300
your instance goes down or something,

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:26.180
I'll D1 to be able to use a classic API again and associated again with a new instance.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.905
So we're gonna go ahead and click that.

00:20:27.905 --> 00:20:31.190
Let's associate before we get charged. And there we go.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:36.515
We now have in this instance associated with this IP address.

00:20:36.515 --> 00:20:38.705
And when we click on it,

00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:42.180
an instance and go into the instance,

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.010
we will see that now we are,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.720
we have a different public IP address,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.545
different from the new one we just got from rebooting our instance.

00:20:51.545 --> 00:20:53.990
But this ones are here to stay, right,

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.625
this one now we can use,

00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.635
we can now use this.

00:20:57.635 --> 00:20:59.850
Let's copy it.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:07.150
This gives us access to our instance.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.999
And if we stop the instance,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.900
and then we restart it.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.540
You see when we started,

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.435
we didn't lose the public IP address.

00:21:25.435 --> 00:21:27.265
This would have normally been gone.

00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:29.635
But because it is an elastic IP,

00:21:29.635 --> 00:21:35.780
it is still there even though the instance has been stopped and is currently restarting.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.000
So there we go. Our instance is up and running

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.120
again after it's been stopped and it still has the same,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.490
the same IP, public IP address.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.060
And if we refresh, we still have accessors him instance.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:56.240
So that's how you allocate an associate and an asic IP with your instance.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.190
And now if we wanted to,

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:04.940
we could associate this IP address from our instance.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.665
And so we're going to actions disassociates elastic IP address.

00:22:09.665 --> 00:22:12.510
Yes, we want to disassociate.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:19.910
But now we still own this elastic IP.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.710
It's still allocated to our account.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.285
So if we don't do anything now,

00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:25.145
we will start getting charged for it.

00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:27.530
So what we want to do is go into actions.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.830
And we want to release this IP address,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.070
elastic IP address, back into the wild.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.900
And just like that,

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.710
we no longer on that IPIP elastic IP address.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.150
Now be careful, don't do that.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.040
If you have a service that's relying on

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.450
that IP address to have users connect with your service.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:53.189
So be careful. Yeah, so I will see you in the next video.
