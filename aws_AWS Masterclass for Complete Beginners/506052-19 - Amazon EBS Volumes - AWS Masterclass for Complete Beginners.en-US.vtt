00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Welcome back.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.829
So we're going to dive straight into EBS volumes.

00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:10.515
So before we get into the various types of EBS volumes and and how they differ.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:15.720
Let's just go over again quickly in what they are and what their benefits are basically.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.860
So remember that EBS volumes are

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.470
durable block-level storage devices that you can

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.530
attach to your instances and their block level there.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.765
The block storage or they don't come with any file system or, or anything like that,

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:39.485
you're basically going to have to format the device in whichever way you want to use it.

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:41.270
I'll be showing you how to set up

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.140
a very simple access file system format on your attached block devices.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.235
So after you attach a volume to an instance,

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.550
you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.790
So essentially, it's just another hard drive that you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.245
attach to an instance and you can just read and write from it.

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:07.475
And that's basically they're very flexible.

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:12.140
For current generation volumes attached the current generation isn't types.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.165
You can actually dynamically increased size and modify the provision IOPS,

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:19.565
capacity and change volume type,

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:22.340
et cetera, on live production volumes,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.040
which is a huge huge added flexibility.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.590
Also, the most important thing,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.390
persistent independently from the running life of an EC2 instance.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.410
This means that you can create an EBS volume independently of any instance.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.255
And you can attach it to any easy to volume and you can read and write from it.

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:49.430
And then you can also detach it from

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.090
that EC2 volume and you can attach to another one or you can just keep it somewhere,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.635
or you could take a snapshot of it.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:55.910
You could store it.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.355
If it does support multitask,

00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:00.695
you can attach to multiple devices at once.

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:04.055
That's going to depend on your instance type and your volume type.

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:08.630
If it if you terminate your instance,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.795
you can specify whether or not to terminate the EC2 EBS volume,

00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:17.060
even if it's the default route device

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.820
that's attached to the EC2 volume when you creating it.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.385
And I'll show you how you can change your option.

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:25.280
Obviously you have to set it while creating the instance,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.110
but I'll show you how to do that.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.325
You can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single instance.

00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:34.790
This instance must be in the same availability zone and there are

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.215
some other criteria to allow for this multi-touch feature.

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:41.315
You can't do it on all instance types,

00:02:41.315 --> 00:02:45.570
but, but you should definitely, if you're interested,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.140
just look it up on the Google Docs and volume types,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.500
different performance characteristics and price.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.055
And I'm going to be going over those in the following slides.

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:01.985
So that's just a very quick introduction to EBS volumes.

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:06.545
Now let's get into some of the benefits of actually using EBS volumes.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:09.965
So there are five primary benefits.

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.095
Stated in the AWS stocks.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:14.600
And these might come up on the exam.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.005
So number one is high availability, okay?

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:25.670
When you create an EBS volume is automatically replicated within its availability zone.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.505
And this is to prevent data loss due to failure of any single hardware components.

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:33.470
So you can attach an EBS volume into

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.860
an EC2 instance in the same availability zone after you

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.570
attach a volume and appears as

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.830
a native block device similar to a hard drive or other physical device.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.210
And at that point, the instance can interact with the volume just as it

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.220
would with a local Dr. And you'll

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.725
have to mount it and I'll show you how to do that as well.

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:55.115
You need some Linux administration skills there,

00:03:55.115 --> 00:03:57.665
um, but nothing too difficult.

00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.380
It's easier lockup on AWS as well.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.440
And then you can connect to the instance a format EBS volume

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.025
with a file system such as S3.

00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:08.510
Or in our case,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.305
we're going to be using SFS and we're going to be formatting it with the IFS file system.

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:17.105
And again, I'm going to show you how to do that.

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:19.010
And then you can install applications,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.185
you can save data, you can do whatever you want.

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.610
And if you attach, attach multiple volumes to device that you have named,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.960
you can strip data across the volumes for increased input,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.494
output and throughput performance.

00:04:32.494 --> 00:04:36.050
So high availability is definitely a huge benefit of

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.785
using EBS volumes and something that is shorter come up on the exam.

00:04:39.785 --> 00:04:43.430
Another benefit would be data persistence.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.240
So an EBS volume is off instance storage

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.050
that can persist independently from the life of an instance.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.135
You continue to pay for the volume usage as long as the data persists.

00:04:59.135 --> 00:05:01.850
So that's something to keep in mind, right?

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.295
The data on an EBS volume will be stored in an S3 bucket.

00:05:07.295 --> 00:05:12.440
And so you're gonna be paying for that if you take snapshots, so on and so forth.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.505
So EBS volumes are attached or running instance can automatically detect,

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:19.160
detach from the instance with the data intact.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.840
When the instance is terminated.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.990
If you, but you have to obviously uncheck the delete on

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.200
termination checkbox when you configure EBS volumes,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.610
for instance, on the EC2 console. And I'll show you how to do that.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.070
The volume can then be reattached to a new instance enabling quick recovery.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.390
And that's, you know,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.505
very, very, very good to know.

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:44.060
That's a very good feature to have to ensure that your applications are

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.155
always serving your customers and your users with our problem.

00:05:48.155 --> 00:05:52.040
And if you do have a use case in which you want

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.900
your EBS volume to be terminated or deleted on termination of your instance.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.640
You can also specify that,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.035
so it doesn't use case specific to that.

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:06.230
You need. If you're using an EBS backed instance,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.420
you can stop and restart that instance without

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.090
affecting the data stored in the attached volume.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.835
So that's also a huge benefit because,

00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:17.195
you know, you're, you're paying for the EC2 instance as long as it's running.

00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:20.330
So if you basically with an EBS volume,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.490
you can basically stop your instance when you're not using it,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.485
but still preserve the data.

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:29.750
And only pay for the storage instead of the actual server usage.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.930
So, so that you can stop and result

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.110
that instance without affecting the data stored in the attached volume.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.300
And potentially you can terminate that instance even

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.300
and start up a new instance and attached to that as well.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.140
As I'll show you how to do the volume in the attached throughout

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.980
the stop-start cycle so it won't get an unattached as you know,

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.795
as soon as you stop the cycle.

00:06:50.795 --> 00:06:57.065
So this will enable you to process and store the data on your volume indefinitely,

00:06:57.065 --> 00:07:00.590
only using the processing and storage resources when required.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.570
The data persists on the volume and the volume is deleted explicitly.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.760
That's something to watch out for.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.700
If you're trusting that the data will just be

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.840
deleted in if you have some security feature that relies on that.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.475
And that's something we keep in mind.

00:07:16.475 --> 00:07:18.620
And the physical block storage used by

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.090
deleted EBS volume is overwritten with zeros after it is allocated to another account.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.780
That's also very good internet security.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.955
But if you are dealing with sensitive data,

00:07:28.955 --> 00:07:32.240
you should definitely consider encrypting your data manually for

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.395
storing the data on a volume protected by Amazon EBS encryption.

00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:39.575
And we will be covering amazon EBS encryption.

00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:43.840
So by default, the root EBS volumes attached, um,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.920
to an instance at large is deleted when the instance is terminated,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.470
you can modify this behavior by changing the value of

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.355
the flag or the checkbox Delete and termination too fast.

00:07:54.355 --> 00:07:55.810
It is checked by default.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.450
And I'm gonna be showing you where,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.955
where you can find that in the wizard EC2 wizard.

00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:02.590
And so if you uncheck that,

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.165
this will basically caused the volume to persist even after the instance is terminated.

00:08:07.165 --> 00:08:10.015
And this enables you to attach the value to another instance.

00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:13.930
So that's when you have an EBS root volume that's attached to

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.970
an instance by default when you initiate the instance for launch the instance.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.020
But by default, additional EBS volumes that are created an attached to

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.500
an instance at lunch are not deleted when that instance is terminated.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.020
And you can also modify this behavior as well.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:36.170
So data persistence is another huge benefit to keep in mind.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.570
Then we have data encryption.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.935
So all EBS volume types support encryption.

00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:49.610
And this is a huge advantage for simplify Data Encryption.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.020
You can create encrypted EBS volumes from the Amazon EBS encryption feature,

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.505
which I'll be showing you.

00:08:55.505 --> 00:08:58.490
And all EBS volume type support encryption.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.260
So in the following slides,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.040
I'm gonna be showing you like the four main types of EBS volumes.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.780
They all support encryption.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.965
You can use encrypted EBS volumes to meet a wide range of data at

00:09:09.965 --> 00:09:14.360
rest encryption requirements for regulated or audited data and applications.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.940
So this will be crucial for you depending on your company and Amazon.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.000
Basically, they, you know,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.085
this is not a security course.

00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:26.870
But if, you know,

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.590
if you are involved in the security operations of

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:36.110
your inner back-end architecture at your company.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.295
There are Amazon basically abides by everything,

00:09:40.295 --> 00:09:42.320
all these standards and stuff out there.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.205
So you can definitely go and search for details on that.

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:48.110
If you're interested.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:53.330
Another benefit of using us volumes are snapshots.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.304
Amazon EBS provides the ability to create snapshots,

00:09:57.304 --> 00:10:01.025
which are basically backups of an EBS volume and write

00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:05.885
a copy of the data to in the volume to Amazon S3.

00:10:05.885 --> 00:10:09.725
And then this is stored redundantly in multiple availability zones.

00:10:09.725 --> 00:10:11.780
The volume does not need to be attached to

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.060
a running instance in order to take a snapshot.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.760
And as you continue to write data to a volume,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.190
you can periodically create a snapshot of

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.100
the volume to use as a baseline for new volumes.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.430
And this is also a huge feature.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.830
When you create a new volume from a snapshot,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.720
It's an exact copy of the original volume at the time the snapshot was taken.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.450
We're going to be going over EBS snapshots on another video.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.560
And I'm not gonna get into it too much in this video,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.980
but essentially think of it as the ability to create

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.660
backups and just save the data that's on your volume ridden.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.500
So basically eliminate any chance of the data being lost,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.350
even in the case of your volume being deleted.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.460
And finally, flexibility.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:07.490
So live configuration changes in production are definitely doable.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.475
This includes modifying volume type,

00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:13.115
volume size, IOPS capacity,

00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:17.045
and all of this without service interruptions,

00:11:17.045 --> 00:11:19.130
which is amazing really.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.410
It's, you know, it's crazy.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:27.275
And you can find out more information if you search for Amazon EBS or elastic volumes,

00:11:27.275 --> 00:11:29.840
which we will not be covering.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.399
But yeah, so essentially,

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:39.950
this is basically everything there is to the benefit of EBS volumes.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.895
Now let's get into the Amazon volume types.

00:11:43.895 --> 00:11:47.825
The Amazon volume types can be broken down into basically

00:11:47.825 --> 00:11:53.495
three main, I guess, categories.

00:11:53.495 --> 00:12:00.320
So and these will obviously differ in performance characteristics and price.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.165
So you can tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your applications.

00:12:05.165 --> 00:12:11.510
The first main category is called the solid state drives or SSD category.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.270
And this category is optimized for

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:20.570
transactional workloads in involving frequent read write operations with small input,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:26.210
output size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.260
Okay? This definitely deserves to be memorized,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.370
especially for the exam if you're focused on studying for the exam.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.745
Again, this course is supposed to be more of a practical hands-on course,

00:12:37.745 --> 00:12:41.135
but there'll be a lot of you studying for the exam.

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:44.495
So definitely worth memorizing.

00:12:44.495 --> 00:12:49.460
So there are basically two types or to assess

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.365
the backup volumes provided by Amazon EBS that fall into this category.

00:12:54.365 --> 00:12:59.360
And I'll be going over those in the following slides.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.705
The next category is known as HDD.

00:13:02.705 --> 00:13:06.005
And it sounds for hard disk drives.

00:13:06.005 --> 00:13:09.530
And this is optimized for large streaming workloads

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.935
where the dominant performance attribute is throughput.

00:13:12.935 --> 00:13:14.540
Okay?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.485
So again, this definitely deserves to be memorized.

00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:24.770
And then we have the previous generation hard-disk drives that can be used for

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.830
workloads with small datasets where data is accessed

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.175
infrequently and performance is not of primary importance.

00:13:31.175 --> 00:13:36.200
I was the Ada AWS recommend that you consider current generation volume type instead.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.180
So we won't be going over previous generation volume types at all.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.920
On the hard disk drives also, um,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.345
have two types of fall into this category,

00:13:50.345 --> 00:13:51.950
which will also be covering.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.140
But again, the main differences are these two.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.620
So one is optimized for transactional workloads that

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.910
involve frequent read write operations with small input, output size.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:07.490
And a dominant performance attribute for solid state drives is IOPS.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.050
Whereas the dominant from attribute for hard disk r is throughput.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.425
So these are basically the two main attributes to consider when

00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:19.550
considering storage, IOPS or throughput.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.820
And so your use case will have to depend on that.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.640
So you have to base on your case.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:30.860
You're going to have to really thinking about what would be more important for you.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.110
Is it a database?

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.705
Is it live streaming,

00:14:35.705 --> 00:14:37.580
is a data processing, et cetera.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.420
And based on that, you can pick between these two categories.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.740
Now, within these categories, essentially, we have.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.340
So within solid state drive or SSD,

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:55.325
we said that there are two main types.

00:14:55.325 --> 00:15:01.040
And these are general purpose SSD,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:08.060
which are also abbreviated as GPT-2 and GPT-3.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.960
And then we have provisioned IOPS,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.180
SSD, which are abbreviated as I0, I1, and I2.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.670
So the general purpose SSD provides a balance of price and performance.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.940
Generally, you know, it's gonna be, it's gonna be,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:31.535
you know, what's recommended for most workloads.

00:15:31.535 --> 00:15:35.419
And in most cases you won't need to look elsewhere.

00:15:35.419 --> 00:15:39.905
But if you do want high throughput workloads

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:45.380
or low latency are mission critical in a high-performance type of storage devices,

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.205
then you can definitely look at the provisioned IOPS, SSD.

00:15:49.205 --> 00:15:56.150
And here we can compare basically the different types within SSD.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.475
So we have GP 3GPP2,

00:15:58.475 --> 00:16:00.395
which are general purpose SSD.

00:16:00.395 --> 00:16:03.950
And then we have I2 and I1,

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.080
which are provisioned IOPS, SSD.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.020
And this table is from the Amazon documentation.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:15.095
So definitely if you are interested in more details such as burst capabilities.

00:16:15.095 --> 00:16:19.040
And calculating throughput and that kinda stuff go into the Amazon dogs.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.090
You know, I don't want to make this video too long.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.160
There's a lot of information to cover.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.755
But if you are focused more on the exam,

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:33.110
I do advise you to go and review like the burst credits and

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:39.350
the credits and calculating throughput and that kinda stuff in the documentation.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.480
But basically what you need to know is that, you know,

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.970
general purpose SSD can be used for,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:49.775
is used for low latency interactive apps or for development and test environments.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:56.075
Whereas provision IOPS, SSD is more for workloads that require sub-millisecond,

00:16:56.075 --> 00:17:00.125
latency and sustained IOPS performance.

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:03.110
Or more than 64 thousand IOPS,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.845
or 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 MIB per second of throughput.

00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:07.790
Okay?

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.700
And that's I2 block Express,

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.885
which we won't be covering.

00:17:11.885 --> 00:17:16.340
But then we have I2 and I1 for closer require sustained

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.160
IOPS performance or more than 16

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.700
thousand IOPS and put up an intensive database workloads.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:28.640
So you need to decide you're going to need to compare it in this table.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.420
There are also the range of volume size for each,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.435
the max IOPS per volume for each.

00:17:35.435 --> 00:17:38.120
And these do come with some caveats,

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.090
which I'll be showing you in the hands-on section.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.725
And these do not support amazon EBS multi attach.

00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:49.685
And the maximum throughput per volume,

00:17:49.685 --> 00:17:51.350
as you can see, so on and so forth.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.080
Again, no need to spend too much time on

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.700
the actual numbers because this is you can look this stuff up when you need to.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.200
And if you are studying for the exam,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.885
you probably have your,

00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:05.420
your book, your resources or whatever,

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.980
which you can use to memorize anyway.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.750
So this is just give you exposure to the different concepts.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.230
And so this should be enough for you.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.010
And then when it comes to hard disk drives or HDD,

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.140
we again have two main types.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.660
We have throughput Optimized.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:28.295
Hdd, which is ST1 for short.

00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:31.535
And these are a low cost HDD

00:18:31.535 --> 00:18:36.935
designed for frequently accessed throughput intensive workloads.

00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:42.215
And then we have cold HDD or SC1 for short.

00:18:42.215 --> 00:18:49.310
And these are low cost HDD design designs for less frequently accessed workloads.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.205
And again, from the Amazon documentation,

00:18:52.205 --> 00:18:56.780
you can have a comparison of the different volume types.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.065
They're both very durable throughput optimized.

00:19:00.065 --> 00:19:02.825
Http is used more for big data,

00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:05.855
data warehouses, log processing, et cetera.

00:19:05.855 --> 00:19:10.190
Where as the cold ACT is used for throughput oriented storage,

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.910
for data that is infrequently accessed or

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.245
scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important, okay?

00:19:18.245 --> 00:19:23.765
And they do have different IOPS and different max throughputs.

00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:26.869
And they also do not support multi attach.

00:19:26.869 --> 00:19:30.710
Now, when you're actually calculating it right,

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.980
if you have a very critical application or use case and you really

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.940
need to determine which of these four types to use.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.220
You're going to have two again, first and foremost,

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.075
consider your IOPS versus throughput requirements.

00:19:44.075 --> 00:19:46.880
And then based on that,

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.130
you can select the cheapest one.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.119
So that's going to differ based on your requirements,

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:59.915
but I'm definitely you're going to just refer to There's like a one page on Amazon docs.

00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:03.559
If you just type in EBS volume types,

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:05.930
a diverse docks into Google,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.160
you'll find this one page that very succinctly summarizes for you

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.860
all the different ways to calculate the different prices

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.800
and different in a burst credits and,

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.510
and that kinda stuff for each volume.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:22.890
And based on that, you'll be able to determine which one you need for your application.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.850
And I think that's enough theory on EBS volumes again,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.360
for those of you who need or require more technical details,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.530
all the different numbers,

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.070
how to calculate the different throughput or IOPS.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.250
And I'm going to start definitely refer to the aid of the stocks.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.180
But most of the rest of you guys do not need to know all of that.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.660
So let's jump straight into the hands-on where

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.935
I'll show you how to actually create and attach EBS volumes.

00:20:51.935 --> 00:20:54.300
Thanks.
