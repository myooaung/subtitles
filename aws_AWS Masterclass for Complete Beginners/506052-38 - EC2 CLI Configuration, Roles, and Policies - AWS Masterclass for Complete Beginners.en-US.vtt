00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
So we're starting out this video with another reminder.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.685
Being careful when it comes to your credentials,

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.390
okay, so never run AWS configure on an EC2 instance.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.524
Now, obviously you can write EC2 is essentially just another computer.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:22.195
If you're using the Amazon Linux 2 for the image,

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:27.050
then you just follow the steps we outlined in the slides.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.485
And you're, you should be able to download and install

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:34.340
Amazon AWS CLI and start using it and configure it.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.380
How we configure that in the last video.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.395
However, this will be ill-advised and definitely not recommended.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.815
And the reason for that is because like we saw in the last video,

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:50.930
as soon as you configure that device using your credentials,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.110
your credentials are openly saved onto that device.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.030
That means that anybody who has access to that device can easily

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.670
access your credentials and see them completely

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.910
exposed without any issues just like that.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.685
And then they're able to use it wherever they want to write.

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:15.905
So since an EC2 instance is not something that we only send our personal computer, right?

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.380
We're just using a temporarily were renting it out.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.845
Basically, it's not good because anyone who

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:26.045
has access or against our hassle easy to machine will have access to your credentials.

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:32.075
So on the user credentials on personal computers that belong to you.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.330
Now, in that case, you might ask me,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.400
how do you configure an AWS CLI on an EC2 instance,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.055
and we do that using IAM roles.

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:46.895
If you remember, in the IAM section of this course,

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:50.930
we talked about users and we talked about policies and giving

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.745
different users access to different services and limiting access and functional,

00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:57.920
certain functionalities and so on and so forth,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.665
using users and roles.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:02.960
And we really go into roles too much.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.115
But I mentioned to you that roles are basically the same thing as users, right?

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.765
But they're intended to be used for actual AWS services.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:16.535
So granting access to different services for other services.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:20.900
For example, if you want to grant access to your EC2 instance,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.910
you want to give it access to,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.165
let's say your S3 buckets or to your,

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:30.710
another EC2 instance, or just give it the ability to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.540
create our EC2 instances or to use any of the other AWS services are,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.200
you're going to essentially need to configure the instance to be able to use AWS CLI.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.920
And you're going to have to give it access to the services.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.620
And it's not really a, a user per se,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.000
right? It's just a service.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.785
So you're going to,

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:55.130
in that case, define what are called rolls.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.185
And they do act in pretty much the same way that uses act.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:03.125
They can also be assigned policies and so on and so forth.

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.230
But they're intended to be used by other services on AWS.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.600
So I'm gonna be showing you how to do that too.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.840
Don't worry about how much you understood that slide.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.080
So let's jump right into C2 CLI,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.500
configuration, roles and policies.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.225
Now here we are, where we left off in the last video.

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:25.160
And, you know, yeah, as you can see,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.160
I've I've deleted my access key because I had shown you guys this is key as well,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.065
so I deleted that.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:34.940
But we're not going to be needing that, right,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.010
because we're going to be configured EC2 instance.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.770
And I told you we can do that without actually using access keys.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.520
So Let's go into EC2.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.190
Last, we had terminated all our instances.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.790
So let's very quickly create a new instance.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.130
For launching new instance.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.145
It'll be a refresher for us.

00:03:58.145 --> 00:04:01.805
So let's go ahead and launch an instance.

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:04.685
We're going to just use Amazon Linux 2.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:11.790
And we're going to be using the t2 micro free tier instance type.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.440
And let's just review and launch.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.990
We don't really need to deal with any of the details.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.950
And we're going to be using the same key pair.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.510
And we can view our instance,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.520
so we can just connect directly with instance, right?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.730
Obviously it's got a initiate, right?

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.075
It's gotta get started up, but essentially we can connect to it.

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:39.190
And it's a Linux instance,

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.725
so we can just download the installer for Amazon CLI,

00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:46.480
install it and configure it.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.160
But we're not going to be doing that.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.735
Instead we're going to be doing we're going to be assigning it an IAM role.

00:04:52.735 --> 00:05:01.000
And that I am row will have access to essentially any particular service in AWS.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.300
So if we go down into details, okay,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.080
we can see that we can see many of

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.860
the details around Tm instance.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.190
But what we're looking for is insecurity.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.500
We can see that there is no IAM role assigned to this instance,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.315
so it's currently blank.

00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:32.270
Okay, so now that it's running,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.950
let's open it up.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.450
Okay.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:42.665
And I'll have these side-by-side. So we can see both.

00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:46.400
So we have our instance here, okay,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.870
and because we used an Amazon Linux 2 image,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.550
Amazon actually conveniently installs the AWS CLI for us.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.210
And so we don't have to install it,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.355
so we haven't installed and it's not Version 2.

00:06:04.355 --> 00:06:06.275
But that's okay, right?

00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:09.185
So it's installed and we can use,

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:11.375
and we can see if it's configured.

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:13.730
And we can see that it's not configured.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.945
And again, do not use this method to configure an EC2 instance.

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:24.150
And we can just see if, let's say S3.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.755
Unable to locate credentials because we haven't configured it.

00:06:30.755 --> 00:06:33.604
And you can configure credentials by running a diverse configured.

00:06:33.604 --> 00:06:34.910
But that's not what we're gonna do.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.940
Instead, we're going to come back in here.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:46.055
And we're going to note that there is no IAM role assigned to this instance,

00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:48.200
and currently we are not configured.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.875
And then we're gonna go into

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:59.940
IAM in a separate tab and go into roles.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.680
And we're going to create a new row.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.340
Okay?

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.130
Now, roles, like I said,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.920
are basically users but for different services.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.820
So you can actually assign roles or create roles to assign to any of the AWS services.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.875
Like let's say you want to have new and assign,

00:07:24.875 --> 00:07:30.829
let's say a role to EC2 to access S3 or you want to assign it to,

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:36.860
I don't know, RDS to be accessed by EKS and so on and so forth, right?

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.220
And so you want to really define all of the fine tune a year

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.835
to really fine tune all of the different permissions and so on and so forth.

00:07:43.835 --> 00:07:45.350
And you'll do that from here.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.760
So we're going to select the type of trusted entity.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.800
Now you can also assign roles to ADLS,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.050
accounts and web entities and so on, so forth.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.985
But that's a more advanced topic.

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:01.324
We are going to be sticking with AWS services.

00:08:01.324 --> 00:08:03.680
And the two most common are lambda1,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.580
EC2, but you can also select any of the other ones.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.310
We're going to be selecting EC2, okay?

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.590
Now when we go into permissions,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.680
this is where we will be creating our policy or assigning an existing policy.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.005
If you remember, this is exactly the same way we created our own accounts.

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:24.380
Right?

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.835
When I was creating my account,

00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:29.705
I assigned it the administrator access policy.

00:08:29.705 --> 00:08:30.605
Right.

00:08:30.605 --> 00:08:35.330
And you can view the details of it by opening it up

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.970
and essentially seeing what you have access to, right?

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.215
And you can do this for any of the predefined.

00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:49.145
So here we have access to two hundred and seventy hundred two hundred seventy services.

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:50.675
But we don't want to do that.

00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:53.285
We don't want to give our instance complete access to everything.

00:08:53.285 --> 00:08:58.280
Um, so instead, we're going to create a policy.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:05.135
And so again, you can pick a predefined policy if you find one to your liking.

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:08.220
For example, if you go into S3,

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.094
amazon S3 full access,

00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:14.855
there's Amazon S3 read-only access,

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.720
right? So on and so forth.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.520
But we can also create our own.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:26.045
So starting off, let's actually use the Amazon S3 read only access.

00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:28.775
Okay, let's click on that.

00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:31.895
Let's also see what's, what's in there.

00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:38.480
And you can see that it only has limited read access.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.610
Okay, And for more information,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:46.295
we can view it as a JSON and we can see that it allows get,

00:09:46.295 --> 00:09:50.090
the get and the list calls,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.590
any type of GET call,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.885
any type of this column, okay?

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.880
For all resources.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.955
So potential if we wanted to modify this,

00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:01.500
right, we can just copy it.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.710
We could copy it.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.535
And then we can change some of this.

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:10.175
And we can paste it into a new policy, right?

00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:12.710
Or when we're creating a policy,

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.820
you can choose a service.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.130
And we can select S3 from here.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.505
So we can allow all as reactions.

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:29.600
Or we can just pick one of these access level.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.190
So let's say Read.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:36.335
And we selected 43 read commands.

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:38.585
And we can selectively,

00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:42.365
like we can say that we don't want to select all of them.

00:10:42.365 --> 00:10:45.965
We just want to give it permission to get an object.

00:10:45.965 --> 00:10:47.510
That's okay.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.700
Or we just want to give it permission

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.410
to get bucket tagging or something like that, right?

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.040
Whatever it is you can, you can basically fine tune it here.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.845
Let's just click on read for now.

00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:05.525
And then you can select the aid of this,

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:12.140
the resource that you want to basically allow it to access.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.400
So you can, you know,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.380
any access point, any bucket,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.830
any job, mobile, or you can add an ARN.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.850
So for bucket name,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:27.050
you could specify specifically which bucket access by the ARN, so on and so forth.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.210
So you can configure any number,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.175
any to any level of detail policy generator.

00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:36.335
But for our sake, currently,

00:11:36.335 --> 00:11:43.505
let's just stick with the read-only Amazon S3 read only access policy. Okay.

00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:46.069
And let's go to next.

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:48.380
We're really wanted to target right now.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.750
And then we can give this a name.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:58.805
My EC2 S3 policy test, okay.

00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:02.285
Allow EC2 instance to call it a services on your behalf.

00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:11.675
Allow 80 instances to read and get S3. Okay?

00:12:11.675 --> 00:12:13.730
And then we create a role.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:22.930
Now, we can see that aside from the AWS managed roles,

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.295
we have my EC2 S3 policy test.

00:12:27.295 --> 00:12:34.615
Okay, this is a policy that we have created and that we are managing ourselves.

00:12:34.615 --> 00:12:35.740
Okay?

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:41.515
But it just so happens to have the Amazon S3 read-only access policy attached to it.

00:12:41.515 --> 00:12:45.955
Um, so my bad, this is a role that we created and within it,

00:12:45.955 --> 00:12:48.130
it has this policy attached to it.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.915
So at any point in time,

00:12:49.915 --> 00:12:55.750
even if this role is assigned to a particular EC2 instance or multiple EC2 instances,

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.795
or to other services as well.

00:12:57.795 --> 00:13:00.965
We can come in here and we can change the policies.

00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:03.605
So we can add or remove and we can edit.

00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:04.850
We could change a policy.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:13.250
So so all of that will propagate to any service that has this row.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.455
So now that we've created that role,

00:13:15.455 --> 00:13:17.990
Let's go in to,

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.685
let's go back into our EC2 instances,

00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:28.010
our EC2 dashboard, and let us go to Actions,

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.565
security, modify IAM role.

00:13:31.565 --> 00:13:34.145
So we've selected the entrance we've just created.

00:13:34.145 --> 00:13:36.830
We want to modify the IAM role.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.425
And from here we can select the roles we want.

00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:43.625
We can also create a new IAM role directly from here as well.

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.770
That's also a mess, very useful.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:51.755
But for now we just want to use the one we just created and we're going to save it.

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:55.325
And now when you go into security, you should see,

00:13:55.325 --> 00:13:59.450
you should probably refresh. There we go.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:04.280
We have a role assigned to this instance.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.720
Now, if we go into,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.620
back into our instance here and we try to do AWS,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.795
we had to refresh because it's timed out.

00:14:11.795 --> 00:14:14.090
We haven't used it for awhile.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.210
Let's refresh, but it's essentially the same instance.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.440
You can see from the ID.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.920
There we go.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.275
You can see from the idea that it's the same instance.

00:14:24.275 --> 00:14:25.970
Now when we go to AWS,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.700
let's say S3 ALS.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.165
We can now fetch our bucket items.

00:14:32.165 --> 00:14:36.620
We can see the bucket, the S3 buckets,

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:42.035
and we can even read individual objects if we wanted to.

00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:47.030
And to do that with AWS,

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.215
S3, Let's say number 1,

00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:53.609
8 of this course.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.420
We forgot to put two slashes.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.875
And there we go.

00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:03.050
We only have popular JPEG.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.885
And then we can do the Ada was a number or ADOS course, website bucket.

00:15:08.885 --> 00:15:14.600
And we can also see that we have the HTML.ai dot HTML index.html,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.020
puppy dot JPEG object with no pockets.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.210
So both of these commands, right,

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.120
they fall into reading S3,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.040
reading and fetching S3.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.610
And we have complete access to S3 because of the role.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.715
And so we're able to use a,

00:15:31.715 --> 00:15:33.980
able to access our S3 through the EC2.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.915
So essentially we've configured ec2 instance without actually using any credentials.

00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:42.815
So this is the proper way to configure an EC2 instance.

00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:44.510
Okay, that's pretty cool.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.200
Now, if we wanted to limit, let's say something.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.300
We want to limit access.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.055
Let's say we want to attach a policy, okay?

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:57.509
And wanted to create a policy.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:04.320
And we want to choose Service S3.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.324
And we want to only give it read access.

00:16:10.324 --> 00:16:13.625
But we don't want to give access to everything we want to access to

00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:18.164
get we don't want to give access to get object.

00:16:18.164 --> 00:16:24.715
But we want to give it access to, let's see.

00:16:24.715 --> 00:16:33.230
Let's give it access to everything except the objects.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.260
We don't want to give access to anything to do with objects.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.170
So, okay, I think that should be enough, right?

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.535
We don't want to get access to

00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:48.580
the getObject grass for machine to receive objects from S3.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.375
Yeah. So we don't want to give it access to that.

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.100
All resources.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.610
Right? Just to All Resources.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:03.350
And then next review.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.175
No, Get object on.

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:10.420
Read.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.635
Pocket.

00:17:11.635 --> 00:17:12.100
Sir.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.820
Okay. Get object.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.975
Prevented.

00:17:19.975 --> 00:17:21.130
Okay.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.185
So we have limited AidAccess.

00:17:23.185 --> 00:17:25.609
Create policy.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.190
And there we go.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.025
We have these ADOS managed policies here.

00:17:33.025 --> 00:17:36.895
And we have a customer managed policy we just created.

00:17:36.895 --> 00:17:43.880
And we can go ahead and select that.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.880
We can go ahead and go into back into roles

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.315
or so That's an policies is go back into here.

00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:57.080
And now what we know as refresh.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.670
Now we have this here,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.820
no getObject only read bucket.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.175
And we're attaching this policy.

00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:08.695
Now that it's attached.

00:18:08.695 --> 00:18:15.590
We can go ahead and try to do this again.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.020
Now it's suddenly, it takes time to propagate,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:27.560
but let's also do something just in case Let's detach this policy.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.435
And there we go, we are getting an error.

00:18:35.435 --> 00:18:41.060
So sometimes it takes time to propagate across all Ada vs infrastructure.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:46.070
So just make note of that when you just assign a new policy might not be instant.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:51.740
So if you're relying on instantaneous propagation of assigned policies,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.440
then you can basically okay,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.820
So anyway, as you can see now we have an error occurred.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.835
Access denied when calling the list object v2 operation access denied.

00:19:04.835 --> 00:19:08.510
That's basically how you configure an EC2 instance.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.269
And how you can assign policies,

00:19:11.269 --> 00:19:14.390
and how you can assign roles and so on and so forth.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.560
So assigning roles and some of that's very important and that you're going to be using

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.660
a lot for many of the services because a lot

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.300
of the services will need access to other services.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.060
Enrolls or basically how you give them access

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.550
and you got permission and you manage all that.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:34.310
So sometimes it kind of gets confusing with all the policies.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.565
It's hard to keep track exactly what each policy does.

00:19:37.565 --> 00:19:44.600
So you can so you can use something called the AWS policy simulator.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.895
And that's located at policy seemed that AWS dot amazon.com.

00:19:49.895 --> 00:19:55.370
And from here, so this is something this is from AWS themselves.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.590
So since I'm logged in with my account,

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:03.140
I can see my my users and I can see my roles as well.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.550
So from the roles,

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:10.460
if I go into policy simulator, I go into policies.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.710
I can see my policy here,

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.870
okay, the positive I defined.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:20.270
And then I can actually run simulations.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.600
So let's select S3.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:35.795
And then we are allowed to get access point, right?

00:20:35.795 --> 00:20:38.390
Because somewhere here, yeah, there we go.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.445
Guess acts and get access point has been allowed.

00:20:43.445 --> 00:20:47.600
Allow you see for all resources, right?

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:54.800
But let's say we want to get object.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.345
Okay?

00:20:56.345 --> 00:20:58.475
And we want to run the simulation.

00:20:58.475 --> 00:21:00.260
We can see that's denied.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.435
Okay? So this is very useful.

00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:05.930
Any policy you have, you don't have to actually go and try it out.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:11.855
You just come in here and you just find your policy from your role and the service.

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:14.705
And you just simulate basically.

00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:18.380
And you can figure out exactly what you, this,

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.505
this policy gives you access to and when it blocks or prevents.

00:21:22.505 --> 00:21:26.585
So this is a very useful tool to really use,

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.730
especially when you're writing your own policies,

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:32.795
are using policies that other people pass along to you.

00:21:32.795 --> 00:21:35.900
So you can really check if everything

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.785
all the functionality you want is present and working.

00:21:39.785 --> 00:21:42.170
And yeah, so that's pretty much it.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:47.825
And we went over how to configure an EC2 instance to the AWS CLI.

00:21:47.825 --> 00:21:50.464
And we did that without even using a diverse configure.

00:21:50.464 --> 00:21:56.570
We did that by creating a role and then giving access to whatever we want it easy to

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:02.855
access to from that role as a policy and then assigning that role to an EC2 instance.

00:22:02.855 --> 00:22:05.825
And then right away we were able to start

00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:10.655
using the different services on AWS through the CLI on EC2.

00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:14.585
And we didn't have to even install it or download it because it

00:22:14.585 --> 00:22:18.335
came with the Amazon Linux 2 distribution.

00:22:18.335 --> 00:22:19.895
And then from there,

00:22:19.895 --> 00:22:26.900
I showed you briefly how you can create your own policy and then the policy simulator.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.660
So we learned how to create roles and policies.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.970
And we learn about the policy simulator.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.184
So I hope that was informative video.

00:22:36.184 --> 00:22:39.545
That's pretty much it for configuration.

00:22:39.545 --> 00:22:42.170
Now in the next videos I'm going to be,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.595
we're going to just very lightly be interacting with some of the services on AWS,

00:22:46.595 --> 00:22:49.190
just the services that we've learned so far.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.144
So like EC2, S3, IAM.

00:22:52.144 --> 00:22:54.530
And then in the future videos as we learn new services,

00:22:54.530 --> 00:23:00.140
I might occasionally pull up the CLI and just show you some more stuff.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.975
But, you know, the CLI is a vast,

00:23:02.975 --> 00:23:07.970
vast, vast universe itself because you can control everything from there.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.710
So, you know, it's kinda,

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.670
kinda be up to you to continue your learning journey after this section.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.910
So I will see you in the next video. Thanks.
