00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
He there, Mark Wilkins checking in.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Welcome to my class AWS Security Operations: Designing

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.222
for Securing Core Infrastructure, and just between you and me,

4
00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.167
getting to that sweet spot is hard,

5
00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:19.222
and that's why this course has been developed,

6
00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:21.889
to help you understand the toolbox,

7
00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:26.000
the set of tools available at AWS to secure your workloads.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.789
Now I work a lot with Amazon Web Services with different customers

9
00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.667
that are hosting workloads in the cloud and I'm certificated in Amazon

10
00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.333
architecture and Amazon system operations,

11
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:40.100
and I have a great deal of background in IBM software,

12
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.500
Microsoft Azure.

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
So I'm certifiable and dangerous.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.333
So in this course we're going to take a look at securing core

15
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.667
infrastructure based against governance,

16
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:54.684
risk and compliance and the regulations in the industry and align

17
00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:58.000
that to your company when you're moving to Amazon.

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What you have to look out for when considering your security design.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.600
So we'll start by defining just what identity and access management is,

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.933
then we'll take a look at EC two instance security

21
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.267
and the virtual private cloud.

22
00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:16.000
That is your software defined network within Amazon.

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500
And then we'll end each module with Amazon best practices,

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.500
giving you the skills and ability to design your own infrastructure.

25
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.500
I should mention this class is also the baseline for a new

26
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.000
Amazon security certification starting in 2017.

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Sound good? Hope to see you in class.
