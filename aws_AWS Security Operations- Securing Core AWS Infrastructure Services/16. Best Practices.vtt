00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
In this clip we're going to take a look at best practices,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.000
planning our core infrastructure.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.265
Now this will involve a lot of extra work,

4
00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:15.277
but you'll be really secure and really happy you followed these best practices.

5
00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:19.892
They're just not my best practices, they're Amazon's best practices.

6
00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:21.892
So let's go.

7
00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:26.010
Planning my VPC architecture, what should I look out for?

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.892
Well how many VPCs do you need?

9
00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:31.080
What are your present and future needs?

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.017
Are you growing?

11
00:00:32.017 --> 00:00:33.892
Are you a very small company?

12
00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:35.277
Are you just testing things out?

13
00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:36.892
You've got to plan for the future.

14
00:00:36.892 --> 00:00:40.892
Once I've got my present and future needs worked out, what do I need?

15
00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:43.292
Public, public/private, just private?

16
00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:46.892
Do I need private hardware VPN?

17
00:00:46.892 --> 00:00:47.892
Private software VPN?

18
00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:51.892
Is there some hardware, software smarts I need to bone up on?

19
00:00:51.892 --> 00:00:55.942
What external connection type is needed if at all?

20
00:00:55.942 --> 00:01:00.892
Do I need security or do I need security and speed?

21
00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:06.892
Meaning do I need an IPsec VPN or maybe I'm looking at a direct access.

22
00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:10.892
When we plan our CIDR blocks, how many IP addresses are needed?

23
00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:14.123
Don't sell yourself short, after all,

24
00:01:14.123 --> 00:01:17.892
these are private IP addresses we're controlling.

25
00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:21.208
Amazon pretty well controls the public side,

26
00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:26.418
in the pool you can assign elastic IP addresses that you

27
00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:28.606
purchase that are part of your account.

28
00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:30.892
So you've got to figure all that out.

29
00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:33.592
Do we need connectivity with an external data center?

30
00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:39.200
Then I've got to find out what I'm doing on that data center and ensure I

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.892
have a seamless connection from on-prem into Amazon.

32
00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:47.463
I've got to make sure that my range doesn't overlap with my

33
00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:51.292
on-prem data center and I don't want my ranges overlapping if

34
00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:52.892
I'm going to be doing peering as well.

35
00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:58.892
Now we should also isolate what we're doing according to our use case.

36
00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:02.123
So when we're looking at VPCs, production,

37
00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:04.892
staging, development, whatever your needs are.

38
00:02:04.892 --> 00:02:06.992
Make sure you have separate VPCs.

39
00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:11.892
Now here's a theory for you, should you create one VPC with separate subnets,

40
00:02:11.892 --> 00:02:16.256
public/private, with security isolated network groups for production,

41
00:02:16.256 --> 00:02:17.892
staging, and development?

42
00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:21.781
If you say yeah, I should do something like that.

43
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:25.292
You should deploy your VPCs using automation, using CloudFormation.

44
00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:29.692
This would allow you to quickly rebuild or deploy networks in

45
00:02:29.692 --> 00:02:33.892
multiple regions exactly the same way every single time.

46
00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:38.200
When securing your VPC components, use a firewall,

47
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.892
a virtual appliance, you know.

48
00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:43.392
Now you can take this a couple of different ways.

49
00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:45.392
I can use the Amazon built in components,

50
00:02:45.392 --> 00:02:48.463
you probably will have no issue with setting up security groups,

51
00:02:48.463 --> 00:02:52.249
after all we have to do it and when we're setting up NACLs,

52
00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.892
it's a pretty standard way of setting up security at the subnet level.

53
00:02:56.892 --> 00:03:00.892
But maybe you've got a virtual appliance that you really know, you can use that.

54
00:03:00.892 --> 00:03:04.186
This class is focused on Amazon components,

55
00:03:04.186 --> 00:03:08.421
there's lots of third party virtual appliances in the

56
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:10.392
marketplace that you can deploy.

57
00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:13.767
Should you consider using intrusion prevention virtual appliances to

58
00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:17.225
monitor the traffic in your VPC for extra protection.

59
00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:21.892
Again, anything in a VM will run just fine in a VPC.

60
00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:25.892
Consider encrypting the root and additional EBS volumes.

61
00:03:25.892 --> 00:03:28.892
For sure configure IAM management policies.

62
00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:34.892
Of course use Cloud Trail to monitor the instances in the VPC environment.

63
00:03:34.892 --> 00:03:40.225
Install antivirus software on EC2 instances that are hosted on the VPC,

64
00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:42.892
especially if they have public access.

65
00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:46.892
Deploy security groups and NACLs, of course.

66
00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:49.200
When we're checking what we're building,

67
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.892
remember there are hard and soft limits.

68
00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:56.559
So understand and review the hard and soft limits for

69
00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.892
the VPCs that you're designing.

70
00:03:58.892 --> 00:04:04.892
These limitations are in effect for security groups, route tables and subnets.

71
00:04:04.892 --> 00:04:09.762
So you should take a look at those limits and if you need increases,

72
00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:14.225
it's easier to start off asking for an increase based on your design,

73
00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:17.892
ensuring that your design will not be affected by those limitations.

74
00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:20.749
If you think there's going to be limitations,

75
00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:22.892
request increases in the soft limits.

76
00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:25.892
So again, thinking long term.

77
00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:30.066
If I'm working with VPCs, I want to be using IAM policy,

78
00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:34.692
so we want to ensure that the IAM policies for allowing or denying

79
00:04:34.692 --> 00:04:38.292
access are attached only to groups or to roles,

80
00:04:38.292 --> 00:04:42.892
and of course, designed with the least access principal in mind.

81
00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:48.892
When we're designing with security, we want to think, we want to be wise.

82
00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:52.186
So security groups for the EC2 instance,

83
00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:57.892
security groups or white listing, NACLs for blacklisting at the subnet level.

84
00:04:57.892 --> 00:05:02.892
Create different security groups for different tiers of your infrastructure.

85
00:05:02.892 --> 00:05:07.559
So you're organized and it makes sense and you can watch the flow from

86
00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.801
the web to the application to the database tier.

87
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:14.892
Standardize your security group naming conventions to avoid errors.

88
00:05:14.892 --> 00:05:19.781
Easy to overlook once you get multiple people working on administration,

89
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:22.892
you want a common set of rules.

90
00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:28.245
Everything should be in a private subnet with the exception of elastic load

91
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:31.892
balancing or monitoring solutions in the public subnets.

92
00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:35.042
If I'm going to be connecting externally to Amazon,

93
00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:39.260
I want to ensure that that internet gateway is set up properly.

94
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.313
So don't add the internet gateway to the main routing table,

95
00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:47.892
minimize the use of the internet gateway through custom route tables.

96
00:05:47.892 --> 00:05:53.892
Minimize the subnet size that's utilizing NAT or internet facing proxy services.

97
00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:57.092
Pay attention to the details, who has access,

98
00:05:57.092 --> 00:06:00.292
who's coming in, what devices are in use,

99
00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:01.892
where are they sitting?

100
00:06:01.892 --> 00:06:05.017
We talked about peering and it's a consideration if I

101
00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:06.892
need connectivity to use VPC peering.

102
00:06:06.892 --> 00:06:12.463
So a couple of examples for you, if I'm a large enterprise organization,

103
00:06:12.463 --> 00:06:16.277
I have multiple VPCs in a single region with

104
00:06:16.277 --> 00:06:17.815
applications that need connectivity.

105
00:06:17.815 --> 00:06:20.892
Peering is really going to help me out.

106
00:06:20.892 --> 00:06:24.892
Maybe you're a large enterprise with different AWS

107
00:06:24.892 --> 00:06:26.892
accounts for different departments.

108
00:06:26.892 --> 00:06:29.704
Maybe you need peering with external partners and suppliers.

109
00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:33.992
Maybe you need peering with cloud brokers that provide monitoring,

110
00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:38.892
orchestration management services to your AWS resources.

111
00:06:38.892 --> 00:06:41.892
If one of these examples fits you,

112
00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:47.892
ensure that the route tables for your VPC peering are designed for least access.

113
00:06:47.892 --> 00:06:54.892
So that's a number of best practices to measure your AWS resources against.

114
00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:57.392
So time to wrap up.

115
00:06:57.392 --> 00:07:01.892
In this module we looked at securing EC2 instances.

116
00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:04.584
We looked at dedicated instances and hosts.

117
00:07:04.584 --> 00:07:06.892
We looked at Amazon machine instances.

118
00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:10.123
We looked at security choices for instances.

119
00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:12.892
We looked at securing EBS volumes.

120
00:07:12.892 --> 00:07:14.797
We looked at VPC security.

121
00:07:14.797 --> 00:07:20.130
We looked at design criteria for our VPCs and we ended off with some

122
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.892
best practices when planning our core infrastructure.

123
00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:29.010
Thank you very much for hanging in through this module.

124
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:37.000
Up next, securing access to edge locations. Hope to see you on the edge.
