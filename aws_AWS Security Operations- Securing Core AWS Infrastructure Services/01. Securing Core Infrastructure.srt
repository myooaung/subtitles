00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,063
Well hello there, Mark Wilkins checking in.

2
00:00:03,063 --> 00:00:04,813
How are you today?

3
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:07,000
Ready for more security operations?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,474
I hope you are.

5
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:11,421
That's what we're talking about in this module,

6
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:16,333
securing core AWS infrastructure, looking at it from the security point of view.

7
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,667
Now this course, AWS Security Operations,

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:22,818
is looking at everything to do with Amazon hosting your

9
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:26,000
workloads on Amazon from this security perspective.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,278
The first module we took a look at managing access control,

11
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:33,000
this module looking at the core infrastructure.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,667
So if you haven't done the first one,

13
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:40,000
you probably need to go back and look at that module as well.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But you can do them in any order, that's the beauty of our digital platform.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So welcome aboard, let's get started.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So first of all, why have a course focused just on AWS security?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,909
After all Amazon is a huge product,

18
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,909
there are so many different ways you could look at Amazon,

19
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,333
but at the end of the day, it's hosted in the cloud,

20
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,708
there's a little bit of control that is held by Amazon and so we have

21
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:10,053
to make sure that the security is set up for this hosted service

22
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,000
because it's not inside our company walls.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,435
We have to rely on Amazon and we have to make sure we secure all of our

24
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:21,000
bits based on the compliance needs of our company.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,273
Now security is still, as I like to say,

26
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:29,000
25/7 in the cloud because it's always on and security can be solved,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
but then new problems arise and you have to solve them.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,800
So it's something that we have to keep on top of and if you're looking at this

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,000
from the point of view of doing a certification say for architecture or sysops

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,579
or maybe the new security certification itself,

31
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:50,000
you really want to have a good handle on the security offerings at Amazon.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now let's start off with a saying from Bruce Schneier.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Now Bruce Schneier is a computer expert in the area of security and

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,400
cryptography and he's written a number of different books on what to do

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,136
with regards to security and what we don't do,

36
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:07,864
and one of his favorite sayings is "the user is going to

37
00:02:07,864 --> 00:02:09,778
pick dancing pigs over security every time.

38
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:16,000
" I might say the user is going to pick cats, but we get his drift.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,667
Now this course is going to help you with that with AWS infrastructure core

40
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:24,368
security and a working knowledge of AWS doesn't hurt,

41
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:29,000
but it's not essential, I'm not assuming anything with this class.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,619
But we're going to move along at a pretty good speed.

43
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,350
This is a very well documented product and we can't cover

44
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,850
everything in this class and I highly recommend that you

45
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,000
bone up on the documentation, which is never ending from Amazon.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,895
So the topics in this module,

47
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:48,053
we're going to start off looking at the security aspects

48
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,750
of EC2 instances or virtual machines.

49
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,250
We'll then take a look at a couple of different versions of these instances,

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,789
they could be dedicated or it might be actually the complete host.

51
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:03,412
We'll then take a look at the Amazon machine instance, what exactly is that.

52
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:08,000
Then we'll look at the security choices for our instances that we choose.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,231
Then we'll look at security storage, i.

54
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:11,692
e.

55
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,000
EBS volumes, Elastic Block Storage.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,143
We'll then take a look at the network security, the VPC.

57
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:21,455
We'll also look at the design criteria and then we'll end off with some

58
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:30,000
best practices when planning our core infrastructure. So we've got a lot to cover, let's get going.
