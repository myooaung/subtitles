1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,867
So in this clip we're going to start our journey.

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:06,960
We'll look at the security of the infrastructure

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,347
that's hosting our virtual machines.

4
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:12,620
So the design of EC2, Elastic Cloud Compute,

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,529
I like to think of that as kind of the Einstein joke,

6
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:21,680
so typically in the stack we're going to have a virtual machine,

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,847
it's hosted by the XEN hypervisor, it's heavily customized.

8
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:28,847
Xen is a very popular hypervisor that many,

9
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:33,747
many cloud providers use and Amazon customizes this for their needs,

10
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:37,247
what they think they have to do in the background,

11
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,347
they do that job for us.

12
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:45,347
If you're used to say VMware or Hyper-V, KVM, Amazon does this for us.

13
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:49,347
We start at the virtual machine level in the stack,

14
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:51,347
below that, that's their job.

15
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:56,347
And those instances that we can choose are either going to be Linux or Windows,

16
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,926
typically a 64-bit box these days, and this is really cloud.

17
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,084
If you want the shortest definition of what is cloud,

18
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:08,285
it's Linux or Windows virtual machines hosted in somebody else's data center and

19
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:12,347
there is numerous Linux distributions and numerous Windows server distributions

20
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:17,347
and these will change based on the date and time that you're in the console

21
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:19,680
looking at building something in Amazon.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,569
So for example, these days you could get 2016 server,

23
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:27,147
I'll bet a year from now you won't get 2008.

24
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:31,347
What they offer might be different from what you want to use.

25
00:01:31,347 --> 00:01:33,680
So can you bring your own images?

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Can you set up a job and load up your virtual machines

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,097
onto a USB hard drive and send that to Amazon and have

28
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:42,597
them load that into your account?

29
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:43,347
Yeah you can.

30
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:46,903
Now if you talk to engineers at Amazon,

31
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:52,256
the feature that they are utilizing when they're designing features for AWS

32
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:56,347
usually involves the latest distribution of Linux or Windows.

33
00:01:56,347 --> 00:02:00,625
So you could be causing yourself some security problems and performance

34
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,680
problems by adhering to an old version of the operating system.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,347
Best practice is to use the latest version of the operating

36
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,947
system that you're deploying on if possible.

37
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:14,947
Now we also have images that are loaded for us,

38
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:16,147
Amazon machine instances,

39
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:21,347
and we can start with a certain size and usually when you start on the

40
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:24,347
cloud you won't pick the exact size of instance,

41
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:24,821
i.

42
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:25,294
e.

43
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:29,084
the RAM, CPU and network components you need.

44
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:33,347
So you can resize these without rebuilding from scratch.

45
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:38,014
You can turn off the instance, choose a bigger chunk of hardware,

46
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:41,280
virtual hardware, turn it back on, virtual scaling.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,214
And lastly,

48
00:02:42,214 --> 00:02:47,347
there's lots of choices for the isolation of your company's workloads,

49
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,242
for the security of the instances,

50
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:52,400
many different sizes and you can choose not to run

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,764
in a multi-tenant environment,

52
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:58,347
and we're going to get into those idiosyncrasies in this module.

53
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,569
Now let's get into a little more design,

54
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:03,347
this slide entitled isolation security because there is a degree

55
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:08,014
of isolation you want your stuff to be separated at the very

56
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:10,347
least by network access control lists.

57
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,597
So let's look at this.

58
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,847
At the bottom you would expect some physical hardware,

59
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:17,347
we haven't figured out how to get rid of that physical hardware.

60
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:20,347
I think we're never going to figure that out.

61
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,084
Physical interfaces,

62
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:25,136
on top of that a special firewall layer that Amazon utilizes,

63
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:30,147
so they have in the stack a couple of unique pieces that they utilize.

64
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:34,347
As far as the customer is concerned, Customer A or Customer B,

65
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,465
for example, sitting on top of the Xen hypervisor,

66
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,347
how do they get out to the network?

67
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:39,983
Well they have to decide, i.

68
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:40,256
e.

69
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:44,347
the customer has to decide on the virtual network cards and how they're set up,

70
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:47,256
what networks they're associated with, are they public,

71
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,347
are they private?

72
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:51,497
How do I secure traffic with my security groups?

73
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,647
So we've got a stack there that's providing a

74
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:56,610
certain level of security isolation.

75
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,715
So a little more detail,

76
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:04,711
the Xen hypervisor is going to run the guest operating system in Ring 1.

77
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:11,529
CPUs have a number of these modes of operation from 0 to 3 called rings,

78
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:16,947
so if we're running the guest operating system in Ring number 1,

79
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:22,347
let's have a bit of isolation by executing the host operating system,

80
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:22,732
i.

81
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:23,116
e.

82
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:27,347
the hypervisor, executing in Ring 0, so we have some separation.

83
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:31,347
And then we have our applications, which we want to separate even further.

84
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:37,700
So with our applications in mind, the applications run in Ring 3,

85
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,347
so there's security separation between the host,

86
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:45,347
the virtual machine itself, and then the application.

87
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:49,935
So clear separation between the guest and the hypervisor,

88
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:53,112
so we've got some security separation.

89
00:04:53,112 --> 00:04:58,926
Now each virtual instance has an operating system, you choose it.

90
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:04,189
So the operating system that you know, such as firewalls,

91
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:06,294
IP tables, for example,

92
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:09,014
or maybe specific security features in the operating

93
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:11,236
system that you might be enabling as well,

94
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,247
just the same as you did on-prem,

95
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:17,147
you can do this the same exact way at Amazon and that's your

96
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,610
control feature and you're in charge of that.

97
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,715
Amazon doesn't care what you do, they would prefer that it's heavily secured,

98
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:24,347
of course.

99
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:27,458
The instances are fully isolated from each other,

100
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,180
Customer A, Customer B, and as mentioned,

101
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,614
the security groups, the firewall, protects the ingress and egress access.

102
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:40,659
Additional firewall information, we don't get to control this layer,

103
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,972
but Amazon does,

104
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:46,791
there's an additional AWS firewall located at the hypervisor level where

105
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,347
they've put additional protections to protect the customer.

106
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:52,747
So in regards to this AWS firewall layer,

107
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:56,747
well the packets have to pass through this layer from the physical interface,

108
00:05:56,747 --> 00:06:00,347
moving up to the virtual NICs for the customer.

109
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:01,547
So in effect,

110
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:06,270
each instance can be treated as if they're on a completely separate

111
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,347
physical host because of this additional firewall layer.

112
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:14,347
That may not be enough for you, but this is a starting point for AWS.

113
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:17,529
Now all instances are going to be using virtual disks.

114
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:22,147
We don't have access to the raw device itself, but we get virtual disks.

115
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:25,347
And we have a very interesting virtualization layer.

116
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:27,747
So when shut an instance down,

117
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:31,747
the storage is automatically reset and the memory is scrubbed,

118
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:37,722
the memory is not returned to the pool of memory on the physical host

119
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,347
that's available until it's completely scrubbed.

120
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:44,452
So let's summarize some additional points just to keep it top of mind

121
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:49,039
when looking at what we do at AWS for instance security.

122
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,347
So available security options for the EC2 instance.

123
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,972
The instances are located, in addition,

124
00:06:55,972 --> 00:07:00,347
in a VPC at the very least the default VPC.

125
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:05,014
In this day and age it's going to be in a virtual private network

126
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:07,347
with a customer specified IP address range.

127
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:11,136
From that network location we have security groups and network ACLs to

128
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:13,809
control all of the inbound and outbound traffic.

129
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:19,347
You have to use security groups, it's optional for the network ACLs.

130
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:23,465
We have dedicated hosts or dedicated instances for additional security,

131
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:27,397
but you don't have to do everything in the multitenant

132
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,497
environment if you don't want to.

133
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:34,347
In order to securely connect to our instances we can use on-prem hardware

134
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:40,347
and set up an IPsec VPN to connect to the Amazon resource.

135
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:44,633
You have root access to all of your instances and it's up to you to

136
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:47,014
control that password once Amazon creates the instance,

137
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:48,680
passes it over to you,

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,347
once you reset those passwords only you know what they are.

139
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,983
Now the SLA for EC2 instances is 99.

140
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:57,802
95% available per region.

141
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:02,983
What I mean by this is you have to design your DR,

142
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:07,120
if you just have one instance running and if you have no failover,

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,547
you're going to find you don't have much of an SLA.

144
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:13,847
They're giving you the toolbox so you can make the decisions

145
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:16,969
on how you should operate in the cloud.

146
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:24,000
Each instance also has assigned to it a public and private IP address.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,458
When you set up your instances,

148
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:29,347
you can make these choices as to how you want this to actually be set up.

149
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:40,000
And we're going to be expanding upon all of these points throughout this module. So there's a look at initial security for EC2 instances.
