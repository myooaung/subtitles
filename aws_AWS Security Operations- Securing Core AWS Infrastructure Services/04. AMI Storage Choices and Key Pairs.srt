1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,014
In this clip we're going to take a look at storage options as well as key pairs.

2
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:09,469
And we'll take a look at our host server,

3
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,469
which has a couple of instance for a couple of customers,

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,681
color coded, you can see in blue those instances are using ephemeral storage,

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:21,264
where in orange the instances, they're not doing exactly the same thing.

6
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:25,764
So Elastic Block Storage can be access, in this case,

7
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:30,485
by both of the instances for the blue and the orange customer.

8
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:34,014
So these Elastic Block Storage volumes, they are block storage,

9
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:36,514
but they're formatted based on the operating system that you're

10
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:40,214
attaching them to and what you can do with the block storage is

11
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:45,014
indicate when the instance shuts down, I want to keep my storage.

12
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:48,666
Now it can also create a snapshot, which gets stored over an S3, i.

13
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:48,927
e.

14
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:49,710
in a bucket,

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,414
so the number one advantage of Elastic Block Storage is taking those snapshots

16
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:57,751
and placing them in a bucket and then optionally I could take those snapshots

17
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,698
and manually copy them to a different region.

18
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:04,714
I also have the ability of using the Elastic File System,

19
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:08,914
this is more of a NAS solution where multiple servers can attach

20
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:11,741
to the volumes on the Elastic File System.

21
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:16,105
So we have a few storage choices, EBS, we know about S3,

22
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:21,236
we know about ephemeral, and now we know a little bit about EFS.

23
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:27,014
We'll do a little more work on EBS and S3 throughout these classes.

24
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:32,014
For now we're looking at the choices, when I spin up an instance - what can I do?

25
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:36,966
Lastly, Amazon EC2 key pairs, if I want to authenticate to my instance,

26
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:42,792
I have to use the key pairs and this is through public key

27
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:48,347
cryptography and I use this to decrypt and encrypt the

28
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:52,014
pertinent logon information, so before I log in to my instance,

29
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:54,014
I have to create a valid key pair.

30
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,559
If I don't have the key pair that I've assigned to an instance,

31
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:00,014
I'm not getting in, I have to start over.

32
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:06,014
So the name of the key pair must be linked to your instance at boot.

33
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:09,157
Linux, we'll use the key pair to log on via SSH.

34
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:11,728
Windows they'll use the key pair to decrypt the

35
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:17,014
administrator password and log on via RDP.

36
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:21,014
Now if you lose the private key for an instance store-backed instance,

37
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:23,014
you can't access the instance ever.

38
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:25,014
You have to start over.

39
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:36,000
EC2 keys are 2048-bit SSH-2 RSA keys. So there's a fair bit of security involved in that public/private key pair.
