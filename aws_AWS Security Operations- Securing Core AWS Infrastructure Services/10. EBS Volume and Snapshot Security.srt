1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,398
In this demo we're going to take a look at EBS volumes and the security

2
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:10,277
that we can attach to the EBS volumes and their snapshots.

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,186
So from the console let's go into EBS.

4
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:14,277
Don't see it.

5
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:18,277
Now the reason you don't see it, it's kind of interesting,

6
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:22,944
it's not in the new menu, we have to go into EC2,

7
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:25,277
that's where the volumes are attached.

8
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:29,277
So on the right we can go down and there is Elastic Block Store.

9
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:32,277
So let's go into Volumes and we can see there is a number of volumes.

10
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:34,410
Some are in use and some are available.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,277
Now what does it mean in use?

12
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:41,368
Well you can bet if they're in use they're probably attached to an instance,

13
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:44,277
so let's go back up to the dashboard.

14
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,055
There's one running instance, but I'll bet you there's three.

15
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:49,277
And each of these will have a volume.

16
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:53,190
Now if we go back down to volumes and let's select the one that is

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,077
in use at the top and let's change our view,

18
00:00:56,077 --> 00:01:00,877
now we can see this is a volume for the web server,

19
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:05,499
it's attached, it's a general purpose, it's a certain size,

20
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:11,610
and there is a snapshot associated with this particular EBS volume,

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,277
it's not encrypted.

22
00:01:13,277 --> 00:01:15,563
And there's no option here where I can encrypt it and we'll

23
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:17,277
look at that as we go through this demo.

24
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,540
Now along with every volume there are status checks.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,983
If I look at Monitoring, there are 9 CloudWatch metrics I could use.

26
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:30,277
So I can take a look at the read, the write, throughput, the queue.

27
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:33,277
Now if I was concerned about some of my volumes,

28
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:36,277
if I was worried about how the volume was participating,

29
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:40,141
and there has been some of this at Wired Brain Coffee as they scale up in size,

30
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,803
so one of the recommendations from Globomantics is that they create some alarms.

31
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,645
So I could go through and create the alarm,

32
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:53,004
send a notification to a topic, I don't see a topic there that's useful to us,

33
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:58,488
so let's go through and create a topic, pick some name that will make sense,

34
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:02,277
we can send it to a particular account whenever the average of

35
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:05,340
throughput percentage is greater than say 65%.

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,277
We want to see what's happening with this box.

37
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:11,077
And we can create this alarm.

38
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:15,277
I could also define tags, so we could give a name of web server.

39
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:20,277
So there's a review of the volumes, let's go and create a volume.

40
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:27,388
So if I want to create a volume, I then have the definition of General Purpose,

41
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:30,103
Provisioned IOPS, if I want a certain speed,

42
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,538
and we're not worried yet about the IOPS,

43
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:36,610
but we could come in and create a volume and say we are

44
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,944
interested in IOPS and set our speed.

45
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:43,277
Now notice at the bottom, regardless of whether I pick provisioned IOPS or not,

46
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:45,277
I can go through and encrypt this volume.

47
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:49,467
Let's go back to General Purpose and we'll create this volume

48
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:53,277
and once it's created we can give it a name,

49
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:53,902
log files.

50
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:56,714
Now what if I want to encrypt this volume?

51
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:58,277
Well I missed my chance.

52
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:01,277
Now there's ways that I can end up with an encrypted volume,

53
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:02,777
but I can't do it here,

54
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:06,488
I have to make that decision at the time of volume creation.

55
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:11,277
So let's create another volume and we'll make it General Purpose as well,

56
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:13,027
but we'll encrypt this volume.

57
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,527
And when I encrypt this volume, I've got some choices,

58
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:20,420
do I want a default master key provided by Amazon or

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,277
do I want to bring my own keys?

60
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:27,277
So we'll accept the defaults, but before we click Create,

61
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:29,277
look at the Snapshot ID.

62
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:34,732
So I can actually go through and decide that I want to

63
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:37,913
create a volume from an existing snapshot,

64
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:42,848
and you can see that there's a number of snapshots that are there.

65
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,277
So we'll create this.

66
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:49,277
So let's name this volume, this is going to be encrypted volume.

67
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:53,277
Let's look at the properties of this drive, and we can see now it is encrypted.

68
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:58,732
We've got the KMS Key ID and we've got that core information

69
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:01,913
as to where it's actually being encrypted,

70
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:03,277
in US East.

71
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:08,277
Next, let's take this encrypted drive and create a snapshot.

72
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:13,277
Name is going to be encrypted data snapshot, it's encrypted.

73
00:04:13,277 --> 00:04:15,277
Why is it encrypted?

74
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:20,277
Well the volume's already encrypted, it's going to remain encrypted.

75
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,512
Let's click Create.

76
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,159
The process has started.

77
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:29,277
So if we go over to our snapshots, it's completed, and there is our drive.

78
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:30,077
It's encrypted.

79
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:37,027
What I could do with this is also copy this volume and notice if I'm copying it,

80
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:42,277
it's defining it as it's encrypted, once it's encrypted it's staying encrypted.

81
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:46,652
Now I also could take a look at, so let's look at the root drive,

82
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:49,277
and we can see that this is not encrypted.

83
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:52,077
There's a Permissions tab, it's a private snapshot.

84
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,527
I could go through and change that,

85
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,322
maybe I would like to share that with another account.

86
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:03,641
If I wanted to do that, I could add in the account number,

87
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:09,066
so in this case I could add in another account that's linked to

88
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:13,527
Wired Brain and say okay I've now got permissions assigned from

89
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:14,777
this snapshot to multiple accounts.

90
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:18,277
Now it's the GUI so things are running in the background and taking time,

91
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,944
so let's speed this up,

92
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:24,610
let's go back to Modify Permissions and we can see right now it's private,

93
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,277
but it's linked between the account that I'm logged in as and another account.

94
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:30,689
I'm linking them together,

95
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:35,277
and I could change this from private to public if I wanted to.

96
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:37,753
So I've got the control, I think I want to keep this private,

97
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,277
after all it is for my web server.

98
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:43,777
So let's go back to Snapshots, change our view,

99
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:49,277
and take another snapshot and from Actions say Create a Volume.

100
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:51,119
Now notice the volume is not encrypted,

101
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:55,046
so I can't change this here because it wasn't started as an encrypted volume,

102
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:59,277
so when the volume was snapshotted, the rules were in effect.

103
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:03,799
But what if I go through and say I would like to copy?

104
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:07,277
Now I can copy the snapshot to a new snapshot,

105
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:12,991
it's going to be in US East and I can encrypt it.

106
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:17,277
So the dance between our volumes is like this.

107
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,822
I start with a volume, I can choose to encrypt it or not,

108
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:24,777
if I don't encrypt it, then the cycle from creating the volume,

109
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:28,277
snapshotting the volume, means it remains unencrypted.

110
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:28,777
However,

111
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:36,277
if I go to the snapshots of a volume that is not encrypted and decide

112
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:39,856
to copy this snapshot I can encrypt this snapshot.

113
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:42,698
So let's do this, and once this process finishes,

114
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:46,095
you can see it's pending as far as the status,

115
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:50,459
we can see our copied snapshot and from this snapshot we can

116
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:53,134
then go through and create a new volume,

117
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:55,420
which is encrypted because when I copied it,

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,277
I encrypted it.

119
00:06:56,277 --> 00:07:00,277
So creating the volume, I have an encrypted volume,

120
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:05,159
so going over to Volumes, I've got my volume at the top.

121
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,277
I can attach this to an instance, but it has to support EBS encryption.

122
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:13,652
But I don't have an instance that supports encryption, why?

123
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:17,508
Because I've created very small inexpensive 3-tier images in these

124
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:20,277
demos and so it doesn't match up with encryption.

125
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:23,991
I would have to create an instance that supports encryption and then I

126
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:26,563
could attach the volume and it would be encrypted.

127
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:35,000
So there's a look at EBS security and some of the ways it's being carried out at Wired Brain Coffee and some other options.
