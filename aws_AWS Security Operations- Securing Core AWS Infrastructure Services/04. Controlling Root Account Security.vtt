00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:04.787
In this clip we're going to take a look at the root account and

2
00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:06.605
how to control the security of that account.

3
00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:11.176
So when you sign up for your account for the first time,

4
00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:14.605
Amazon likes to call it the initial business arrangement,

5
00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:16.500
so you'll sign up, you'll have an email address,

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.394
that's how you get to Amazon the first time,

7
00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:20.252
across the internet, and password.

8
00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:25.605
You're the root account, this is the account which cannot be locked down,

9
00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:30.605
you have full access to anything that you want to order within AWS cloud family,

10
00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:33.176
you can do so, there's no restrictions.

11
00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:36.034
The account cannot be disabled.

12
00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:40.605
So don't use this account for daily operations.

13
00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:41.855
Now do people do this?

14
00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:42.855
Of course they do.

15
00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.605
But you don't want to get into a situation where somebody gets those

16
00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:50.605
credentials and can wreck havoc on your account.

17
00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:55.805
Anybody that you allow to use that account is the root person.

18
00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.905
This is totally outside of IAM control,

19
00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:01.805
there is no control restrictions that you can do on that account,

20
00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:04.605
so pretty important in the corporate world.

21
00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:06.664
So to manage that account,

22
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:11.605
you better take those credentials and store them in a physical safe.

23
00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:15.487
Multi-factor authentication should also be enabled on the root account and

24
00:01:15.487 --> 00:01:19.205
there's both hardware and virtual devices that can be supported.

25
00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:23.205
Now the virtual device has to support the TOTP standard,

26
00:01:23.205 --> 00:01:26.462
this is the time-based one time password standard,

27
00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:31.605
and one of the virtual devices you could use is Google authenticator.

28
00:01:31.605 --> 00:01:33.383
Hardware device, Gemalto devices,

29
00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:38.716
and there's another way of doing the MFA and that's through SMS,

30
00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:42.272
but those devices are not compatible with the root account,

31
00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:45.605
have to have a higher level of security for that.

32
00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.487
So best practices for your root account,

33
00:01:48.487 --> 00:01:52.605
first thing, create an IAM role with full admin privileges.

34
00:01:52.605 --> 00:01:55.272
Then change that root account, the password,

35
00:01:55.272 --> 00:02:01.230
to a random string, and then what you want to do is don't save the password,

36
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.605
throw it away, so you don't know how to get in with that credential.

37
00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.700
Lock it up into the safe and there are a couple of reasons

38
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.605
why you might have to use that account.

39
00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:13.938
Use the forgot password to gain access to that account.

40
00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:17.605
So a couple of best practices to take a look at.

41
00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.605
So when do I need the root account?

42
00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:22.105
Well if you have to change the root account information,

43
00:02:22.105 --> 00:02:25.462
maybe that email address, you're not going to use it any longer,

44
00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:29.605
think of the times you may have set up a website and you forgot

45
00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:32.938
the credentials of that website and then you couldn't actually

46
00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:35.868
talk to the registrar about that website because you didn't know

47
00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:36.710
what the credentials were.

48
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.795
So again, think of that when you're looking at the importance of this account.

49
00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:41.938
The next time you might need the root account,

50
00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:44.917
you may have to set up or deactivate account billing.

51
00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:50.605
If you want to transfer a Route 53 domain registration to another customer,

52
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:52.272
another account, you'll need the root account.

53
00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.129
If you want to close the AWS account you have to use

54
00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.129
the account that you started with.

55
00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.843
If you want to submit a pen test request to test your public IP addresses,

56
00:03:02.843 --> 00:03:06.605
and finally the number one reason that you need your root account for,

57
00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:08.787
can I have a drum roll please, okay,

58
00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:12.297
the number one reason is to buy stuff on Amazon.

59
00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:14.605
We all have that account, right?

60
00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:17.060
Well you know I meant AWS.

61
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.469
amazon.

62
00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:23.605
com, but are you using your root account for AWS to buy stuff on Amazon?

63
00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:26.605
So let's look at some of these concepts in a demo.

64
00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:30.605
In this demo we're going to look at managing root account security.

65
00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:32.605
So I've logged into the console.

66
00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:34.605
There's a user account on screen.

67
00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:38.105
How do I know this user account isn't the root account?

68
00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:40.969
Well there's a clear clue in front of us,

69
00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.447
this user Mark has some policy attached.

70
00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:47.131
Policies aren't attached to the root user because the root

71
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:50.005
user could do anything that it wants to do.

72
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:51.125
So let's log out.

73
00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:56.127
We'll go back into the console and the console is ready for me to log on as an

74
00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:59.257
IAM user because I have logged on previously as an IAM user,

75
00:03:59.257 --> 00:04:03.958
but if I use this link at the bottom, sign-in using root account credentials,

76
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.723
it'll give in and say alright email address,

77
00:04:07.723 --> 00:04:09.605
password, let's go in.

78
00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:15.388
So if I go down to IAM, it will tell me that I should delete my root access keys,

79
00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:18.005
I should activate MFA on my root account.

80
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:22.905
Those are the two pieces that are going to apply to the root account,

81
00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:23.855
everything else no.

82
00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.105
If I go in and look at the users,

83
00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:29.355
I'm not going to see the root user account because the root user

84
00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:32.514
account is above all other accounts that are created.

85
00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:37.605
So let's go back and if I want to delete my root access keys,

86
00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:41.562
I would go in and manage my security credentials and then it would

87
00:04:41.562 --> 00:04:44.605
warn me that hey we know you're the root account,

88
00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:48.105
let's set up some IAM users, we know that,

89
00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:51.605
so let's continue to security credentials and under credentials,

90
00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:52.083
i.

91
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:52.562
e.

92
00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:56.388
access keys, is where I could make inactive.

93
00:04:56.388 --> 00:05:02.605
So that's where I could remove my access key for my root account.

94
00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:06.445
Now if I go back up to the menu I can also,

95
00:05:06.445 --> 00:05:10.285
if I was going to use the root account I probably should

96
00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:11.383
activate multi-factor authentication.

97
00:05:11.383 --> 00:05:12.549
Clicking Manage MFA,

98
00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:16.827
it would then ask whether I wanted to use a virtual

99
00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:19.605
MFA device or a hardware MFA device.

100
00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:24.405
I could click Next Step and decide which device I was actually

101
00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:28.546
going to use and it would tell me I'd have to do some

102
00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:30.605
installation of software and set this up.

103
00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:35.605
So these are the areas where I would manage the root account security.

104
00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:42.272
The last thing I could do for my root account would be change the password by

105
00:05:42.272 --> 00:05:46.480
going up to my name and going into security credentials,

106
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.293
clicking Continue to security credentials and here's where I could change

107
00:05:51.293 --> 00:06:02.000
the password name or email address for the root account. So there's a look at managing root account security at AWS.
