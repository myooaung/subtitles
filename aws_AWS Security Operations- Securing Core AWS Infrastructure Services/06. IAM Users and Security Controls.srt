1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,800
In this clip IAM Users and Security Controls,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,323
we're going to delve a little bit further into the concept of IAM

3
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:11,871
and what it's performing and then in upcoming clips we're going

4
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:14,473
to get into creating the policies, applying them,

5
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,806
so and so forth.

6
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:19,996
So defining access, that's what I want to do with IAM,

7
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:23,806
other than being the root user, and I'm accessing data,

8
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:27,235
that's the most important, and if I'm a user,

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:32,206
well do I really want to give users direct access to data or

10
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:36,606
do I want the user instead to query the application server

11
00:00:36,606 --> 00:00:40,556
and the application server says, well I've got to check,

12
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:45,806
can I do and it sees if there's a policy applied to the server.

13
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:50,606
Now these policies are JSON format and so every time a request

14
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:53,806
is carried out where our policy is involved,

15
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:56,701
you're going to get an answer back that hey thumbs up,

16
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:58,806
you can do that, or no you can't.

17
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:02,284
And the best practice is don't do this by user,

18
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:06,806
add that user to a group to define the access in that way.

19
00:01:06,806 --> 00:01:12,406
So identity and access management, giving me a flow for accessing users,

20
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,806
groups, and more.

21
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:17,806
So after that initial root user has been created,

22
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:21,806
in order to get additional users you're using IAM.

23
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:24,306
It's controlling the authentication and the authorized

24
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,806
access to the resources in your account.

25
00:01:26,806 --> 00:01:31,806
It's also providing central management of user accounts and user

26
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:35,806
access to resources based on users and groups,

27
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:36,406
roles, i.

28
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:36,706
e.

29
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:39,706
what is the server doing, is it an application server,

30
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:44,187
is it a database server, the policies which some provided by AWS,

31
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,092
a managed policy, i.

32
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:46,568
e.

33
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:50,377
a policy you can manage, an inline policy,

34
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:54,868
inline with a role, a computer system, an application server,

35
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:58,806
or an custom policies that you want to create.

36
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:01,139
So you have questions, we have answers.

37
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,806
Access to the management console?

38
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,442
Assign a password.

39
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:08,806
Access AWS resources via a script or automation?

40
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:11,901
Create an access key or maybe you're using an existing access key, i.

41
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:12,139
e.

42
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,988
a secret access key that might be enabled for the account.

43
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:19,806
Controlling access to the resources at AWS?

44
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,806
Attaching a policy to the user?

45
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,473
Let's attach the user to an IAM group,

46
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:29,306
that's the best practice and I know I keep hammering that point,

47
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,806
but really important.

48
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:31,806
Extra security?

49
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:36,806
Add multi-factor authentication to either the root account or the IAM user.

50
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,648
So looking at IAM at work for access points,

51
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:42,806
maybe I want to control access to the S3 bucket.

52
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:46,306
I've got specific needs and requirements for some content.

53
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:50,606
Maybe it's an EC2 instance and the access to database records.

54
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:55,806
Maybe it's specific access to a folder in S3, not the whole bucket.

55
00:02:55,806 --> 00:03:00,806
Maybe it's access through Cognito for a single sign on.

56
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:05,949
Maybe it's database access when the username matches the actual IAM policy.

57
00:03:05,949 --> 00:03:09,377
There could be a lot of scenarios where you want to set

58
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,753
up access using a policy through IAM.

59
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:16,964
So you could look at this as administrative setup for access,

60
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:19,806
what about the end user access?

61
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:22,761
For IAM @ Work for Users at the very least you get to

62
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,351
change your own password on a schedule,

63
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:27,806
perhaps you set up IAM to define group membership,

64
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:30,806
somebody managing the members of a group.

65
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:33,663
That's all they can do, that's what you want them to do.

66
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,806
Maybe you want somebody to manage other IAM users,

67
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:38,806
that's as far as you want them to go.

68
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:42,806
Maybe it's for setting the actual account policy, the default account policy.

69
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,806
Maybe all you need to do is create security reports.

70
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:49,982
Again, we can get very granular and define the jobs for the end user,

71
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:52,041
the jobs for people using the resources,

72
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,806
what they can and can't do.

73
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:56,988
When we have an IAM policy it's checked every time

74
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:00,806
access is requested via from that user, that group or that role.

75
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:05,806
There's a policy attached, let's review it, every time.

76
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:07,079
Did I mention Every.

77
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:07,397
Time.

78
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:10,897
It's not like you get a DHCP lease for 7 days,

79
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:17,000
we're checking it every single time. We don't want any holes.
