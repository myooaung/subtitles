00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.896
Well hello mate, that's my best Australian.

2
00:00:02.896 --> 00:00:09.130
I'm sitting here in the Amazon console, we're going to do a VPC security demo,

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.273
and looking at the initial setup of a VPC for Wired Brain.

4
00:00:14.273 --> 00:00:16.178
We're getting used to this.

5
00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:20.368
So we're going to use the wizard and we're going to

6
00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.273
set up public private subnets.

7
00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:28.273
We don't have a data center or we would pick hardware VPN access.

8
00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:30.589
We've just got Amazon.

9
00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.905
So public/private subnets, select.

10
00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:37.536
Now we get a CIDR block and 10.

11
00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:38.115
0.

12
00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:38.694
0.

13
00:00:38.694 --> 00:00:43.823
0/16, so up to 65, 000 nodes we're covered, but is that too many?

14
00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:48.273
Remember that's the growth potential for the public and private subnet.

15
00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:53.273
Do I think I'm going to ever have 251 nodes?

16
00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:57.006
If I sell a lot of coffee, sure.

17
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.273
What about 251 application servers, database servers?

18
00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:05.273
I probably could change that and say I'm going to make that a bit smaller.

19
00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.799
So when I'm looking at security,

20
00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.273
I might want to ensure that I don't have too many addresses available,

21
00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:17.273
just in case there's an address that's available that can be coerced and used.

22
00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:20.606
Now availability zones, we're going to start in the southeast,

23
00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:25.391
of course we're eventually going to want to failover between availability zones.

24
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:26.979
The VPC name.

25
00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.273
Now how do my systems on my private subnet communicate

26
00:01:32.273 --> 00:01:34.073
with the outside world for updates?

27
00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:35.873
I can define a NAT gateway,

28
00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:39.091
but I don't have an elastic IP allocation as of yet

29
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.728
because I've not set that up.

30
00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:44.273
I think we're going to start off with a NAT gateway instance anyways

31
00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:48.113
and if I select that option then I could decide on the size of it and

32
00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:50.273
the key pair that I was going to use.

33
00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:55.273
Now I don't have a key pair defined at this point, so I probably should do that.

34
00:01:55.273 --> 00:02:01.273
So let's go over to Services, up to EC2 and let's define a key pair.

35
00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:06.273
So we'll create a key pair, this is going to be wired brain Australia.

36
00:02:06.273 --> 00:02:08.460
Download it and we're good to go.

37
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.273
So now I can add in my key pair.

38
00:02:11.273 --> 00:02:13.273
Now let's look at the end point.

39
00:02:13.273 --> 00:02:15.273
This defines access to an S3 bucket.

40
00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:19.091
This is currently the only VPC access endpoint that I can define

41
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:22.273
right now and I want it for my public subnet.

42
00:02:22.273 --> 00:02:25.431
In the future people are going to be able to upload content

43
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.273
dealing with their coffees that they make.

44
00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:30.321
So we want to get that set up.

45
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:35.606
Now we could also define our policy and use the policy creation tool to

46
00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:38.940
set up a policy that says for this particular bucket,

47
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.273
this is the policy.

48
00:02:40.273 --> 00:02:44.273
In this case the default is full access for any user and service.

49
00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:45.909
We'll leave that alone for now,

50
00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.182
but you can see that you'd probably want to go and edit

51
00:02:49.182 --> 00:02:50.979
that once you started having uploads.

52
00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.391
DNS host names, yes.

53
00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:56.273
Hardware tenancy, I'm going to leave it as shared for now.

54
00:02:56.273 --> 00:03:01.273
Let's create a VPC.

55
00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:06.273
So our VPC has successfully been created, let's click OK and it will show up.

56
00:03:06.273 --> 00:03:10.273
There's my Wired Brain VPC, tenancy of default,

57
00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:14.273
network ACL, we've got DHCP options automatically set,

58
00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:15.523
we have a route table.

59
00:03:15.523 --> 00:03:17.523
Let's take a look at our route table.

60
00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:20.852
So if we highlight the route table and look at the routes,

61
00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:24.010
we can see that there is definitely local access and

62
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.702
there's my elastic network interface,

63
00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:31.273
let's go up to EC2 and there's my instance that is being defined

64
00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:35.909
for my NAT and it will have an address of 13.

65
00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.318
55.

66
00:03:36.318 --> 00:03:36.728
204,

67
00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:42.864
we'll see that that is where the elastic IP address has been placed in my

68
00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:45.799
account and associated with the particular instance.

69
00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.273
So let's go back to the VPC and let's look at our subnets.

70
00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:55.273
So we have a number of subnets, what are these two unnamed subnets?

71
00:03:55.273 --> 00:04:02.273
Well if we expand our view, we can see that these are the default subnets.

72
00:04:02.273 --> 00:04:03.773
If I go over to VPCs,

73
00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:07.273
I would have a default and the one that I want to work with.

74
00:04:07.273 --> 00:04:09.391
When I go to Route Tables,

75
00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:13.273
I've got route tables specifically for my public and private subnet.

76
00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:17.273
If I go up to subnets, if I wanted to create an additional subnet,

77
00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:20.398
note that this where I could start adding in

78
00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:23.211
information for the availability zone.

79
00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:29.773
I definitely would want these additional subnets to be in southeast-2b or 2c.

80
00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:34.273
So creating additional subnets would absolutely be what I'd want to do.

81
00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:39.523
If I look at internet gateways, I can see I have an internet gateway,

82
00:04:39.523 --> 00:04:40.273
it's attached.

83
00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:41.364
So I've got connectivity,

84
00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:46.000
which means if I go back up to my subnet and select my public subnet and look

85
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.818
at the route table for the public subnet so we can see for my public subnet I

86
00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:55.623
have local access and the internet gateway,

87
00:04:55.623 --> 00:04:57.373
that kind of makes sense.

88
00:04:57.373 --> 00:05:00.873
If I look at my private subnet, the route table,

89
00:05:00.873 --> 00:05:05.097
I have local access and my elastic network interface is there as

90
00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:08.273
well to allow my private nodes to get out.

91
00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:11.398
The next option I could define, which would be optional,

92
00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:13.273
would be down under Network ACLs.

93
00:05:13.273 --> 00:05:15.735
If I select the ACL for Wired Brain,

94
00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:21.273
you can see I have a couple of rules at the top of the list processed in order,

95
00:05:21.273 --> 00:05:23.773
rule number 100, all traffic allowed.

96
00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:31.273
So it would be up to me to change this and add in the rules that I wanted.

97
00:05:31.273 --> 00:05:33.023
For my Subnet Associations,

98
00:05:33.023 --> 00:05:38.273
associated with the public and private subnets of my virtual private cloud.

99
00:05:38.273 --> 00:05:40.773
So there's a look at the security components and the

100
00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:48.000
considerations you have to take care of in order to have a secure virtual private cloud.
