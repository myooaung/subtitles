00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.484
In this demo we're going to take a look at network interfaces and addresses.

2
00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:10.734
So let's start off by looking at what an EC2 instance has assigned when we're

3
00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:14.335
looking at the test environment for Wired Brain Coffee.

4
00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:18.500
So into EC2, now let's select the running instance.

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.493
So we can see the web server is running,

6
00:00:21.493 --> 00:00:25.484
and we can see that there are addresses assigned to this system,

7
00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.984
it's got a public IP, 51.

8
00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:28.401
145.

9
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:28.817
72.

10
00:00:28.817 --> 00:00:32.984
165, doesn't have an IP version 6, has private DNS,

11
00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:35.484
and has a private IP address.

12
00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:41.602
Assigned by Amazon in this case, we are running in the default VPC,

13
00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:43.484
so it's all automated.

14
00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:45.323
What if I wanted to do more?

15
00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:49.000
What if I wanted to add an additional network interface adapter to this system?

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.665
What if I wanted to add an elastic IP address to this system?

17
00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:56.116
What if I wanted to add a NIC to the SQL box and

18
00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:57.589
add two NICs on the private side?

19
00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.484
So there's a couple of things we can do.

20
00:00:59.484 --> 00:01:03.762
Let's start off with the web server and add an additional

21
00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:06.484
network interface adapter for the web server.

22
00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:09.859
So if we scroll down under Network and Security,

23
00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:12.484
there's a couple of interfaces already defined.

24
00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:16.770
We know they're all in the same VPC, we know they're in the same zone,

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.234
we know they have security groups and we know they're primary network adapters.

26
00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:24.431
Let's click on one of these and we can say okay, that's the SQL Server.

27
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:27.747
So let's add a new network interface.

28
00:01:27.747 --> 00:01:32.484
Description, this is going to be for the load balancer,

29
00:01:32.484 --> 00:01:34.919
so we will call this Nginx NIC.

30
00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:38.397
The subnet, it's going to be on the public side,

31
00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.484
and I need a security group,

32
00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:45.484
I'm going to select my default VPC security group and say Create.

33
00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:50.284
So there is my Nginx NIC, I can add a tag into this as well,

34
00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:53.484
and what do I want to do with this NIC?

35
00:01:53.484 --> 00:01:58.484
I want to attach it and I want to attach it to a particular instance,

36
00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.484
the web server, the load balancer.

37
00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:03.484
We're looking at this for Wired Brain Coffee and doing some tests.

38
00:02:03.484 --> 00:02:04.884
Now associate an address.

39
00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:09.434
So you're on the public subnet so if you want to associate an

40
00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:12.734
address that's going to be an elastic IP address,

41
00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:17.234
this is a static address that's in my account that I can

42
00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:20.757
choose to use and associate it with a particular NIC

43
00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:22.348
attached to a particular instance.

44
00:02:22.348 --> 00:02:27.651
So let's cancel out of here for a second and take a look at my elastic IPs.

45
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.567
So you can see I've got one in my account,

46
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:36.724
I'm paying a bit of money for it per month and I can use it and move it around.

47
00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:42.484
So I have some nice features for DR and we will go back to our NIC

48
00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:45.666
and say yes we would like to associate an address,

49
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.620
there's the 34.

50
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.284
197, that's what we want to do, and the associate to that private IP address.

51
00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:56.484
Now notice I also have the ability of detaching.

52
00:02:56.484 --> 00:02:58.151
Alright so I can detach,

53
00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:03.484
and what I could do then is attach to move it over to this web server.

54
00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:08.425
So note that I can move the network interface and the properties

55
00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:11.734
associated with that network interface will move with it.

56
00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:15.484
For now I'm just going to put it back where it was.

57
00:03:15.484 --> 00:03:19.719
Okay so there's some work with the addresses.

58
00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.484
Let's now add a NIC for my SQL box.

59
00:03:24.484 --> 00:03:27.151
So create another network interface.

60
00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:32.484
Description, I can have a second NIC, subnet, private subnet.

61
00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:32.960
RDSSecurityGroup.

62
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.198
Let's go back up to my dashboard, look at my instances,

63
00:03:38.198 --> 00:03:45.184
the test NGINX box, you can see I have my public and my private association.

64
00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:48.784
I have my SQL box, two network interfaces,

65
00:03:48.784 --> 00:03:52.612
the eth0 that I can't change, and the eth1,

66
00:03:52.612 --> 00:03:57.500
which I've added in for this system and for the NGINX load balancer.

67
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.000
Alright we're all set. So there's a look at network interfaces and addresses.
