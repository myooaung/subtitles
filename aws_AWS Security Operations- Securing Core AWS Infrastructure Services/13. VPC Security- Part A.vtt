00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.768
In this clip we're going to take a look at VPC security,

2
00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:09.567
look at the different tools and features that you can use to

3
00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:12.138
increase security when designing with VPCs.

4
00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:15.138
So what do we put in VPCs?

5
00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:19.834
The first thing that we add into a VPC is an instance.

6
00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:24.138
So this instance is hosted in the VPC, we get that,

7
00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:27.296
we can also choose to use network access control lists.

8
00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:31.805
This is really a firewall at the subnet level that controls both the

9
00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:35.138
inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

10
00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:36.281
This is stateless.

11
00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:41.614
We also have the subnet that the instance is on and the subnet will

12
00:00:41.614 --> 00:00:46.138
have a routing table saying what traffic is allowed in and out and

13
00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:50.138
then the NACLs will control that traffic and closes to the instance

14
00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:52.271
we have security groups.

15
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:57.605
Another firewall for the instance controlling inbound and outbound traffic,

16
00:00:57.605 --> 00:00:59.662
but at the instance level.

17
00:00:59.662 --> 00:01:04.995
So we have a couple of areas when we create a VPC that we

18
00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.875
should consider for absolute security.

19
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.559
Let's look at this graphically in a different way and

20
00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:16.138
when we look at the security levels, again we start with the EC2 instance,

21
00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:21.138
closest to the instance is the security group being part of your account.

22
00:01:21.138 --> 00:01:26.296
The security group can be modified on the fly if you decide to make

23
00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.538
changes for the inbound/outbound access to the instance.

24
00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:35.138
Next, we have the subnet, which the instance will be hosted on.

25
00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:38.085
Below the subnet, really associated with the subnet,

26
00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:42.138
is going to be the network access control lists that control

27
00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:44.938
the inbound/outbound from the subnet level.

28
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.805
Now this is, again,

29
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:50.956
stateless where the security group is considered stateful and

30
00:01:50.956 --> 00:01:54.138
we'll explain those terms in upcoming slides.

31
00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:57.454
Next we have the host of everything, the VPC,

32
00:01:57.454 --> 00:02:02.038
the software defined network that defines what you can do in this area

33
00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:05.038
of AWS and you've got these options that you decide,

34
00:02:05.038 --> 00:02:05.338
i.

35
00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:05.638
e.

36
00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:09.491
the NACLs and security group who are protecting your instance.

37
00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:12.314
When we look at security groups,

38
00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:18.201
they're mandatory in that when you spin up an instance it's going to

39
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:22.138
request that you create at least one security group.

40
00:02:22.138 --> 00:02:24.573
So you could make it pretty weak,

41
00:02:24.573 --> 00:02:28.747
you can say every computer in the world can access port 22,

42
00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.916
but they force you to think about it.

43
00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:34.582
Now we define this as stateful.

44
00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:38.138
If you allow inbound, then you've allowed outbound.

45
00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:41.138
So you can't just do one way.

46
00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:45.424
So this is operating at the instance level and it

47
00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:47.971
restricts the traffic by IP protocol,

48
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:52.138
by the service port and the source destination IP address.

49
00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.701
So how do these operate?

50
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.138
Well let's take a look at the security group operation rules.

51
00:02:57.138 --> 00:03:03.020
We've got inbound rules for TCP/IP port 80 from anywhere.

52
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.138
We've got TCP/IP port 443 from anywhere.

53
00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:16.138
SSH, port 22, from a specific IP address and UDP from port 2009 from anywhere.

54
00:03:16.138 --> 00:03:18.805
The security group is surrounding this instance.

55
00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:24.138
This is the security that we have at this point at the VPC level.

56
00:03:24.138 --> 00:03:28.582
So a security group provides allow rules, no deny rules.

57
00:03:28.582 --> 00:03:32.138
So port 80 from anywhere, yep that's allowed.

58
00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:34.233
Port 22 from 172.

59
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:34.757
30.

60
00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:35.281
1.

61
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.424
200, yep we can do that.

62
00:03:38.424 --> 00:03:41.567
What about port 102 from 0.

63
00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:42.090
0.

64
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.614
0.

65
00:03:42.614 --> 00:03:43.138
0/0?

66
00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:46.338
No, not defined, sorry you're not getting in.

67
00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:49.538
So the rules assigned to the security group,

68
00:03:49.538 --> 00:03:52.805
linked to the instance determine the access.

69
00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:56.138
Again, the key concept, they're stateful.

70
00:03:56.138 --> 00:04:01.314
A response to inbound traffic that's allowed is allowed to flow

71
00:04:01.314 --> 00:04:04.138
outbound regardless of any outbound rules.

72
00:04:04.138 --> 00:04:10.138
Now you may wonder, how many rules can I add to a security group?

73
00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:14.138
Now you can have up to 50 rules for each security group.

74
00:04:14.138 --> 00:04:17.138
Within the VPC you can have 100 security groups.

75
00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:20.138
So let's take a look at some best practices for security groups.

76
00:04:20.138 --> 00:04:25.296
And where you can get this information is from the Center of Internet Security,

77
00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:28.609
and Amazon is the only cloud provider, at this point,

78
00:04:28.609 --> 00:04:31.256
which has been aligned with the foundation and they've

79
00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:33.852
provided some interesting benchmarks, specifically for AWS,

80
00:04:33.852 --> 00:04:38.138
so certainly something to Google to get the full details.

81
00:04:38.138 --> 00:04:41.694
So some of their best practices to consider,

82
00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:46.138
the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic.

83
00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:47.471
So we restrict everything,

84
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.138
but then we poke holes into it with other security groups.

85
00:04:51.138 --> 00:04:58.197
No security groups allowing ingress from everywhere to port 22 and no

86
00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:02.471
security group allowing ingress from anywhere for port 3389.

87
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:07.138
So we want to ensure that we don't have holes in our security groups.

88
00:05:07.138 --> 00:05:10.008
We can go much deeper than this in the real world,

89
00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:13.138
highly recommend that you go over and take a look at the

90
00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:15.664
best practices for securing AWS resources.

91
00:05:15.664 --> 00:05:19.454
Now to keep everything nice and clean and simple,

92
00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:21.671
even when it gets complicated,

93
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:26.471
one of the recommendations as well is to separate

94
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.138
inbound and outbound traffic rules.

95
00:05:29.138 --> 00:05:31.995
Don't jumble them all together, make it nice and clean.

96
00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:35.138
So I could look at a solution for a whole project.

97
00:05:35.138 --> 00:05:37.664
So let's say we have a web tier,

98
00:05:37.664 --> 00:05:41.138
we've got an app tier and we've got a database tier.

99
00:05:41.138 --> 00:05:47.805
And we have different communications between these different tiers and

100
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:52.442
from external access outside Amazon into this tier.

101
00:05:52.442 --> 00:05:59.399
So if I add my firewalls in and say, well there's going to be HTTP access,

102
00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:04.438
port 80, port 443, I'm also going to do SSH,

103
00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:04.988
RDP,

104
00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:09.938
and I also want some on-prem access from resources

105
00:06:09.938 --> 00:06:12.834
on-prem linking to resources in Amazon.

106
00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:18.747
Now one other component we want to add in here is a way to do administration to

107
00:06:18.747 --> 00:06:22.938
any of the boxes in any of the tiers from my administrators.

108
00:06:22.938 --> 00:06:25.388
This is typically called a jump box,

109
00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:28.956
which allows you to jump from this box to the

110
00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:31.138
instances that are in the solution.

111
00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:35.138
So I don't want everyone having access to the jump box.

112
00:06:35.138 --> 00:06:38.405
In fact, if I'm not doing administration,

113
00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:42.138
the jump box instance should be turned off.

114
00:06:42.138 --> 00:06:44.486
So let's finish off this design.

115
00:06:44.486 --> 00:06:51.138
We can say HTTP port 80, port 443 to the web tier, that kind of makes sense.

116
00:06:51.138 --> 00:06:54.454
SSH or RDP to the jump box,

117
00:06:54.454 --> 00:06:57.770
the engineering staff or the development staff

118
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.369
needing access to their resources, and I also need on-prem access,

119
00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:07.138
database access, hosted at Amazon from on-prem.

120
00:07:07.138 --> 00:07:12.338
So once I've whiteboarded my architecture I can then step further and say

121
00:07:12.338 --> 00:07:16.805
alright I need a security group solution for the jump box.

122
00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:23.055
I need a security group solution for the web tier to talk to the app

123
00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:27.638
tier and the app tier to talk to the different tier.

124
00:07:27.638 --> 00:07:30.138
So there's a number of considerations.

125
00:07:30.138 --> 00:07:33.233
This clip we've looked at a lot of things to do with VPCs

126
00:07:33.233 --> 00:07:34.662
and the different tools and features,

127
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:45.000
now let's move on to clip number B where we're explore the custom security groups and some additional VPC connectivity options.
