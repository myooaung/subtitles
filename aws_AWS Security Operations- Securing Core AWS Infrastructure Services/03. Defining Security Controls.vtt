00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.053
In this demo we're going to take a look at defining some of the

2
00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:07.789
security credentials that we can use in AWS.

3
00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:11.218
I'm going to show you where they show up in the GUI

4
00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:13.218
and give you some food for thought.

5
00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:15.885
So first of all we have to log in to the console,

6
00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:18.107
so if I want to look at the root account,

7
00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:20.361
I'll have to log on as the root account,

8
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:23.218
although we know that's note the safe thing to do.

9
00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:24.551
So let's do that,

10
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:28.218
sign into the console and since the last time that I

11
00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:31.218
logged on to AWS I used the root account,

12
00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:35.107
it's still showing up as a root account log on.

13
00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:38.218
I know that because of my email address.

14
00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:39.418
So I can sign in.

15
00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:42.298
Now this is the only time I'm using the user account and

16
00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:44.955
password for the first time I set up my account,

17
00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:49.376
so this is the master account for my Amazon services and I

18
00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:52.491
shouldn't be in doing things using that root account,

19
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:56.309
but we do want to look at the situation as far as

20
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.218
security options for the root user.

21
00:00:58.218 --> 00:01:03.978
So if we go up to my name and take a look at my security credentials,

22
00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:07.218
we can see what is the state right now.

23
00:01:07.218 --> 00:01:10.218
Note it comes up and says you're accessing security credentials,

24
00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:15.885
we know your root, we just want you to know maybe you should go over to go IAM.

25
00:01:15.885 --> 00:01:18.218
I'll continue, but you get the idea.

26
00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:20.957
So my password, if I expand password,

27
00:01:20.957 --> 00:01:27.218
it tells me you use an email address and password to sign in for this account,

28
00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:31.991
so you could change the password, this is where I could create a random password,

29
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:36.218
not save it, not write it down, and lock this account out.

30
00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:38.618
If I look at multi-factor authentication,

31
00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:41.277
I could activate multi-factor authentication for this

32
00:01:41.277 --> 00:01:43.747
account using a virtual or hardware device,

33
00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:46.218
this is where I would do that.

34
00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:48.718
If I want to take a look at my access keys,

35
00:01:48.718 --> 00:01:50.536
we'll find out that there are access keys,

36
00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:53.305
they've been here for a year or so, some of them,

37
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:56.696
some of them much longer, you can see that one was created 2016,

38
00:01:56.696 --> 00:02:00.018
one was initially created 2011, and it was deleted,

39
00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:03.218
but then a new one was added in.

40
00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:08.218
And note, we can have access keys active or inactive at one time.

41
00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:11.218
So over on the right I could make this key inactive,

42
00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:14.218
I won't do that right now, but in a real account,

43
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:15.060
a real corporate account,

44
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.218
that would be the first thing that I would be doing after I created an

45
00:02:18.218 --> 00:02:20.336
administrative account for doing administrative work.

46
00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:25.481
Note I can also create a new access key if that's something that I need to do,

47
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:28.218
if I have removed the key and want to add it back in.

48
00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:29.809
Next we have key pairs.

49
00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.718
If I expand CloudFront key pairs,

50
00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:36.902
you can see that there is a key pair that is in place for CloudFront,

51
00:02:36.902 --> 00:02:39.007
for the content delivery network.

52
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:45.336
Now the other area we can look for key pairs is when we set up IAM.

53
00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:49.218
And lastly, we could take a look at the account identifiers.

54
00:02:49.218 --> 00:02:51.586
And you can see the account identifiers and the

55
00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:53.165
canonical user ID are displayed here,

56
00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:56.744
so this is where I can get the information for this account.

57
00:02:56.744 --> 00:03:01.051
Let's see what changes if I log on as an administrator through IAM.

58
00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:04.801
So let's sign out and we'll sign back in,

59
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:10.218
but I'm going to sign back in by using a console log on.

60
00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:13.082
This is a console log on driven by IAM,

61
00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:16.263
which says okay we're not giving you the entire console,

62
00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.885
so log in with your IAm username and then password.

63
00:03:19.885 --> 00:03:23.694
When I sign in and I go to my Services,

64
00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:28.266
I can do everything as this user because I'm an administrative user.

65
00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:32.837
So let's go down to IAM and we'll select the users and

66
00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:36.718
we'll select Mark and we can see that this user has

67
00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:40.586
certain policies that are applied, he also has certain security credentials,

68
00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:43.165
it's enabled, I can manage the password.

69
00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:47.551
This is the console login link where once I have an IAM

70
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.885
user that's my entry point into Amazon.

71
00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:54.518
At this point MFA is not assigned and I don't have a signing certificate.

72
00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:58.118
So this is the area where you have to make those decisions

73
00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:01.261
as to what's going on with credentials, what should I do,

74
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:11.000
what would be the best step for my company. So that's a bit of a look at the authentication options for AWS.
