1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:05,094
In our first clip we're going to take a look at the concept of identity and

2
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:09,987
access management and in this clip we're going to look at a few goals of what

3
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:12,458
identity and access management means to Amazon.

4
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:19,658
Now you may think of identity and access management as user management,

5
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,347
access controls, authentication, identity management,

6
00:00:22,347 --> 00:00:27,236
these are all terms that kind of mean the same thing,

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,458
it depends on which certification,

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:33,458
what level of compliance in your industry you're trying to adhere to.

9
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:34,517
So number one,

10
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:39,458
the access that's going to be granted is based on least privilege at Amazon.

11
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:44,125
We're not giving you Windows guest or you log on as a user and

12
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,458
you've got a bare minimum of privileges,

13
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:53,958
no you've got to kind of earn all your security with Amazon and once we

14
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,932
grant access we then define what control we have,

15
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,300
i.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:58,669
e.

17
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:02,353
administration wise, against the user, a group or the role,

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,458
the access to the resources.

19
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:08,458
This is typically required my most certification standards,

20
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,164
including HIPPA, NIST, FEDRAMP, ITAR, ISO,

21
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:14,693
there's a lot of different information security compliance standards out

22
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:19,634
there and they all have a common goal of granting access based on least

23
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:22,458
privilege and then controlling the access to resources.

24
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,879
Now how do we find out that Amazon is living up to the

25
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,458
security controls that they talk about?

26
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:30,634
Well the SOC-2 audit will reaffirm that the security

27
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:33,458
controls are in place and functional right now.

28
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:39,458
Remember they're being audited kind of 24/7 365 days of the year.

29
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,958
Now when we talk IAM,

30
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,858
it's going to define some of the resources that I want to access,

31
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:47,073
namely storage and machines, i.

32
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:47,612
e.

33
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:52,458
instances, and we start with a policy for authentication.

34
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,576
And we start with the users,

35
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:58,458
we have to have a user account to authenticate to Amazon.

36
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,791
Or at the very least we need to have some level of federation

37
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:06,458
where Amazon knows who we are and then essentially you could

38
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,791
look at the IAM as an add-on, okay I've authenticated,

39
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,458
I've got an Active Directory environment synchronized from

40
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,791
on-prem to Amazon and once Amazon knows who I am,

41
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:20,608
I'm verified, then I can have a policy for accessing the resources at AWS.

42
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:24,458
Of course I should do that by a group of users.

43
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,166
Even if I have a single user, put that user in a group.

44
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,458
The odds are what that user does, there'll be more users,

45
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,458
it'll be easier to manage at the group level.

46
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,458
Now the users and groups are going to have a password policy,

47
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,340
so this is something that we should consider,

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,987
this probably matches what you're doing on-prem,

49
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:42,601
so implementing a password policy best practice,

50
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:43,029
obviously.

51
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:46,458
We then have authorization levels once I've authenticated,

52
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,879
for the users, for the groups of users, and for the resources.

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,458
So we've got a policy for authentication,

54
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,541
once we get through that hoop then hey what am I allowed to do?

55
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,029
One of the concepts that's going to be coming up in this

56
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:03,315
module is the aspect of roles for resources,

57
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:06,458
how do I manage that resource since it's not a human,

58
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,458
so something we'll be discussing.

59
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,932
So we're going to take a look at the authentication options,

60
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,511
some that IAM participates with,

61
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,501
and other ones are a part of what I can do at AWS.

62
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,415
First of all,

63
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:22,744
the email address and the password of the first person that signs up

64
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:27,029
and creates the AWS account will be the root user,

65
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:30,458
and that's what will be used for authentication,

66
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,090
initial authentication.

67
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,247
That's not what we want to do for our users,

68
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,391
we don't want our users to use these credentials,

69
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:43,458
we want to have an IAM username and manage that user in groups.

70
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:49,458
We also, when I create an account, whether it's a root account or through IAM,

71
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:53,458
there's access keys that are under the hood of my account,

72
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,458
an access key for authentication and a secret access key that allows

73
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:01,227
me to do things like automation with that account,

74
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:04,458
access via a script controlling the APIs.

75
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:09,458
So access keys, we'll expand upon that a little later in this class as well.

76
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,791
We also have key pairs that are primarily used if I'm dealing with

77
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:18,932
an instance and I have to log on to the instance and if I'm logging

78
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:21,511
onto the instance for the first time,

79
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,458
they'll be administrative credentials that are set up.

80
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,458
This is the only time that Amazon is supplying credentials.

81
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,902
So there are key pairs for authentication to the Linux and

82
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:34,902
Windows boxes that are used for the first time.

83
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:38,958
I also can invoke multi-factor authentication and should invoke

84
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:44,458
multi-factor authentication for the root account and any user that I

85
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,214
have created through identity and access management.

86
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:50,992
So when they log on they can get a code on their phone that they

87
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:53,516
have to enter to authenticate to Amazon as well.

88
00:04:53,516 --> 00:05:04,000
So that's a starting point looking at identity and access management and some of the pieces of identity and access management.
