00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
Well hello there, Mark Wilkins checking in.

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:08.833
Welcome to AWS Security Operations: Securing Core AWS Infrastructure Services,

3
00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:13.000
how many times can I say AWS in this class?

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.882
Probably quite a lot.

5
00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:15.824
Welcome aboard.

6
00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:21.316
We're looking at managing access control and this is the second of

7
00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.842
four classes dealing with security operations on AWS.

8
00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:27.429
And we're going to have a lot of fun learning about

9
00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.000
AWS and putting this into practice.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.077
Why have a course focused on AWS security?

11
00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:35.000
See there's that word again.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well, your design has to be secure, secure from the user standpoint,

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.333
data,

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.188
you could look at security from the aspect of security of your

15
00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.375
business because your application could scale properly,

16
00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:48.286
so security can be sliced a number of different ways,

17
00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:53.235
so this class focuses on AWS security and if you're going to take the new Amazon

18
00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.941
certification or any of the other certifications on Amazon,

19
00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:00.000
you'll get some great background to help you with those certs.

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.227
Security is still 25/7 in the cloud,

21
00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:06.682
we usually react to security and we try out best to be proactive and

22
00:01:06.682 --> 00:01:09.227
put systems in place and protections in place,

23
00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:12.091
but then there's a new hack, a new attack,

24
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:14.000
and we have to be reactive.

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So we don't really ever solve this problem, we try to get better at it.

26
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And so, again, the focus of this class, security in the AWS cloud.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.450
Now Kevin Mitnick, who is Kevin Mitnick?

28
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.600
Well he was one of those original bad hackers,

29
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.632
he hacked into IBM and Nokia,

30
00:01:31.632 --> 00:01:35.105
and he is now running a security company and he says,

31
00:01:35.105 --> 00:01:37.625
hey companies spend millions of dollars in firewalls,

32
00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:41.688
secure access devices, kind of wasting money because the weakest link is us,

33
00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:42.000
people.

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The people that use, administrate, operate the computer systems.

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.333
Yea it's true, we always want to get around security,

36
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:52.444
we want potentially a shorter password or cached credentials,

37
00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.778
aren't they great?

38
00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:55.111
Well not really.

39
00:01:55.111 --> 00:02:00.000
So we have to adhere to Kevin's advice with this class.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And this course will help you with all things in AWS infrastructure security.

41
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.063
Does it cover everything in Amazon security?

42
00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:11.000
Well, how long do you want to be here?

43
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.667
This is a product that keeps on giving.

44
00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.333
It is constantly changing, but the core pieces,

45
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:20.000
yeah we can get a great handle on those.

46
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So a working knowledge of AWS services is a bonus, but not essential.

47
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm starting at the ground floor, but if you have some background great.

48
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.529
Now security operations is the course that's broken into four different courses,

49
00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.000
part 1 we've already done, it's up on Pluralsight,

50
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Designing for Acceptable Risk and Compliance.

51
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We're doing part 2 right now, Securing the Core AWS Infrastructure Services,

52
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.235
we're talking VPC, infrastructure and identity management,

53
00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:51.471
securing our instances.

54
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.588
Then we'll take a look in the course after this,

55
00:02:55.588 --> 00:03:00.235
Securing Access to Object Storage, S3, the edge locations.

56
00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:05.000
And finally, we'll look at Securing the Managed Services.

57
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But for now, we're focusing on part 2, Securing Core AWS Infrastructure Services.

58
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.824
So what are our topics for this module?

59
00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:18.000
Well we start off with identity and access management.

60
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.364
And then we go a bit further into IAM users and groups and then we take

61
00:03:22.364 --> 00:03:25.000
a look at roles and controlling access to resources.

62
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Then we'll look at access keys, how do they play a part in Amazon security?

63
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.684
We'll then take a look at creating some IAM policies.

64
00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:37.412
We'll look at the concept of delegation and federation for

65
00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:40.294
corporations that want to use Amazon resources,

66
00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:43.588
but want to use say Active Directory on-prem

67
00:03:43.588 --> 00:03:46.059
integrated into Active Directory in Amazon.

68
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:51.000
We'll then take a look at best practices when planning access control.

69
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So those are our topics. Let's get going.
