00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.091
We're going to take a look at the all important IAM

2
00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:07.066
policies and take a look at the basics.

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.955
This is really kind of a lifelong endeavor with AWS,

4
00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:14.441
getting used to defining policies, applying them to users,

5
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.441
groups and resources, and generally learning with experience,

6
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:21.066
what works, what doesn't work in your environment.

7
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:25.066
So let's start off by looking at some of the rules for a policy.

8
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:29.066
Number one, they are set up to deny by default.

9
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.066
There is no holes allowed.

10
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:36.066
The humans, that is you and I, have to allow the holes that we want.

11
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:42.698
A policy is going to list the permissions to allow or deny and these

12
00:00:42.698 --> 00:00:46.119
are explicit permissions for accessing the resources.

13
00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:51.908
Now the logic for a policy to function is starting off

14
00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:55.066
with explicit deny or explicit allow.

15
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.622
Those are the two mainstays of our policies,

16
00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:03.066
however, we could also have an implicit deny as well.

17
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:08.277
Now what the implicit deny means is that if you don't

18
00:01:08.277 --> 00:01:11.119
explicitly grant access to the resource,

19
00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.844
then it's implicitly denied, it's without question,

20
00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:17.066
you don't have access.

21
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:21.066
So we don't have any shortcuts in the security setup of a policy.

22
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.916
If it's not stated, if it's not defined, it's not possible.

23
00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:29.266
Now if a conflict is created during the evaluation of the policy,

24
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.866
because there could be many statements in the policy,

25
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:36.066
the most restrictive policy is going to win.

26
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.923
An explicit deny is going to trump all allows.

27
00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:43.352
Policies can be attached to either the user,

28
00:01:43.352 --> 00:01:47.254
a group of users, a role, or a resource,

29
00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:52.066
and we'll have some examples of these upcoming in this clip.

30
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:56.466
So to have a graphic view of this, I've got a user,

31
00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:00.666
or a group, or a role, so when the policy is evaluating,

32
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.066
are you a user?

33
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.971
Are you a group member?

34
00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:06.637
Is this policy attached to a role?

35
00:02:06.637 --> 00:02:12.288
Is there an explicit permission or will you be denied because there is not?

36
00:02:12.288 --> 00:02:17.177
Or you will be allowed because there is an explicit permission

37
00:02:17.177 --> 00:02:21.196
or permissions allowing you to do the task.

38
00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:25.892
So for example, user Tom or group of developers,

39
00:02:25.892 --> 00:02:32.948
in this case Dev, or an EC2 instance can be controlled by a defined policy,

40
00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:37.066
once attached to the user, the group or the role.

41
00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:40.013
We also can have the resources involved,

42
00:02:40.013 --> 00:02:42.540
meaning that the policy, for example,

43
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.989
is going to be conditional on the address range that you

44
00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.066
may be connecting to the resource at AWS.

45
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:57.066
And if you're within the defined address range, you might be allowed or denied.

46
00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:01.566
So if the address range matches, you're allowed.

47
00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:06.066
The evaluation logic is an interesting scenario when

48
00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.066
evaluating the policies at AWS.

49
00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:11.066
Best practice: Follow the least-privilege principle.

50
00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:15.066
Give the users, groups, and roles the minimum.

51
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:20.066
So living by the least privilege, I can't really stress it enough.

52
00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:24.066
Grant permissions that are required, start with the absolute minimum.

53
00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:28.793
Alright let's take a look at some of the aspects of the IAM

54
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:33.352
policies and let's create an IAM policy and see how we can

55
00:03:33.352 --> 00:03:35.066
utilize this powerful feature.

56
00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:39.266
In this demo we're going to take a look at blocking requests

57
00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:42.066
that aren't from an approved IP address range,

58
00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:46.066
so when the request for Amazon services comes

59
00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:51.066
outside a specific IP address range, you're not getting in.

60
00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:53.166
Why would I want to do that?

61
00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.466
Well at Wired Brain Coffee I have some pretty good administrators,

62
00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:58.540
but they're getting a little lazy,

63
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.224
they're logging on to do administration from any computer system,

64
00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:06.066
and I want to limit them to the range of their systems.

65
00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:08.923
So that's what we're going to take a look at,

66
00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:12.878
we're going to create a JSON policy and apply it to the admin

67
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:15.066
group to ensure we have this protection.

68
00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:18.066
I'm saving them from themselves.

69
00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.780
So to start off,

70
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.495
the first thing in a policy is a big complicated left

71
00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.066
bracket saying there's more to come.

72
00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.066
Alright I've got my left bracket to start the process, what's next?

73
00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:31.666
Well a version number.

74
00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:36.866
This is the latest version number for policies for AWS and this will

75
00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:41.013
change over time as more features are added to the policy,

76
00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:45.066
but this is the version number that we need right now.

77
00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:50.666
Next we're going to make a statement and the statement is deny.

78
00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.066
No surprise there.

79
00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:54.233
Well deny what?

80
00:04:54.233 --> 00:05:00.733
Deny any action, note the asterisk, to any resource,

81
00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:05.066
again note the asterisk, the condition,

82
00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:09.370
if it's not from this approved IP address range,

83
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.849
172.

84
00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:10.327
0.

85
00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:10.805
2.

86
00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:12.240
0 to 172.

87
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.718
0.

88
00:05:12.718 --> 00:05:13.196
2.

89
00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:17.912
20, forget about it, ending off with three right brackets.

90
00:05:17.912 --> 00:05:18.835
Why three?

91
00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:22.066
Well we'll take a look at that.

92
00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:27.066
And then finally ending off with okay I'm done, not that bad was it?

93
00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:29.184
So let's look at those brackets.

94
00:05:29.184 --> 00:05:33.066
First of all, the opening and closing brackets, they're in red.

95
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.399
I open, I close.

96
00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.733
I've got to put my hands together.

97
00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:38.066
What's in my hands?

98
00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:39.004
My JSON policy.

99
00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:41.504
Now take a look at the left brackets.

100
00:05:41.504 --> 00:05:43.066
Note there's three of them.

101
00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:47.066
TO the right of statement, to the right of condition,

102
00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:49.066
to the right of NotIpAddress.

103
00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:54.199
I've got three left brackets, got to have three right brackets,

104
00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.066
so it's all balanced.

105
00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:59.177
Any of those options are missing, no version,

106
00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:03.066
no proper brackets no proper syntax, you won't be happy,

107
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:08.360
but that's part of creating policies, it's going to happen.

108
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.066
So let's go put this into place.

109
00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:15.248
Okay I've saved some time, I've logged into the console.

110
00:06:15.248 --> 00:06:19.066
Let's head into IAM and see what we have in this account.

111
00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:22.316
Well we have a group and let's go into the group and we

112
00:06:22.316 --> 00:06:25.748
can see we have a number of policies, I want to attach a policy,

113
00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:28.475
but I'm creating one, I don't want one of the managed policies,

114
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:32.248
so I'm going to go over to Policies and say Create

115
00:06:32.248 --> 00:06:36.066
Policy and select Create your Own Policy.

116
00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:38.066
That's what I want.

117
00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:44.066
Policy Name, Description, Policy Document, add it in, and create my policy.

118
00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:47.066
Well before that let's validate it.

119
00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:51.066
The policy is valid, great, let's create it.

120
00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:52.971
So at the policy listing,

121
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:57.542
let's switch all types to Customer Managed and we can see the

122
00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:02.297
Block_IP and the Policy Actions are going to attach to the

123
00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:05.066
admin user or to the wiredadmin.

124
00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:09.184
I think we want to do it to the group, so clicking Attach Policy,

125
00:07:09.184 --> 00:07:10.066
it's been attached.

126
00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:12.835
So we're all good to go.

127
00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:16.066
Now I'm protecting my administrators from themselves.

128
00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:19.066
I'm adding a layer of protection, in all seriousness,

129
00:07:19.066 --> 00:07:28.066
so they do administration from the IP address range that I want them to use.

130
00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:35.000
So that's a look at IAM policy creation and attaching the policy at the group level.
