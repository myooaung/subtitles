00:04.880 --> 00:09.140
The case let's take a look at the solutions to exercise too.

00:09.170 --> 00:11.780
So the first question was from the Products table.

00:11.780 --> 00:17.810
Select the name and price of oil products you have a coffee origin equal to Colombia or Indonesia an

00:17.900 --> 00:20.690
order by name from A to Z.

00:21.350 --> 00:31.700
So the first thing we need to do is select name price from products and then we need a WHERE clause

00:32.000 --> 00:41.720
to say where the coffee origin where coffee or origin is equal to Colombia or Indonesia.

00:41.720 --> 00:45.930
So what we need Collen to be equal to more than one value.

00:45.950 --> 00:52.160
We need to use in open a pair of brackets and then put both of our values here.

00:52.160 --> 01:02.520
So we need to say Colombia and Indonesia and then we also need to order it by name from A to Z.

01:02.570 --> 01:10.730
So when you say order by name we don't need to say ascending or descending because by default it's going

01:10.730 --> 01:19.830
to order it from 8 As'ad and you can see we now have all four coffees with a coffee or region of Colombia

01:19.850 --> 01:21.540
or Indonesia.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.470
So the second question is saying from the Orders table.

01:24.470 --> 01:31.980
Select all the orders from February 2017 for customers with IDs of 2 4 6 or 8.

01:32.420 --> 01:46.780
So we need to select staw from orders and we need to say where order time is in February.

01:46.780 --> 01:49.000
So when you say all the time between

01:51.000 --> 01:53.710
2017 0 2 0 1

01:56.250 --> 02:09.900
and 2017 to 28 so that's for February 2017 and then on the next line we need to say where the IDs of

02:09.900 --> 02:10.820
the customers is.

02:10.820 --> 02:12.750
EVA 2 4 6 or 8.

02:12.930 --> 02:13.890
So we need to say.

02:13.950 --> 02:27.320
And Customer ID because it's because of my DNA ID and the orders table is in 2 4 6 or 8.

02:27.450 --> 02:30.900
So we don't need single quotes because it's numbers.

02:31.580 --> 02:40.900
And then we can run this and you can see we have all the orders for February where the customer IDs

02:40.930 --> 02:42.600
2 4 6 or 8.

02:43.060 --> 02:50.200
So no other customers are present and it's only four orders in February.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.340
And then finally the last question is asking from the customers table.

02:54.410 --> 03:00.800
Select the first name and phone number over customers whose last name contains the parts and all.

03:01.240 --> 03:17.440
So we need to select first name and phone number for all the customers table where our last name contains

03:17.440 --> 03:18.150
the pattern.

03:18.250 --> 03:27.110
So we need to say well last name is like because we're looking for a string pattern and then we need

03:27.110 --> 03:35.420
to open all single quotes and use to send you signs because we're not looking for single characters

03:35.420 --> 03:36.560
either side of the aisle.

03:36.760 --> 03:45.560
We're just looking for any in the last name and then we can type all within sensu signs and then we

03:45.560 --> 03:53.880
can run this and you see we have Chris and Katie and their phone numbers.

03:53.910 --> 04:00.800
So let's take a look at their last name and we should see that they both contain They are some way in

04:00.810 --> 04:08.670
the last name so we see their last names are Martin and Armstrong so we have a R after the M M We have

04:09.210 --> 04:11.020
a R at the beginning here.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.240
So that's it for the solutions to exercise 2.

04:14.430 --> 04:20.340
If you still have any questions on this exercise then please ask in the Q and A section.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.230
But for now let's move on to the next video.
