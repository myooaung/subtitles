A case that's pretty much it for this demo section.

00:09.480 --> 00:15.990
You may have noticed we've only been looking at our products table so I'm back in my coffee store database

00:16.620 --> 00:22.020
and I select to stuff from products so we have some data but we don't actually have any data in our

00:22.020 --> 00:25.180
customer or Orders table.

00:25.560 --> 00:32.700
So instead of you watching me enter data into these two tables if you go to the resources section of

00:32.700 --> 00:38.850
this video you'll find two files one name customer table and one names Orders table.

00:39.120 --> 00:45.430
So I want you to open them and I want you to copy and paste the data in there.

00:45.450 --> 00:53.040
So first open the customer's table file and you'll find an insert into customers query.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.730
And this is going to enter in about 24 customers into our customer table.

00:59.100 --> 01:04.480
So it would have been a bit boring for you to enter into this data yourself.

01:04.530 --> 01:13.280
So you can just copy and paste it into workbench and then you can run that query

01:18.550 --> 01:25.740
and once you've run this query insert into customers you can select start from customers and you'll

01:25.750 --> 01:31.820
see that we now have 24 customers in our customer table.

01:32.470 --> 01:38.790
You'll notice that some have based no data and we'll be looking at that in the next section.

01:39.070 --> 01:41.630
So don't worry about that for now.

01:42.310 --> 01:49.630
So once you've run the query for the customers table you can open the orders table file and you can

01:49.630 --> 01:50.470
copy this

01:54.850 --> 02:02.020
into workbenches will copy and paste and just run that statement.

02:06.870 --> 02:10.850
Once you've done that you can select stuff from orders.

02:10.890 --> 02:19.060
We now have a lot of orders in order table I think is about 80 or 90 orders.

02:19.140 --> 02:26.490
So once you've run those to insert into queries you now have data in all three tables and we're ready

02:26.490 --> 02:33.300
to move on to the next section where we'll be querying our three tables and retrieving data from all

02:33.300 --> 02:34.540
three tables.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.890
So that's it for now.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.090
See you in the next section.
