00:05.640 --> 00:11.380
A case said let's take a look at the rules for first novel form and an example of how we can get our

00:11.380 --> 00:15.980
tables to adhere to the rules in first normal form.

00:16.030 --> 00:18.330
So what is first normal form.

00:18.370 --> 00:20.940
So the tables are in first normal form.

00:21.100 --> 00:28.840
If there's no repeated rows of data in that table if the columns only contain a single value and if

00:28.840 --> 00:31.280
the table has a primary key.

00:31.810 --> 00:37.630
So if we have two rows of data in our table then it's not in first normal form.

00:37.900 --> 00:44.590
If any of the columns contain more than one valley then is not in a single form and if the table doesn't

00:44.590 --> 00:47.760
have a primary key then is also not in first form.

00:48.010 --> 00:48.680
I'm a member.

00:48.700 --> 00:54.630
Primary Key is a column or a set of columns which uniquely identifies that row.

00:54.850 --> 00:56.280
So it doesn't have to be one column.

00:56.290 --> 01:00.580
It could be a combination of more than one column.

01:00.670 --> 01:03.460
So let's have a look at an example table.

01:03.460 --> 01:10.660
So here we have a student table and it has the student name the year they're in and any classes they

01:10.660 --> 01:11.620
take.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.380
So is this table in first normal form.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.290
Well we can see straightaway that is not.

01:17.860 --> 01:23.680
So we can see we have poodle's in year 11 class math entered twice into this table.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.630
So we have G.P.A. rows of data.

01:27.160 --> 01:33.640
And also we can see we have more than one value assigned to the class column for Brian Cox and Linda

01:33.640 --> 01:34.600
marsh.

01:34.600 --> 01:40.960
So we have English and chemistry comma separated for Brian and we have math history and biology for

01:40.960 --> 01:41.660
Linda.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.720
So this table really does not follow first normal form.

01:45.790 --> 01:52.050
So the question is what can we do to make sure that this table follows First no form well straightaway

01:52.180 --> 01:54.030
we can remove the duplicate.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.140
Dawson entry into our table.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.720
And secondly we can split the class entries for Brian Cox and DeMoss in more than one row.

02:03.070 --> 02:09.970
So you can see instead of having English in chemistry for Brian Cox in one column we have a row for

02:09.970 --> 02:13.720
Brian Cox English and a row for Brian Cox chemistry.

02:13.720 --> 02:22.090
And then we have free rows for Linda Marsh and three classes and we also have a primary key which is

02:22.120 --> 02:25.300
the student column plus the Clauss column.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.670
So this is all a unique identifier for this table.

02:27.670 --> 02:30.460
Student column plus Clauss column.

02:30.820 --> 02:33.910
And now you can see that this table does follow first normal form.

02:33.910 --> 02:35.350
So we have a primary key.

02:35.530 --> 02:41.780
We have no repeated rows of data and we have no column with more than one value.

02:42.310 --> 02:48.220
Now you could argue that this actually increases the data redundancy and you would be correct because

02:48.220 --> 02:49.050
we have.

02:49.210 --> 02:56.860
BRIAN COX Yeah a to twice and we have Linda Marsh years seven to three times into this table whereas

02:56.890 --> 03:02.750
before we just had it entered once for Brian Cox and once for Linda marsh.

03:03.130 --> 03:06.380
But this is only the first level of normalization.

03:06.610 --> 03:08.980
And our data is better organized.

03:08.980 --> 03:13.370
We have no columns with multiple values in our table.

03:13.870 --> 03:18.540
So that's it for normalizing our tables so that they follow the first normal form.

03:18.580 --> 03:25.140
Now the first normal form is fairly simple compared to second normal form and third normal form.

03:25.180 --> 03:29.080
So next let's move on to the second level of normalization.
