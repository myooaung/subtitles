I may say now that we have all seven tables in our database we actually need to insert some data into

00:11.700 --> 00:12.860
these tables.

00:13.260 --> 00:22.410
So in the resources section for this lecture are seven scripts one script for each table and they contain

00:22.410 --> 00:29.910
an insert into statement which we are going to run and data into each of our tables.

00:29.910 --> 00:35.770
So the first file that I want to open is called films data and it should look like this.

00:35.850 --> 00:46.050
And we need to copy and paste this into my school work bench and is going to enter all our films into

00:46.050 --> 00:46.920
our films table.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.990
So it's going to be 12 films.

00:48.990 --> 00:55.300
So we need to run this insert into statement and then we can select stuff from films to make sure that

00:55.350 --> 00:56.270
worked.

00:56.380 --> 01:00.380
And you can see we now have 12 films in our films table.

01:00.600 --> 01:06.240
So copy and paste the script into my school work bench and do that and run that statement.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.890
And then once you've done that for films we need to do the same for customers.

01:09.900 --> 01:18.330
So open custom and data flow and copy and paste this into my school workbench So we have a lot of customers

01:18.420 --> 01:22.220
in our customers table.

01:23.070 --> 01:34.980
So copy paste run the stateman and then select stuff from customers just to make sure that that's works

01:34.980 --> 01:43.200
as well and you can see we have our customers in our customer table now and then we need to do the same

01:43.200 --> 01:45.050
for rooms.

01:45.150 --> 01:54.470
So we put in rooms data copy and paste into my school work bench and right.

01:54.510 --> 02:02.250
So we just have free rooms in our cinema and then named after famous directors.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.050
So now we need to select stuff from Marines and you can see we have free rooms on the number of seats

02:07.050 --> 02:08.280
in each room.

02:08.670 --> 02:12.960
So we need to open the screenings data file.

02:13.320 --> 02:17.350
We need to copy and paste this into my school work bench as well.

02:17.730 --> 02:25.020
So we have a lot of screenings this data took a long time to write out but it will be worth it in the

02:25.020 --> 02:25.760
end.

02:26.130 --> 02:37.570
So copy that paste it into my school work bench and run the query to insert into the screenings table.

02:37.580 --> 02:44.790
And again we just want to make sure that that works by selecting stuff from screenings and you can see

02:44.790 --> 02:47.870
we have all screenings in screenings table.

02:48.260 --> 02:48.570
OK.

02:48.580 --> 02:57.180
Now we need to do the same for seats so open seats on the school data and we can copy and paste this

02:58.350 --> 03:02.040
into my school work bench

03:04.820 --> 03:06.750
and run the query.

03:11.340 --> 03:18.830
Select stuff from C S And We have our data analysis table that we need to do the same for bookings data

03:21.620 --> 03:28.640
sets contains all our bookings Cinematheque online bookings.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.590
So copy that

03:35.700 --> 03:40.280
paste it into my home my school work bench run the query.

03:40.600 --> 03:46.560
Now we have our bookings data to check out by selecting staw from the bookings table

03:49.820 --> 03:51.320
of the data.

03:51.740 --> 03:56.360
And then finally we need to open the reserve seat data file.

03:56.660 --> 04:05.110
We need to copy and paste this into my school work bench and you can see we have a lot of reserved seats

04:08.470 --> 04:08.980
and

04:11.780 --> 04:14.990
copy paste run that query

04:18.540 --> 04:20.340
and then just to make sure that it works.

04:20.340 --> 04:24.160
We want to select stuff from reserve seat

04:26.900 --> 04:30.930
and then we have all the data and a quick explanation of the data.

04:30.980 --> 04:41.610
Basically the data is showing all the bookings and films and customers that was shown in October 2017.

04:41.650 --> 04:48.550
So if we select stock from films you can see we have Blade Runner 2049 dunker.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.450
So these are films that were shown in October.

04:51.620 --> 05:01.190
And if we select stuff from screenings you can see the screening date is 2017 October 1st and then the

05:01.190 --> 05:03.590
final screening is on the thirty first of October.

05:03.590 --> 05:11.440
So all our screenings in October and then basically we have all our bookings for screenings in October.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.360
So now we have the data entered into our database.

05:14.390 --> 05:19.430
We can move on to the next section and start selecting from this database.
