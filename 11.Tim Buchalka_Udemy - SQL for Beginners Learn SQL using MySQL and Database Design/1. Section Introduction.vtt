Woken to this challenge section of the course in this section we will go through a number of challenges

00:11.370 --> 00:17.070
which will test your knowledge of Q Well based on everything we've learned so far throughout the course

00:17.590 --> 00:21.350
so this includes joins such queries and functions.

00:21.660 --> 00:28.080
So these challenges are slightly different to the exercises in the previous sections as they are more

00:28.140 --> 00:36.090
open questions in the exercises I was asking you to select certain columns from certain tables whereas

00:36.090 --> 00:40.810
these challenges will be more realistic to what you will face in the real world.

00:41.650 --> 00:46.810
So the first challenge is a fairly simple challenge just to give you an idea of the sort of questions

00:46.810 --> 00:48.780
you will face in this challenge section.

00:48.940 --> 00:52.260
But then they get more and more challenging as we go through.

00:52.690 --> 00:55.220
So let's get started in the next video.
