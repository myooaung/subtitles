00:05.380 --> 00:08.770
So so far we've just looked at joining two tables together.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.940
But in theory we can actually join as many tables as you want.

00:12.950 --> 00:16.220
Together in one select statement.

00:16.220 --> 00:21.560
So in this video we're going to be looking at joining the products customer and orders table together

00:21.590 --> 00:23.050
in one select statement.

00:23.420 --> 00:24.820
So let's do that now.

00:25.020 --> 00:31.460
So here I've selected stuff from orders and you can see we have to idÃ©e and we have a product ID and

00:31.460 --> 00:34.900
a customer id failed and then we have the all the time.

00:35.180 --> 00:43.110
So these products ID uncustomary de fields or foreign keys to the products and the Customers table respectively.

00:43.130 --> 00:49.160
So we can actually join in the Orders table to the Products table and the Customers table in the same

00:49.160 --> 00:53.130
select statement and retrieve data from free tables.

00:53.270 --> 00:58.760
So let's try and write a select statement which will retrieve the name and the price from the Products

00:58.760 --> 00:59.500
table.

00:59.750 --> 01:05.920
The first and last name from the Customers table I need all the time from the Orders table Celeste's

01:05.930 --> 01:21.290
type selects P door name to begin is called products pay Pido name P-doc price see Dalt first name.

01:21.500 --> 01:33.510
See your last name and then I talk all the time from a nest made product saw first table.

01:33.530 --> 01:37.040
So products we want to join.

01:37.040 --> 01:41.370
So we're just going to be doing in a joins on the orders table.

01:41.570 --> 01:46.640
Now we can join the products in the customers table together directly because they don't have any related

01:46.640 --> 01:47.460
columns.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.240
So we have to join through the orders table.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.320
So we have to join in on orders.

01:56.010 --> 01:59.770
I say we need to type products pay

02:03.310 --> 02:17.450
join on orders on P dot ID is equal to door Product ID.

02:17.450 --> 02:20.670
So that's join two tables together the products and the orders.

02:20.690 --> 02:24.100
And now we need to join in the Customers table.

02:24.650 --> 02:27.560
And then on the next line we can type join.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.410
Customers see on.

02:32.430 --> 02:38.030
And now we need to find the common columns between the customers table and the orders table.

02:38.420 --> 02:48.280
So it is all and C or ID is equal to both customer ID.

02:48.770 --> 02:52.390
So we're not joining the customers in the products table directly.

02:52.460 --> 02:57.820
Joining the customers and the orders table and the products and the orders table.

02:58.280 --> 03:07.860
So we can run this statement now and you can see we have the name from the products table and the price

03:07.860 --> 03:08.890
on the table.

03:08.900 --> 03:13.490
Then we have the first and last name from the customers table and we have the all the time from the

03:13.490 --> 03:14.450
Orders table.

03:14.690 --> 03:21.340
So we retrieve data from three separate tables in one select statement by joining the free tables together.

03:21.620 --> 03:28.070
And of course we could if we had more tables in our database we could keep joining more and more tables

03:28.070 --> 03:28.490
together.

03:28.500 --> 03:36.080
So a full table by just typing join on the next line the fifth table and so on and so forth.

03:36.380 --> 03:41.510
And of course we can add where clause is to this just like we can for other join statements.

03:41.810 --> 03:45.590
So let's say where last name is equal to.

03:45.590 --> 03:50.150
MARTIN So your last name is from the customer table.

03:50.150 --> 03:51.570
So we type type.

03:51.580 --> 03:57.050
See your last name is the call to Martin

04:00.300 --> 04:08.130
and we can also order this by to order a time

04:11.810 --> 04:14.020
and run statement.

04:14.810 --> 04:19.610
And now we have all the orders from Chris Martin ordered by order time.

04:19.940 --> 04:25.540
So you can see like espresso say but sometimes he goes for a full two or even a couple night.

04:26.060 --> 04:30.110
So this is how we join more than two tables together in one select statement.
