00:05.130 --> 00:11.330
I k so in this video we're going to be creating our test database to use later on in the section.

00:11.330 --> 00:18.320
I've also included the escrow code that we're going to write in this video as a resource to this video.

00:18.620 --> 00:24.890
So if you want you can just copy and paste the code into my square workbench and then just create that

00:24.890 --> 00:26.200
database that way.

00:26.600 --> 00:34.030
But for now if you want to follow along we're going to be creating three tables in our test database.

00:34.130 --> 00:38.890
We're going to create an address table a people's table and our pets table.

00:39.290 --> 00:43.100
So the first thing we need to do is actually create the database.

00:43.100 --> 00:47.140
So let's create a database test

00:49.740 --> 00:51.320
and then run this code.

00:54.470 --> 01:05.010
And then we need to use that database so use test so run that and now we're in a test database we can

01:05.010 --> 01:08.340
create a first table.

01:08.420 --> 01:13.380
So the first table that we want to create in our database is addresses table.

01:13.790 --> 01:17.610
So that's like create table addresses.

01:18.110 --> 01:24.630
Open our brackets and with a semi-colon like normal and then we can type in our columns.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.960
So the first column is going to be an ID column and this is going to become our primary key for this

01:29.960 --> 01:30.680
table.

01:30.830 --> 01:34.490
But for now we're just going to have it as an data type.

01:34.520 --> 01:43.080
So it's going to contain 1 2 3 4 etc and then the next column is going to be a house number column.

01:43.490 --> 01:45.050
So that's like PAOs number.

01:45.140 --> 01:52.910
And that's also going to be an INS and then the next column is going to be a city column so the city

01:52.910 --> 01:59.500
that the address is in and that's going to be a vulture and it's going to have a maximum length of 20.

02:00.290 --> 02:06.290
And then the final column in our addresses table is going to be a postcode so a postcode is the British

02:06.290 --> 02:07.980
equivalent of a zip code.

02:07.990 --> 02:12.060
It's made up of numbers and letters and it has a maximum length of seven.

02:12.170 --> 02:20.370
So this type of Shaw and have it set to maximum length for seven case so that's it for the addresses

02:20.370 --> 02:20.830
table.

02:20.830 --> 02:25.230
So now we can just run this query to actually create the table.

02:25.710 --> 02:26.590
So that's done.

02:26.760 --> 02:30.820
So now we can move on to the next table which is going to be a people table.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.910
So let's say creates table.

02:34.390 --> 02:41.730
People open up brackets and move a semi-colon and then we can type all columns on the first column is

02:41.730 --> 02:43.790
going to be an ID column again.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.530
It's going to be our primary key.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.830
But for now let's type just for the data type.

02:50.310 --> 02:53.830
And then the next column is going to be the first name.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.070
So first name of the people entered into this table.

02:57.350 --> 03:01.330
Obviously are going to be a vulture unless the maximum to 20.

03:01.890 --> 03:07.280
And then the next column is going to be the last name of the people in this table.

03:07.530 --> 03:12.590
That's also going to be a vulture with a maximum of 20.

03:12.830 --> 03:19.070
And then the final column in this People table is going to be an address id type address underscore

03:19.300 --> 03:20.240
ID.

03:20.390 --> 03:26.420
And this is going to be a foreign key to the ID column you know addresses table which will add later

03:26.420 --> 03:27.570
on in this section.

03:27.770 --> 03:33.530
But for now the data type is going to be in it and that's it for the People table.

03:33.530 --> 03:40.580
So let's run a query to make sure we've created the People table and then we can move onto the last

03:40.580 --> 03:42.910
table which is Petz table.

03:43.130 --> 03:44.120
So.

03:44.290 --> 03:56.550
Pets of the people in the People table selects type creates table packs open or brackets and with a

03:56.570 --> 04:02.220
semi-colon and then we can type all columns into our table.

04:02.270 --> 04:06.190
So the first one again is going to be an ID column is going to be our primary key.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.010
But for now let's just type it as the data type.

04:10.180 --> 04:14.700
Then the next column is going to be a name column and that's going to be the name of the path.

04:14.700 --> 04:18.840
So it's going to be a vault with a maximum length of 20.

04:18.850 --> 04:25.120
And then the next column is going to be species so a species of the pet is a cat dog it's a drug that's

04:25.140 --> 04:26.500
also going to be a vulture.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.790
And that's the maximum length to 20.

04:30.220 --> 04:34.440
And then the final column is going to be an owner ID.

04:34.480 --> 04:43.810
So this is going to be a foreign key to the ID field in the people's table to specify which person owns

04:43.810 --> 04:44.870
this path.

04:44.880 --> 04:50.110
So that's also going to be an INS and then finishes that for the pet stable.

04:50.410 --> 04:53.090
So let's just run queery.

04:53.680 --> 04:58.290
And now we've created our test database with our free tables in it.

04:58.300 --> 05:05.120
So let's just make sure that it did in fact create those free tables by running show tables

05:09.020 --> 05:15.590
and you can see down here you managed to scroll up that we have our free tables so we have our addresses

05:15.590 --> 05:18.950
table of people table and our pets table.

05:19.280 --> 05:25.220
So now that we've got our database complete Let's look at how we can modify these free tables in the

05:25.220 --> 05:26.940
remainder of this section.
