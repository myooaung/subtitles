A case analysis of a look having closes.

00:08.290 --> 00:14.740
So like I said before having clauses acts like a where clause in a select statement book for grouped

00:14.800 --> 00:16.760
by statements.

00:16.780 --> 00:24.130
So arrived selected custom ID screening Id count ID from bookings and grouped by custom ID and screening

00:24.130 --> 00:24.950
ID.

00:25.120 --> 00:32.120
So if I run I see I have a custom ID screening ID and the count of the ID field.

00:32.740 --> 00:37.400
But what if I only wanted to select data where custom ID was equal to 10.

00:37.690 --> 00:46.180
Well normally I could come in here and I could add a WHERE clause saying where custom ID is equal to

00:46.180 --> 00:56.450
10 but on getting an error and saying there's an error with my escarole syntax and that's because if

00:56.450 --> 01:02.480
we're grouping by data then instead of using a WHERE clause we have to use a having clause.

01:02.540 --> 01:08.870
So I have to come in here I have to remove where I have to type having instead so grouped by custom

01:08.870 --> 01:15.590
ID screening ID having custom ID equal to 10 if I run.

01:15.620 --> 01:24.710
You can see I now get some results and you can see customer ID 10 made a booking for screening ID six

01:25.130 --> 01:30.530
thirty seven hundred twenty eight hundred thirty four hundred eighty seven then 205.

01:30.530 --> 01:37.220
So remember when you are using group by clauses you dont use where clauses afterwards you use having

01:37.950 --> 01:42.080
so having cause is pretty simple already and that's it for this video.
