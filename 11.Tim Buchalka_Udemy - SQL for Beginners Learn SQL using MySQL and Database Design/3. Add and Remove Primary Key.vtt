00:05.230 --> 00:12.040
OK so in this video we're going to be looking at how we can add remove primary keys from our table using

00:12.040 --> 00:14.830
the table command.

00:14.830 --> 00:16.430
You can see I've already typed.

00:16.640 --> 00:23.920
Ask your old code which we need to use to add and remove Prime McKay's So to add a primary key we need

00:23.920 --> 00:27.360
to type out a table followed by the table name.

00:27.490 --> 00:34.540
And then we type add primary key followed by the column name which we want as our primary key in brackets

00:34.900 --> 00:40.350
and then end with a semi-colon and then to remove a primary key from a table.

00:40.390 --> 00:47.760
We need to type out a table followed by the table name and then type drop primary key.

00:47.780 --> 00:51.580
So let's go for an example of adding a primary key to a table.

00:51.650 --> 00:56.610
So let's add a primary key to the addresses table in a test database.

00:57.170 --> 01:02.870
So the first thing I want to do is I want to type describe addresses.

01:03.260 --> 01:07.520
And that's because I want to show you something about the addresses table before we are our primary

01:07.520 --> 01:08.390
key.

01:08.930 --> 01:15.020
So let's run that command and you can see here that we have information on our addresses table.

01:15.170 --> 01:16.430
So we have all columns here.

01:16.430 --> 01:22.940
We have that data type we have whether they can contain no values and we can see they can all contain

01:22.940 --> 01:28.080
no values and then we have this column called key and that's the one I want to look at.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.780
So you can see here that all of them are blank.

01:32.390 --> 01:39.080
All the columns are blank and this key and this is the column which is going to change is going to show

01:39.620 --> 01:43.300
which columns are primary keys which columns of foreign keys.

01:43.490 --> 01:48.340
So this is going to change once we've had our primary key to our addresses table.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.460
So let's do that now.

01:49.490 --> 01:52.810
Let's make this ID field primary key.

01:53.120 --> 01:59.980
So to do that we need to come in here and we need to type out a table followed by the table name so

02:00.160 --> 02:08.600
addresses in this case and then we need to add primary key open a pair of brackets and with the semi-colon

02:08.690 --> 02:11.570
and within the brackets we just need to type column name.

02:11.570 --> 02:22.570
So in this case it's just ID and we can run that statement and then we can run describe addresses again

02:22.570 --> 02:28.360
so we get that information about the addresses table back and you can see now that two things have changed

02:28.420 --> 02:31.030
for this ID field.

02:31.030 --> 02:38.290
You can see that now it states in the key column that it is a primary key the ID field and you can also

02:38.290 --> 02:42.140
see that it now no longer accepts no values.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.690
And that's because in a primary key column you can enter no values.

02:46.690 --> 02:50.210
So this now has switched from yes to no.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.260
So that's how we add primary keys to tables.

02:55.290 --> 02:58.630
Now let's have a look at removing a primary key.

02:58.650 --> 03:04.640
So let's just remove this primary key for this ID field and the addresses table.

03:05.060 --> 03:12.040
So to do that what we need to do is we need to type out the table again followed by the table name so

03:12.030 --> 03:18.480
as addresses again and then we just need to type drop primary key.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.220
We don't need to state the column just draw a primary key.

03:22.440 --> 03:26.770
We can run this and then let's check by running.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.790
Describe addresses again.

03:30.250 --> 03:37.960
And you can see that now under this key column we no longer have the primary key for the ID field.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.760
But there's no value has not changed.

03:40.780 --> 03:44.620
So we haven't changed and there's no constraint.

03:44.830 --> 03:48.260
The ID field can no longer accept no values.

03:48.430 --> 03:53.920
So just be aware when you drop a primary key column in a table it's not going to change the fact of

03:53.920 --> 03:56.060
whether it can accept no values.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.550
It's still going to be set to No.

03:59.590 --> 04:01.610
And now let's have a look at the people table.

04:01.610 --> 04:07.840
So let's type describe people and run that query

04:10.500 --> 04:16.570
and you can see we have the same set up that we had with the addresses table of all columns can accept

04:16.590 --> 04:20.340
no values and none of them are set primary keys.

04:20.340 --> 04:27.570
So as a mini challenge now I want you to post the video and add your own primary key to the ID field

04:27.600 --> 04:28.860
in the People table.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.090
So post the video and I'll be back with the solution in a second.

04:37.000 --> 04:45.930
OK I'm back and I'm sure you were able to do this or we need to right was on the table.

04:46.450 --> 04:53.590
And then the table name people and then type at primary key and it's the ID field again so we just had

04:53.590 --> 04:57.700
to pretty much just change the table name.

04:57.960 --> 05:06.970
And if we describe people again we can see that now we have this primary case for the ID field.

05:07.270 --> 05:09.510
And it can no longer x no values.

05:09.520 --> 05:17.260
So if I up primary key to the ID field and the people say well OK so that's it for adding and removing

05:17.260 --> 05:20.000
primary keys from a table.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.960
So let's move on to the next video.
