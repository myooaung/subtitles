A case in this video we're going to look at the primary and foreign key concepts within databases.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.420
So let's have a look at a primary case.

00:13.420 --> 00:19.420
Primary Key is a column or a set of columns which uniquely identifies a record within the table.

00:19.810 --> 00:26.520
So each new entry of data within a table is going to have to have a unique identifier for that right.

00:26.830 --> 00:32.710
And this is what we call a primary key primary key must be unique.

00:32.710 --> 00:33.760
It cannot be No.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.640
So it must have a value and a table can only have one primary key.

00:39.640 --> 00:45.940
So as I say it can be made from multiple columns but there can only be one primary key per table.

00:46.390 --> 00:51.980
When we create our tables we're going to learn how we can define our primary case.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.960
So as an example let's have a look at the smoke table.

00:54.970 --> 00:57.290
So it's mock customer table.

00:57.570 --> 01:04.630
It's got an ID column first name last name gender and telephone column and we can see here that the

01:04.630 --> 01:12.130
ID column is the primary key and we can see that because it's unique for each row in the table you can

01:12.130 --> 01:16.550
see it goes 1 2 3 4 5 etc. for each new right.

01:16.960 --> 01:22.720
And you can see we couldn't use first or last name as a primary key as we have repeating values in both

01:22.900 --> 01:23.900
columns.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.160
So we have three Johns.

01:26.170 --> 01:30.240
We have a last name of Simmons that turns up twice.

01:30.460 --> 01:35.670
And similarly we can use gender as a primary key or even telephone number.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.510
So now let's take a look at a foreign case.

01:38.530 --> 01:45.730
So foreign key is used to link two tables together and the foreign key is a column whose values match

01:45.940 --> 01:53.830
the values of another table's primary key column and the table with the primary key is called the reference

01:53.860 --> 01:58.870
or parent table and the table with the foreign key is called the child table.

01:59.320 --> 02:04.900
And unlike primary keys a table can have multiple foreign keys within it.

02:05.650 --> 02:08.410
So let's take a look at a foreign key example.

02:08.740 --> 02:15.070
Here we have an Orders table and we can see we have a customer id call them and our product ID Card

02:15.070 --> 02:23.160
them and they are foreign keys in the Orders table which reference other columns in other tables.

02:23.350 --> 02:30.340
So the customer id call them is referencing the ID column in the Customer table and the Product ID called

02:30.340 --> 02:33.990
them is referencing the ID column in the products table.

02:34.180 --> 02:39.850
So these are two foreign keys and one orders table.

02:39.850 --> 02:46.420
So this is what we mean when we talk about primary and foreign keys and we're going to be creating priming

02:46.420 --> 02:50.200
foreign keys when we create our coffee store database.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.260
So let's move on to that now.
