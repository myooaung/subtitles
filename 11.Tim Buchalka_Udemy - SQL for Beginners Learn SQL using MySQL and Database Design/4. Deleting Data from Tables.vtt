A case or in this video we're going to look at how we can delete data from a table.

00:10.250 --> 00:17.420
So I'm actually in my example database and I've created this people table with an ID name age and gender

00:17.450 --> 00:18.590
columns.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.560
I've then inserted six stories of data into that table.

00:23.270 --> 00:28.790
So if you want to do that you can pause the video and create the table and insert the data so you can

00:28.790 --> 00:29.190
do that.

00:29.310 --> 00:35.580
Now if you just want to follow along then don't bother.

00:35.620 --> 00:45.200
So to delete data from a table we need to type delete from and then the table name.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.150
So in this case is people.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.350
And then just like the update statement we need to work close.

00:51.410 --> 00:58.070
So we need to say where we're deleting the data so we need to type where a column name is equal to a

00:58.070 --> 00:59.660
certain body.

00:59.660 --> 01:07.970
So let's say we want to delete John from the database we can say where the Name column is equal to John

01:11.330 --> 01:23.510
and run now and then select stuff from people again and you can see now that I.D. to which had named

01:23.510 --> 01:26.240
John has now left the table.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.670
So it's been deleted from the table.

01:28.910 --> 01:35.400
So that's how easily one or I have data from table but we can actually really multiple rows at once.

01:35.540 --> 01:43.970
So let's say we wanted to delete from people where the agenda was F all the females on the table.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.460
Now we can change this.

01:45.470 --> 01:49.240
We're close to where.

01:49.250 --> 01:53.230
GEND is the call to f

01:56.620 --> 02:01.560
and this is going to Italy by ID 1 and Id 5 from the table.

02:01.870 --> 02:03.710
So let's run that now.

02:05.120 --> 02:11.270
And select stuff from people again and you can see by females have been deleted from the table we're

02:11.270 --> 02:14.300
just left with Thomas Chris and Frank.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.560
Now we can also get to the.

02:15.580 --> 02:18.530
All rise of data from a table at once.

02:18.890 --> 02:23.580
And we do that simply by not having a WHERE clause.

02:24.350 --> 02:31.250
So simply saying delete from a table name so delete from people and this is going to delete every single

02:31.250 --> 02:32.980
row in the table.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.670
So let's run now.

02:35.180 --> 02:38.030
And that's Sadak stuff from people.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.110
And you can see it's empty now.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.290
We no longer have any data in our people table.

02:43.490 --> 02:44.810
So that's it for this video.

02:44.810 --> 02:46.990
That's how you delete data from a table.
