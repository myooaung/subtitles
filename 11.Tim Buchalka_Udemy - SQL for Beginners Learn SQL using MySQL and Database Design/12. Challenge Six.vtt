So for challenge six I want to find out how many of the customers made a booking in October 2017.

00:12.570 --> 00:18.000
So we have a list of customers in our database and it's possible that not all of them watched the film

00:18.000 --> 00:21.280
or made a booking in October 2017.

00:21.390 --> 00:28.320
So I want you to write and ask you a query which will return the data telling me how many of the customers

00:28.410 --> 00:31.620
made a booking in October 2017.

00:32.070 --> 00:36.900
So once you've done that I'll see you in the next video and we'll go through a solution.
