A case in this video we're going to be looking at column name alias's So a column name alias is when

00:12.450 --> 00:16.940
you rename a column in your results.

00:17.630 --> 00:20.160
So let's take a look at how we can do that.

00:20.310 --> 00:26.310
So you can see here I've selected name price and coffee origin from products and it's return the values

00:26.310 --> 00:27.280
here.

00:27.420 --> 00:32.170
But as I say I wanted to rename this column and our result set to coffee.

00:32.190 --> 00:39.570
So it said coffee instead of name unless I just wanted to name the coffee origin column as country.

00:39.570 --> 00:50.330
To do that I need to go into my select statement and I selected name and I need to type as coffee.

00:50.600 --> 00:57.820
So I'm selecting name as coffee and is going to rename this column to coffee in the resos.

00:58.190 --> 01:08.500
And I also wanted to change coffee origin to country so I can simply type as a country from products.

01:08.630 --> 01:10.710
So let's run this statement now.

01:11.450 --> 01:17.510
And you can see in the results here that is rename the columns to coffee and country instead of name

01:17.510 --> 01:19.180
and coffee origin.

01:19.460 --> 01:25.610
But it's not actually changing the name of the column in the database just in the results.

01:25.880 --> 01:33.800
So if we were to then select stuff from Puddock again we can see that the column names have come back

01:33.800 --> 01:36.740
to name and coffee origin respectively.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.480
So in the database nothing has changed.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.790
It's just in the results.

01:42.380 --> 01:46.210
The columns have been renamed to coffee and country.

01:46.350 --> 01:52.700
So this is how we call them names aliases we use the column name followed by as.

01:52.850 --> 01:57.690
And then the word that you want to rename the column to.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.800
So that's it full column name Elissa's.
