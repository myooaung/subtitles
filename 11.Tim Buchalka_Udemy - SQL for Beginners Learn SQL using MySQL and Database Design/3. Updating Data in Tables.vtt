00:05.750 --> 00:11.820
So in this video we're going to learn how we can update data that's already been inserted into our tables.

00:11.950 --> 00:17.030
So I've selected stuff from our products table and we have all seven entries down here.

00:17.330 --> 00:22.810
But I want to update the coffee origin of our food coffee from India to Sri Lanka.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.860
So to do that I need to use an update statement.

00:26.330 --> 00:29.000
And here I've written out the syntax.

00:29.150 --> 00:34.390
So we need to type update table name and then we need to set our column name.

00:34.390 --> 00:38.110
So in this case coffee origin ecord to our new value.

00:38.300 --> 00:42.920
So this will be equal to Sri Lanka and then we have a WHERE clause.

00:42.950 --> 00:47.330
So look more at where clauses later on in the course as well.

00:47.720 --> 00:52.370
But here it is going to say where a column is equal to a certain value.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.660
So in our case we could use where coffee or a gin is equal to India or we could use where ID is equal

00:59.660 --> 01:07.070
to seven so type or update statement for changing coffee or region of our food to coffee from India

01:07.070 --> 01:08.940
to Sri Lanka.

01:08.990 --> 01:16.610
So we need to type up day products so the products table and then we need to set our coffee origin column

01:20.900 --> 01:24.110
equal to Sri Lanka

01:27.520 --> 01:28.780
we need to say where

01:31.770 --> 01:32.590
ID.

01:32.730 --> 01:35.850
So the ID column is equal to seven.

01:36.570 --> 01:41.080
So it's going to look for whether Id call them as equal to seven and it's going to change.

01:41.150 --> 01:46.070
We're going to update the coffee gorging column equal to Sri Lanka.

01:46.080 --> 01:49.970
So let's run this statement and that story from pulok.

01:50.310 --> 01:55.520
Again you can see that the coffee chain change from India to Sri Lanka.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.740
So that's how we do updates on data tables.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.540
And by default.

02:01.590 --> 02:09.660
In my school work bench you're only allowed to use the primary key column in the WHERE statement when

02:09.660 --> 02:11.370
you're updating data.

02:11.710 --> 02:18.370
And that's because automatically it sets safe updates to change.

02:18.450 --> 02:26.840
We can skew our safe updates equal to zero.

02:26.870 --> 02:30.110
So zero means Force 1 means true.

02:30.140 --> 02:34.200
So here we're deactivating safe updates now.

02:35.130 --> 02:43.190
And now we'll be able to update our data but we won't have to use the primary key column when we're

02:43.340 --> 02:47.060
up we're using the WHERE clause.

02:47.060 --> 02:51.850
So now I want to show you how you can update more than one column at a time.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.530
So here we've just updated coffee origin.

02:55.020 --> 03:03.610
But if we select stuff from products again I want to change the price and the coffee origin of our Americano.

03:03.860 --> 03:06.560
So I want to change the price to free 4:46.

03:06.680 --> 03:14.570
I don't want to change the coffee origin to Ethiopia so let's write up a statement for that.

03:14.900 --> 03:24.540
So we have to update products again and we have to set price equal to the value Sifry point to five.

03:24.710 --> 03:34.810
And then we can just type a comma and type your next column which is coffee origin and set that you

03:34.940 --> 03:36.420
to Ethiopia.

03:41.810 --> 03:51.240
That correctly and then we can say where name is the couture Americano.

03:51.930 --> 03:57.510
So the name column is equal to Americano an American has to be in single quotes

04:01.070 --> 04:11.760
and let's run up and select stuff from products and you can see our Americano here now has a price of

04:11.760 --> 04:13.140
three point eighty five.

04:13.560 --> 04:19.890
And the coffee origin of the Ethiopian sorry about dated two columns in one update statement.

04:20.930 --> 04:25.630
And we can also update two rows at the same time.

04:25.740 --> 04:33.360
So at the moment we've just looked a single rose Americano and filter but we can also update two rows

04:33.510 --> 04:34.640
at the same time.

04:34.950 --> 04:40.650
So here we have for our espresso macchiato we have a coffee or region of Brazil.

04:40.890 --> 04:49.580
But I want to change all our Brazilian coffee to Colombian so let's write the update statement for that.

04:50.880 --> 04:55.610
So we need to update products again.

04:56.030 --> 05:01.280
We need to sell our coffee origin to Colombia.

05:06.330 --> 05:08.320
Call Lumbee.

05:09.240 --> 05:13.350
You can say where coffee origin

05:17.070 --> 05:18.920
is equal to Brazil.

05:24.500 --> 05:30.550
And let's run that statement and select style from politics again.

05:31.350 --> 05:36.410
And you can see it update two values in coffee erging column.

05:36.420 --> 05:43.890
So we had our espresso macchiato coffee Jane Brazeau and now they've both changed to Colombia.

05:44.010 --> 05:50.040
So in this video we've learned how to update Singo values like India to Sri Lanka.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.680
We've learned how we can update multiple columns for a single row.

05:54.120 --> 06:00.340
And now we've learned that we can update multiple rows in a single update statement.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.900
So that's it for the updates.

06:02.970 --> 06:03.360
Thank you.
