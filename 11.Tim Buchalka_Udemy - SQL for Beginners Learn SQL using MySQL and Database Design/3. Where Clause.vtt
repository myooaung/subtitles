A case to this lecture we're going to be looking at adding WHERE clauses to select statements so you

00:11.410 --> 00:17.760
can see I have selected staw from my products table with in my coffee store database and it's returned

00:17.830 --> 00:22.690
all seven rows within my products table.

00:22.930 --> 00:30.610
But what if I want to select certain certain rows from this table let's say I wanted to only select

00:31.030 --> 00:34.370
products where the coffee region was equal to Columbia.

00:34.930 --> 00:40.130
Well to do this we're going to have to add a WHERE clause to our select statement.

00:40.130 --> 00:46.270
So here I've selected stuff from products and I'm going to add a WHERE clause which will mean that it's

00:46.360 --> 00:52.500
only going to return rows where coffee origin is equal to Columbia.

00:52.510 --> 00:59.170
So to other close we need to type select style from products and then on the next line we need to type

00:59.170 --> 01:03.880
where a column is called to a certain value.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.260
So you put where.

01:05.260 --> 01:07.330
Followed by the column name.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.540
So in this case is coffee origin

01:13.690 --> 01:16.060
is called to a some value.

01:16.450 --> 01:23.140
So in this case I want to be to be equal to Columbia so for all cha cha data types.

01:23.170 --> 01:28.210
I need to use single quotes and then within those single quotes I need to type the value.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.650
So in this case it's Columbia

01:32.400 --> 01:33.440
and then I can run that.

01:33.450 --> 01:41.010
So we've got select stuff from products where coffee origin column is equal to Columbia and you can

01:41.010 --> 01:47.640
see that just returned the first two rows where coffee origin was equal to Columbia.

01:47.640 --> 01:53.280
Now we can also do it with integers or numbers.

01:53.310 --> 01:55.080
So let's try the price column now.

01:55.110 --> 02:03.420
So let's type where price is equal to three daughters or 3.00.

02:03.810 --> 02:06.450
Now because it's a number we don't have to use single quotes.

02:06.450 --> 02:08.390
We can just type 3.00

02:10.790 --> 02:17.350
and we see we have our two products where the price is equal to 3.00.

02:17.790 --> 02:24.730
So we use where clauses and select statements and we can also have more than one where clause in a single

02:24.730 --> 02:25.820
select statement.

02:25.930 --> 02:31.230
So here I've just got one where clause of code where price is equal to 3.00.

02:31.480 --> 02:39.040
I can also add a second one by going to the next line and typing and then putting my next where clause.

02:39.100 --> 02:43.270
So I type and column name equal to a certain value.

02:43.530 --> 02:52.580
So let's type where price is equal to 3.00 and coffee or region is equal to Colombia.

02:54.980 --> 03:03.280
And because it's a string of single quotes unless run that and see what we got and you can see it turns

03:03.280 --> 03:06.620
one right which meets both where clauses.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.430
So we have a price that sequence 3.00.

03:09.640 --> 03:18.090
And we also have an origin that's equal to Colombia and we can keep going adding more and more clauses

03:18.130 --> 03:19.140
as many as we want.

03:19.150 --> 03:25.300
We just have to keep typing and column name equal to certain value and column name who to send a value

03:26.020 --> 03:33.200
for as long as you want for as many whacko's as you want as well as using the and stateman.

03:33.220 --> 03:42.430
We can also use or so we can say select from X where price is equal to frequent 0 0 or coffee origin

03:42.490 --> 03:44.520
is equal to Columbia.

03:45.700 --> 03:48.720
And if we run now let's see what we got.

03:49.240 --> 03:57.320
So you can see here it's returned all the rows which meet either one or both of the criteria is.

03:57.430 --> 04:03.400
So here we've got Bouffard coffee origins which are required to Colombia but you can see it's also included

04:03.400 --> 04:06.830
the espresso which has a price of 2.5.

04:06.940 --> 04:09.790
So that didn't meet the price secret of 3.0.

04:09.820 --> 04:16.570
But it did meet the coffee origins to Columbia and then similarly here we have to filter coffee which

04:16.570 --> 04:22.600
does have a price of 3.00 but it doesn't have a coffee origin of Sri Lanka.

04:23.140 --> 04:30.910
So that all means it has to me one of the where clause is but the and it has the meat both of the where

04:30.910 --> 04:38.220
clause is so that's it for adding a simple where clause to a select statement.

04:38.300 --> 04:42.670
We just have to type where a column name is equal to a certain value.

04:43.070 --> 04:46.780
And we can add as many wack clauses as we want using the.

04:46.850 --> 04:50.030
And all the or statement.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.660
So let's move on to the next video.
