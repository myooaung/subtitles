00:05.110 --> 00:10.600
A case or in this video we're going to look at how we can modify our tables in our database by adding

00:10.600 --> 00:12.290
and removing columns.

00:12.640 --> 00:19.730
So here I've selected stuff from products and we're going to look at the select statement later on in

00:19.830 --> 00:22.550
the course in future sections.

00:22.660 --> 00:27.670
But for now what you need to know is that when you select store from a table it's just going to retrieve

00:27.820 --> 00:30.030
all the data in that table.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.900
So here I selected stuff from products and you can see down here.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.790
Returns the free columns that we set up.

00:36.790 --> 00:41.960
So our ID card in my name column on our price column within the products table.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.060
So now I want to add a fourth column.

00:45.280 --> 00:51.130
I want to add coffee origin column and this is going to contain a word.

00:51.190 --> 00:54.370
So a country of origin of the coffee.

00:54.460 --> 01:06.740
So Brazil Indonesia etc. so to modify a table we need to type out a table followed by the table name.

01:06.740 --> 01:14.530
So in this case it's going to be products and then on the next line we need to type I'd call them to

01:14.530 --> 01:16.880
write or column.

01:17.300 --> 01:23.170
Table Table name followed by column and then the column name.

01:23.170 --> 01:30.340
So in this case it's going to be coffee origin and then we just need to finish that off with the data

01:30.340 --> 01:31.030
type.

01:31.060 --> 01:32.720
So it's going to be a string.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.620
So it's going to be a vulture.

01:35.410 --> 01:39.320
And set the maximum length to 30.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.570
Now we just need to run that statement and then select stuff from Puddock again.

01:45.970 --> 01:48.760
And now we have all four of them have coffee origin.

01:48.850 --> 01:55.840
So that's how we add columns to a table is alter table table name calling column name followed by the

01:55.840 --> 01:56.940
data type.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.200
So now let's look at how we can remove columns from tables to do that.

02:02.200 --> 02:08.690
We also need to alter our table and we need to follow up by the table name.

02:08.690 --> 02:17.040
So let's alter the table products and then on the next slide we need to type drop column.

02:17.440 --> 02:23.180
So to remove a column from a table we type called column followed by the column name.

02:23.290 --> 02:26.200
So let's remove coffee origin which we just did

02:28.980 --> 02:34.840
and let's run that statement and select start from Pollocks table again.

02:34.870 --> 02:41.290
And you can see now we just have our original free columns ID name and price coffee origin has been

02:41.290 --> 02:43.290
removed from the table.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.760
So that's how we either remove columns from the table.

02:47.050 --> 02:50.950
Actually for the following videos and sections in this course.

02:50.950 --> 02:54.460
I do want the coffee origin column in our table.

02:54.490 --> 02:59.040
So let's add it back again.

02:59.050 --> 03:03.010
And now we have our coffee origin calling back again.

03:03.010 --> 03:04.640
So that's it for this video.
