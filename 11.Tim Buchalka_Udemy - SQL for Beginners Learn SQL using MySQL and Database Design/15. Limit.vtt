K soon is video we're going to be looking at limiting the number of writers with turned in our results

00:10.420 --> 00:12.240
from our select statements.

00:12.580 --> 00:19.060
So here I've selected stuff from customers and it's returned all the rows of data in our customers table

00:19.120 --> 00:20.050
as you would expect.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.000
So we have 24 writers.

00:22.110 --> 00:27.640
But let's say we just wanted to return five years of data from the Customers table.

00:27.820 --> 00:33.550
What to do this we can use that limit statement so we can get into a select statement where you can

00:33.550 --> 00:41.140
type select stuff from customers and then on the next line we can type limits 5 say limit followed by

00:41.140 --> 00:45.340
the number of rows you want returns from your select statement.

00:45.340 --> 00:52.000
And if we run this now we can see it's just returned five days of data series returns the five rows

00:52.000 --> 00:56.370
where ID is equal to 1 2 3 4 5.

00:56.440 --> 01:02.920
So that's how we limit the number of rows in a select statement and we can also apply an offset to this

01:02.920 --> 01:03.720
limit.

01:03.760 --> 01:10.000
So let's say we didn't warn the 5 raise type and where ID is equal to 1 2 3 4 5.

01:10.150 --> 01:21.220
But we wanted Id 6 7 8 9 10 what to do that after the limit 5 we can type offset 5 and run that statement

01:21.660 --> 01:29.400
and you see now that it returns the IDs for ID 6 7 8 9 and 10.

01:29.470 --> 01:36.490
So this is how we apply limit sun offsets to those limits when we're selecting from tables and we can

01:36.490 --> 01:45.730
use any numbers we like in the limit and the offset so we can type limit 10 offset 5 and return customers

01:45.730 --> 01:49.070
with ID 6 3 15.

01:49.090 --> 01:53.210
Now we can also add an ORDER BY statement in our select statement.

01:53.380 --> 01:59.590
So let's say we wanted the first 10 customers alphabetically by last name.

01:59.710 --> 02:05.200
We can come in to us stateman we can remove the offset because we just won the first 10.

02:05.440 --> 02:14.860
And on the next line after our select start from customers we can type order by last name and have a

02:14.860 --> 02:22.390
limit of 10 and you can see it's no longer ordered by ID but is order by last name so we have the two

02:22.390 --> 02:23.850
nos like before.

02:23.890 --> 02:28.510
And then we have Armstrong the blue box and then Portmans.

02:28.530 --> 02:33.620
So that's how we return the first 10 rares ordered by a column.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.610
So order by last name in this case.

02:36.610 --> 02:41.680
So this is how we limit the number of rows returned in a select statement.

02:41.680 --> 02:48.120
We use limit followed by the number of rows you want returned and then we can also apply an offset.

02:48.190 --> 02:51.500
If you don't win the first number of rows returned.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.160
OK so that's it for this video.
