A case here there are solutions to each question.

00:08.300 --> 00:15.650
So the first question was asking us how many bookings to customer ID 10 make in October 2017.

00:15.650 --> 00:24.080
So we need to count the number of lines in the bookings table for Customer ID 10 so we can select count

00:24.830 --> 00:25.590
Stolle

00:28.320 --> 00:32.590
on bookings and then we need a WHERE clause.

00:32.610 --> 00:43.210
So we need to say where customer ID equals 10 and October 2017.

00:43.210 --> 00:48.510
Actually all the data in our database is for October 2000 1790.

00:48.630 --> 00:54.990
So we don't need to wear clothes stating that the date must be in October 2017.

00:54.990 --> 00:59.540
So let's run that query and we can see we have a value of 6.

00:59.550 --> 01:07.950
So customer ID made six bookings in October 2017 and then the second question is asking us to count

01:07.980 --> 01:14.940
the number of screenings for Blade Runner 2049 in October 2017.

01:15.090 --> 01:22.790
So we need to count the number of rows in the screenings table where the screening was for Blade Runner

01:23.090 --> 01:25.700
2000 in 2009.

01:25.710 --> 01:30.490
So we need to select count staw

01:33.760 --> 01:37.470
from screenings.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.730
Now in the screenings table we only have the film ID.

01:41.830 --> 01:48.310
We dont have the film name so we are going to have to do a join on the films table to get the film name.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.240
Blade Runner 2049.

01:50.590 --> 02:01.730
So we need to select count stuff from screenings S and M and we need to join films F on Dot film ID

02:01.780 --> 02:06.330
so we have the film Id and the screenings table is equal to the film.

02:06.340 --> 02:17.130
Id say stop film Id cause f id and then we can say where after that name.

02:17.530 --> 02:20.260
So films table name call them.

02:20.620 --> 02:35.680
Is it cool to Blade Runner 20 49 and then we can run that query and you can see we had 24 screenings

02:36.190 --> 02:41.780
for the film Bladerunner 2049 in October 2017.

02:41.890 --> 02:48.450
So the final question is asking us to count the number of unique customers who made a booking for October

02:48.460 --> 02:49.900
2017.

02:50.110 --> 02:55.810
So when you see that you have to select unique you have to think about the distinct keyword.

02:56.080 --> 03:05.050
So here we can count the number of distinct customer IDs in the booking table Sidus type select count.

03:05.270 --> 03:12.930
I put a pair of brackets type distinct open another pair of brackets and type customer ID.

03:13.480 --> 03:17.770
So this is going to count distinct customer IDs.

03:18.040 --> 03:25.600
I mean EMBA to close it with a second bracket there and then we want to say from the bookings table

03:28.060 --> 03:32.840
say lets run this query and you can see is retired 105.

03:33.140 --> 03:43.280
So 105 unique customers made a booking in October 2017 and if you remember from India we have 120 customers

03:43.280 --> 03:44.190
in total.

03:44.320 --> 03:48.990
So 15 customers didn't make a booking in October 2017.

03:49.410 --> 03:55.680
OK so if you go beyond two or three questions and well done because I was quite a tricky exercise.

03:55.680 --> 03:59.630
But if you didn't no worries just what the video solutions are for.

04:00.010 --> 04:04.480
So if you have any questions about solutions please ask in the Q&amp;A section.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.940
But for now let's move on to the next video.
