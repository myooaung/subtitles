OK walk into this first exercise video in this section in this exercise we're going to be looking at

00:11.920 --> 00:16.880
concatenate substring upper and lower functions.

00:16.960 --> 00:26.590
So the first exercise is to concatenate the film names and length from the films table and then the

00:26.590 --> 00:34.780
second exercise is to extract the customer's email from the fifth character on what's the third exercise

00:34.810 --> 00:41.890
is to select the customer's first name and lowercase and their last name and uppercase for each customer

00:41.950 --> 00:44.590
with the last name of Smith.

00:44.680 --> 00:52.360
The fourth exercise is to select the last three letters of each film name from the films table and then

00:52.360 --> 00:59.590
the final exercise is to concatenate the first three letters in the first name and last name columns

00:59.860 --> 01:02.930
together from the Customers table.

01:03.010 --> 01:09.250
So have a go at answering each of these exercises and then the next video there'll be a solution to

01:09.280 --> 01:10.060
each rung.
