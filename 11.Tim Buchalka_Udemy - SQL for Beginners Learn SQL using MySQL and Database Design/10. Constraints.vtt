00:05.540 --> 00:08.940
A case in this video we're going to be looking at constraints.

00:09.150 --> 00:16.140
So constraints placed on columns within tables and they used to restrict what values can be entered

00:16.140 --> 00:17.720
into those columns.

00:17.760 --> 00:24.180
So we've already seen data types which are applied to columns which restrict the data which can be entered

00:24.180 --> 00:24.900
into a column.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.870
So this is kind of a constraint.

00:27.150 --> 00:31.800
So now we're going to take a look at some other constraints within my school which we can place on our

00:31.800 --> 00:33.090
columns.

00:33.090 --> 00:36.170
So the first constraint we look at is not no constraint.

00:36.270 --> 00:40.500
And this means that a column can contain any no values.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.210
If we put no constraint onto that column.

00:44.310 --> 00:48.930
So we saw in our coffee store database that some of our customers didn't provide us with a phone number

00:49.320 --> 00:53.440
and we had no value placed in phone number column.

00:53.550 --> 00:58.660
But if we are to apply not no constraint to this column then we wouldn't have been able to place these

00:58.830 --> 01:03.190
values and we would have required a phone number from our customers.

01:03.210 --> 01:06.890
So this is more than not no constraint does two columns.

01:06.960 --> 01:14.580
It requires that you have to have a value entered into that column and then the next one is the unique

01:14.580 --> 01:15.330
constraint.

01:15.540 --> 01:22.710
And if we apply the unique constraint to a column that means we can place any duplicate values of data

01:22.710 --> 01:24.150
into that column.

01:24.180 --> 01:30.150
So if we try to enter a value into a column which already contained that value we would actually get

01:30.150 --> 01:32.900
an error and we wouldn't be able to enter that data.

01:32.910 --> 01:39.240
So every row of data in that column must be unique if it has the unique constraint applied to that column

01:40.440 --> 01:41.840
and the next two constraints.

01:41.850 --> 01:44.630
We've actually seen already so primary key foreign key.

01:44.860 --> 01:50.850
So the primary key is a column that uniquely identifies each are of data within the table and foreign

01:50.850 --> 01:55.330
key is a column which is related to a primary key in another table.

01:55.350 --> 02:00.540
So we use foreign keys and primary keys to linked tables together.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.560
And then next type of constraint is the check constraint.

02:04.560 --> 02:10.860
So if we apply a check constraint to a column this will control the values that can be inserted into

02:10.860 --> 02:11.910
that column.

02:11.940 --> 02:16.500
So as an example where we have a check on the ratings column in a table.

02:16.500 --> 02:24.240
So this is like film ratings and is saying that any value inserted into this ratings column must be

02:24.240 --> 02:27.770
between zero and 100.

02:27.780 --> 02:36.570
So this is like for Metacritic school or just a rating out of 100 were allowed to enter data between

02:36.570 --> 02:39.570
0 and 100 into this column.

02:39.570 --> 02:41.930
So this is what the check constraint does.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.980
And the last constraint we look at is 34 constrain and the default constraint allows you to set a default

02:48.160 --> 02:53.880
value which will be entered into a column when you're writing insert into queries.

02:53.880 --> 02:59.760
So say you inserting data into the Customers table for the first and last name.

02:59.850 --> 03:06.960
If you answer in a blank value for the last name and the last name column has a default value set to

03:06.960 --> 03:11.940
Smiff then it's going to interest me if for every time you leave that blank.

03:11.940 --> 03:18.870
So every time you do insert into Joe on a first name and then blank for last name is going to enter

03:18.870 --> 03:21.080
the default value which is Smith.

03:21.450 --> 03:27.630
So we have an example here of e-mail column which has a default value set to no data.

03:27.630 --> 03:33.840
So if you are inserting a new customer into your customer table and they didn't provide an e-mail you

03:33.840 --> 03:39.710
could leave it blank and then the default will set this to no data.

03:39.810 --> 03:45.180
So that's it for the different types of constraints in my sorrow when we create a system our booking

03:45.180 --> 03:50.440
system database we're going to be looking at setting some of these constraints to our table columns.

03:50.850 --> 03:53.150
But for now that's it for this video.
