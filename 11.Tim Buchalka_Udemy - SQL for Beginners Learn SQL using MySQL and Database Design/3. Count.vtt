A case or in this video let's have a look at the count aggregate function.

00:09.700 --> 00:14.590
So I've selected stuff from the Customers table and you can see it's return all the information we have

00:14.590 --> 00:15.880
about our customers.

00:16.160 --> 00:22.270
But you want to count the number of customers that we have in this table and to do that I can use the

00:22.270 --> 00:24.690
Count aggregate function.

00:24.730 --> 00:31.310
So in the new line type selects and then write counts and then we want to open up half Burkett's and

00:31.450 --> 00:33.080
within the brackets per stall.

00:33.100 --> 00:41.780
So we're counting store for all customers and a semi-colon.

00:41.810 --> 00:47.520
And we can just run up and you can see as returns a value of one hundred and twenty.

00:47.710 --> 00:51.030
So we have 120 writers in our customers table.

00:51.190 --> 00:53.790
So we have 120 customers.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.050
We can also count on a column.

00:56.050 --> 00:57.430
So that's count last name

01:01.250 --> 01:03.890
and you can see returns on June 20 again.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.470
But now let's try and count first name

01:10.450 --> 01:13.460
and you can see has just returned 114.

01:13.750 --> 01:17.590
And this is because it's not counting no values.

01:17.690 --> 01:22.550
So first name we have some no values because we didn't set the not no constraint.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.960
So we have 6 no values.

01:25.010 --> 01:28.430
So it's just returned the value of 114.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.530
When is counting the first name.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.370
So be careful of that.

01:32.770 --> 01:36.830
And we can also add where clauses were made using aggregate functions.

01:37.040 --> 01:41.290
So let's select count stock again from customers.

01:41.340 --> 01:50.090
Let's add a WHERE clause that said where last name equals Smith

01:54.330 --> 01:59.500
and you can see we have six Smiths in our table.

01:59.950 --> 02:05.140
Let's try a second where close where first name is no.

02:05.190 --> 02:10.680
So where first name is no

02:13.830 --> 02:15.620
and you can see it returns 6 again.

02:15.630 --> 02:20.160
So we have 6 customers who didn't provide us with first name.

02:20.160 --> 02:28.680
So that proves the 120 114 we saw earlier count does not include no values when you're counting on a

02:28.950 --> 02:31.100
specific column.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.820
So that's it for the aggregate function for now.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.490
Let's move on to the next video.
