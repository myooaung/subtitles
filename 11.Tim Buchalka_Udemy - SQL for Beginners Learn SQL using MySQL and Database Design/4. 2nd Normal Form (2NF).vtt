00:05.230 --> 00:08.770
So now let's look at the second normal form.

00:08.770 --> 00:11.410
So a table was in second normal form.

00:11.650 --> 00:20.290
If it's in first novel full plus every column of data that is not a primary key of the table is dependent

00:20.410 --> 00:23.070
on the whole of the primary key.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.740
So what does this mean.

00:25.750 --> 00:31.130
So this has to do with removing unrelated data from tables.

00:31.180 --> 00:36.440
So I remember from before I said we only wanted related data in a single table.

00:36.760 --> 00:42.920
Well this is how we use normalization to remove unrelated data from a table.

00:43.150 --> 00:49.660
We want to make sure every column that is not a primary key of the table is dependent on the whole of

00:49.660 --> 00:50.840
the primary key.

00:51.100 --> 00:56.710
And by the whole of the primary key we mean every column that makes up that primary key.

00:56.740 --> 01:02.260
So I've already mentioned that we can have multiple columns combined together to make a primary key

01:02.950 --> 01:03.780
in any column.

01:03.820 --> 01:08.540
That's not a primary key must depend on the whole of this primary key.

01:08.980 --> 01:11.740
So now let's look at an example.

01:11.740 --> 01:17.980
So here we have a student table and it contains the student name any subjects they're taking the Great

01:18.010 --> 01:21.110
they got for that subjects and their age.

01:21.580 --> 01:27.270
So let's take a look and see if this table is in second normal form.

01:27.310 --> 01:33.100
So the first thing we need to check is whether it's in first normal form so we can see there's no repeated

01:33.100 --> 01:34.080
rows of data.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.860
Every row is unique within this table.

01:37.210 --> 01:43.930
We can see that every column only has a single entry and we can see that it does indeed have a primary

01:43.930 --> 01:45.110
key.

01:45.220 --> 01:49.850
So the primary key is the student column plus the subject column.

01:49.870 --> 01:52.540
So we have Natasha Williams math.

01:52.630 --> 01:59.730
Natasha Williams English and these are this combination is unique and then we have Daniel James math

01:59.740 --> 02:02.840
Simon Brown chemistry hematomas geography.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.060
OK so it is in first normal form.

02:05.140 --> 02:09.370
So now we got to check whether it is in second normal form.

02:09.370 --> 02:14.420
So is every column that's not a primary key dependent on the whole of the primary key.

02:14.530 --> 02:17.580
So we can see we have two columns here which aren't primary keys.

02:17.590 --> 02:19.790
We have grade and daj.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.460
So let's first check the great column.

02:22.540 --> 02:28.990
So yes this is dependent on the whole of the primary key and we know this because it doesn't make sense

02:28.990 --> 02:30.190
to just say.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.860
Natasha Williams I we need.

02:32.920 --> 02:39.160
Natasha Williams Plus the subject of math to be able to say that her grade was a.

02:39.160 --> 02:45.760
And it also doesn't make sense to just say Subject math grade A or a subject math grade C.

02:45.970 --> 02:49.920
We also need the student name to be able to say what grade they got.

02:50.140 --> 02:53.990
So yes the grade is dependent on the whole of the primary key.

02:54.010 --> 02:57.210
So it depends on the student and the subject.

02:57.550 --> 02:59.640
So now we need to check the age column.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.000
Well the age column does depend on the student.

03:03.100 --> 03:08.140
So we need the student to be able to tell what their ages are so we need to say.

03:08.140 --> 03:11.090
Natasha Williams to be able to say she's 15.

03:11.140 --> 03:12.520
We need the student name.

03:12.520 --> 03:18.670
Daniel James to be able to say he's 16 but we don't need to shoot the student subjects.

03:18.850 --> 03:24.860
So the fact that Natasha Williams takes math and English doesn't have any impact on the age of two.

03:25.300 --> 03:30.570
So this age column is dependent on the student but it's not dependent on the subject.

03:30.760 --> 03:35.110
So this age column is not dependent on the hold of the primary key.

03:35.110 --> 03:39.290
So this table is in fact not in second normal form.

03:39.370 --> 03:44.650
So now the question is how are we going to make sure that this data is normalized so that it follows

03:44.650 --> 03:51.750
the second normal form and to do that we actually need to split this table into two separate tables.

03:52.210 --> 03:54.970
So the first table was going to look like this.

03:54.970 --> 03:59.400
It has the student name the students subjects and the grades.

03:59.440 --> 04:05.620
So basically we've removed the age column from the original table and we just have the name subjects

04:05.710 --> 04:06.670
and grade.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.040
So now we need to check whether this table was in second normal form.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.070
Wow.

04:12.070 --> 04:15.150
First let's check in first of form.

04:15.310 --> 04:18.100
So yes there's no repeated rows of data.

04:18.100 --> 04:23.050
Every row is unique and every column only has one value.

04:23.590 --> 04:28.510
And we also have a primary K is the same primary key is studen plus subject.

04:28.990 --> 04:31.690
So now we need to check whether it's in second normal form.

04:31.870 --> 04:34.990
Well actually we've already checked for the grade column.

04:34.990 --> 04:38.500
Yes it's dependent on the whole of the primary key.

04:38.680 --> 04:43.870
So we need to she didn't name and we also need test subject to be able to tell what grade they got.

04:44.260 --> 04:48.730
So yes this table now follows a normal form.

04:48.760 --> 04:52.520
So what about the age of the student.

04:53.650 --> 04:59.280
So for that we actually need a separate table which just has the student name and the age.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.520
So let's check if this follows a normal form.

05:02.890 --> 05:07.510
Well does it follow first normal for so yes there's no repeated rows of data.

05:07.540 --> 05:14.050
We haven't got Natasha Williams entered twice or done you James and to twice every row is unique every

05:14.050 --> 05:18.960
column only has one value and we have a primary key.

05:18.960 --> 05:25.150
I saw a student column so this table does follow first normal form.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.950
Now does it follow Second normal form.

05:27.970 --> 05:35.530
So our primary key is now any made up of one column and we have one column which is not a primary key

05:35.980 --> 05:37.220
which is H.

05:37.480 --> 05:42.210
And yes it's fairly obvious that this does depend on the student.

05:42.550 --> 05:46.570
So the age column does depend on the whole of the primary key.

05:46.810 --> 05:50.500
So this table is now in second normal form.

05:50.500 --> 05:56.500
So if we add any columns in a table which one dependent on the hold of the primary key is you show that

05:56.500 --> 06:03.360
we have to separate this data into two separate tables so that it follows second normal form.

06:03.410 --> 06:08.500
So the second normal form is quite a lot more complicated than first animal form.

06:08.500 --> 06:15.670
So maybe you need to go through this video more than once just to make sure that you have absolutely

06:15.880 --> 06:22.510
understood what second normal form is how to make sure that your table are in second normal form and

06:22.510 --> 06:26.920
then we can move on to the next video which is looking at third normal form.
