A case.

00:06.020 --> 00:09.030
Now let's talk about relationships.

00:09.110 --> 00:16.400
So when we talk about relationships in a database we mean the link between tables within that database.

00:16.460 --> 00:24.440
So the whole point of a relational database is that the tables can be joined together and as related

00:24.440 --> 00:31.220
columns between the tables and these tables are related through primary and foreign keys which we've

00:31.220 --> 00:32.270
already looked.

00:32.510 --> 00:40.220
So in our coffee store database we had a relationship between the customer and the orders table and

00:40.220 --> 00:43.670
a relationship between the products and the Orders table.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.850
So this is what we mean when we're talking about relationships in a database.

00:49.250 --> 00:57.580
And there are three different types of relationships as a one to one relationship as a one to many relationship.

00:58.040 --> 01:03.530
And then finally there's a many to many relationship and we're going to discuss each one in the next

01:03.530 --> 01:05.270
three videos.
