00:05.260 --> 00:09.380
A case in it's video let's take a look at some aggregate function.

00:09.400 --> 00:15.550
So here I selected stuff from LA Reems table and you can see we have free rooms so we have our main

00:15.550 --> 00:18.330
room which has 72 seats called Chaplin.

00:18.430 --> 00:24.610
And then we have our two secondary rooms Kubrick and Capella and they each have 36 seats.

00:24.910 --> 00:31.660
So what if you wanted to sum the number of seats called them so that you could find out exactly how

00:31.660 --> 00:35.800
many seats you had in your house in a mall Well you could use the saw.

00:35.850 --> 00:37.110
I couldn't function.

00:37.330 --> 00:45.160
So we could select number of seats and then put that in brackets.

00:47.480 --> 00:58.900
And before that I had some sage select some the color and number of seats from Bream's.

00:59.350 --> 01:05.020
And you can see it summed all the values in a number of seats column and it's just return one value

01:05.440 --> 01:06.930
of 144.

01:07.150 --> 01:11.750
So this is 72 plus 36 plus 36.

01:11.750 --> 01:16.390
So we only have three Vadhu So it is very easy to add that up anyway.

01:16.440 --> 01:22.530
But if you had lots and lots of values this sum becomes quite useful.

01:22.810 --> 01:28.940
And unlike the Coulon function we can do is On-Star.

01:29.800 --> 01:37.450
So if we try and do some star We're going to get an era and this is because I was just counting the

01:37.450 --> 01:38.730
number of rows in a table.

01:38.740 --> 01:46.350
So you could do the stall but some is actually summing up the values in that table or in that column.

01:46.510 --> 01:52.900
And if you look care we have four chaws So chop Kubrick capella.

01:53.150 --> 01:54.460
How is it going to sum this.

01:54.460 --> 01:55.840
It doesn't make sense.

01:55.840 --> 02:01.140
So we have to stay the column and it has to be a numeric called him.

02:01.240 --> 02:07.210
So right is number of seats column here and we can also add where closes to all some functions.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.260
So that's some number of seats again.

02:10.360 --> 02:18.170
But let's add a WHERE clause let's say where ID is greater than 1.

02:18.310 --> 02:21.300
So it should sum up these two values here.

02:22.330 --> 02:28.530
And you can see a returned 72 so 36 plus 36 and it's returned 72.

02:29.020 --> 02:31.330
So that's it for some aggregate function.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.790
Now let's move on to the next video.
