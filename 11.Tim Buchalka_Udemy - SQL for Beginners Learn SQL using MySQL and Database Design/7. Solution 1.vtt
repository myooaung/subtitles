00:05.540 --> 00:08.660
Case has the solution for each question.

00:08.980 --> 00:15.640
So the first question was asking us to select the film name and length for all films of a length greater

00:15.640 --> 00:17.360
than the average film length.

00:17.470 --> 00:20.760
So obviously we're going to have to select from the films table.

00:21.090 --> 00:28.150
I'm for this one where you're going to use a non correlated query and the inquiry will be off to the

00:28.160 --> 00:43.330
west stateman So let's select a name and length for men from films and then we want where length men

00:45.340 --> 00:48.870
is greater than the average film length.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.180
So for this we're going to need to type in a query now.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.930
So next line we can tie select

00:58.120 --> 01:09.070
average length men so do the average aggregate function on the length men called him from films

01:11.740 --> 01:19.400
so let's run this query and you can see it return six films and their length.

01:19.400 --> 01:27.990
So these are six films that have length which was greater than the average length of all our films in

01:28.000 --> 01:29.820
our database.

01:29.840 --> 01:38.510
So just to confirm let's run the inquiry independently of the outer query so let's copy onto the next

01:38.660 --> 01:47.930
line and we're selecting average length men from our films table and we can see it's returned a value

01:47.930 --> 01:51.560
of one hundred fifteen point 0 8 3 3.

01:51.560 --> 01:57.680
So now we run the query it should return all films.

01:57.680 --> 02:04.220
So the name of each film and the length of each film from films where length man is greater than a hundred

02:04.250 --> 02:08.280
fifteen point zero or a three.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.870
So you can see that in the lengthening column.

02:10.940 --> 02:18.540
All above a hundred fifteen point zero three three and has written a name for each film.

02:18.620 --> 02:25.850
So that's the answer for question 1 and Question 2 was asking us to select the maximum number and the

02:25.850 --> 02:29.660
minimum number of screenings for a particular film.

02:29.660 --> 02:35.510
So for this we're going to use a non correlated subquery again but instead of being in the WHERE clause

02:35.600 --> 02:39.420
the inquiry is going to come off to the From.

02:39.530 --> 02:44.680
So to answer this question let's write the query first.

02:44.690 --> 02:58.010
Say for the query I want to select film ID and I want to count on the ID fields from the screenings

02:58.010 --> 03:01.760
table.

03:01.760 --> 03:07.840
So this is going to return film ID and account for each screening for each film.

03:07.850 --> 03:14.810
So I also need to group by film ID.

03:15.710 --> 03:24.440
So let's run this first so you can see we have each film Id 11:59 and then we have a count on the ID

03:24.440 --> 03:25.750
field in the screenings table.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.040
So we have a count on each number the screenings.

03:29.330 --> 03:39.590
So film Id won had 24 screenings film ID to have 25 screenings etc etc. So no this type the outer query.

03:39.590 --> 03:46.400
So basically I want to select the maximum number and the minimum number from this county ID column.

03:46.460 --> 04:00.110
So I want to select max by day and I want to select men ID from this in a query.

04:00.110 --> 04:08.130
So now we have to put brackets around in a query and remember this creates derive table.

04:08.360 --> 04:14.140
So we also have to give it any name we like we can just call it a bit you can call it whatever you like.

04:14.480 --> 04:26.090
And also you can see on selecting Max ID and main ID so we also have to select film Id counter ID as

04:27.380 --> 04:29.020
ID.

04:29.150 --> 04:31.630
So now I'm going to be performing the max in the meeting.

04:31.630 --> 04:38.190
I mean I can get functions on this county Id call and which is now as ID.

04:38.690 --> 04:43.180
So lets run this and you can see it returns two values.

04:43.210 --> 04:47.530
It returns a maximum ID of 26 and a min of 6.

04:47.630 --> 04:54.230
So the film had a maximum number of screenings had 26 screenings and the film had the minimum number

04:54.230 --> 04:56.780
of screenings had six screenings.

04:57.020 --> 05:03.440
So the final question was asking us to select each film name and the number of screenings for that film.

05:03.710 --> 05:07.230
So we are going to have to select the film name from the films table.

05:07.520 --> 05:13.010
I'm gonna have to do a count on the ID field from the screening stable and to do this we are going to

05:13.010 --> 05:14.520
use a co-related.

05:14.570 --> 05:21.960
So Guerrieri Celeste type select name and last name from the films table.

05:22.380 --> 05:25.290
And now we want to write in a query.

05:25.480 --> 05:31.410
So I put in a pair of brackets on the next line and we can type in a query.

05:31.640 --> 05:40.620
So we want to select count ID so we do an accountant ID fields in the screenings table.

05:40.640 --> 05:54.480
So let's say from screenings where film Id So the film Id call them in the films table in the screenings

05:54.480 --> 06:05.100
table is equal to f id so the ID field in the films table and then we can return to our outer query

06:05.190 --> 06:16.080
and we can say from films if so we are saying select name from films F and then in a query were selecting

06:16.080 --> 06:25.800
counted ID from screenings with film ID is a call to f id and let's run that query and you can see it

06:26.150 --> 06:28.560
and all our films.

06:28.830 --> 06:37.470
So we have all 12 of our films and then we have the number of screenings for each film in our database.

06:37.470 --> 06:40.590
So thats the solution for each of the questions.

06:40.590 --> 06:47.010
Now there were probably more than one solution for each question and you could have even use Joines

06:47.010 --> 06:49.330
for some of these questions I imagine.

06:49.330 --> 06:55.110
So if you found a different solution for any of the questions then let me know in the Q&amp;A section and

06:55.100 --> 06:56.280
I'll take a look.

06:56.770 --> 06:59.240
But for now that's it for this video.
