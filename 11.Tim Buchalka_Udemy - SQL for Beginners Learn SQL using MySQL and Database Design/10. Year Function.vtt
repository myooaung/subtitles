A so in this video we're going to be looking at the Year function and what the Year function does is

00:10.740 --> 00:17.240
it extracts the year from a date or date time data type.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.840
So you can see here we've selected the year from this date.

00:21.900 --> 00:25.310
So 2018 I-65.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.800
And if we were to run this query you can see just returns the year 2018.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.690
And similarly if we were to add a time to make this a date time

00:40.590 --> 00:48.880
and run this query again you can see still able to return just the year 2018.

00:49.410 --> 00:56.700
Okay so now let's look at applying the Year function to our tables in our system our booking system.

00:56.720 --> 01:03.930
So here I've selected that time from screenings again and you can see it returns the date time data

01:03.930 --> 01:04.740
type.

01:04.740 --> 01:13.620
So 2017 October 1 1 p.m. and so on and so on and if we copy and paste this query

01:17.700 --> 01:22.740
and then add a year function to our start time column.

01:22.740 --> 01:27.920
So year and then start time in brackets and run the query again.

01:28.110 --> 01:33.110
You can see for every row of data just return the year 2017.

01:33.330 --> 01:37.960
And that's because we only have data for October 2017.

01:38.010 --> 01:42.030
So every row returns a year 2017.

01:42.200 --> 01:48.900
But you can imagine if we had years and years of data then this is going to return just the year 2016

01:48.900 --> 01:54.720
if we had data from 2016 2015 2014 et cetera et cetera.

01:55.320 --> 02:00.390
And we can use this function to select all the data from certain years.

02:00.390 --> 02:05.400
So if we if we write our query select

02:07.800 --> 02:15.200
store from screenings and then we have a WHERE clause where the stop sign

02:18.950 --> 02:21.470
column has the Year function applied to it.

02:21.500 --> 02:31.610
So year and then in brackets start time and then if we said that equal to 2017 then it's going to return

02:31.670 --> 02:40.640
all the rows of data which have dates from the first of January 2017 to the thirty first of December

02:40.640 --> 02:42.420
2017.

02:42.950 --> 02:52.350
So if we run this you can see it returns all rows of data because all our data is from October 2017.

02:52.910 --> 02:58.720
So this is how we can return data from certain years in our database.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.880
So that's it for this video when the Year function.

03:01.880 --> 03:08.930
Just remember that the Year function extracts the year from a date or a date time data type.
