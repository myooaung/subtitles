00:05.230 --> 00:10.350
A case of the first table that we want to create is the films table.

00:10.590 --> 00:14.380
Now if you remember from the schema the films table looks like this.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.360
So we have an ID column which is an end.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.610
And it's also the primary key.

00:19.890 --> 00:26.880
And then we have the name of the film which is a volleyball and we have the length of the film in minutes

00:27.000 --> 00:28.640
and that's an end.

00:29.070 --> 00:33.580
And both of these columns the name and the length are also not.

00:33.590 --> 00:34.190
No.

00:34.380 --> 00:36.130
So they have not no constraint.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.190
And also the name column has the unique constraint.

00:40.230 --> 00:45.430
So we don't want two films with the same name entered into our films table.

00:45.780 --> 00:55.630
So now let's open my school work bench and create this films table.

00:56.050 --> 01:01.910
So before we create the films table we actually need to create the database for our cinema booking system.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.040
So here I've run short databases.

01:04.340 --> 01:11.250
And you can see we have our coffee store database but we don't have a database for our booking system.

01:11.390 --> 01:21.830
So what we need to do is we need to create a database and we're going to call that cinema our booking

01:23.310 --> 01:23.880
system

01:28.050 --> 01:35.520
and then if we run this and shared databases again you can see now we have our system our booking system

01:35.520 --> 01:39.860
database and we can use that database so we can use

01:43.810 --> 01:44.760
booking system

01:51.220 --> 01:55.390
and now we can create our films table.

01:55.390 --> 02:01.600
So if you remember from before to create the table we need to type create table followed by the table

02:01.600 --> 02:09.400
name so films that we need to open a pair of brackets and we can put a semi-colon on the ends and then

02:09.400 --> 02:17.220
within the brackets we need to type our columns and data types and constraints.

02:17.530 --> 02:22.220
So the first column we want to create is the ID column.

02:22.270 --> 02:27.600
So this was an index and it was the primary key.

02:27.670 --> 02:38.110
So we need to type ID into primary K and this is also auto incrementing So we need to type autoincrement

02:38.320 --> 02:50.370
and then a comma and then the next column must the name column which was a char of length 45 bands.

02:50.410 --> 02:52.270
We had the constraints not no.

02:52.270 --> 02:55.950
So we just typed No no after the data type.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.520
And we also had a unique constraint.

02:58.750 --> 03:03.380
So we just type unique after that not no constraint.

03:04.750 --> 03:09.500
And then the last column was the length minute column.

03:09.730 --> 03:20.880
So we need to type length men followed by the data type which was in then followed by the not no constraint.

03:21.820 --> 03:24.110
And then we need to run this query

03:27.250 --> 03:30.250
and then we can show you tables

03:34.560 --> 03:42.420
and you can see now we have our films table in our database and we can select stod

03:46.800 --> 03:51.880
from films just to see the columns.

03:51.960 --> 03:58.080
And you can see we have all three columns and we can also run this new query we can run describe

04:02.330 --> 04:03.280
films.

04:03.310 --> 04:12.560
So describe followed by the table name and it shows us the columns the data type with the columns wherever

04:12.610 --> 04:15.040
they're allowed to have no values.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.820
So we set not know two or three columns.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.880
There is no and then we have the key.

04:21.010 --> 04:29.320
So we have a primary key Priore for ID and we also have the unique key for our name field.

04:29.680 --> 04:35.130
We didn't set any default values for any of the columns.

04:35.290 --> 04:40.430
And then as an extra common we have the ID field which is auto incrementing.

04:40.510 --> 04:45.720
So describe that by the table name to find out all this information.

04:45.850 --> 04:49.860
So that's it for this video we've created or films table.

04:50.050 --> 04:52.790
Now we need to move on to our customers table.
