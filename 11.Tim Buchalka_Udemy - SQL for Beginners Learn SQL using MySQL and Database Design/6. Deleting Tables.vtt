A case or in this video we're going to look at how we can delete tables from a database.

00:10.220 --> 00:15.860
So I've actually created a new database called example and I'm using that database and I've created

00:15.950 --> 00:21.710
this test table with free columns just for this video just so I can do the two.

00:22.010 --> 00:24.150
So here I selected stuff from test.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.110
And you can see the free columns here.

00:26.150 --> 00:36.050
Id name and age and if I run show tables it's just going to show you the tables in the example database.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.120
I've just one table of code test.

00:39.120 --> 00:47.900
So now let's delete this table test from the example database so to delete tables I simply just need

00:47.900 --> 00:52.670
to type drop table followed by the table name.

00:52.670 --> 00:57.090
So in this case it's a test and then I just need to run that.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.430
So drop table for it by the table name.

01:00.510 --> 01:09.070
Now if I select start from test I get this error saying table example test doesn't exist.

01:09.350 --> 01:14.370
And if I show the tables in the example database is now blank.

01:14.810 --> 01:19.620
There's no test table in the example database anymore.

01:20.060 --> 01:23.190
So that's how we remove all the league tables from a database.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.720
We'd simply type drop table followed by the table name.
