A case in this video we're going to look at how we can rename a column using the Otar table command.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.560
So you can see here.

00:14.590 --> 00:23.030
I've already written out the fuel for how we can rename a column so we can type out a table followed

00:23.040 --> 00:24.290
by the table name.

00:24.370 --> 00:26.480
So the table which the column is in.

00:26.800 --> 00:32.130
And then we type change and then we followed up with the old column name.

00:32.170 --> 00:36.670
So the column name that it currently is in back ticks.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.000
So these are back ticks.

00:38.050 --> 00:39.940
No single quotes.

00:39.940 --> 00:44.890
And then we follow that with the new column name so the column name that we want to change it to.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.820
Which is also mbak ticks.

00:47.170 --> 00:50.920
And then we end with the column data type.

00:50.950 --> 00:55.300
So let's look at an example of changing columns name.

00:55.330 --> 01:02.250
So here we have the table and we have the ID and name the species and the owner ID columns.

01:02.620 --> 01:09.440
And now let's just run select stuff from Pass which is going to retrieve all the columns in the table.

01:09.790 --> 01:12.250
And you can see we have all four columns again.

01:12.670 --> 01:18.120
So as an example Let's rename the species column to a different name.

01:18.430 --> 01:26.920
So to do that we can go in here and go to the next line and we can type out table followed by the table

01:26.920 --> 01:27.350
name.

01:27.370 --> 01:32.470
So you pass and then type change and then the back tick.

01:32.470 --> 01:37.240
So on a Mac the back tick is next to the one above the tab key.

01:37.240 --> 01:45.640
So we can do back tick old column name which is species followed by another tactic and then a space

01:45.760 --> 01:47.480
and then a new column name.

01:47.530 --> 01:54.010
So you can call it whatever you like but I'm just going to call it animal underscore type.

01:54.010 --> 02:02.140
For example follow up with another tactic and then we got to follow up with the data type which is a

02:02.140 --> 02:12.170
VAR and then 20 and we can end that with a semi-colon and then we can run this statement and then we

02:12.170 --> 02:20.600
can run select stuff from pets again and you can see now the species column is named animal type.

02:20.690 --> 02:24.660
So this is how we rename columns in my school.

02:24.920 --> 02:36.100
And then we can change it back to species if we won by simply typing out a table pass change.

02:36.190 --> 02:46.380
And spoke directly and then back to Jack O column name which is now animal underskirt type space.

02:46.410 --> 02:56.690
But tick species tick followed by the data type which is 4 or 20.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.870
And then if we run this

03:02.120 --> 03:09.630
and select stuff from pets again you can see the column has been renamed species.

03:09.770 --> 03:13.760
So this is how we rename columns in my school.
