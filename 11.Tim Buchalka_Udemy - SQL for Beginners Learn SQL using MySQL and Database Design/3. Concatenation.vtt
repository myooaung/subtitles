00:05.160 --> 00:09.910
Okay so the first string function we're going to look at is concatenate.

00:10.020 --> 00:16.680
So first of all what does concatenate mean concatenate is when you join two or more things together

00:16.740 --> 00:20.190
into into one single thing.

00:20.190 --> 00:26.910
So in Eskew when we talk about concatenate we're talking about joining together data from multiple columns

00:27.000 --> 00:29.990
and returning it in one single column.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.470
And we do that using the concrete function.

00:33.720 --> 00:41.720
So you can see here we have select conquer and then we have a pair of brackets with two columns inside.

00:41.760 --> 00:47.730
So we have conquer open bracket column one comma column two close bracket.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.610
And that means we're concatenate in these two columns together as a new column.

00:53.610 --> 00:57.500
So as new column name from a table.

00:57.570 --> 01:04.770
So this is going to join column 1 in column 2 or the data from column 1 and column 2 and return it in

01:04.770 --> 01:06.530
one column.

01:06.570 --> 01:11.370
So let's go for an example from our cinema booking system database.

01:11.550 --> 01:19.890
We can select the first and last name from our customers table and return it as one column.

01:19.890 --> 01:26.340
So let's concatenate the first and last name columns together so he can write conquer open up their

01:26.340 --> 01:30.320
brackets and within the brackets we can write our column names.

01:31.050 --> 01:35.270
So the first one is first name comma last name.

01:37.320 --> 01:41.340
And then we can set a new column name.

01:41.340 --> 01:48.330
So this is like setting column aliases so we can say as full name as it will be returning their first

01:48.330 --> 01:49.010
and last name.

01:49.020 --> 01:59.220
We can call the new column full name from customers and we have a semicolon and then we can run this

01:59.310 --> 02:01.260
Eskew or query and see what we get.

02:02.100 --> 02:08.280
So you can see here is returned one column called full name but it's join the data from the first name

02:08.280 --> 02:10.080
and the last thing columns.

02:10.230 --> 02:14.980
So you can see we've got Theresa which is first name and and Davis last name.

02:15.240 --> 02:22.740
Jerry Martin John Smith Martin Watkins Emma Watson etc. etc. So it's concatenated the data from two

02:22.740 --> 02:26.100
columns and then turned it as a single column.

02:26.100 --> 02:31.590
Now you can probably also see that there is a slight problem with the data that this returns in that

02:31.590 --> 02:35.920
there is no space between the first name and the last name.

02:35.940 --> 02:41.040
So it's literally returned first name last name no space.

02:41.040 --> 02:46.610
So we need to know how we can add a space between columns when we can Cattani.

02:47.190 --> 02:55.830
And it's quite simple if we just copy and paste this query because it's not going to change much.

02:55.890 --> 03:03.420
We can go into our brackets and between the first name and the last name we can add another comma and

03:03.420 --> 03:09.350
then between these two commas we can actually had a space by putting double brackets.

03:09.480 --> 03:17.720
Space double brackets and what's happening here is is actually concatenate being three strings though.

03:17.820 --> 03:24.850
So the first string is first name which is gonna be concatenated with this space which is then going

03:24.850 --> 03:28.260
to be concatenated with this lasting column.

03:28.260 --> 03:30.330
So let's run this

03:33.800 --> 03:35.210
and you can see that's much better.

03:35.210 --> 03:39.690
We've now got a space between our first name and our last name.

03:39.830 --> 03:43.990
So there's no limit to the number of things the number of strings you can Courtenay.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.930
You can do two three four etc..

03:47.360 --> 03:53.830
So let's look can an example where we return three columns of data in one single column.

03:54.320 --> 04:01.480
So let's copy and paste our query again the one with the space

04:04.210 --> 04:13.310
and now let's also return the email column but let's put a space between the last name and the email

04:14.380 --> 04:16.630
so it so is readable.

04:16.630 --> 04:21.460
Now we want to return e-mail columns so you can see here we're actually concatenate in five strings

04:21.460 --> 04:31.510
together three rows of data or three columns of data plus two spaces and you can see here it's returned

04:31.530 --> 04:34.610
Theresa Davis Plus her email address.

04:34.690 --> 04:41.090
Jerry Martin plus his e-mail address and so on and between the double quotes we can actually pull any

04:41.090 --> 04:50.930
string we like so if we come and do you one final example let's copy and paste our last query and we

04:50.930 --> 04:52.940
can actually put whatever we like here.

04:52.970 --> 04:56.890
So let's try something a bit more complicated.

04:57.020 --> 05:04.800
Let's type this is Space comma first name.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.750
So the first name column comma last name.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.160
Actually we want a space between the first and last name

05:17.390 --> 05:21.430
and then in this space here.

05:21.440 --> 05:26.510
Let's type apostrophe airspace e-mail.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.870
Colon space.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.170
Email.

05:30.170 --> 05:33.550
So let's see what this returns.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.960
And you can see it is return.

05:35.960 --> 05:46.100
This is first name space last names email followed by the email and you can see our column name is full

05:46.100 --> 05:50.560
name which isn't a good description of the column data.

05:50.570 --> 05:55.980
So let's just put customers e-mail.

05:56.360 --> 06:03.650
Run that query again and you can see now we have a column return to customers email and the data says

06:03.650 --> 06:07.830
this is customers email followed by the email address.

06:09.080 --> 06:13.340
And one final thing if we don't have the column name alias.

06:13.340 --> 06:21.080
So we just say select conquer first name last name from customers.

06:21.080 --> 06:26.300
You can see the column name returned is actually conquer first name last name.

06:26.300 --> 06:30.220
So it returns this part as the column name.

06:30.380 --> 06:37.490
So it's not mandatory to put as full name or to stay a column name alias but obviously it makes much

06:37.490 --> 06:42.860
more sense to do so you get a much better column name makes more sense.

06:42.950 --> 06:46.760
So that's it for concatenate ing data in askew 0.
