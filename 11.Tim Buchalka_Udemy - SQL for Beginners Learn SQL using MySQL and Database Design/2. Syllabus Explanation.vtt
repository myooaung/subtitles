00:05.180 --> 00:10.470
In this video and to go over the syllabus section by section so you can see what you're going to learn

00:10.470 --> 00:12.170
in this course.

00:12.170 --> 00:18.240
So in section 2 the section following this video you're going to learn about databases as you know and

00:18.260 --> 00:24.120
miss out and the differences between them were run through the installation and set up all of my school

00:24.150 --> 00:29.970
and my school work bench and then in the final video of this section you're going to be writing your

00:29.970 --> 00:36.710
first Escudo queries and then in section 3 we'll have a section on data definition language so you will

00:36.710 --> 00:39.440
be learning about primary and foreign keys.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.280
You'll be learning how to create modify and delete tables within a database.

00:44.310 --> 00:50.760
We'll be doing this by creating a database for a coffee store which we use in feature sections and then

00:50.760 --> 00:54.170
in Section 4 we'll learn about data manipulation language.

00:54.180 --> 00:59.610
So this is how to insert update and delete data from tables within the database.

00:59.620 --> 01:06.650
Are we doing this by inserting data into our coffee store database and then in section 5 we'll learn

01:06.660 --> 01:11.040
how to retrieve data from a table using select statements.

01:11.040 --> 01:17.170
We'll also learn about where clauses to filter our data and also learn how to order our data.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.290
We'll be learning quite a lot more in this section.

01:19.290 --> 01:20.550
This is quite a big section.

01:20.580 --> 01:27.030
We're going to learn a lot of useful escrowed queries and in section 6 We're going to learn how to retrieve

01:27.030 --> 01:29.470
data from more than one table.

01:29.520 --> 01:34.800
So we're going to learn about how to use Table joins and we'll also learn about the different types

01:34.800 --> 01:39.750
of JOINs within my school and then Section 7 will be slightly different.

01:39.750 --> 01:43.270
This is going to be a section where we'll learn about database design.

01:43.410 --> 01:49.230
So we're going to learn about concepts in database design such as normalization relationships between

01:49.230 --> 01:55.980
tables and constraints that we can place on our tables and I decided to put this section in later in

01:55.980 --> 01:58.200
the course rather than before.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.040
We created a database for our coffee so.

02:01.340 --> 02:03.550
And this is because it's quite a lot of theory.

02:03.570 --> 02:05.110
Caudillo the concepts.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.850
So we're not going to be writing Escudo queries in this section.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.190
We're just going to be learning about concepts in database design.

02:12.540 --> 02:18.660
And I didn't want a whole section on just learning about concepts and lots of information on database

02:18.660 --> 02:19.130
design.

02:19.170 --> 02:24.930
At the beginning of the course I really wanted to get started with writing escrow queries creating tables

02:24.930 --> 02:25.800
straight away.

02:26.010 --> 02:29.530
So I decided to put this section later in the course.

02:29.970 --> 02:35.130
So in Section 8 we're going to be taking what we learnt in the previous section on database design and

02:35.130 --> 02:39.260
we're going to be creating a database for a system online booking system.

02:39.420 --> 02:45.420
So this database is going to be quite a lot more complex than our coffee store database and we're going

02:45.420 --> 02:47.550
to go through it step by step.

02:47.880 --> 02:54.090
And then the final video in this section we're going to be inserting data into our cinema online booking

02:54.090 --> 03:01.800
system database and then we're going to use this database in future sections and then in section 9 we're

03:01.800 --> 03:04.480
going to learn about aggregate functions in Escudo.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.490
We're going to learn what they are and how to use them.

03:07.560 --> 03:13.230
We're going to learn how we can group data by column and then we're also going to learn about the having

03:13.230 --> 03:14.450
close.

03:14.460 --> 03:18.610
So this is a really useful section for data analysis.

03:18.630 --> 03:24.630
So in Section 10 we're going to be learning about some queries in as well and how they work on the different

03:24.630 --> 03:26.380
types of queries within us.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.730
So you go through examples of non correlated sub queries and then we'll go through some examples of

03:32.730 --> 03:34.690
correlated sub queries.

03:35.190 --> 03:37.870
So that's everything we're going to learn in this course.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.080
Let's get started in the next video.
