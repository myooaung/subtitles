00:04.900 --> 00:08.310
A case of let's have a look at the solutions to exercise free.

00:08.650 --> 00:11.470
So the first question was from the customer table.

00:11.470 --> 00:16.560
Select Distinct last names and order them alphabetically from A to Z.

00:17.230 --> 00:20.200
So here we can select distinct

00:23.210 --> 00:24.080
last name

00:26.780 --> 00:31.200
from customers and then we need to order a set.

00:31.210 --> 00:44.540
So we need to order by last name and then we need to run this statement and you can see it's only rich

00:44.780 --> 00:47.920
and distinct last names and has ordered them from me to that.

00:48.100 --> 00:54.110
So if you remember we had lots of bloops normally in our customer table but because we've only selected

00:54.110 --> 00:57.250
distinct last names it's only returned one Bluth.

00:57.740 --> 01:04.630
OK and then the second question is saying from the Orders table select the first three orders placed

01:04.630 --> 01:05.550
by customer.

01:05.550 --> 01:09.340
We've already won in February 2017.

01:09.340 --> 01:13.060
So this is a little bit complicated actually.

01:13.060 --> 01:26.350
So we need to select staw from orders and we need it only in February 2017 so we need to say where all

01:26.350 --> 01:29.950
the time is between

01:31.870 --> 01:34.860
2017 to 1

01:37.430 --> 01:38.480
and

01:41.520 --> 01:45.760
2017 to 28

01:49.270 --> 01:56.410
and then we need to know the where clause saying and customer id equal to 1.

01:56.470 --> 02:03.310
So we need to say Customer ID equal to 1.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.610
Then we also need to order this by

02:09.790 --> 02:17.770
order time so that we're getting the first order placed first and then second and so on and we need

02:17.770 --> 02:20.540
to do that in ascending order.

02:21.220 --> 02:29.020
And then finally we need to type limits 3 so we're only getting the first three orders or the first

02:29.020 --> 02:32.300
free rows returned by this select statement.

02:32.860 --> 02:33.900
Let's run now.

02:34.490 --> 02:42.400
And you can see we have the customer ID won his order on the 1st of February the 7th of February is

02:42.400 --> 02:43.640
his next order.

02:43.780 --> 02:47.140
And then the 13th of February is his third order.

02:47.290 --> 02:52.840
So if you got that first time well done because that was a little bit more complicated than the last

02:52.840 --> 02:54.230
question.

02:54.250 --> 02:58.980
So the final question is asking us to select the name price and coffee origin from the products table

02:59.280 --> 03:03.590
but to rename the price column to retail price in the results.

03:04.090 --> 03:15.980
So lets select name price and coffee origin for on products and then to rename the price column.

03:16.240 --> 03:26.440
We just come in here and we say as the new name are as Rito price and then we just need to run up and

03:26.440 --> 03:34.350
you can see here we now have to name the retail price and the coffee origin from the products table.

03:34.690 --> 03:36.540
Okay so that's it for this video.

03:36.540 --> 03:43.150
If you have any questions on any of these exercises please let me know in Q&amp;A section but for now let's

03:43.150 --> 03:44.420
move on to the next video.
