00:05.540 --> 00:11.080
A case and others create the final table and our database the reserved seat table.

00:12.090 --> 00:20.430
So the reserved seat table contains information about each booking which C has been reserved for which

00:20.580 --> 00:24.340
particular screening by which particular customer.

00:24.590 --> 00:31.990
So we have free fields in our reserve see table we have the ID field which is the primary key and and

00:32.040 --> 00:33.600
is Autor incrementing.

00:33.930 --> 00:39.910
Then we have the booking ID which is also an int and its foreign key to the bookings table.

00:40.380 --> 00:47.190
And then we have a CTD which is also an end and it's a foreign key to the ID field in the seats table.

00:47.850 --> 00:53.220
And you can see from the second picture here that we have a one to many relationship between the bookings

00:53.220 --> 00:55.320
table and the reserved seat table.

00:55.500 --> 01:03.660
So one booking by a customer can reserve many seats but only one reserved seat ID can be associated

01:04.200 --> 01:05.810
with one booking.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.700
And there's also a one to many relationship between the seats table and the reserved seat table.

01:12.030 --> 01:18.360
So a particular seat can be Reserve many times depending on the screening but only one reserved seat

01:18.420 --> 01:22.200
ID can be associated with one seat.

01:22.800 --> 01:27.670
And it looks like on the face of it that we don't have enough information on our reserved seat table

01:28.140 --> 01:32.740
we have a reserve see ID but then we only have a c ID and a booking ID.

01:32.820 --> 01:35.380
We don't have customer id field.

01:35.610 --> 01:42.780
So how do we know which customers Reserve which see while Fruita booking ID we can make a link between

01:42.780 --> 01:48.710
the reserved seat table and the bookings table and in the bookings table we then have the customer ID

01:49.290 --> 01:55.470
so we can get all the customer information for each particular reserved seat.

01:55.740 --> 02:02.960
So we will be able to know which customers to which seat for which booking and for which room out.

02:02.970 --> 02:07.410
So in my school work bench and create a final table with a reserved seat table

02:11.920 --> 02:21.430
so we need to type create table reserved underscore seats open air pair brackets with the semi-colon

02:21.730 --> 02:25.430
and within our brackets we need to type or columns.

02:25.450 --> 02:34.480
So the first column like always is ID column which is in and saw a primary key and it also auto increments

02:37.570 --> 02:42.360
and then the next column Mazhar booking ID which is going to be a foreign key.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.510
So its an end.

02:43.570 --> 02:47.570
And we also have to not know constraints on our booking ID.

02:47.830 --> 02:51.070
So the final call home so see ID column.

02:51.190 --> 02:55.700
This was also an int and it was not as well had the not no constraint.

02:56.230 --> 02:59.100
So now we just need to define our foreign keys.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.170
So we have two foreign keys in this table.

03:01.180 --> 03:13.840
So the first one is foreign key booking ID and this is referencing the booking table with the bookings

03:13.840 --> 03:25.560
table and the ID column within the bookings table and then the second foreign key is for the seat ID.

03:26.710 --> 03:33.660
And this is referencing the seats table and the ID field within the seats table.

03:34.390 --> 03:42.280
So now we have our create table queries set up we can run up and then we can type show tables

03:45.350 --> 03:51.350
and you can see we now have our reserved seat table here and we have all seven tables created in our

03:51.350 --> 03:53.030
database.

03:53.210 --> 04:03.870
We can now just type describe it see just to see that everything is OK and you can see here we have

04:03.870 --> 04:11.780
all three columns our id our booking ID and all study the data type none of them allow no values.

04:11.810 --> 04:14.080
We have our primary key which is already filled.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.190
Then we have our two foreign keys.

04:16.190 --> 04:22.930
We've set no default values for any of the columns and the ID field is also incrementing.

04:23.340 --> 04:29.540
OK so now that we've created all the tables in our system our booking system database we now need to

04:29.570 --> 04:33.170
insert some data into our tables.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.190
So let's see that in the next video.
