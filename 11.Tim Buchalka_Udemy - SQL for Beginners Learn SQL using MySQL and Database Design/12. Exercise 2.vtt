AKCA Welcome to the second exercise in this section.

00:08.870 --> 00:12.010
Again we have three questions for you to answer.

00:12.230 --> 00:13.670
So let's take a look.

00:13.760 --> 00:18.500
The first question is saying from the Products table select the name and price of all products with

00:18.500 --> 00:27.290
a coffee origin equal to Colombia or Indonesia and then ordered by name from 8 to Zed and then the second

00:27.290 --> 00:29.760
question is saying from the Orders table.

00:29.900 --> 00:38.570
Select all the orders from February 2017 for customers with IDs of two four six or eight.

00:38.690 --> 00:42.930
And then finally the third question is saying from the Customers table.

00:43.040 --> 00:49.780
Select the first name and phone number of all customers whose last name contains the pattern.

00:50.180 --> 00:54.740
So once you've completed all three questions I'll see you in the next video for the solutions.

00:54.740 --> 00:55.240
Thank you.
