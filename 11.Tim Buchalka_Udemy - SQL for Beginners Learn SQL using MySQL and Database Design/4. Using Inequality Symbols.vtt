00:05.160 --> 00:10.760
A case in it video we look at where columns are equal to a certain body in this video.

00:10.760 --> 00:18.360
We're going to be looking at inequality symbols say where a column is greater than or less than a certain

00:18.720 --> 00:20.410
value.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.490
So we have all full inequality symbols here.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.940
We have a greater than symbol and then we have greater than or equal to.

00:29.370 --> 00:33.460
So it's a greater than sign followed by an equal sign.

00:33.500 --> 00:40.440
We have less than sign and then we have our less than or equal to sign which is a less than sign followed

00:40.440 --> 00:43.300
by the coup sign.

00:43.300 --> 00:47.500
So now let's use these inequality symbols in a WHERE clause.

00:47.880 --> 00:56.010
So I selected stuff from the table again and I've got my seven results and here I've got a statement

00:56.010 --> 01:01.930
where the where clause which is selecting start from products where price is equal to three.

01:01.950 --> 01:07.590
So this is just going to return every row where the price column is equal to free.

01:07.680 --> 01:17.670
But let's change this equal sign to greater than or equal to that statement.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.670
And you can see it's return just six rows now.

01:20.940 --> 01:27.510
So we have every single row returned whether the price is equal to free or grace free.

01:27.510 --> 01:32.280
So we got three 3.5 three point two five.

01:32.310 --> 01:39.270
So this is returning rows where a column is equal to or greater than a certain value.

01:39.720 --> 01:45.630
So now let's simply change this to greater than and see the difference.

01:45.630 --> 01:48.560
And you can see now it's return just for ROIs.

01:48.560 --> 01:54.420
It's got rid of the rows where the price was equal to free and it's just return the rows which are greater

01:54.420 --> 01:56.080
than 3.00.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.950
So we got 3.5 three point two five.

01:59.310 --> 02:04.180
So that's the greater than and greater than or equal to symbol's looked.

02:04.410 --> 02:07.810
Now let's take a look at that less than less than or equal to.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.180
So let's change this to where price is less than three

02:15.620 --> 02:21.870
and you can see it just returns the row for our espresso where the price was equal to 2.5 0.

02:22.370 --> 02:28.550
And then we can simply guess whether price is less than or equal to free by adding an equal sign off

02:28.570 --> 02:30.500
to the less than sign.

02:31.070 --> 02:37.760
And you can see returns free rose we have our espresso macchiato and our food to coffee where the price

02:37.760 --> 02:41.580
column is equal to three or less.

02:41.580 --> 02:47.590
So that's pretty much it for using an equality symbols in a way across are just today only really makes

02:47.590 --> 02:54.830
sense to use inequality symbols when you're dealing with numeric columns like a Price column or even

02:54.830 --> 02:56.480
an ID column.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.440
It doesn't really make sense to use inequality symbols when you're dealing with strings.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.420
So that's it for this video.
