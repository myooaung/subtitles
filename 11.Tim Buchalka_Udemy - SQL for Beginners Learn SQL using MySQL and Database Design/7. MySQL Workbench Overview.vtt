WEBVTT

00:05.390 --> 00:07.240
OK so welcome back.

00:07.310 --> 00:13.790
So now that we've been to my school workbench Let's have a look at what my school work bench actually

00:13.790 --> 00:16.240
is and how are we going to be using it.

00:16.670 --> 00:23.450
So my school work Benge is an integrated development environment for the Mariscal database system.

00:23.450 --> 00:30.550
This means that it's a visual tool for database design databases administration and school development.

00:30.590 --> 00:36.670
So we're going to be writing all escrowed code and queries in my ask you work.

00:37.130 --> 00:43.690
Now we could use the command line to do this but my school work bench gives us a nice visual too and

00:43.700 --> 00:48.320
it's a much more and of way to write our escrow queries.

00:48.830 --> 00:56.090
So now that we know what my score workbench is let's take a quick tour of my school work bench before

00:56.090 --> 01:00.940
we start writing our first school queries in the next lesson.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.270
So if you haven't already.

01:02.270 --> 01:07.820
The first thing I want you to do is open my school work bench so you can see this page.

01:08.190 --> 01:12.290
And once you've done that we can click into dev use.

01:12.830 --> 01:20.920
Now once you click into dev visa you're going to see page appear like this on a screen appear like this.

01:21.390 --> 01:25.940
And this is where we're going to be spending the majority of our time in this course.

01:25.940 --> 01:30.160
As you can see there's a lot of features in my school work bench.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.740
You can see we have a lot of links on the left hand side to the left side menu.

01:34.970 --> 01:42.320
We also have a ribbon at the top here and we have this sort of Notepad page open here called query one

01:42.350 --> 01:51.260
query one tab and we also have another ribbon along the top here with even more functions now these

01:51.260 --> 01:56.990
videos just can be a quick tour of my school work bench as we don't need to know every single Ditto

01:56.990 --> 02:00.410
about my school work bench right now.

02:01.070 --> 02:06.070
So like I said we're going to be using my school work bench to write all our Resco queries.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.080
I'm going to be doing that here.

02:08.390 --> 02:15.330
So this is like a notepad page and this is where we can actually come in and start writing.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.460
Scroll.

02:16.730 --> 02:23.820
So right a couple of queries now don't worry if you don't understand this we're going to be going through

02:23.840 --> 02:26.070
this later on in the course.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.860
But this is what an escrow query generally looks like.

02:30.950 --> 02:37.680
So we have select store from a table and then we have select store from another table to type 1 and

02:37.750 --> 02:38.560
2.

02:39.110 --> 02:43.070
And then each escrowed query ends in a semi-colon.

02:43.310 --> 02:49.290
So this semi-colon is telling my Escudo that the query has ended.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.740
So my.

02:51.470 --> 02:58.700
That the query starts here with this selects and finishes with this semi-colon and then it knows that

02:58.700 --> 03:07.680
the second query here starts it after the semi-colon and runs to the next semi-colon which is here.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.620
So my Schiro knows that these are two distinct escrowed queries because of the semi-colons.

03:13.970 --> 03:17.540
So every Escudo query ends in a semi-colon.

03:18.110 --> 03:24.590
So now that we've written some Eskimo queries we need to know how to run them in Workbench and to do

03:24.590 --> 03:29.410
that we need to go to this top ribbon here which is in query top.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.100
And if we hover over each of the icons we can actually see what they do.

03:34.130 --> 03:41.470
It gives a brief description so we can see that this one is to open a script file in this editor.

03:41.720 --> 03:48.020
So if you have already written a script and saved it's your computer you can open it using this like

03:48.020 --> 03:55.670
on here and if you need to save a script for later use then you can use this icon here.

03:55.850 --> 03:58.820
So this is the same script that you've already written.

03:59.150 --> 04:04.880
So if you want to save this script for example with these two queries you can click on this button save

04:04.880 --> 04:07.670
it to your PC and then open it later.

04:07.670 --> 04:13.790
Using this first icon but for running queries where are you interested in these next four icons.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.540
So these free lightning bolts and this hands with the red backgrounds.

04:19.640 --> 04:26.930
So these free lightning bolts for running queries and then this red hand is for stopping a query which

04:26.930 --> 04:28.880
is in progress.

04:28.940 --> 04:35.540
So if we hover over the first lightning bolt we can see it says execute the selected portion of the

04:35.540 --> 04:37.960
script or everything.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.960
If there is no selection.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.850
So by script it means whatever is written in this note pad.

04:45.090 --> 04:46.760
Block here.

04:47.060 --> 04:51.770
So it's saying if I get the description up again

04:54.420 --> 04:58.200
saying execute a selected portion of the script or everything.

04:58.220 --> 05:05.210
If there's no selection so I can select a portion of a script like this just clicking and dragging and

05:05.210 --> 05:09.260
then if I click this lightning bolt is just going to run what I've selected.

05:09.260 --> 05:15.470
So this first query if I hadn't made a selection I just had my cursor down here and click this lightning

05:15.470 --> 05:16.430
bolt.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.510
It's going to run the first query and then it's going to run the second query straight afterwards.

05:21.860 --> 05:27.950
Now the second line in both works slightly differently is going to execute the statement under the keyboard

05:27.950 --> 05:28.920
cursor.

05:29.300 --> 05:33.760
So if we had our keyboard cursor here within the first query.

05:34.050 --> 05:40.550
So it's between the start of the query here and the first semi-colon is just going to run this first

05:40.550 --> 05:43.320
period because that's the only one that's under the cursor.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.300
But if we moved the cursor point to here and click this button then it's going to run.

05:49.340 --> 05:51.220
The second query.

05:51.470 --> 05:57.080
Now this third line in both works slightly differently again is going to execute the explain command

05:57.170 --> 05:59.540
on the stateman under the cursor.

05:59.900 --> 06:06.500
So basically what that means is if we had our cars ahead to run the second query is going to run the

06:06.500 --> 06:14.150
query but it's also going to explain what it's doing behind the scenes how my row is running this query.

06:14.360 --> 06:19.570
So that can be quite useful although I tend not to use this one so much.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.370
So when I'm running queries I'm mainly going to be using these first two lightning bolts.

06:24.360 --> 06:31.730
Trust you run the query and then finally this red hand is to stop the query being executed.

06:31.970 --> 06:38.010
So if you're running a query which is retrieving thousands or tens of thousands of rows of data and

06:38.110 --> 06:43.420
taking a very long time and you want to stop the query rather then waiting for it to finish.

06:43.700 --> 06:50.650
You can click this red hands and it's going to stop the query and then the other important going along

06:50.650 --> 06:56.340
this ribbon is this icon here which says limit to 1000 rows.

06:56.350 --> 07:02.440
So again if you're retrieving data from a table which has hundreds or thousands of rows of data but

07:02.440 --> 07:04.310
you don't retrieve every.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.700
You can limit your resos to a certain number.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.490
So by default it sets a limit to 1000 rows.

07:11.560 --> 07:20.410
You can take the up and down I tried to change this to whatever Valley 150 up to 50000 rows and the

07:20.410 --> 07:27.160
benefit of using this is that obviously it's a lot quicker to run a query which is only going to retrieve

07:27.160 --> 07:30.580
1000 rows rather than 100000 rows.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.770
So that's it for this talk ribbon.

07:32.770 --> 07:35.330
Now let's actually run one of these queries.

07:35.620 --> 07:40.870
So let's run this first query here and see what happens.

07:40.900 --> 07:44.600
You can see we've got a we've got a menu pop up at the bottom here.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.610
And this is our actual output.

07:47.020 --> 07:51.910
So when you run an escrow query you're going to get action out or you're going to get some data which

07:51.910 --> 07:54.210
is output from the bottom here.

07:54.520 --> 07:58.150
So if you run a successful query you're going to get data returns.

07:58.330 --> 08:03.930
But if you run an incorrect query you're going to get an error and that's what happened in this case.

08:03.970 --> 08:11.170
You can see an error because we got a little red X here rather than the green tick and in the action

08:11.170 --> 08:14.250
output is also showing you what action was taken.

08:14.470 --> 08:17.660
So it's selected store from table 1.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.800
And we had that limit to 1000 rows which was stated here.

08:23.140 --> 08:28.330
Now don't worry again if you don't understand this action we're going to be going for you selecting

08:28.330 --> 08:33.810
data from tables later on in this course in in really much more detail.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.070
So don't worry about that for now.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.060
And we also get this response so this Erica.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.260
So he's telling us why it failed.

08:41.590 --> 08:46.570
And again don't worry if you don't understand this is saying no database selected.

08:46.840 --> 08:51.460
So it wasn't able to run this query correctly.

08:51.460 --> 08:57.110
So now we know how to run our escrow queries we know how to get some output from the bottom here.

08:57.340 --> 09:01.000
Let's take a look at this left hand side.

09:01.210 --> 09:08.320
So I'm just going to briefly go for the left hand side as a lot of it is not super useful for this course

09:08.320 --> 09:10.240
for a beginners course.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.770
So let's quickly go through it.

09:11.770 --> 09:16.180
So under this management tab we have this service status.

09:16.450 --> 09:23.560
So if we DoubleClick or not we get a new tab opened which is code administration service status and

09:23.560 --> 09:29.960
then we have some stats on our server so we can see here that is running our server is running.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.820
You can see the load on the server.

09:31.870 --> 09:36.380
You can see the number of connections and you can see traffic and efficiency.

09:36.520 --> 09:42.190
So again this isn't super useful information for this course but it's good to know is that if you're

09:42.190 --> 09:48.620
having issues with my school workbench and then the next type is client connections.

09:48.670 --> 09:56.140
So if we double click on that we can see more detail on which clients are connecting to our server and

09:56.140 --> 10:01.090
then the final tab would look at the management list as users and privileges.

10:01.390 --> 10:08.320
And this is where we can see what users have access to our server to a go server and we can also set

10:08.320 --> 10:09.580
privileges.

10:09.820 --> 10:14.830
So we're actually going to be going through this type in more detail in the next video where we have

10:14.830 --> 10:18.980
to set privileges to our dev user.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.730
And then I want to go down to this performance.

10:23.740 --> 10:31.690
So the performance dashboard and this shows us lots of performance stats on our network on my skew and

10:31.690 --> 10:33.510
something code in IDB.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.410
But again we don't really need to use this.

10:36.580 --> 10:40.550
It's just good to know is that if we're having issues with my skew well.

10:41.350 --> 10:48.050
But the most important thing on this left hand side is actually under the scheme as a database schema

10:48.050 --> 10:55.580
is basically a database diagram showing us what tables are in our database and it's showing us relationships

10:55.580 --> 10:58.610
and other information within our database.

10:58.670 --> 11:04.460
So you can see here there's a list of databases you can tell that databases because of this symbol.

11:04.590 --> 11:12.850
So stacked cylinder that's the symbol for a database and you can see then names of the database here.

11:13.010 --> 11:17.990
So you won't have seen him our booking system or a coffee store database yet because we're actually

11:17.990 --> 11:25.230
going to be creating both of these databases in the course so you'll have a few others listed are things

11:25.280 --> 11:26.830
you have for listed.

11:27.260 --> 11:35.270
But if you go to this dropdown triangle here and click on that you can see within the coffee store database

11:35.570 --> 11:42.670
we have tables and we have other objects called views stored procedures and functions.

11:43.010 --> 11:47.930
And then you can see we have a drop down by the tables so we can click on that and you can see what

11:47.930 --> 11:51.680
tables are within the coffee store database.

11:52.010 --> 11:58.610
And then if you click on customers table you can see even more information so you can see here we have

11:58.610 --> 12:04.160
let's say winning customers and then we also have the columns within the customers table.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.980
So you can see the customers table has five columns within it and then we also have some more information

12:09.980 --> 12:10.360
here.

12:10.360 --> 12:16.370
But again we're going to be going through this later in the course so don't worry if this looks like

12:16.610 --> 12:17.240
gobbledygook.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.980
For now we'll be exploring that later in the course.

12:22.010 --> 12:27.410
You can also click on the other tables to find out information about them as well.

12:27.500 --> 12:34.740
So this database schema is very useful for seeing what tables you've created with databases you've created.

12:35.390 --> 12:38.680
And more information on the tables here.

12:38.690 --> 12:42.050
So that's pretty much it for all my school work bench tool.

12:42.050 --> 12:47.190
Again the most important thing is to know that we have the right queries here.

12:47.450 --> 12:54.520
We can run them using this ribbon at the top here and we get our output at the bottom here.

12:55.010 --> 12:55.820
It's also good.

12:55.850 --> 13:02.750
If you can have a look through the database is that can be quite interesting and useful but most of

13:02.750 --> 13:08.270
the links on the management instance performance just aren't very useful for now.

13:08.270 --> 13:13.250
So let's move on to the next video and start writing our first Escudo queries.
