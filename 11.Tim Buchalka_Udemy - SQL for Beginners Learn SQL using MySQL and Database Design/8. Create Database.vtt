00:05.710 --> 00:12.030
A case or another we've been told my school and my school work Benge Let's start typing off first escrowed

00:12.070 --> 00:13.210
queries.

00:13.720 --> 00:18.440
So the first thing we want to do is we actually want to go into a root user.

00:20.010 --> 00:27.400
And we one on the left hand side we want to go to users on Privileges and we want to select a dev user

00:27.400 --> 00:30.130
which we'll be using for the rest of the course.

00:30.330 --> 00:37.860
We want to go to administrative roles and you can see everything's on tigs and we want to grunt's the

00:37.980 --> 00:42.760
views views the role of DVA which is the same as the user.

00:42.820 --> 00:48.730
So we want to take this first box here and now the dev user is going to have all the same rights as

00:48.730 --> 00:49.760
the root user.

00:50.020 --> 00:54.540
So he's going to be out to create databases and tables and delete stuff.

00:54.550 --> 00:56.530
So that's what we want to do.

00:56.620 --> 01:06.240
And then we want to click apply and then we can exit out of our root user and we can go to our user

01:07.030 --> 01:11.950
and now we can start typing our first escrowed statements.

01:12.040 --> 01:20.650
So the first scroll statement that we want to type is show databases and this is going to show us all

01:20.650 --> 01:23.530
the databases we have created.

01:23.530 --> 01:29.470
So you can see here we have four databases which are automatically created when you install my school

01:30.140 --> 01:32.660
and none of them are very useful.

01:32.950 --> 01:40.810
So what we want to do is we want to create our own database and to do that we need to create a database

01:41.500 --> 01:43.670
followed by the database name.

01:43.690 --> 01:46.790
So for this video we're just going to cool that test.

01:46.840 --> 01:53.730
So a test database and let's run that statement and you can see how successful.

01:54.040 --> 02:01.210
So let's show database's again and you can see now we have this test database at the bottom here.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.760
So that's how we create databases.

02:03.940 --> 02:13.480
And now we want to go into our test database and to do that we need to use test and run.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.640
And now we're actually inside our test database.

02:17.710 --> 02:24.950
So now let's right show tables and this will show all the tables within our test database

02:27.700 --> 02:32.820
and here you can see in the results it says tables in test and it's blank.

02:32.860 --> 02:37.650
And that's because we haven't created any tables yet within our test database.

02:37.780 --> 02:39.840
We're not going to do that for now.

02:40.450 --> 02:48.010
So the final query we want to run in this video and this introduction video is how to delete databases

02:48.760 --> 02:54.580
and to do that we type drop database followed by the database name.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.680
Celestially our test database and run that statement

03:01.500 --> 03:04.510
and you can see down here that it runs successfully.

03:04.510 --> 03:11.670
So now let's show you databases again and you can see we're back to just having all four databases from

03:11.670 --> 03:12.700
before.

03:13.230 --> 03:18.750
OK so that's it for this video in the next section we're going to create a new database and we're going

03:18.750 --> 03:21.400
to be creating our first tables as well.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.310
So you see you in the next section.
