00:04.940 --> 00:11.860
A case in this video we're going to be looking at how we can use like statement in a WHERE clause.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.840
So you use the word like statement for pattern matching.

00:15.840 --> 00:20.020
So I think the easiest way to explain this is through in example.

00:20.370 --> 00:26.400
So for example I've selected stuff from customers and just returned all the rows of data in the table

00:26.520 --> 00:27.680
in the Customer table.

00:28.050 --> 00:35.880
But let's try and find just the customers who have a last name beginning with W and we can do this using

00:36.450 --> 00:43.540
the like keyword search in our select store from customers query on the next line.

00:43.610 --> 00:53.780
Let's type where last name and then use the keyword like say where last name is like.

00:53.780 --> 00:59.100
And then open a pair of single quotes and within a single page type w because we want the last name

00:59.100 --> 01:06.930
to begin with W and follow that with a percentage sign and what the percentage sign is doing is it saying

01:06.930 --> 01:15.360
return any last names that start with Toby and then are followed by any number of characters.

01:15.660 --> 01:21.270
So let's see what if we run this query what it returns and we see returns.

01:21.450 --> 01:25.500
All our customers have a last name that begins with W.

01:25.800 --> 01:32.940
So we have West Williams and Watkin's say the percentage sign is looking for any number of characters

01:33.020 --> 01:35.580
of the doubly bad.

01:35.580 --> 01:39.900
We don't have to only use one percent sign in or like statements.

01:40.140 --> 01:50.360
We can change this to an hour and then have a percentage sign before the next run and see what it returns.

01:50.380 --> 01:58.390
So you can see it's return quite a rise and in fact it's returned every last name that has an issue

01:58.690 --> 01:59.230
in it.

01:59.380 --> 02:05.260
So it looks for any number of characters before the show and he's looking for any number of characters

02:05.320 --> 02:06.340
after the show.

02:06.580 --> 02:13.690
So as long as the last name has an eye in it then it's going to be returned in this statement here.

02:14.020 --> 02:19.660
And you can see up here I've written the percentage sign is looking for any number of characters but

02:19.660 --> 02:24.520
we can also use and underscore and that's just looking for one character.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.820
So let's look at the difference between the percentage sign and the underscore in a like statement with

02:29.880 --> 02:30.940
an example.

02:31.090 --> 02:39.990
So that store from customers where first name is like potentiates sign or percentage sign.

02:40.210 --> 02:48.650
So this should return any customer that has eye in their first name and you can see its returns.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.650
John Jole and Ghareeb George George John and tell me so they all have in their first name.

02:55.810 --> 02:59.190
So let's change the percent you sign now to an underscore.

02:59.830 --> 03:07.630
On either side of the eye and run that statement again you can see it's just return gobe.

03:07.870 --> 03:11.010
And that's because he only has one character.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.790
Either side of the eye.

03:12.850 --> 03:16.900
So it's a character any character or any character.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.940
And it didn't return jauh know George because they have more than one character either side of the eye.

03:22.150 --> 03:27.970
So it didn't it didn't meet the criteria for this like statement and it's not just string columns that

03:27.970 --> 03:29.900
we can use the like statement.

03:29.950 --> 03:32.320
We can also use it on a number of columns.

03:32.650 --> 03:35.770
So let's select stuff from products and see what we got.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.580
So we have this price column which is OVC numbers.

03:39.580 --> 03:47.500
So let's try and return all the rows that have a price that begins with free so you can be free point

03:47.500 --> 03:48.760
0 0 0 free.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.310
Point anything.

03:50.770 --> 04:02.610
So to do that we can go into a select statement and type where price is like 3 percent sign.

04:02.650 --> 04:08.350
Now even though we're dealing with a number column we we she needs to sing requies when we are using

04:08.350 --> 04:10.650
that like statement.

04:10.750 --> 04:17.770
So let's run up and you can see it's only returned six Fridays so it's got rid of espresso which was

04:17.940 --> 04:26.440
the one in the price 2.5 but has returned 3.00 3.5 three point to five.

04:26.800 --> 04:33.590
So that was where the price column started with a free and was followed by any number of characters

04:33.730 --> 04:36.730
free points series or three point five zero.

04:36.970 --> 04:43.600
So this is how we use like within a WHERE clause when we're trying to match patterns of data and we

04:43.600 --> 04:49.280
can use that percentage sign when we're looking for any number of characters or we can use the under

04:49.360 --> 04:51.960
school when we're just looking for one character.
