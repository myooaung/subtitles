00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
in the sector.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.550
Let's see how to con trigger our My back is a P I used to connect with our underlying

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.160
database.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.360
For this,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.580
we have to create a configuration slide.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.090
And typically the configuration flights go under resources.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.760
So SRC mean the sources someone right click and then say knew I needed finally here and I

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.470
don't see a file option.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.770
So I click on other.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.290
And then there is a dialog box under General,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.820
you can see file or you can just type your file and you can see it gets filter I see filed

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370
under general enemies.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.740
I take on next on the name of the file.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.570
You can do anything you want.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.100
I'm gonna give my back this dash conflict,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.960
examine,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.960
press,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.790
enter and go to the source section from here at the bottom pace to this.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.050
So this is basically the boilerplate code that we have to give.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.950
It contains some very generous configuration information.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.170
The only thing that were the focus is on this section over here,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.830
which is that there is a data source,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.550
which means there is a connection.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.870
Pool on the connection pool represents connection objects from this particular database the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.370
driver class Name is okay.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.390
Here are good.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.530
It's to the driver.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.350
That is fine.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.570
The Ural says Jeremy C.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.410
Colon each local and TCP that it's fine.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.240
Local hostess.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.610
Fine.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.700
Tilda slash My back is demo,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.190
but it's actually training is the name of the baby that we have the user name.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.370
We know password is secret,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.600
so this is all fine.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.350
So with this information,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.050
my birthdays will be ableto communicate to the underlying database.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.390
However,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.850
we need to give one more set off information over here.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.930
After the environments over here,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.950
we have to give something called mappers and then the list off mapper interfaces.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.950
Some aspirin Defense is an interface that maps a function to an SQL command.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.430
So I'm gonna take your mapper class equals toe cord out.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.820
Be no dart Diego Dart Customer Dio We don't have this particular interface at this point in

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.260
time,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.050
we want toe create one.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.230
Once we have this interface at the runtime,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.070
my buddies will clear an object off a dynamic class that implement this particular

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.190
interface so that we can communicate with the database at this time.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.090
We don't have this interface in the next lecture.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.770
Let's create an interface representing customer deal
