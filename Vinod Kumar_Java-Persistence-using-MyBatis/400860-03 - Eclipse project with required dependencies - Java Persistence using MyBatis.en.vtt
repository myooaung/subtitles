00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
I already opened my eclipse,

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.700
and I've created a brand new workspace called training workspace,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.950
which is on my desktop.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.740
And,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.730
as you can see here that they create a Mulan project and couple of other options.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.470
Over here.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.320
We can also go file new,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
and you would see the similar options again.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.480
I will get started with the May 1 project.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.950
May 1 Product allows us toe create a project.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.470
Add all the product dependencies,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.210
which are nothing but third party job friends.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.880
So start with will say create a simple product on skip archetypes.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.390
Election.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.550
Click on next.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.070
Give the group I D.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.960
Which is supposed to be your website in the reverse order,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.930
for example,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.720
in my case,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.700
I'm gonna give a desk.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.140
Korda be not because my website is We know Darko Artifact really would be the name that

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.680
identifies your project.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.720
Since we are here for learning my brightest,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.180
I can say here my back kiss Dutch demo.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.060
I'll select the packaging is job for no,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.210
because this is just an ordinary job,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.720
a project,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.790
not a project.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.560
You can change the oceans as and when you make some changes.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.890
Eventually I click the finish button toe,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.230
complete the project set up,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.980
and you can see that we have a brand new project which contains Ponder example.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.780
Over here it's open the same.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.750
Increase the front it a bit by using command plus on Mac and Control plus on windows,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.750
we have to adhere one section called dependencies.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.960
You can also halfway through press control space.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.530
You'll see that you get a dependencies for this project.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.970
Let's are three.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.290
Dependence is number one is the my back.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.380
This number two is the GBC implementation jobs,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.870
since we're using Hitch to as our backend database.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.300
So we're gonna add hitched to a job well over here.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.550
Number three is Lombard,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.790
which is an optional one,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.810
but it helps us simply find the entity classes.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.460
So we're gonna add the lumber job as well.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
So let's go to the main one central in a browser,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.260
open em being deposited dot com and search for my bodice press Enter.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.700
The 1st 1 that we see here is ordered,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.540
my brothers,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.400
My baddest.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.560
That's the one that we want.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.550
And let's let the latest portion,

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.470
which is three dot fight at four under May wonder than XML,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.140
so click under it and it gets copied to your clipboard.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.820
Let's come back to eclipse based it.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.750
Over here.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.920
We also want hitched to Let's go back over toe.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.800
May 1 Central search for Hitch to enter.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.770
Still it the 1st 1 which is calm their hits.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.910
Two.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.240
Database That's their website hits to rid of its dot com,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.500
and then you have the itch to here.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.280
Click on that.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.470
This time we don't want the latest one because we are connecting to a standalone Sarwar in

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.930
the Washington worked for standard.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.300
And so what is the wonder for that 197?

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.750
So make sure that you select it's not the latest one.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.850
And then again,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.160
copy the XML Come back over here based it on a tournament that we're looking for is the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.990
Lombok.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.530
So look for L om be okay press enter and the 1st 1 is all about Project Lombok.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.360
Celik that Let's get the latest version.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.420
Copy the May win dependency XML come back toe project based it That's former,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.530
This bypassing command shift f r control shift on windows and save it And as soon as you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.190
save on the right bottom corner,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.930
you may see some activities.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.740
Since I already have these dependencies in my local repository,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.650
It was quick.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.120
If I explained this May 1 dependencies over here you will see that there is my bet.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.820
Is that age to the lumber?

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.590
You can also say hits to charge.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.000
Finally,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.060
little grayed out.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.740
And that's primarily because the scope it says test on.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.400
We need to remove this because we don't want this only for testing purposes.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.750
But we also want to use it for our applications.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.840
So I'm gonna delete this by pressing commander D or control be on windows.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.380
The interline gets deleted.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.510
Save it and you can see now it is no longer great.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.480
Let's full screen this pond or XML.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.590
One more thing that we want to add in the palm of maximal is the maven compiler plugging.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.520
This is required because if you look at the project properties and go toe Java bill,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.530
but you'll see that under libraries,

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.540
it says here,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.640
Jato sc one that five.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.170
Even though we have the Wonder Aid Washington Now one thing that I can do it.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.920
I can double click this and then change this to Gela s C.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.750
Wonder eight over here and then click on finish to come out of that so we can sell this out

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.710
The problem is,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.750
.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.930
if I go back to my project Explorer over here and then right click Onda se here May 1

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.530
update project this will actually reset that.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.310
Washington wondered if I once again a white that we may have to use a May 1 compiler

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.790
plugging that ensures that the Washington remains 1.8.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.290
Even if you do anyone update.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.090
So it's a good practice to absolute at that.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.800
Do our pom XML.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.480
I'm gonna make some room here.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.790
After this abortion,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.270
I'll type your bill.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.750
You can press control space as well.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.220
On Under Bill,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.020
we have something called plug ins so you can see that dearest plug ins inside the plug ins

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.840
because it's fluid.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.840
All we have to add one plug in here.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.790
So that's the plug in on the name off.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.040
The plugging is nothing but the artifact.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.670
80 is May 1 dash compiler dash plug in,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.650
and this comes with something called Configuration.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.030
Configuration is very you mentioned.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.340
What is the source?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:57.630
Washington As unless the target washing seven type your source is 1.8 as Realize Target is

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.670
one that ate.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.430
Save it Now,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.450
If you do a May win update project by right click and say May 1 update product over here.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.950
Click on OK,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.850
it takes a minute or less,

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.820
and now you can see that it's Washington should be wondered.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.150
Eight.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.220
If I goto Project properties on,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.640
then Goto job bill,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.880
part libraries you should see now it says Choice is the one that beat,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.050
So this is a good practice to you.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.020
So always are dissection to your Palmdale XML.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.340
That's all for this lecture Syrian the next one.
