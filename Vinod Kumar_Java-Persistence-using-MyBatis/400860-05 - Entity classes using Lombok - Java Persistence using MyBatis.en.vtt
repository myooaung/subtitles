00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
in this lecture.

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.470
Let's create an interdict loss representing this entire table.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.550
Fields of the class is going to represent the columns in this particular table as well.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.240
So let me get it off this SQL script file.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.050
Come back toe our eclipse.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.830
Do not close this command from Dr Miller because it's the server.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.030
If you close this,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.260
that means that somewhere is gonna be stomped.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.880
So I'm gonna just click on this button toe,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.700
minimize that and come back toe kicks here.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.100
Notice we used John file here called Lombok John.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.430
Fine.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.080
Lumbered jar provides some annotations to our application so that we can automatically

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.450
gender constructors ghettos centers on many other violet played court that is required for

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.610
any entity class.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.820
For this to work,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.520
you have to run this jar file.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.630
So in windows,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.620
you can simply go and double click this jar.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.940
Fine.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.890
From this particular location on Mac and Linux,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.240
you have tow copy.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.110
The qualified filing and open a new terminal are probably another tab.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950
So I have your shell new tab.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.000
Andi,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.040
In this time,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.840
I'm gonna give Java miners jar and then paste this one.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.860
Like I said on windows just double click the jar file are open a command prompt.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.380
Follow the same steps as I've done over here.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.110
So when I pressed Enter,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.190
you can see that it's goingto bring up a U I.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.220
And it shows the list off all the compatible ID's I have here Eclipse that is listed

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.880
automatically if you're not seeing your eclipse over here,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.400
and that's probably because you would have kept your eclipse in a different location.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.090
First,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.980
find out where their eclipse on,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.320
then go to that location here by clicking the specify location on select either the eclipse

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.920
or the exit.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.690
Phylon Windows are eclipse that I in my file on any lawyers.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.860
You can also see that in my case,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.660
there is a small icon over here that indicates Lombok has already been applied on this.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.840
But in any case,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.650
click on this install update on that has done the job.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.640
All it has done is it has updated the clips and I and I,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.200
with an entry saying that it has to use lumber jar during compilation process.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.550
Now quit the installer.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.490
One thing that you may have to do now is you have to close eclipse and open again.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.340
Now,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.290
if you come down toe clips on under file,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.790
you can see that there is an option called Restart.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.610
Do not use this because this doesn't help.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.110
This doesn't reload the eclipse or I and I file So you basically have toe quick eclipse and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.040
are basically exit eclipse and then re open the same So I'm gonna do the same thing once

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.390
again.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.820
So open eclipse.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.450
And now it has opened.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.930
Let's go to our project.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.700
Let's get a new class under SRC main job.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.370
Let's call it US customer.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.680
The new class.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.540
I'm gonna call it US customer,

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.870
so I'm gonna give the package.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.840
Name is code out.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.360
We know dot Entity.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.540
It's a regular Gela Class it.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.360
There's nothing to be added over here.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.760
Click on finish and what I want is I want a feel here representing each off the columns.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.740
I have your idea,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.160
which is an integer our name Citi email Phone They're all strings as far as jobs concern

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.520
someone who are those variables.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.650
So I'll type your private in teacher or you can go with intestinal.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.910
But the preferences a rapper plus rather than a primitive type Adidas Islay private string

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.250
name Private String City.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.240
Private string email on one last ISS private string phone number assuming,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.210
Let's say you can see that there are a lot of warning messages here because digital private

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.910
variables,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.190
they either have to be used.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.480
Are there supposed to be exposed?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.030
I have not done any of them.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.150
That's why it is giving another.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.900
Let me also see the outline over here so you can see that there is something called

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.110
Plainview and it shows them members off this particular class.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.000
Currently,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.880
I have only the variables.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.700
Typically,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.490
we will add a constructor.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.840
We will add getters and sitter than so on and so forth.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.240
So how that I have a constructor,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.270
you come down here or press control space and then press enter.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.230
You can see we got a constructor and then we go toe source menu,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.150
generate getters insiders on.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.650
Then select all of them.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.880
Click on 100.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.040
If you want to add hash code and equals again,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.650
you go to the source Middle gendered hash code and equals.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.970
If you want.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.900
I click on Generate.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.690
So we got two more functions we're gonna have here Source.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.490
Gender to string Onda SE 200.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.710
You can see that we only wanted these fields representing the actual table.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.120
But we ended up in writing hundreds of lines off court over here,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.700
which are nothing but some violent record.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.520
So this is where Lombard comes into picture.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.480
So I'm gonna select all off this code and then delete that I just have these five variables

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.160
over here.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.010
Andi,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.950
I can simply come here and then add an annotation called Adelaide Data.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:23.100
And this is coming from Lombok so you can automatically import them by taping command shift

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.210
on Mac control shift on Windows and Lennox.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.380
So when I do that,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.680
you can see it has imported on as soon as they say you can see there is a bunch of ghettos

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.070
that a bunch of settles the equals that they can equal.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.410
Hash scored two string on the default constructor.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.050
So my class looks very crisp and concise,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.510
but at the runtime,

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.830
an object off this customer class will still have these functionalities.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.510
So lumber ads always during the compilation time.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.670
So in the resulting customers are classified.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.470
We already have all this stuff.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.240
So instead of data,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.910
if you want specific members in your class,

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.820
for example.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.470
I want the no argument constructor.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.500
I can adhere underrate know our constructor controlled space.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.010
You see,

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.190
I got a constructor.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.820
I can say I want a getters.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.550
So select this.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.360
You got on the get us are a center and you got the centers as well.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.840
If you want a posting,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.570
you cannot underrate to string.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.510
So either selectively are few members are used at the red data toe.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.560
Add all of them.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.010
So let me get it off the unused imports.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.910
Save it.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.320
My entity class is not really so.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.790
That's all for this lecture in the next lecture,

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.920
let's configure my back is to connect to our it's two database server.
