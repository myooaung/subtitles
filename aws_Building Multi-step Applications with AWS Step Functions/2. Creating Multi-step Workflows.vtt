00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.340
[Autogenerated] hi.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.260
In this clip,

3
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.930
we are going to focus on creating a multiple step

4
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.620
workflow with decisions and tasks.

5
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.100
We are going to implement a scenario for our global Mantex company.

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.830
Firstly,

7
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.750
we'll have a task that generates a PdF report will be

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.200
using the land of function toe.

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.470
Hold our logic.

10
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.740
Next, we'll have an increase in step.

11
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.540
Some clients have sensitive data,

12
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.610
so they want the reports to be encrypted before sent anywhere.

13
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.930
The encryption step will also be a server less land.

14
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.660
The function,

15
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.980
based on the encryption settings off the customer will make the choice

16
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.700
whether we need to increase or not increase our document after the

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.050
encryption step will have an e mail step.

18
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.740
These will send the actual file to the client.

19
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.980
The generated be their file and the increase pdf file will

20
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.090
be saved on Amazon as three storage.

21
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.720
And finally, we have the cleanup step.

22
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.820
We don't want our files to stay on history for no reason after their scent.

23
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.430
So after the email step has been completed,

24
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270
we want to clean up the generated media files as well.

25
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.400
Let's get started first.

26
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.560
Let's take the logic for our several Islam.

27
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.320
The factions for this demo, I'm using no j several dysfunctions,

28
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.270
but you can use the programming language off your choice.

29
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.260
The report Generation Lambda Function doesn't actually generate a really report,

30
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.730
but it generates a pdf file with some demo data.

31
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.380
The demo data is placed on Amazon every storage and Ling Tau.

32
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.380
That file is out.

33
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.240
Put it as a result.

34
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840
Next, we have our encryption function.

35
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.830
These will encrypt the report and story on history just like the previous

36
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.640
function and output the link to the encrypted file.

37
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.720
The email function will receive the file as an import on

38
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.070
email address to send it toe and the subject.

39
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.250
Using that information,

40
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.380
it will send out an email and include a Pdf report as an attachment.

41
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.860
And finally, our cleanup step will delete the two generated files from storage.

42
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.940
So we don't gather unnecessary files on our storage.

43
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.600
You will find the Lambda functions used in this demo in

44
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.550
the exercise files for the course.

45
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.900
Let's go ahead and create a new work so this workflow

46
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.190
will not have high event rate workloads.

47
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.840
So let's leave the type as standard.

48
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.240
I have already prepared the workflow definition for this demo.

49
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.450
We are going to go through it step by step and explain each step in detail.

50
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.310
If you refresh the diagram, we can see a preview off power flow.

51
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.040
Well, let's start with our first date,

52
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.160
which is going to be a task state that will invoke

53
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.300
the PDF Generation Lambda function.

54
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.330
To do that, we specify the resource which will be Lambda,

55
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.510
and we'll use the inbox FBI and in the parlor meter section.

56
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.340
We specify the function name, which will be the function A Alan.

57
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.040
This function does not require any import for real life scenarios.

58
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.840
Ideally, these were taking some sort of client I D or another identifier.

59
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.440
But for demo, this won't require any import.

60
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.780
So in the payload section, we won't best anything for the output.

61
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.250
We need to use a result bath property to map our

62
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.660
function output to a specific variable.

63
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.430
So the next step execution does not override the workflow output.

64
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.240
Let's name this steps output report generation output.

65
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.080
Next, we're going to have a past eight.

66
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.350
Past states are useful when we want to map some data to the output.

67
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.070
In our case, when we call our email step,

68
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.570
we won't know from which that we came from,

69
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.610
and we shouldn't.

70
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.530
And also our email step also should have cared.

71
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.840
If it's sending the encrypted file or the unencrypted file,

72
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.380
all it needs to know is which file to send.

73
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.500
So we're going to use the past day to map a set off PIRA meters.

74
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.240
We're going to map the report generation output into two properties,

75
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.850
email file and unencrypted file.

76
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.470
We are going to override the email file on the encryption step if we reach

77
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.300
it and we're going to use unencrypted file in the encryption step and even

78
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.980
clean up step later on using Result Bath,

79
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.340
we will save the data in the report options that report data.

80
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.150
Next, we have a choice.

81
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.800
They here will make the decision to increase the report or not,

82
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.240
we are going to use the property should increase on the report.

83
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.350
Options object.

84
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.570
If the value is said to true, we move to the encryption step.

85
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.040
Otherwise we move to the email step.

86
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.690
Next,

87
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.330
we'll have the encryptions that the encryption step is going to point

88
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.110
to the encryption London function for the import.

89
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.910
It's only going to need the unencrypted report filed

90
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.280
path we generated on the first step.

91
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.010
The output off the encryption step will be the

92
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.720
encrypted file location on Amazon s tree.

93
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.040
And that result will be stored on a property called encryption output,

94
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.480
which we specify using the result bath.

95
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.980
Before we go to the email step, we need to add another pastor here.

96
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.340
They're going to override the email file property.

97
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.470
So it now points to the encrypted file and also

98
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.560
said the encrypted file property, so we can use it later in the cleanup step.

99
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.590
Now in our power meters, we need to specify email,

100
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.800
file an encrypted file and an unencrypted file,

101
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.630
and all these properties will now be available in the

102
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.360
report options that report data which we can use on the

103
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.340
email step and in the cleanup step.

104
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.420
Next, we have the emails step.

105
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.310
These will use the email London function and,

106
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.150
as an import,

107
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.810
will have the client email subject body on the property called email file.

108
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.080
The email file Property will have encrypted report

109
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.500
if the encryption was required.

110
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.640
Otherwise, it will have the unencrypted report if encryption was not required.

111
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.050
And finally, after the email step,

112
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.620
we have the cleanup step this step will taking apart a meter,

113
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.720
a least off files or on object with our files.

114
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.570
Currently, there is no way to create an away on the step function definition,

115
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.020
so we'll be passing object off files.

116
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.320
The cleanup function is smart enough to determine between array and

117
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.340
an object and delete all the files specified.

118
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.800
This will be our last item on the workflow,

119
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.130
so we need to set the and property to True now that we

120
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.770
have completed our workflow definition, that's great.

121
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.140
The workflow.

122
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.030
Let's give you the descriptive name and for the role we're

123
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.140
going to leave it as creating new role.

124
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.470
These will create a role based on the definition off the work floor,

125
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.980
which will give it the appropriate permissions.

126
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.520
Once the work slow has been created that start a new

127
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.970
execution using the staff execution bottom,

128
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.040
we are going to pass our options in an object called report options.

129
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.420
We need to specify a client email on email,

130
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.170
subject une male body and should angry tell it to encrypt our report or not.

131
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.040
In this case, we're choosing to encrypt our report.

132
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.970
Once the workflow execution starts,

133
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.940
we can see in the diagram steps being executed one after the other.

134
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.290
The blue color indicates that the step execution is in progress,

135
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.780
and green means it's complete and once execution of the work flow is completed.

136
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.870
If we check our inbox,

137
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.960
we should have an email with the specified subject body and a pdf

138
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.770
attachment that we cannot open since it's encrypted.

139
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.130
If we look at our in box, we can see that an email has arrived.

140
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.140
And if we try to open the pdf file, we should not be ableto.

141
00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.660
Now.

142
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.290
Let's execute our workflow again without requiring encryption.

143
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.960
We can do that by using the new execution bottom at the top right corner.

144
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.800
Let's change the shoot Angry property to falls once we execute a workflow.

145
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.420
If we look at the diagram, the encryption step shouldn't be executed.

146
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.450
This time around.

147
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.940
Seems to be setting tau false.

148
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.320
And when the workflow is completed, if we check our email,

149
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.440
we should have a video file attached that we can read now.

150
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.170
And indeed,

151
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.250
we have a PdF file attached that we can read AWS Step Functions

152
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.750
makes creating complex work clothes easy,

153
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.030
and we can use our existing several its functions to feed them into a larger,

154
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.960
complex business.

155
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.750
Workflow.

156
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:47.000
That's it for creating work close with multiple steps and decisions, we look into error handling and other options in the clips to call.
