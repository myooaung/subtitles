[Autogenerated] Welcome to the kubernetes for developers moving

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,550
from Docker Compose to Kubernetes course.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,860
My name's Dan Wall Lean, and I'm a software developer,

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,700
architect and trainer specializing in development

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,760
container and cloud technologies.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,270
I'm really excited to talk with you about different techniques that could be

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,440
used to move your containers from Docker Compose to Kubernetes.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,820
So we'll start off the course with a quick review of Docker Compose

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,750
and Kubernetes concepts and see how Docker Compose services map two

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,340
different kubernetes resource is.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,750
From there you'll learn about Docker stack commands and how they can

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,550
be used with Docker desktop to deploy containers to kubernetes using

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,340
an existing Docker Compose YAML file.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,040
This is one of the easiest ways to get started moving your

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,440
containers from Docker Compose to Cooper Nets.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,240
Next,

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,990
you'll learn about an open source project called Composed that could be used

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,210
to convert Docker Compose files into Kubernetes manifest.

19
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,140
Using only a single command,

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,430
you learn about the Kubernetes XAML that's generated and modifications

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,770
that you may end up making as the course progresses.

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,080
You'll also learn about a tool called scaffold that could be used

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,570
to convert a Docker Compose YAML file into Kubernetes manifest

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,240
files and how it can also be used to do live development against

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,040
the Kubernetes cluster.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,950
Finally,

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,180
we'll put all these concepts together and demonstrate using

28
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,040
Docker stack commands composed and scaffold to move an

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,840
application from Docker Compose to Kubernetes.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,830
So with that,

31
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:50,000
let's get started with a quick review and learn how Docker Compose maps to kubernetes.
