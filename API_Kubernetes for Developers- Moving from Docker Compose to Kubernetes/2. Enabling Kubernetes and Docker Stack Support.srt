1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,460
[Autogenerated] Docker desktop makes it really easy to run

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,440
kubernetes on any developer machine that supports it.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,090
And we've covered that and how to enable it in

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,440
previous courses in this learning path.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,620
But I'm going to show you how we can not only enable

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,800
kubernetes but also override the default behavior of Docker

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
stat commands Very simple to get enabled.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,140
And I'll show you that process here momentarily.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,340
Now let's ask a couple questions, though, before we go down this route.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,540
So question number one can Docker Compose files be used to

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,840
run containers directly in kubernetes?

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,600
And the short answer there is not natively?

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,740
No.

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,360
So if you're not using Docker desktop,

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,210
then what I'm gonna show you here is really not gonna

16
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,700
be in the realm of possibilities.

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,030
You know, if you're on mini kubectl or even kubectl them the full kubernetes.

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,340
This won't work, but the answer is yes.

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,320
When Docker desktop is being used and all we have to do is enable a setting in

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,340
Docker desktop so that when these Docker stack commands run,

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,650
it translates the Docker Compose services into Kubernetes.

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,380
Resource is and that all happens like magic.

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,110
Really very simple.

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,600
And I'll show you that process coming up now.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,190
Question number two What are Docker stacks or what's the Docker Stack Command?

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,300
You may have never heard of that one,

27
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,230
especially if you've never used the older term was Docker

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,600
Swarm or the newer one is swarm mode now.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,140
Docker swarm.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,740
The original version of all This was a way to do what Kubernetes does,

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,740
and it's still available.

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,750
It's now swarm mode, as I mentioned,

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,530
but it allows us to create a cluster and run our

34
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,260
containers across multiple nodes.

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,730
We can scale them.

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,820
They could be monitored.

37
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,300
They could be healed all those type of things that

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,040
you see with kubernetes in general.

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,110
So Docker stack commands out of the box are used to manage this swarm mode.

40
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,700
Clustering, however, with the check of a check box we can switch it.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,440
So instead of creating a swarm cluster,

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,090
it can actually put all of our containers into pods within kubernetes.

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,140
Create the necessary services for communication and all of that type of thing.

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,140
So it actually allows you to keep using your standard Docker Compose file,

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,710
but actually run that app up in kubernetes on your machine.

46
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,660
So it's a nice little compromise approach.

47
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,740
You could take if you don't want to take the time to translate

48
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,560
Docker Compose all the way to the Kubernetes resource files Now I'll

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,400
show you how to do this on Mac and windows.

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,850
They look pretty much identical these days.

51
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,920
And all we have to do is go into the coup Pernetti settings and

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,390
check a check box which will see right here for deployed Docker

53
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,890
stacks to kubernetes by default again.

54
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,020
Normally you have to do a swarm initializer phase,

55
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,940
run a command and get your Docker swarm configured and enabled.

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,620
But by checking this check box,

57
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,660
you can override that default behavior and make it so

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,370
it runs these up in kubernetes.

59
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,290
Now let me jump over to macOS are and show you and you'll

60
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,910
notice when I go up to the wail icon we can,

61
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,980
come on into the preferences and go down to kubernetes and all

62
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,240
you have to do is check this box right here.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,340
Now this one If you watched any of the prior courses in this learning path,

64
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,840
this is what you, of course, enable to get Kubernetes going.

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,700
But this one will allow us to actually run Docker Compose files

66
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,480
against kubernetes using these Docker stat commands that I'll be

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,450
showing you coming up here now, on Windows,

68
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,740
it looks almost identical.

69
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,950
We can come down into our tray right-click on the Docker

70
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,040
icon and go to settings in this case.

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,740
And then from here it's gonna look identical to what you saw on the Mac side.

72
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,020
We can come down to kubernetes and then enable kubernetes.

73
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,860
And then, of course, check the box from here We apply and restart.

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,290
That'll start everything back up.

75
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,190
But it's pretty quick normally and you're ready to do so.

76
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,230
That's all we would need to do in Docker desktop to do this.

77
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,940
Now, if you are on something else aside from Docker desktop,

78
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:21,000
unfortunately, you're not gonna have this option. So for this particular module, you are gonna need Docker desktop, Of course.
