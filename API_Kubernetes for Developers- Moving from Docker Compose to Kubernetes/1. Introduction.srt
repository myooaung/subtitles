1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,190
[Autogenerated] in this final module.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,440
We're gonna put everything together that we've learned up to this point.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,350
I'm gonna walk you through a different application,

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,640
though that has more services and see how we could

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,570
still use Docker stacks with it,

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,240
as well as the composed tool to do our conversions.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,800
So we're going to start this module off with a review of using Docker stacks,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,040
but with a different application.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,150
Once we get that application up and running and kubernetes,

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,840
then we're gonna review how we can use composed convert to actually convert

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,340
more complex Docker Compose file into kubernetes XAML files.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,840
And then we're going to revisit the scaffold tool that we looked at

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,910
earlier and see how it could be used again for live development and

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,340
moving from Docker Compose right into Kubernetes.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:44,570
Now,

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,350
the application that I'm gonna walk you through has been used in

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,620
my Docker for web developers course and also throughout the

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,140
Kubernetes for developers learning path.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,580
And you can get to it here.

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,340
GitHub dot com slash dan wall lean code with Dan Docker services.

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,770
Really,

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,760
all you need to do is clone it or download and extract the zip file and

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,340
you have everything that I'll be showing momentarily.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's go ahead and get started by reviewing how to use Docker stacks with this new application.
