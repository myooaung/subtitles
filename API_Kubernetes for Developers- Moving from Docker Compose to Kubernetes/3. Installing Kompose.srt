00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,450
[Autogenerated] getting the composed tool installed is a really

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,980
straightforward process on Mac windows or Linux.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,870
So I'm gonna walk you through that process,

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,060
show you the docks and you'll see that literally within a few

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,440
minutes you can have it up and running.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,640
So currently I'm on Mac and I've gone to the composed iOS website.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,790
This will give you some basic information,

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,730
help get you started and even have installation instructions.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,050
But what I found is that sometimes it could be out of sync with the GitHub repo.

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,530
Normally, the GitHub repose up to date on the installation,

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,740
and this one might lag a little bit.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,020
So I'm gonna recommend you actually click on the GitHub repository link,

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,140
and we're gonna go to that instead.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,040
And if I scroll on down,

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,940
you'll see that we have installation instructions and

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,730
specifically for Linux and Max.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,610
Your going to do almost the same thing.

18
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,340
You're gonna do a curl command on Linux or on Mac do a commode,

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,600
and then you're gonna copy that binary over to a specific folder,

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,920
and then you could use the tool.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,740
Very simple.

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,420
Once we're done getting that going on my Mac here.

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,630
Well, then do the same thing for Windows,

24
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,140
but I'll show you what is required there.

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,350
So the first thing I'm gonna do is grab the curl command syntax here and

26
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,930
copy it into my clipboard and then go to a command prompt.

27
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,540
And we're just gonna run this to download the binary that we need.

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,260
Somebody pace that in.

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,120
We'll hit in her.

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,340
And this will take just a second or two to get this downloaded.

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,250
All right, Now, the next step will be the charm.

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,440
Odd command.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,840
So we're gonna run that.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,540
Now that that's done, we're going to copy it over with the pseudo command.

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:54,440
So we're gonna do a move of composed to usr slash local bin composed.

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,380
So you could see I'm basically just following the

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,440
instructions that you see right here.

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,640
All right, so we'll go ahead and do that.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,340
Enter my password, and we're done.

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,750
So let me go ahead and clear this.

41
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,820
And now what we can do is type compose,

42
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:16,640
and this should show us the initial help documentation for how to use the tool.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,090
All right.

44
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,890
And there we go.

45
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,440
Let me go ahead and go full screen on that.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,760
And if we scroll on down.

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
You're going to notice there's several different commands up here.

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,940
We're gonna be looking at the convert one specifically,

49
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,140
but notice there's a help as well.

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,640
So let's do that.

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,240
And you're going to see us the same thing we just got.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,160
So that command will give you inside into the other commands.

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,720
You can run now.

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,810
The version obviously will change as time progresses.

55
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,340
But if you want to see what you're on we can do composed version,

56
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,190
and there's the version I'm currently on.

57
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,840
But that would probably be out of date in a week or two.

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,800
All right, so that's how we get it going on, Mac.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,040
Now, for Linux, it would be the same exact instructions.

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,940
Just make sure you use the Linux and 64 command for curling,

61
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,250
and that would get that binary downloaded.

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,840
Then you run the same instructions that you see right here.

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,940
Now let's move over to windows.

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,280
So on the windows side, you'll see that we're not gonna do a kernel command.

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,070
We're actually gonna download Obayan are e from GitHub.

66
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,440
We're gonna add it to our path.

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,340
So I'm gonna go ahead and download that and that will just take a second or two.

68
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,620
Looks like it prompted me to try to block it.

69
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,030
In this case, I'm gonna trust it.

70
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,540
So we'll say keep.

71
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,250
And that will take me to here.

72
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm gonna go ahead and say, Yeah, I trust it And keep it.

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,940
We're gonna do keep anywhere.

74
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,640
Now you're may or may not be prompted on that I'm currently an edge,

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,610
and that's what it obviously showed.

76
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,970
So if you do get that, just go through that process,

77
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,440
otherwise it should just download it with a different browser.

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,680
So I'm gonna go to the folder of the downloads and what I'm gonna do

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,330
here first is rename it to just compose .NET y-axis.

80
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:08,430
Now, the next thing I'm gonna do is cut it from here and I have a tools folder.

81
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,270
I'm gonna put it in just for this demo.

82
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,230
You might have a different folder where you wanna put it.

83
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,790
I'll go ahead and paste it into the tools folder in order to

84
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,520
get to this from anywhere on my machine,

85
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,380
I need to add this.

86
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,240
See Docker tools path that you see up top here into my path.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,070
So to do that,

88
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,830
I'm gonna come down to the search and I'm gonna type E n v and

89
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,640
we can edit the system environment variables.

90
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,640
So I'll go ahead and click on that.

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Well, then click on the environment Variables button.

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,140
And now you need to make a choice.

93
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,060
You can either update the path for just your account or

94
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,820
you could do it for the entire system.

95
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,940
It really depends if it's just your machine or other people are using it.

96
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,940
I normally update the system once because this is my machine.

97
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm going to select path and click at it and notice I've already added it.

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,160
But from here,

99
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,910
we could do new and then just type C Docker slash or whatever your path is

100
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,340
right there and save it just like you see I did here.

101
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,360
Now that should be in my path.

102
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,740
And if I type composed, which we're gonna do in a moment,

103
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,540
I should build to get to the tool as well.

104
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,720
Let's go ahead and close out of here and we're ready to go.

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,020
So now let me open a command problem.

106
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,480
Now I'm gonna open the windows terminal.

107
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,540
This is something you can download from the windows store or online,

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,530
and this is multiple shells in one.

109
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,620
Right now, it's defaulting a PowerShell,

110
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,220
but you'll see that I can do the typical command PowerShell.

111
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,160
I have a window subsystem for Linux going even Azure cloud shell,

112
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,140
and it's really nice if you haven't seen it.

113
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,190
So let's try this out.

114
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,440
You'll notice I am not in the Sea Docker Tools folder.

115
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,750
But go ahead and clear this.

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm gonna tie it, compose,

117
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,140
and there we do I can do compose version and there's my versioning.

118
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,550
So now we're ready to go.

119
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:13,000
We can now use this tool with the convert command you'll see in the help there, and that's what we're gonna look at next.
