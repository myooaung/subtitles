[Autogenerated] Well, that's a wrap on this course.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,960
I appreciate you taking the time to go through the course and hope

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,990
you learned a lot about different techniques that could be used to

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,140
move from Docker Compose into kubernetes.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,380
So, as a final review,

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,380
we talked about how we can use Docker stacks with Docker desktop

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,030
to get containers up and running and Kubernetes by simply

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,210
checking a check box and then running.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,630
A few commands talked about commands such as Docker,

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,340
stack, deploy, Docker stack removed and others that could be used to do that.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,400
We also discussed the composed tool and saw how it could be used to convert

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,240
from Docker Compose XAML files into kubernetes XAML files.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,010
And we ran the composed Convert Command and discuss that

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,100
there are some other commands as well.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,740
They could be used to work with it, too,

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,550
and finally we talked about the scaffold tool and saw how it can also

17
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,840
be used to convert from Docker Compose while also enabling live

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,550
development against kubernetes we can use scaffolding it to actually do

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,520
that initial conversion if we need to, and then we can define our artifacts.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,000
That would be our path to the Docker files any files sinking.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,740
We want to do things along those lines.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,280
And then we could simply run Scaffold Dev to bring that environment up.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,540
Now, as we make any code changes,

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,420
it can automatically rebuild and then redeploy those images and

25
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,140
get that container running in a kubernetes pot.

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,170
Are there other tools we could use for these different techniques?

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:32,970
Absolutely.

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,930
There's always more tools,

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,720
but these are some of the main ones out there that will help get you started.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,940
And I hope it will really simplify your process of

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,840
moving from Docker Compose to Kubernetes.

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,480
So thanks again for making time to go through this course with me.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,110
I hope you enjoyed it.

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,180
