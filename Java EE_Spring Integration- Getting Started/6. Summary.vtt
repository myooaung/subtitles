00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.070
[Autogenerated] considering how to deal with errors and unexpected

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.110
situations is essential for any piece of software in this module.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.340
We looked at different ways.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.140
You can deal with errors in the spring integration application.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.390
We've looked at how you can configure an error handler on the MQ API

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.790
inbound channel it after to prevent it from Rick Ewing,

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.790
a message which causes an error and how we can configure evident

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.210
que to move such a message to with that letter.

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.440
Q.

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.330
We've also discussed how you can handle errors when the

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.340
message handlers in your application are not running on

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.740
the same threat is is center.

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.720
In that case,

14
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.220
error messages are sent to an error channel from where

15
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.840
you can handle them appropriately.

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.200
Besides error handling,

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.590
you've also learned to be aware off how spring integration uses

18
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.120
threats and what consequences these has for propagating

19
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.740
exceptions and also for transactions.

20
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.740
And now we are at the end of the spring integration getting started course,

21
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.520
even though this is just getting started course in the

22
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.140
spring integration learning path, you've learned a lot.

23
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.640
We started with the basic concepts off a synchronous messaging.

24
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.300
You've learned about enterprise integration patterns,

25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.280
a set of design patterns specifically about integrating

26
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.040
software systems using messaging.

27
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.700
The enterprise integration patterns were originally described

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.840
in the book by Gregor Hope and Bobby Wolf.

29
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.000
Throughout the course,

30
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.380
we even counted many different enterprise integration patterns,

31
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.820
from messages and message sandals to channel adapters,

32
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.640
polling consumers and event driven consumers,

33
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.040
routers, transformers, service, activators and more.

34
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.890
You have, of course,

35
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.100
also learned a lot about spring integration and how it makes

36
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.400
the enterprise integration patterns available for you to use

37
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.240
in your spring based applications.

38
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.610
We've built a nice demo application that you can experiment

39
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.540
with to learn exactly how it all works.

40
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.680
We started the demo with a few simple point to point

41
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.700
channels and the service activator,

42
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.040
and then extended it with channel adapters to work with rebel MQ.

43
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.760
You've learned about published subscribe messaging,

44
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.900
which we used to make the applications and the confirmation

45
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.650
email and notify the billing system when a registration was made

46
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.540
for the Globomantics Tech conference.

47
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.640
Finally, you've learned how to handle errors in different ways.

48
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.680
You now have a solid understanding,

49
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.800
offspring integration and enterprise integration patterns,

50
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.240
and you're ready to start using it in your own applications.

51
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.240
Of course, there's a lot more to learn about spring integration.

52
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.400
There are many more enterprise integration patterns that we

53
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.060
haven't discussed in this course and spring integration as many

54
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.140
more features that we couldn't cover Here.

55
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.060
You're welcome to continue your journey to learn spring integration with the

56
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.640
next courses in the spring integration learning path that will be available soon

57
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.820
on Pluralsight or will already be available to you,

58
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.340
depending on when you're watching this.

59
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.000
I hope you found this course interesting and useful, and I wish you success with using spring integration in your own work.
