00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,990
[Autogenerated] Let's take a few minutes to understand what you should

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,030
already know to get the most out of this course and what other courses you

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,640
might want to follow before and after this course.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,060
These courses meant for Java developers who are already

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,640
familiar with the spring framework.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,220
If you haven't used to spring framework before,

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,280
or if you are brand new to programming in Java,

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,770
then I recommend that you follow other Java and spring framework.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,240
Fundamental scores is first.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,050
You should be familiar with the core concepts of the spring framework,

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,550
such as inversion off control and dependency,

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,670
injection spring beans and configuring them using XML and annotations some

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,500
other spring projects that will use besides spring integration,

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,840
our Spring web, MVC, spring data, JPA A and spring boot.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,840
It will help if you haven't least basic knowledge about these spring projects.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,340
There are many excellent courses about Java and spring available on Pluralsight.

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,270
Just search for them in the Pluralsight up or on the website,

18
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,040
and you'll find them.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,960
This course is meant to be your first course about spring

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,340
integration and enterprise integration patterns.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,300
It will be the first in a series.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,940
Off course is organized in the spring integration learning path.

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,180
At the moment I'm creating this course.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,850
Other authors and I are busy creating these learning path.

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,250
So more courses that will go deeper into specific spring integration topics

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,140
will be available soon on Pluralsight or they already are.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:41,000
Depending on when you're viewing this, these will be great to follow after this getting started course.
