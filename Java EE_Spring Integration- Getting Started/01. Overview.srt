00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,780
[Autogenerated] Okay, now you know what spring integration is about,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,340
and it's time we start working with it in practice.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,740
In this module, we're going to start working on the demo application.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,440
It's going to be a Web application where people can

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,340
register for the Globomantics Tech conference.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,040
We're going to start with a plain and simple spring boot web application.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,730
I'm first quickly going to show it to you and explain its architecture.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,640
Er,

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,330
then we're going to introduce bring integration into this application

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,940
to decouple the web player from the surface layer.

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,500
You will learn how to use spring integration in the spring project,

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,160
and I'll show you different ways to configure spring

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,890
integration components using XML configuration,

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,140
Jaffa annotations and the spring Integration Domain specific language.

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,400
Spring integration provides a number of different message

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,320
general implementations that correspond to different

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,840
enterprise integration patterns.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,070
We will take a look at what those are and organize them

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,880
so that you have a clear overview.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,840
Offspring integration message generals.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,000
You will have a strong foundational knowledge of spring integration, and in the next modules we're going to build on top of that
