[Autogenerated] since everything in spring integration is

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,490
about messages and message channels,

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,010
it's very important to understand the different message colonel implementations

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,180
that spring integration provides Let's organize them and get a good overview

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,540
off the available message channel implementations.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,240
There are six main message colonel implementations we're going to look at.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,250
There are actually a few other ones,

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,340
but these six are the most common and most important ones.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,200
The other one's error really specialized

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,030
implementations for less common use cases,

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,490
so they are not so interesting.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,740
For now, let's start with what all the message channels have in common.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,240
They all implement interface message channel.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,940
This interface is very simple.

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,290
The only methods It defines our to send methods,

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,970
one that takes a message and another one that takes

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,440
a message and a time out value.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,810
The first distinction that we can make to divide the message channels

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,140
into two types is the way that messages are received.

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,230
Direct Channel,

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,480
Executed channel and published subscribed channel are all subscribe.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,400
Double channels que channel around the View Channel and

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,740
Priority Channel are possible channels.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,500
The distinction between subscribe double channels and possible channels

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,940
corresponds to to enterprise integration patterns.

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,840
These event driven consumer pattern and the polling consumer pattern.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,510
The difference will become more clear if you look at the interfaces.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,950
Subscribe double channel and possible channel,

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,180
which both extent interface message channel interface

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,470
subscribe double channel AD DS methods to subscribe and

31
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,740
unsubscribe message handlers to a channel.

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,100
This is how the event driven consumer pattern works.

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,160
To receive messages from a subscribe double channel,

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,670
you subscribe a message Chandler that will be called by the messaging

35
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,340
system whenever a message is sent to the channel.

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,640
Receiving messages from a possible channel works differently.

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,300
Interface.

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,670
Possible channel AD DS to receive methods to receive a

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,320
message from a possible channel.

40
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,080
You call one of these methods,

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,740
which blocks until the message is available or a time out occurs.

42
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,840
This is the polling consumer pattern.

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,940
Another way to describe the difference is pushing versus pulling messages.

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,380
A subscribe double channel.

45
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,910
Push his messages to the receiver by calling the receiver,

46
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,450
and the message is available versus a possible channel where

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,580
the receiver has to pull messages from the channel by

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,340
calling a blocking receive method.

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,040
Finally,

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,710
a difference between these two types of channels is that possible channels

51
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,840
may buffer messages while subscribe double channels do not.

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,000
We'll get back to that when we take a closer look at the possible channels. But let's first look at the subscribe A ball channels in more detail.
