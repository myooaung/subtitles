00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
Hello folks.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.670
Welcome back until last section we house in How can we deploy on your docker container

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.690
using answerable This all involvement is in place We are deploying on docker container

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.950
using answerable in this section We are going to deploy I on kubernetes by using answerable

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.260
All this environment is already ready So we need to set up Kubernetes cluster to start with

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.020
the dissection.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.730
So the topics goes as below that is introduction Toku Bernadis setting up kubernetes

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.990
environment Then using Cube City will commence will test it out by creating deployments and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.650
services,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.190
then writing deployment and service files.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.640
Whatever commands we exclude with Cube City l same commands,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.250
we can create it as if file so that the file can be reusable.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.940
Then create answerable playbooks,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.680
toe reply nothing but whatever We're fine.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.710
We are creating that rifle.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.840
Get converts as the doctor emits.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.950
Then we deploy it as it part on Kubernetes cluster.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.350
Once it is done,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.340
we will integrate this one with the Jenkins job and will run your job after competition off

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.030
this step,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.550
we should able to deploy any kubernetes cluster without touching anything.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.790
All right,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.060
so do this one.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.130
I help prepare the other documentation which is required to set it up.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.720
That is there in our get hungry.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.230
Positive.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.050
Let's jump in.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.380
I'm on my get her back account.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.790
We have repository called Simple develops project And here we have your folder called

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.570
Kubernetes.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.670
I have updated all the documentation which is required for this section.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.350
Over here.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.320
Right in next video.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.470
We are going to see how to set up kubernetes on air,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.440
oblivious until then.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.930
Bye.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.450
See you in the next video.
