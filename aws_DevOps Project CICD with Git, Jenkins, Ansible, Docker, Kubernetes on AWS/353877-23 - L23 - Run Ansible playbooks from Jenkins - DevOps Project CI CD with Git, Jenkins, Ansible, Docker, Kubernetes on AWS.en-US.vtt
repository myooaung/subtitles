00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
Hello,

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.630
folks.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.900
Welcome back in Los Studio,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.240
we have seen how to write danceable playbooks to create your doctor image under Docker

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.850
Container.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.130
In this video,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.060
I'm going to show you How can we run our answerable playbook from the Jenkins itself before

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.660
marching over Jenkins job?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.850
Let me remove all over container Sander,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:28.160
you may just This was created from previous video and container.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.570
First,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.550
let me remove the container Darker.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:42.010
Stop Container name next Turned out Dougherty Artemis to remove majors only.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.450
You would images names.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.110
Sorry,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.340
We need to remove the doctor pendant Doctor.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.610
Autumn don't contain or name.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.700
No.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.890
We can remove images because we can't delete images.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.750
If they'll containers are running based out off it.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.950
Clear the screen.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.250
So no doctor images,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.710
no images.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.750
Docker ps minus here.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.150
No containers.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.600
Let's jump into our Jenkins console.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.910
Deploy on container using answer please.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.080
Over previous job,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.720
we are going to modify same job toe our playbook edited by using conficker on the scroll

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.050
down.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.850
Now we are going to eggs.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.580
Good comments.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.310
If you remember,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.150
we were executing comments toe build our doctor in majors and containers from here.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.750
Similar where we are going to run answerable playbooks from here.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.880
We just need to space for your playbook.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.680
Command here,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.250
let me June the screen.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.550
So ensemble minus playbook minus.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.750
I varies over inventory file is there or PT?

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.590
Dr Hosts.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.040
Right,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.250
If you remember.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.840
So,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.090
Peter bloody year less you can see under Oh,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.740
pretty doctor,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.080
we have hosts file next.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.620
Answerable playbook name We need to provide here over answerable playbook.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.250
Name is simple.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.980
Develops project to dot Wimal on full part Offensive ble or pity dr.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.150
And of what playbook?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.720
Limb A class province.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.190
And Michael.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.050
Um So it is going to execute this command.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:46.350
It is going to execute this command on our answerable system.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.450
So let's play these changes.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.460
Save it on the building up this time What should happen?

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:04.530
The where people get copies on Dover answerable system and it creates a amazed by using

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:16.120
that we're file onda created container or talk it so date you can see See the time stamp

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.550
over here it is him.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.950
Nothing but just know this var file has been copied onto answerable system and ah,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.800
Dr Images so far No,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.350
he majors docker ps Manus here.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.550
No containers as well.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.050
Let's see where the job is successfully completed or not.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.560
Okay,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.150
it's completed successfully.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.350
That takes a grew tired jobs under job.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.510
Sort of fine to change.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.690
So nothing but those are fine.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.110
Let me see the images.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.360
Yes,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.610
you can see images.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.030
Let me see the containers.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.650
You can see the container as well.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.890
Let me try to access the container.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.320
So let me take the appeared Joseph Enseval system because currently we have hosted it

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.440
Unanswerable system.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.950
We are still under testing phase to set up over principle environment.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.050
Okay,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.910
we can able to access under rebel right?

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.150
So it's working fine.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.340
So far,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.450
our job is working as expected.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.650
Arjun is that there is a change in the court off our river publication.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.300
In that case,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.750
we should able to create a new image by taking new Weber publication.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:43.050
Then create a new container protest this activity I'm going to modify our source scored

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.300
which is available in our get her then pushed the latest toe objects into the get her so

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.650
that we can see the changes in over rebel publication.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.390
Then we can run a Jenkins job toe,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.830
pick up the changes on creating new images on container out off it rather than running a

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.440
Jenkins job manually,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.930
we can use policy.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.220
Um,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.250
which we have already experimented in our previous jobs.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.920
Same.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.970
We are going to enable for this one so that it pickups new changes on create your docker

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.150
image under Docker Container.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.170
Let's go on to modify our Jenkins job to enable police even then change the source scored.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.650
Let's do that one.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.560
So go back con figure policy.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.750
Um,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.450
here I'm giving to run this job for every minute.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.060
So whenever we Trident changes the transfer job,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.950
let's go and change the court.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.950
It is available in my Jenkin server.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:58.050
So we have Hello world Siri.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.890
Hello,

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.360
world.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.990
Go insert toe with duck.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.660
That's such see index starter?

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:20.450
Just be so I will just to add deploying on playing on container.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.180
Okay.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.600
No way.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.750
How changed it gets status.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.950
Get out of the dark.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.490
Get commit.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:42.350
Minor Siem Maar deferred index file toe test with the protest with the doctor.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.600
Get push origin mastered.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.850
I'm pushing the changes,

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.780
okay.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:58.230
There is a change in our cord Once court has changed it Should I didn't friend eggs got the

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.640
job.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.750
Let's wait to see the new job triggering for sure it is going to fail.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:11.750
I will tell you what is the reason that's executing the job.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.860
So new commit.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.750
You can see here.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:23.650
Okay,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.670
it is unstable.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.350
The reason behind dirties creating your container It is throwing an error with the name

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.240
already.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.400
A container does exist so you cannot create a container with the same name.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.160
Toe overcome this problem.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:45.320
What we should do is we need to remove the container before creating a new container.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.810
So we need to modify our danceable playbook little bit so that always the latest core get

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.370
deploys aren't over target environment how to do those changes?

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.150
I'm going to show you in the next video.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.120
Until then.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.610
See you.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:07:59.950
Bye.
