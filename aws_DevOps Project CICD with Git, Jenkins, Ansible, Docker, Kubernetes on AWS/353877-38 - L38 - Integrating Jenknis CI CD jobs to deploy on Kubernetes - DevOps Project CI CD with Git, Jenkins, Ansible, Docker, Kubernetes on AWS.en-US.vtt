00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.780
Hello,

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.370
folks.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome back.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.520
In previous lecture,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.780
we have seen how to create a C a job by modifying our deploy and docker container using

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.820
answerable playbook.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.030
And also we are running this job under Slash were pretty kubernetes so that the files which

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.190
are required for these two jobs are in the same location in this video will integrate Siri

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.280
job as a don't stream job for see a so that we never see a job is executive and if it is

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.020
successful,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.170
it is going to execute the city job.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.270
If it is failed,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.150
it won't execute those Syria job.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.370
For that.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.180
Let's jump into oversee a job on Goto configuration toe Marty free under this one.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.830
If we go here post to build actions under post build accents,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.950
we have your option that build other projects.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.650
Let's choose the project on it comes abo here,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.050
So I want to execute other project that is deployed on container Siri job.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.710
When do you want to deploy?

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.060
I trigger only if building stable nothing,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490
but if this building stable,

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.920
then only run it we have another option is even though buildings unstable are building

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.550
pills,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.050
we can choose it But,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.910
er we want to make sure that our see a job is success before executing Siri.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.310
Play unsavory?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.410
No,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.580
to exude our see a serie job.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.450
What I'm going to do is I will modify our court.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.850
You never get help so that our see a job can identify that the research in because police

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.850
seem is enabled.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.820
I will just show you Yes.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.390
Policy,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.260
um is enabled.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.920
Undeterred.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.410
Trigoria,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.260
Build it build.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.950
Sit on the creator emails and the emails get pushed into Dr Hub.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.670
Once it is successful,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.180
then Siri job get eggs.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.430
Good.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.580
Because our buildings table on the Serie job pulls the latest image on created container

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.250
out off it.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.950
But we'll see whether it works or not.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.500
What I will do before doing that.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.970
Let me go toe C d job as well.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.710
We have one build here to make sure that both are having at the same level.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.450
Let me believed one more time.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.250
Built one more time.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.000
What happened?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.440
We are just going to see deployment.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.040
You can see still what surgeries running from party seven minutes.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.350
Nothing but previous deployment only.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.050
And even services also Nothing changed the way because there is no change in the myth.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.960
Now we are going to change the image because we are updating the court.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.950
So we should see the new deployment.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.910
For that,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.770
I'm using my Jenkins server to modify our court.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.060
Let's log into our Jenkins.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.950
Take the public AP off our server Goto over stations.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.150
This is huge by Pierre Toes on da Keep it.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.020
You see two minus user and we can change Tom Nuttall,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.450
which can Okay,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.050
I'm using this one.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.750
Something differ.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.950
Okay,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.950
this is our drinking serval.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.510
Become your route.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.110
Clear the screen less.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.470
Let me increase the farm stays and we hope.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.950
Hello,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.640
world Siri.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.960
Hello.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.950
World fib.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.950
The searching main rebel.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.070
Under this,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.450
we have your file called next our jsp.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.450
So just to edited.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.460
This is what we can see in the pros already.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.470
When you can see here.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.060
Still Okay.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.730
Started here.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.100
You can still see that.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.350
Hello.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.180
Welcome to simple develops project.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.900
Deploying on a container using answerable playbook.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.850
Same content is dead.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:07.530
Now we're going to update it as it deploying on Kubernetes Gruber Notice he was invincible

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.530
.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.950
Paper.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.360
Let's serve it.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.450
Get heard.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:18.850
Get comet hit.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.040
Push Okay.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.890
Before pushing,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.050
Let me kowtow because it really so we own kids.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.380
Onda.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.810
Hello,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.250
world.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:40.130
You can see 16 comets are that we are doing the 17 to commit to.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.450
See?

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.640
Yep.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.350
17th committee is done.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.950
Now Go back to over Jenkins under core and see.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.430
And we never This job is executing.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.710
We can see the building.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.850
Scooter starters.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.350
Let's wait to trigger this one.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.030
Once it is successful,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.750
it is going to trigger the serie job.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.840
Okay,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.670
Building kill.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.710
You can see that.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.120
Okay.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.550
Multiple jobs are running.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.950
I will desirable most of the jobs because all these urgent for the there is a change.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:25.050
So I will disable this job next to Tom gets or will deploy and only gets that world so

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.860
results.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.050
I'm goingto discipline.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.950
I want to see a job.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.250
I would see a job is working.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.400
No,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.850
let's see.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.150
But make until this storm cut one.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.250
We don't need it.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.110
So we'll see.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.050
A job is working.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.680
One See a job is done.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.020
Our Siri job is going to initiate.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.250
So in the background what will happen?

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.360
It copies the where fail.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.050
Over here.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.780
So did 18 59 letters to wear.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.950
Find God created.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.250
See here.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.050
Deployment on Coburn et Siri Job is running.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.420
Okay,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.290
it's successful.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.900
Looks cool.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.140
Yes.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.520
Started,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.150
built or done.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.620
Let's review over deployment before that.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.120
Let's see.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.770
The Lotus team is because there are changes in the court.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.260
So 86 to come.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.150
It should happen.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.480
Okay,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.100
86 committees done.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.850
And if I goto May,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.650
If I go to my cluster,

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.650
I could see the new containers and parts.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.050
Right.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.550
We'll see what happens.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.950
Get to deployment.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.050
You can still see that their deployment is 54 minutes earned.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.200
Also parts.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.740
If you'll see the part,

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.050
these are running from the 54 mayors.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.870
So what I'm trying to say here is if there is a change in the amaze,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.530
it cannot ableto pull directly until you have enabled worsening watching nothing but each

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.840
and every time there is a change in the court promote from you.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.820
So you each and every thing there is a change in the court.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.440
We should update this felt.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.860
They only create the new part other ways.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.790
It thinks that okay amazes same.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.220
So no need to create.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.130
To overcome this problem,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.050
we are going to use the command called Rollout.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:30.350
Were it can able to remove the existing containers on to create the new containers.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.360
How to do that when an immortal changes,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.590
we need to do over playbooks under deployment.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.030
Friends,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.150
we are going to see in the next video.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.750
Thanks for watching this video and see you there.
