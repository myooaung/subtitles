00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Hello,

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.600
folks.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.140
Welcome back in this video,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.590
I will show you how to set up Mavin on our Jenkins server procedure to install.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.350
Mavin is also operated in over Documentation Repository.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.790
Let's go there.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.850
Select a simple develops project.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.350
Go inside so that there is a folder called Jenkins.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.170
Then we have your file called Mavin insulation.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.010
This is the procedure we should follow to install Maren on Jenkins.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.890
We can download Mavin from the several.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.160
Once it is downloaded.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.050
We need toe set up the home partof mavin.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.710
Then we can check the MAV in Washington.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.470
Once it is done in the Jenkins server,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.820
we should jump into Jenkins console.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.180
Install Marinin worker on the Mavin integration plug in next.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.650
We need to configure Maren under global tool configuration.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.580
All right.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.970
It's quite simple how we have done for get similar way.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.520
Let's jump into Jenkins under Do this.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.350
So this is my Jenkins server.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.650
Clear the scream.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070
So set up Mavin.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.540
We need toe.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.550
Don't lure Mavin.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.310
Bruiser,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.310
don't lured Maren.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.650
Initial link itself shows the Apache that words this last don't lord dot c g a.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.180
If you scroll down here here,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.330
you can see the binary washing off over Apache Mavin,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.050
we can take this link.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.190
Tar daughter geezer.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.490
Copy the link address.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.060
Go back to our server.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.580
Currently I'm under route.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.050
Let's goto a pity.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.120
Will install underwater pity under or pity we have your direct recording.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.450
A laborious because it is a debris a server.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.050
Let's don't load it.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:00.550
The blue get our Maren binaries link so it don't lords mavin undead.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.350
It star minus X region deaths star minus six Ridgedale off Apache.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.950
So darn hard on da Now,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.260
the folder name is Apache Mavin.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.490
$3 extort one.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.730
But for better naming convention,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.850
I'm going to move this one to just Mavin folder so that it is easy to you our part.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.170
So I'm insert Mavin.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.850
Peter bluey slash will pity Mavin.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.410
And if I do?

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.510
Ls you can see that been directly over here.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.320
This is the actual folder.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.270
We should set it apart for Mavin.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.840
We need to set up a part for two variables.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.750
That is him to underscore home on the m toe.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.450
They aim to underscore home nothing Birth Mavin parties slash will PT Mavin and ah,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.070
just for the m two.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.950
We should give slash Were pretty mavin slash been.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.050
Let's go on to do that one and we are going to do it under route to use their bash.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.000
Underscore profile.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.840
So for that v eight killed killed nothing but goto Root home directory under that opening a

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.550
file called a Dark bash and Oscar profile.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.030
So where we have set up our job,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.850
our home but same location we need to set up.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.720
So I'm going toe dough below to Java.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.580
There are two variables we need to set up.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.180
That is him to underscore.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.850
Home is recalled slash Will PT Mavin then I am too.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.730
It is ah slash hope et Maren slash bean rich.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.050
So we have set up the part for both variables.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.350
W Q.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.710
Now you can see echo dollar am tow.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.510
It doesn't show anything way because we need to lock up on the login.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.160
So exit Sodo ASU minus again.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.350
I'm liking as a route.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.250
Now you can see echo dollar M two.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.170
All right,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.860
So it is showing up the part if I given to understand home here also,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.350
it is fun.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.860
Clear now.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.510
Let's check the Mavin wash in minus minus.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.650
Worship center.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.010
Oops!

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.880
Command missing seems we have missed with something in our bash.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.050
Underscore Profile.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.500
Let's Sorry,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.340
not this file.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.370
It is a bash.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.370
Underscore Profile.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.510
We a tilde dark bash.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.600
Underscore profile.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.420
Okay,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.080
good point.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.550
And off the file.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.550
Goto part location.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.990
Yes.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.380
Here.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.020
If you see,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.750
we missed toe are the pot at it?

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.650
That is dollar em to colon dollar.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.540
Um,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.450
toe underscored home.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.550
So we Mr Toe Export This one.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.920
I have done it now exit again.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.800
Three Larkin,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.000
then the M V n minus Manners Worship Hall.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.670
Right now you could be able to find the Mavin.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.230
We have set up Apache Mavin $3.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.850
61.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.350
Next thing,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.650
Jumper back to our Jenkins console.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.350
We are in the dashboard here.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.350
We should install Mavin plug ins to install plug ins again.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:36.340
Goto manage Jenkins Man is begins available here.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.920
Such for Maren.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.110
So we must install Mavin integration.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.950
Are the mavin in worker installed without restart even It also requires some dependencies.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.250
But it's already installed while we were installing.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.790
Get her.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.350
So it takes here when we'll wait.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.120
Cool.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.320
Mavin and selection has been completed.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.070
Go back to Jenkins.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.570
No.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.350
We need to set up Mavin pot for that man is Jenkins.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.510
Global tool configuration.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.250
This time we can see the Mavin.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.170
Okay.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.600
Even not clear it was there,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.680
and we have already installed.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.950
So no need to install automatically.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.760
No.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.360
Um 200 square home.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.120
I will give you this is slash war,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.890
PT marriage.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.580
So where exactly?

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.550
Our marinus day?

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.520
If I give slash been,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:43.250
it doesn't accept the because until Mavin home directly would be sufficient.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.930
Our place.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.670
All right.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.190
Our Maren set up is completed in next video.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.150
We are going to create a job to build with Mavin.
