Hello,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.520
folks.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.170
If you know various develops tools like get Jenkins and simple Docker on Cooper Nitties are

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.440
not sure How collaboratively does it work are you would like to set up your CSE reply

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.020
Planned using the Web stools are you want to see how they entered the wops?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.050
Florida as it were Then you are at the right place.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.920
Welcome to simple Develops Project Training program from Biloxi Technologies before diving

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.920
into What do I cover in this training?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.650
Let me introduce myself.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.550
My name is Air Shankar I how our own the 90 yourself i d experience.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.450
Currently I am working as a develops consultant in your leading 80 companies.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.250
I have also worked rivet the AWS and some of the UNIX flavours.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.960
Let's see,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.250
what tools do we cover in this program?

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.390
I'm going to use get adds Our source scored management Jenkins to create CSE Reply plans

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.350
Mavin as a bill little answerable for configuration management under deployment.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.730
Dr.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.810
As a target environmental to host over applications Cuban it is to manage our docker

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.690
containers under all this environment,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.110
I'm going to set it up on a jobless.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.840
No.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.850
Let's see how these tools get fits in our their works floor.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.430
Usually,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.340
developers dollop there court on the dollop record,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.550
they push it into get repository get is a source scored management system.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.550
Whenever court is available in,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.650
get Jenkins pulled that court under do the build.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.300
Once a building is completed,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.680
it generates article.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.850
This artifact should be get deployed into target environment,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.330
target environment.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.040
Maybe a VM docker container arc.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.150
Overnight is cluster,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.450
so we should house some tool which helps to get this deployed onto target environment.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.610
In our case,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.390
we are going to use answerable as their deployment service.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.290
It would deploy Sonya Docker container are kubernetes cluster By end off this training,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.800
you could able to set up this serious theory pipeline.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.890
I hope this has given your fate idea off.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.280
What do we cover in this training on?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.850
I will share more details about this program in our next video on building by.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.650
See you there
