00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Hello,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.420
folks.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.510
Welcome back in this lecture we are going to see how to install and set up.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.600
Get required information is already updated in over Get herb repository called a simple

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.830
develops project which is there in our wearing gym.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.350
Sock on.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.450
Let's go and have your look.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.950
So here we have simple the works project.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.560
Go inside to Jenkins folder here we have get plug in installed.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.320
It is very simple to set up.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.950
Get You can see here.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.850
Prerequisites.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.110
We need your Jenkins server which is already available and I have already logged in.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.960
Yes,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.990
your foster step.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.900
We should install.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.360
Get on over Jenkin server for that.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.940
Let's log into our Jenkins for better naming convention on changing host Name off the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.960
server as Jenkins So that it would be easy for us toward interpret I'm giving it.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.650
Does it host name as a Jenkins?

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.510
So I have logged in because toe take it effect.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690
It is temporary toe Take it Effect.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.260
You need to lie.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.080
Organize the route So it is a Jenkin sorrow.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.350
Next install get on Jenkins Server.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.450
After that,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.540
we should like into Jenkins.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.250
Console and install get her plug in and configure Get part how we have set up for our job.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.910
Let's do this.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.290
Um,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.850
Install it.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.150
Minus way.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.470
Where meantime,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.750
accepting to install.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.450
Go back to cancel.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.980
This is our Jenkins Council.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.660
Now we should install your plug in whenever we were configuring Jenkins.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.240
Initially,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.150
we haven't installed any plug ins.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.740
If you want to install,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.890
play against manually go to manage Jenkins under manage jinkins Manus plug ins Artery Moved

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.890
.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.190
Begins our Brit This talks about If you have already installed some plug ins,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.500
any latest Watson's has been released for those against,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.660
it will show up here we can install latest watchin if necessary.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.120
But so far we haven't installed anything,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.600
so there is no option to see here available all the available plug ins we can install on

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.820
this Jenkins server Can you can find here installed so far?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.850
If you installed any plug ins that will show up here.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.920
But we haven't installed anything.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.880
I'm going toe available now.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.780
I'm trying to install my first to plug in.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.170
That is,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.550
get help such forget help.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.750
Okay,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.940
now,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.130
if I scroll down,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.350
I can see option called Get help selected this plug in installed without restored we are in

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.070
selling one.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.830
Dig it up for no,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.000
because our Cody's available get help repository toe pull that court from could help the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.940
Jenkins We must need this plug in Depends upon the what sort scored management tool.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.850
You should install it Respect to plug in like pickpocket rsv and are something else.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.280
And also,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.010
if we observed we are trying to install Get her Berta,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.590
there are so many plug ins are getting install.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.630
These are a lot of dependence IPL agains So all the necessary plug ins are getting

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.370
installed during this.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.850
Get plug in insulation.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:34.180
Okay.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.830
Our installation is successful.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.150
Go back toe our Jenkins home pace.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.730
Next thing is we need toe set up Give the in the global tool configuration so go to manage

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.950
jinkins global tool configuration.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.260
If you remember earlier,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.520
we don't have this option while setting up our Java.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.840
Now we have installed Get plug in.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.510
That's where you could able to see but get it can ableto take up or directly because it is

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.650
a installations off here.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.850
That's way we no need to provide any full pot.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.570
I'll play the changes.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.750
Serve it.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.270
So far we have set up our get in next real.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.410
We are going to see how toe integrate Mavin with Jenkins until then.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.970
Bye.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.830
See you there.
