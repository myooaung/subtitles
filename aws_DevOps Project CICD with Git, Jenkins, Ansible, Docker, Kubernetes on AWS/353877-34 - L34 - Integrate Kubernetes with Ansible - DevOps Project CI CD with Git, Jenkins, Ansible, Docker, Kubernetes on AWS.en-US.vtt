00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
Hello,

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.300
folks.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.350
Welcome back in this video we are going to see how to integrate our kubernetes with

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.560
answerable To enable this one.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.200
I brought up my answerable server which was Don't.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.710
And also our Kubernetes cluster is running.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.150
I have a better proces er toe integrate kubernetes with the answerable in our get help

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.550
repository Let's jump in under Cuban it is folded itself.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.150
We have your file called integrating kubernetes with danceable.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.640
If I go here it how list of the steps What we should follow Frustrating is like incredibly

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.550
a server on the copy public Janda Kubernetes Cluster Master a cone.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.380
This is the step we need to do so that our answerable can ableto do the password less At

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.970
indication with the Kubernetes Master next update hosts filed with the new group called

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.950
Kubernetes on our Kubernetes Master In it,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.850
I'm going to create a new host Well under that host well I will air the Kuban.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270
It is must raping next,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.730
create answerable playbooks to create a deployment and service.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.390
These are quite simple year.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.680
It's something like,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.250
Ah,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.230
it is something like what we have executed in our previous lecture.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.230
So if I goto deployment.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.150
This is a kubernetes Alexei deployment.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.000
I will tell you how it can be done if I goto tasks.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.450
Just we are using the command What we have used in last lecture to create a deployment.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.440
And we can ignore this one for time being because I will explain when we are using our

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.090
Jenkins job Similar way If I goto over service file,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.850
this is also quite simple.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.020
We are going to eggs Good only over Cube Citadel Command instead of using common model we

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.400
can still use the Cube CTL model which is available in there danceable.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.450
But this is his.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.070
It'll manage.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.250
So I'm using the common model.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.000
Let's jump into regrettably,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.550
a sovereign integrate Cooper Nitties with danceable.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.710
So let me get the I p off our answerable system.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.850
This is the I P position.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:18.110
This is Hitch I p address on key paid and for sensible surgery It is easy to menace,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.550
User,

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.580
for better understanding what I will do,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.850
it will change the terminal appearance.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.950
I will give the this one so that it gives a different color.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.180
Yes,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.010
under let me increase the foreign Saiz,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:46.140
I will rename the terminal as well and Sibyl Server so that it would be easy toward and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.450
fight.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.110
No,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.110
let's become answerable,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.650
user.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.100
I'm answerable user Now I want to log in tow Kubernetes cluster rethought password Then we

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.250
should copy our public and to Kubernetes cluster.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.350
Yes,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.020
it's copier.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.870
They also can do.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.280
But we should create additional user for that one.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.600
Why?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.420
We need to use that one will use the existing user itself So let's goto Dart Shh!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.710
Here we have idea Racy pub Whatever is there in this file just to copy this one and go toe

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.500
kubernetes Master Goto telling nothing but home directly in the darkness.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.550
Yet here we have operated file I upload this file shifter g war.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.630
Okay,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.850
it is not copying.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:46.060
So let me created So instead of doing that one double greater than our trade I'm just a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.900
pending a letter public Ito,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.850
that friend considers Don't let me open it.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:08.070
So I have ordered So where I have edited under root account I heregger So from answerable

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.950
system I can log in tow kubernetes master as a root user.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.850
So let's try that one.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.810
It's a search minus i on danceable server public AP addressed let me take because I cannot

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.570
use private I p address here.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.810
Both are different.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.480
We pieces.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.150
Either you need to enable we peace eternal in which is another concept.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.320
So it's such minus eight.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.680
Tilled slash Dark as his hit under already.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.380
Or isi,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.350
this is our private key onto target system as a route I want to log in.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.490
So just takes a goatee.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.900
Yes.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.390
Yes,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.550
I could able to log in tow 33.1 26 from my 21 daughter 216 system.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.250
Okay,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.470
so alerts exit Nothing,

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.830
but I can able to like in tow kubernetes cluster without password.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.050
No,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.230
Clear the screen.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.750
So foster strip is done as per our documentation.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.830
Next update host file with the new group called the Kubernetes on our coburn,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.850
its master in it.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.050
For this what we should do,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.690
we are going to CD slash war.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.140
Pity underwear.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.090
Pity we were working on darker directory.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.970
Now I'm going to create one more directly pseudo um Katie Air Coburn It is.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.450
I'm creating a direct recalled look over Nitties.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.930
Let's go inside the Kuban.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.610
It is nothing,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.050
is there?

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.600
Let me create hosts.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.850
Well,

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.020
sort of EA hosts here.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.150
I'm going to add my answer.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:56.630
Will server that is local host on da our Kubernetes Sarwari be as well So kubernetes

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.150
Sarwari p I can take it from here.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:08.400
This is the core Bernetti sovereign Now instead off using this one directly we can use

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.910
other option is there In previous lectures we were directly using it.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:22.450
We can have one more efficient with grouping this horrible So and Sibyl server similar were

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.950
I'm creating you Burn it is group under this one.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.760
What hours are worse?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:35.850
Are there those can be accessible a sick over in this group So let it be like that No cat

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.960
hosts,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.560
Okay,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.020
This is how our hosts file.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:48.250
Let's go Tar step that is create answerable playbooks to create a deployment and service.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.130
We have already opened it.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.610
Let me copy this.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.650
Let me take the file name first.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.150
Sort of a A file name.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.980
Hi.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.890
Next Copy the file with old.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.600
So there too No special characters comes and I'm not copying.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.550
This one will use this one in the next recession,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.950
So let me copy it.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.950
Okay?

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:27.150
Opportunities will actually deployment is done Similar A sword over here.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.440
Kubernetes.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.920
Relax.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.290
E service start.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.780
William,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.280
L Hi.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.290
So this is our service.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.550
Well,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.950
I'm copying service.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.810
Okay,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.550
We have copied it.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.040
Now,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.240
if you see Here,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.850
let me open this file.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:01.000
So I'm hoping that deployment fell.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.210
We are creating your part using their deployment.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.050
And if you see here hosts,

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.840
I'm using Cooper Nitties.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.340
So this is the Coburn.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.920
It is group under this group.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.400
Whatever star wars are there on that Star Wars,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.070
this playbook is going to run.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.090
We are going to create a deployment only and master North.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.750
So we have space for the master north over here.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.350
Right on.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.980
Become true.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.920
It is optional.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.100
Just I kept it.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.340
Because anyway,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.630
we are liking as a route,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.910
so we should log in as a route to user.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.690
If we don't specially this one,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.290
it will try to like it as a Ennis had been itself,

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.990
because that is the default user.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.260
Right?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.650
But there is no in this admin user in our masters are up.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:44.430
That's why I'm saying toe my system that use the root user to log in.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.260
And the A nus had been how the privilege to become your route on the target system because

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:56.370
we helped copied our keys onto Route User Next to task we are just executing the task toe.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.520
Create the animal feel This is the commander.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.250
It takes a good on the remote system.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.950
Similar Where we house service file.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:08.340
If you see here this is the same thing over here.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.970
Aren't service file alright there?

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:16.540
Cell for this lecture In next video we are going toe Execute this wells and see how it is

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.050
going to create deployments and services.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.710
Thanks for watching this video.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.010
See you in the next video.
