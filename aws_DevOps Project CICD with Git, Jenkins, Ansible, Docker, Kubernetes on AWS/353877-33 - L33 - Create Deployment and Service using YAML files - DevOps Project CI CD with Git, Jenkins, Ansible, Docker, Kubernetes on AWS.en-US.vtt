00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
Hello,

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.660
folks.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome back.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.900
In previous video,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.010
we have seen how to use Cube CTL command line to create our deployments Armed services.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.150
In this video,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.650
I'm going to show you how can we use deployment and service files?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.640
I have already creators.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.170
Harvey's under deployment files for our project.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.340
So it is updated in our simple develops project.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.250
Let's go here.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:32.030
So here we have.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.910
Relax,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.780
E deploy under galaxy service,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.670
our Jim Dirty Galaxies our plane for this client.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.740
We are creating our co opportunity set up.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.450
Let's open it and we'll see what is there in this.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.720
All right,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.320
this is the kubernetes deployment file.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.660
We have washings in our Coburn.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.720
It is filed writing.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.720
So ap A.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.960
What should we need to do?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.440
And kind you need to space weather.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.320
What kind of service you are creating?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.830
We are doing the deployment.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.690
Apart from deployment parties,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.160
the replication control it.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.710
Is there services there?

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.220
So depends upon what kind of thing you are doing.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.690
According to that unity space feeder kind here we are using the deployment on DA next.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.710
That deployment of name,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.750
we are giving this one on the label.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.130
Also,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.220
we are giving the same.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.190
This is the APP label with this name that up.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.790
Get creator on the replications.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.730
Whatever instructions we have given in the common land similar way we are creating to

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.420
replications Next.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.670
I don't talk about this one right now.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.510
We'll talk about once we have done initial set up.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.400
So initially I don't copy this one in our court Next template.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.140
So template is nothing better to create our part Water template.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.670
It should use the app name again It is They will accede there Warps project then container

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.790
named This is the container name Biloxi develops project on from where it has to take the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.360
image that is wearing kill Simple develops Demo.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.950
We haven't to creator this repository yet.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.900
If I goto over darker hub so we're young kills.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.650
So with my ankles account,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.800
we have only simple develops images there One more.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.040
Reportedly we are going to create and push the image into that repository and pull it from

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.720
here on the container port on which port number our application is going to run.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.250
It is run some port number 800 which we are using from starting.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.650
So this is our deployment file Similar where we have service file as well.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.850
So whatever we executor from the common land Same things would be there.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.700
Artisan toe that we need to give the proper syntax.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.360
We should follow this index well,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.700
creating over normal people.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.820
Same thing we are doing.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.780
So the api a Washington Be one on the kind.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.500
If you see here,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.420
this is service So name of the service We are giving relaxes service on the app.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.650
They should be same as our deployment.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.250
Let me open the deployment file as well.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.550
So in the deployment in the deployment we have given as they relax,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.550
it develops project.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.010
Same thing we should give here next selector it Select Stop this container and it creates a

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.630
load balancer Now under ports.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.480
If you see here,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.900
our application is running.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.540
Port number,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.840
age rate zero in the container on the target port.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.750
Nothing but in the cluster level we are exposing onto port number 800 So this is art part

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.210
level.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.650
This is our Coburn.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.750
It is cluster level.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.630
This is to external nothing But from outside we want to access.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.860
In previous video,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.580
we have used tatty toes and one because it randomly created.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.000
But I don't want to create it randomly because it would create randomly.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.320
I need toe open each and every porter.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.040
Diab Lee,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.230
a secretive group level,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.550
which is not possible.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.770
That's why I'm fixing that this application should be Always expose on port number 31,200

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.060
so that I can open only the sport number in the security group level so that we can access

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.950
over application.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.660
Got it.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.550
Now we are going to use these two files to create our part.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.410
Let's go on to create these files in our system.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.570
First,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.650
let me copy it.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.360
Let's go on over.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.860
Server,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.850
This is our master server,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.520
Peter Bloody am.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.160
Under route.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.890
That's okay.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:49.050
Cat relaxes service on DA.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:58.400
I'm copying because it is a,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.280
um l feel we should follow the appropriate spaces as it is.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.550
We need to copy next to go back.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.560
I'm also creating the deployment file.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.120
So cat,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.050
relax e d plight on a carpet of fine.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:27.040
Okay.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.250
I helped copied it.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.420
As I said,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.750
let me remove the strategy.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.300
So were you.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:43.950
We will keep only replications and I will explain that once we executed with this.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.740
I'm just serving the felt.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.210
Okay,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.050
Now we have deployment and service files.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.720
How?

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.310
We have created deployment on surveys earlier.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.200
Similar Where?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.480
We are going to create through files this time.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.870
But here we are not using the engine x application.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.900
We are using our one application.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.190
So yeah,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.300
we don't help this one for testing.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.030
What I will do.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.050
I will just change The de Moya's emits so that that image is already available.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.680
It pulls the image and create a part with that one.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.950
Let's go and do that.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.450
Three A.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.710
Relax,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.750
it deployment.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.920
So what is the image we need?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.200
That is simple.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.210
Develops image.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.350
That is the one we are we were using.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.450
Same thing I'm going to use in this lab as well.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.840
Everything is set.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.530
First,

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.930
we should create a deployment,

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.700
then service.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.760
So to create your deployment,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.750
we should Executive Command called Cube City.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.810
L let me clear the screen to create a deployment.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.090
We should executing a command called Cube City Ill.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.990
Same comment.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.710
Cube city,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.820
Ill on Ah,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.650
play our play minus f.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.640
Nothing but file.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.030
So whatever instructions are there in this Well,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.430
please,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.000
our play Those with that one,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.860
it is going to create a deployment.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.460
Okay.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.850
Deployment is created.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.150
Cube C t yell,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.550
get deployment.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.620
Okay,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.270
now you can see yet this is our previous one on that.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.270
This is the current one we have.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.880
Relax a deployment on DeVito that to desired systems.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.500
That is what?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.270
They're in the pile.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.030
And currently both are running up to date Onda available.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.530
Both are not available yet.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.650
Let me execute it one more time.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.250
Yes.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.500
This time it is available.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.830
Nothing.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.950
But it is accessible.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.420
It is 15 seconds.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.630
So it was getting ready under tow.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.560
A world confusion.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.710
Let me remove this sample engine ICS Cube,

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:54.570
CTL delete deployment and also service.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.880
Also,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.710
I'm going to delete Cube.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:03.750
See Thiel get services and we haven't created service for our will accede deployment yet.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.350
Let me remove it,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.580
Cube.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:14.250
See the yellow Dailide Sort of these can be pretty.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.710
Execute,

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.890
We hope Only default service.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.350
Let me create the service.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.740
Same commander to create a service Cube City alive.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:27.900
Play Minah Sierra under the service name service.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.350
Also God created Let's get the services.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.170
Okay,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.820
we can see here we have your service on.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.350
Let me get the part as well.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:40.550
Cube CTL get ports on the boat are running.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.320
Okay,

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.690
good.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.900
From two minutes minus what you can see here.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.650
These two are running in the two different systems to make sure that it is highly available

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.650
.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.430
No,

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.950
To access our application,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:59.080
we need to use the kubernetes Masters RR ap followed by our external port.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.750
What is our external port in service file.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.750
We house Pittsford.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.480
That is 31,200.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.690
This is the port number.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.350
We should access our application.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.410
So let's go into console.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.750
I'm going here where?

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.340
He was accessing my engine Ex.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.950
Let me change the port.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.020
Okay?

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.480
I can't access it right now because we should open this port number in the security group

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.850
level.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.550
