00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
Hello,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.660
folks.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.350
Welcome back in this video I will show you how we can turn our Pasta Jenkins job.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.760
In previous video,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.240
we have seen how to set up your Jenkins over currently how logged in and I'm out homepage.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.650
We can create the jobs by going into new item.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.080
If it is a fresh face,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.450
you can see here to create your job.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.580
Let's go to new item here.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.050
We should provide our Jenkins job name.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
I will give my first job.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.970
It is a freestyle project here.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.730
You can provide the description.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.450
I'm going to you my first job.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:50.830
Then underserved scored management.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.900
We can choose only none for now because we haven't installed any plug ins which are related

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.740
toe source code management,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.850
like a gato big bucket are Israel so no options are going to show right now.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.150
Next one,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.450
we are going to use build in this job.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.020
We hope couple off options over here mostly will see execute windows Bash Command if you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.700
were target system is windows on the one put on some comment are we can choose execution if

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.150
target system is Lennox.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.650
You never kiss.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.970
We are going toe.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.490
Choose.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.200
Execute shell Because our target system is Lennox.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.970
I'm going to give just echo.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.150
Welcome to there were hopes Project.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
Okay,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.660
I'll play this.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.750
See you.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.890
And once it it saved you can build this job.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.010
This is the option toe.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.660
Build your job if you want to modify it again.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.510
Goto configure Now I'm executing building.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.750
No.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.060
Whenever you excluded,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.340
it creates a build job over here.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.280
So this is our faster build.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.260
You can see a blue ball here means it is successful Usually if it is your blue ball,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.530
that means that our job is success.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.100
In case if it is read,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.450
our job is failed.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.330
Sometimes it may be in orange color nothing but partiality.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.010
Success.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.150
You can see the console output by clicking over here.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.930
This job executor by admin user That is what it is showing here.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.550
Next we have executive the A commander Col vehicle So what is the output off that common?

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.770
Same you can see in the output Then this job finished successfully.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.010
This is how we can create a Jenkins job and run it in next video We are going to see how to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.310
set up on install Get plug in on building by suited
