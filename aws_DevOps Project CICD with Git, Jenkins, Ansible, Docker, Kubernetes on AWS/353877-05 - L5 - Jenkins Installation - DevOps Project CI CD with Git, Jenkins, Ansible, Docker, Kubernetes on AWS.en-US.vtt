00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.830
Hello.

00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.420
Folks will come back in this section.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.850
I'm going to show you how we can deploy I an easy to container by using their warps

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.160
pipeline for this purpose.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.050
We should have your dollar prick ord in the get hub repository.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.440
Then our Jenkins can ableto pull their court on the build under our Jenkins.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.840
Also use it as a deployment tool.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.350
It would replace on your target environment.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.510
In this section,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.350
we are going to see any C two instance which is running with Tom Care as our target in

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.750
government.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.670
So as we discussed in the outlier section,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.090
our court is available in our way ankles account,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.500
every project recalled.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.890
Hello,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.220
world.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.200
I will just show you that this is our way and kill account.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.750
Here we have your hello world repository as well as simple develops project report It rips

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.300
Hello.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.050
World is a job based web application going inside.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.450
We can see us.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.050
Sarver Overbear per doctor filed bomb dot XML read me file.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.140
These are the contents off our hello world repository.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.440
But I'm not much interested about this court because the purpose off this training is how

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.020
we can take this quarter build writing this court is the dollar purse work.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.510
We are going to use this court toe build under deployed again.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.700
Come back to overflow.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.420
No,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.600
we don't have.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.820
Jenkins are very it.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.540
And also,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.240
we don't have Tomcat server.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.000
We are going to set it up this true taste to this deployment with that.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.980
Let's go on.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.830
Install Jenkins Jenkins.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.690
Insulation pro Caesar also operated in over Repository.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.990
We have documents.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.510
Report it.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.820
Recall the simple develops project in the same so simple.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.660
The works project go inside.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.150
So this you can find your folder called Jenkins.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.690
Under Jenkins.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.720
We have you file called Jenkins installation.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.230
It has all the instructions how to install Jenkins.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.160
I will quickly run through it so that we know what steps we should follow.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.970
Initially,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.620
we need an easy two instance.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.060
We haven't created it.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.470
It on da secretly group of each open sport number a jury,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.190
Jiro because Jenkins runs on port number eijiro eijiro.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.960
Then install java.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.300
Because this is the prerequisites after Java installation,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.830
we need to set up home pot off our Java.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.590
I will show you how to do that.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.790
Well,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.080
once it is done,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.250
we can install Jenkins Jenkins packages we can Don't learn from this,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.770
you oral.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.380
Even we can google it toe,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.420
get the Seaworld.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.150
But just for reference I have given here.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.110
Once a Jenkins has been installed successfully,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.340
we can start Jenkin service on Daxing it from the browser because this sport we are going

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.450
toe open heart security group level.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.710
Once it is accessible,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.740
we should log in and change the password apartment.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.070
Why?

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.700
Because it comes with other default password once logged in tow.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.740
Jenkins console.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.370
We should set up the Jerry cape part as well.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.790
Nothing.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.800
But where exactly?

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.230
Java has been installed on our Jenkin server.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.770
Then for testing purpose Weekend.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.340
Rainier.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.120
My first job just to see that Jenkins is functioning fine with that,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.880
Let's jump into our ear oblivious console on the creating.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.250
An easy two instance Services select.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.480
Easy to instance,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.790
we can launch an instance in this program.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.300
I'm going to use our Major Lennox for most off our they were up stools installation because

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.320
it is pretty easy to manage on,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.920
and I would recommend you toe use the same operating system so that you don't end Contrave

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.200
eight.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.690
Any new issues well,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.250
following our videos hence and select eating.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.580
I'm a generally next.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.850
It is a Tito micro.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.760
I'm not changing anything over here.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.250
Discuss Eyes is fine Name I'm giving it as a Jenkin server.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.460
Jenkin server Security group.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.600
I'm going toe create a new security group secretly group name.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.850
I will give you the wops.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.150
Understood Project Security group.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.580
I'm going to add one more route because Jenkins runs on port number Eijiro Eijiro.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.880
We must open port number Eijiro,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.800
eijiro and the description also I'm going to give the same Launch it now We should choose a

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.000
keep here I How in existing Keeper called a works project.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.460
If you don't have one,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.400
you can create yet keep it under Don't know that.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.430
Keep it to log into over server So choose the existing Keep it in our case on the lunch it

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.650
because I have this Keep it It takes couple off minutesto get it launched I will wait until

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.350
it comes up.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.050
Let me refresh the screen.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.770
Alright,

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.550
Surgeries running state Let me take the public ap off the server.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.330
I'm using a tool called a more by external to log in tow over server.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.880
We can also use Pootie toe connect over servers.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.810
But I would recommend you to use more by extreme because you don't need to convert.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.240
He will keep her from Pimco PPK.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.650
If you want to connect,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.890
I can use my pinky directly to connect over servers.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.650
I have choose sensation.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.850
Then s is hit.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.450
Provided the remote host i p address on DA use.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.750
Private key.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.550
This is the works project that Pym I'm using a pinky and user easy to minus user.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.080
All right,

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.950
I hope connected to my server.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.300
I'm increasing foreign.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.350
Say's let's become your route because we are doing installations.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.400
We must help root privileges as they discussed the first we need to install Java before

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.510
installing Java.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.800
We'll check the job over shit because amazingly,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.020
next by default comes with the job.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.430
Abortion Wonder seven.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.600
I would recommend you to removed a wondered seven on use.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.670
Wondered it to remove.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.130
Wondered.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.490
Seven.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.370
Washing from the server you can use,

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:46.260
um remove job minus wondered $7 to Jiro start because after this whatever is there,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.450
you can remove it.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.600
Okay,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.510
I have removed if we check for Java Washam No,

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.350
nothing is there.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.250
Let's install Java one about it Clear the screen.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:02.260
Young install job minus wondered.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:09.770
Eight Start it installs Java were not eight on our Jenkin server.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.370
Yes,

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.050
to install.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:19.970
No installation is completed after Java installation.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:26.300
We need to sit home part of our job over for that We should find wherever Jerry exist.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.020
We held this command in our document We can just search for Java Wonder Day to start by

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:41.280
using find command It gives us very our Jeriome are jar file available?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.250
This is the actual part off our J r E.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.290
We can see that by using your less miners.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.850
L SLUss Jerry,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.130
You can see it is available under this part.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.240
I'm giving control.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.550
See?

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.250
We need to set this one as our part.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.680
Let's set the home pot Let clear this screen so to set home.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.650
But under our home directory,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.440
we can use Siri killed.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:17.950
So we are going toe home Directory off Our user are nothing but root user now v a dark bash

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.550
under square profile.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.740
Under this,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:31.120
we should provide over job a whole But so I will you here Java under square home is the

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.500
cold of ah J r e I thought and Also,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.360
we need to add it to part John,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.850
uh,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.650
under square home.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.550
So this world,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.600
that's it.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.680
We have set up our Java home pot.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.070
Now echo gore dollar java under square home.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.240
Me,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.540
Craig,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:52.750
you.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:58.980
It doesn't show you the full pot way because we need to log off on the large in tow.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.450
Get it?

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.040
Effect.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.800
So let's log off again.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.550
I really large in as here route.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.370
No,

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.440
let me execute the same command.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.530
Now you can see the latest,

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.360
but this is how you can set up home.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.580
But now let's install Jenkins.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.220
If you tried to install,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:18.840
um,

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.070
install Jenkins directly,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.340
it doesn't work because it doesn't have the report it.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.600
Reese toe pulling the court for that purpose.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.010
Let's jump into browser search for Jenkins.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.790
Down Lord,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:39.190
Faster Link itself Tells about Jenkins.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.520
Start.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.550
I was last don't,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.810
Lord.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.150
This is the official website where we condone Lord Jenkins.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.990
We have long term support abortion under weekly release,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.350
it is always best practice to use long term support abortion because it is tested one.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.420
And if we scroll down,

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.270
we have you Red hat Fedora sent ways of major clinics supports for the swim.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.910
So click over here and you can see the instructions.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.170
What?

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.190
You need to do this?

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.880
To use this reported rerun The following comments.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:16.080
We must run these comments to set up Jenkins repository in our server.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.150
So I'm learning this command first.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.050
Next to go back,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.650
take the commander toe are key.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.650
I'm marrying key as well.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.850
Once it is done,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.280
let me executive Jenkins in sole command once again.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.230
Young,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.450
install Jenkins.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.210
All right.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:45.420
Now we can ableto find the Jenkins software and we are installing it.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.450
May take you well.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.400
Alright,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.340
Jenkins.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.850
Installation is successful.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.670
No.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:00.650
Let's see the Jenkin Service Service Jenkins status.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.860
It isn't.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.230
Stop.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.680
It stood.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.850
Let me start it.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.720
I helped start our Jenkins against you.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.270
The status it's working.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:10.970
No.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:17.000
Will try to access our Jenkins application from the browser for there to take the public AP

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.450
off our Jenkins server.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.590
Goto browser Jenkins.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.800
Run,

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.060

Port number eijiro eijiro access for the website.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.370
So it is getting ready.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.350
We need to wait for your Well,

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.950
here you go.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:39.590
So it's asking us to provide the password to login by departure.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.950
You can find a password in this location.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.170
Let's go back on the cactus.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.470
Well,

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.450
you can see the art of generator.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.110
Password.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.360
Go back.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.960
Probably this password.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.130
Continue Whenever you initially log in,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.970
they were drinking,

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:56.230
sir,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.000
or after set up it to suggest toe install,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.890
few plug ins.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:03.300
But we are not installing any plug ins right now.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.050
We install later point off.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.040
Time depends upon the necessity.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.120
For time being,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.350
I'm skipping the step.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.200
Now.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.820
Our Jenkins is ready.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.490
Start using Jenkins.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.260
All right,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.230
This is our fresh Jenkins council.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.110
I have just logged in as a discussed.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.560
We need to change our passport to change our password.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:26.880
Nothing,

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.970
but I mean password.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.680
We need to goto user called art mean Here.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.370

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.650

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.280

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.140
You have your option called password.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.820
I'm changing my password.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:51.050

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.360
I have successfully changing my password.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.950
That's where I got locked up.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.180
Let me browse the web site again on the religion,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:08.180

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.950
now I have changed my default password.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.690
Next thing is we need to set up our job.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.320
A home pot for that.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.790
The easier option called man is Jenkins.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.570
We should go here to manage our Jenkins most of the time.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.090
Let's go inside to manage Jenkins.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.780
There is a option called drinkin Stool conflagration.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.800
This is the option.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.810
We should choose to configure our configure Our Jerry G.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.490
So far,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.250
we haven't added anything,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:46.330
so our Jerry k I will give java underscore oil home on the job.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.150
A home part.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.350
Let me grab it from here.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.140
Echo dollar,

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.420
Java underscored home.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.270
This is our job home part.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.650
Go back again.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:06.900
And if you give any type O it immediately says that it is not right,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.820
but so Okay,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.960
it looks good right now.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.050
I'll play seven.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.550
Okay.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.160
With that,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.890
I can say that our initial checkup off Jenkins is done in next video,

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.550
we will run our Foster Jenkins job until then by suited.
