00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
in previous video,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.050
we have set up til four steps now fifth step is created and I am user.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.500
Let's jump into Regrettably is console.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.550
Go to services.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.700
I am.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.250
I am opening in the new top.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:27.250
Let's go here and go to rules because we are creating rolls over here.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.550
Create your role,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.940
this role we are goingto attached to use it to instance or select.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.150
Easy to instance.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:42.050
Then we should attach the policies so we should attach easy to full access.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.410
Next.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.790
Yes,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.080
three.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:55.250
Full access but old 53 full lances earned.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.650
I am for Alexis This four policies we should attach extra tag name.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.420
I'm giving it as it cool.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.540
Bernadis the rules Next Who?

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.970
Burnett.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:14.650
ISS rule.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.780
Okay,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.810
and you can see here we have attached four policies for this role.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.050
Create your rules.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.850
Now let's attach this roll over the easy to instance.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.090
Go back on.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.510
But this is the cover notice management severity.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.350
They were going toe.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.220
Actions go to instance,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.780
settings attach under replace.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.220
I am ruled here.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.710
We should choose Cuban noticed role play.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.050
That's it.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.200
Now let's execute the AWS Ciolek comment that is the next to step so irritably is configure

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.200
.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.420
We need to execute,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.880
Aired,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.510
oblivious.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.760
Can figure I'm still on my one to sister and you can see it's asking for access key we

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.050
don't need because we have a natural secret access key.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.830
Also on region.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.820
I'm going toe work on Mumbai region.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.490
So,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.750
mom,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.610
Berries and name is it be so one earned output.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.680
Let it be Jason body for two days,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.550
edges and output.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.270
So we have set up our boon to system to create kubernetes cluster on our irritably a second

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.980
one.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.620
Last thing we need to do that is to create your old 53 records it So this is done the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.770
system next create road 53.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.850
Private Mr John,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.530
let's jump in again.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.110
Under your ablaze concern services about 53 comes under networking.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.650
So here we have about 53 and just to opening a new tab.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.930
So no host regions we have so far go to get started.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.250
No,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.650
create hosted June.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:08.600
So we are using relaxing Darknet galaxy darknet as our domain and it is prayer.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.420
It was surgeon well choosing private host region.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.150
You should choose your reason as well.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.270
In our case,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.280
we are using Mumbai.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.350
Reason created.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.050
Seventh step is done.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.540
It's step.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.040
We need to create a word.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.380
Yes.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.150
Three bucket.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.210
Let me open services.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.550
Let me go under stories.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.470
We have a history.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.720
So let's open this.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.210
So far,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.410
I don't have any buckets on this account.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.910
Let's see.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.270
Yep.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.310
We don't have any.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.590
Booker's I can create bucket from year are ALS.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.620
I can't run terribly.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.140
A c l a common from here.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.650
Let's execute terribly a cli command.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.850
Let me copy this one.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.050
So?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.800
So you're oblivious.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.330
Yes.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.750
Three.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.560
Um be nothing but make bucket on the wirral off the bucket.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.850
What do you want to create?

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.730
And if this bucket is not available,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.850
it throws an era.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.710
Hopefully lead is available.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:22.770
I have given the name as a day more Cooper Nitties Well Accident Mitt and even my cluster

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.550
nimal time going to use the same.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.950
So that would be easy to recognize.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.110
Yes,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.080
we got this bucket make bucket.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.120
It is successful.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.850
And if I go on refreshing may terribly is console.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.490
Yeah,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.730
we can see that and nobody's empty.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.640
Once we're on,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.850
cops come and we can see some of the configuration files.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.450
Let's go back we should export it so that our cops can able to use it.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.550
Cops State store Is he called our is three bucket.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.550
Let's exclude this command to export over the street market turned gender it Keep it

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.000
because this keep its are used to log in to our kubernetes cluster.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.140
If we don't create it,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.220
we cannot able to log into over cluster later point off.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:21.740
So we must generate keys so I'm generating keys only creates under Dr Associated directory

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.250
and you can see ID er etc already on a ship up.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.560
So this idea a step up get copied onto Cuban It is clustered.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.950
So by using this key weaken luggage.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.950
All right,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.850
now let's go back.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.480
Exude the cops Commander to generate Cuban it is cluster definitions So let me copy this

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.490
one as it is As they explained earlier,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.800
cops create cluster We're creating cluster Amira Publius clothes Next availability Joan

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.860
name here I'm using a p Soto one be because I'm using member region.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.420
Even my develops environment is available in Mumbai region.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.090
I helped created my Road 53 record search on Mumbai region So my kubernetes cluster also

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.290
should be available on member Reason under Mumbai reason AP Soto one babies one after

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.590
available region If you are using some other region,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.320
make sure that you are going to use the right availability.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.130
Joan Name Over here other ways you will be Incontrera Davidian error While creating your

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.610
cluster reason name You can find it out on your ear.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.610
W's console,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.960
right Third top cardinal on the name off our clustered I have given the same name whatever

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.170
bucket name I help given so that it would be read into color and easy to identify then DNs

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.580
June.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.990
Well,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.850
actually Darknet under DNS it is prayer it Let's execute.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:58.890
Okay?

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.170
It has been executed on the will.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.950
Scroll up on the sea water and all conflagration it created.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.350
If you see here,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.650
if you see here,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:16.180
it is creating its operative vpc it don't use the existing vpc usually in the real time we

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.550
are not going to store our develops environment Onder target environment in the same BBC's

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.050
due to security reasons.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.280
Same thing I'm following here.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.090
So we are creating separate re pieces submitted security groups just I'm running quickly

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.160
through these waters.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.850
Reality is going to do a round tables it is creating.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.950
Managed the files.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.150
Launch conflagration.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.050
Keep it.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.950
I am role.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.550
Devious volume Auto scaling group.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.020
Okay,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.590
that's it.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.210
These all research is it is going to create.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.450
That's way we should grant access toe all the services to create it.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.460
VPC we didn't give.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.440
But whenever we give you easy to instance,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.350
it gets the VPC access as well.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.350
All right?

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.350
No.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.890
It also listed the station to list the clusters.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.750
We can execute this command.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.450
Okay.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:18.910
So far,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.780
we have creator only one cluster,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.590
then toe edit our cluster.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.530
This is the command under tow.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.960
Edit our instance.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.810
Numbers are instance types we can used this command.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.970
It goes to the configuration file off our north under.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.940
If we want to modify our master,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.450
we can exude this comment.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.950
I will just to show you our master how it is going to create.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:47.500
You can see this is kind of Farmall file How we are going to create a deployment on

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.950
Saturdays Files so kind of meta data name specifications.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.540
It is pulling images and creating mission papers.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.650
See for large.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.020
If you need smaller system,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.350
you can update here and ah,

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.580
the sub knit Okay.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.450
Under which subject should it create?

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.470
But all all this information would be there.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.890
If you need any changes,

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.350
you can modify Belgium start.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.770
I need to monsters.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.050
I can update over here maxes and minces.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.650
Okay,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.060
that's how we can do.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.710
But we are not changing anything.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:26.060
Let it be as it is next to create a cluster Here we have a command.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:32.150
So it also says that finally configuring were clustered with cops Update cluster minus

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.750
minutes Name clustered name followed by a minuses option.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:41.080
Whenever we execute this comment then only our cluster is going to get creative Let's

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:48.850
execute on going See Let it run on We see in the system level what's happening here?

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.750
It is going to create new files.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.490
Okay,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:58.490
you can see here one folder God created And if we go some off the files are there on the AM

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:05.150
role we have created these And these all were existing ones only if we see two more rolls

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.550
God created on go to Road 53.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.860
We have created these two records by default it comes No,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.150
let me refresh it.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:20.850
We can see artisanal groats got creative And if I Goto Instances,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:27.150
Instances also we can see the additional instances are getting launched.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.130
Yes,

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:37.950
you can see here Nord North Demo under one more also nor the demo one master to North's Ark

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:38.950
getting created.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:45.900
And also if we go down it also creates lunch configuration Nothing But due to some reason,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.430
any of these systems go stone It creates automatically.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.460
You can see here See,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:57.390
for large Tito medium I'm not a scaling group also God created so that in case off any

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:02.350
failure occurred stood these north It is going to recreate Fine.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:07.510
This is how we can create Our cluster will wait until it comes up.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.730
So whether it completed the set up or not,

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:11.760
we can see that one.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.300
By executing this command,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:22.790
you can see here Still it is in air upstate once it is ready you don't get this era once

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.250
systems already we can log in by exuding this command.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.070
Okay,

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:32.230
this will log in tow over Master note parents instead of using their DNS name,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.650
we can directly use the public AP off our master server.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.250
If I go to your loveliest console,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:47.040
this is our master server and we can take this public AP and a large in either rebuild Work

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.470
on.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.850
Also,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.480
we can manage our classle from here itself because it is they want to system on DWI

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.950
installed Cube CTL comments.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.480
Okay.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.330
From here we can exclude Cube citadel comments are ALS.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.550
We can log into master there also weaken,

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.950
install,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.250
cube,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.320
citadel and manage our cluster.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.230
Either way would be fine but I would be using my kubernetes masters or what?

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.610
To eggs.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:16.720
Got all these comments rather than managing from open to system I mean to say rather than

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:23.200
managing our cluster from the this system this is Kubernetes management's overwinter system

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.200
.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.650
I will manage make Leicester from here itself.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.650
But we should install Cube CDL on this system as well.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.160
So let's wait until it is ready.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.750
Yes,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.410
toe by toe.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.100
State of sticks No,

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.900
let's eggs Good.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.390
Our command cops valued it.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:44.240
Cluster still It is showing that not really wait for some more time because it is saying

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.910
that please wait 5 to 10 minutes for your master to start.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.350
Okay,

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.410
here.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.650
If you see Master,

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:58.770
see for large north t two medium on the two notes it is creating under yappy Sotus toe one

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.050
b.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.810
Okay,

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:01.950
it is getting ready.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:12.720
Okay.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.090
Tar noted Study or six.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.300
Good.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:15.530
No.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.070
Yes,

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.150
we can see No,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:23.350
All the systems are fine Now It is showing that our Kubernetes cluster is ready.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.490
Let's connect.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.950
Or Cuban it is clustered.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.710
So we have your command.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.450
Let me get that.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.450
So this is the commander toe connect our kubernetes cluster.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.210
And if you observe a here it is taking over.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.250
Idea rests here Under lacking as it admin user,

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:45.060
we should not like it as a root user we should like in as admin user.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.470
Yes,

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:51.410
I want to connect First time I'm connecting and you can see here Admin I heard locked into

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:59.660
1 26 And if I go and check this I p address over here My cluster ap is 1 26 Yes.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.760
33.1 26 thirties cluster mastery p All right.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.240
Our cluster is ready And if I exit,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.190
I'm on my way.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:17.630
Going to system Let me clear the screen on the fire on Cube CTL get north is the commander

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.010
toe.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.650
Nobody were notes.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.730
We can see here.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:26.650
We have one master to North's are there and it's creator around three minute single.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.910
That's all for this video in next.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.170
Really,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.350
we are going to see how to work with the Cube Citadel comments.
