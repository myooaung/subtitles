00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
Hello,

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.270
folks.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.180
Welcome back to decision in this video.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.050
I'm going to show you How can we created Jenkins job?

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
So do their deployment on Kubernetes cluster.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
To do that when we need to log into our Jenkins server.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.260
I just brought up our Jenkins or where it is still inning initial aging start butter.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.610
We got public AP.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.350
Let's log in.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:28.790
General Jiro are going and for a sword.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.530
So I have locked into my Jenkins council here.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.560
We should create our Jenkins job.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.110
So do the deployment for that one.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.550
Let's go to the new item.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.050
So did play.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.780
Okay?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.970
Deploy on Kubernetes City job and it is a free still project and walk it so we just need to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.840
execute comments under answerable how we were doing earlier.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.730
Similar way We don't do anything over here because we don't want o build with to this job.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.260
We just want to deploy post a bill Accents go to send the build artifacts over.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.430
It's a church on on which,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.620
sir?

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.650
Where do we want to run this playbooks?

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.230
The designs Bull server On what?

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.690
Playbooks.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.550
We should run that we should space way over here.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.650
So let me copy the playbooks.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.570
Clear the screen,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.150
Peter.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.650
Bloody.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:34.300
They're less so I'm going to run answerable playbook and simple playbook minus a on the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.150
part slash hosts hosts are there.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.780
Then again,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.600
part earned.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.830
What is the final in?

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.660
So first,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.150
we should create a deployment for the deployment of this is doc file.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.410
All right.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.350
And we can give them equal on here while executing this command continuously are inter also

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.750
fine.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.850
Stay that way.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:07.950
Next commanders seem we are going toe execute the service file.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.450
So Service hood,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.440
that's it.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.850
Our play on Syria.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.800
So I helped create a Jenkins job.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.230
No.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.800
Let's go and remove whatever we created earlier by executing manually.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.080
I'm on my Cuban.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.170
It is Master Nord Cube.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.870
CTL delete deployed cubes.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.480
It'll delete to deployment.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.950
Our deployment of name is will accede Deployment similar here,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.510
Cube CTL daily.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.650
It sort of ease our service name is relaxes service.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.650
Let me clear the screen.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.210
We'll see.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:03:00.150
The parts first know parts are there then nor deployments are there?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.350
No services are there.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.830
Once I exited my Jenkins job,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.400
we could able to see that one.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.050
And also one more thing.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.120
We cannot able to access our application right now because parts are not did.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.190
Once we execute that job,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.050
we could able to see all this stuff.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.050
And ah,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.250
we could able to access the application.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.490
Let's build this.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.760
No.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.650
Okay,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.850
let me refresh it.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.120
Look,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.380
you're building successful,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.430
okay?

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.580
There isn't some defecation warning,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.410
but our jobs are successful.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.850
Let's go and see in our system.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.650
Let me get the parts.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.430
Yes,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.450
Parts are there.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.650
Let me get the deployments.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.910
Let me get the services.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.740
OK?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.800
Everything is fine.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.850
And I am also trying to access my application from the browser.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.850
So everything is working as expected.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.060
Now one more step Togo is.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.090
Whenever we push any court,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.740
it should create a new images to create a new you Miss.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.110
We can use our previous job nothing but which we used to create our remisiers on going back

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.050
and I will show you.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.670
Okay,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.650
Deploy on docker container using answerable playbooks and con figuration.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.890
Please.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.300
Go on,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.750
See?

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.930
So this is what we were using.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.250
It pulls the court from the get hurt.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.650
It checks the court for every minute under do the build.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.060
Creative,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.040
careful and copied of our file unwto answerable server answerable server creating an image

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.550
by using this playbook under deep.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.280
Lay down your doctor host as a docker container.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.660
But in our case,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.850
we have created a sooty job which can deploy your emails on your kubernetes cluster.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.010
Now we just newly Annie May's so until creating any team is I mean to say,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.720
until this playbook would be sufficient for us so that I would see a job just to creation

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.960
Dark Kareem is on the city job.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.450
Take that image in the deploy Tanya Kubernetes Cluster.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.230
How can we do that?

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.220
One We are going to see in our next video until then.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.830
Bye.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.650
See you there.
