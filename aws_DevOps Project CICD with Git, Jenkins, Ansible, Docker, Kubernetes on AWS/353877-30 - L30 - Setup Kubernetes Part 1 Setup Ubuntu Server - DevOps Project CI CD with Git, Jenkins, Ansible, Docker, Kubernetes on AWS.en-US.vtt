00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
Hello,

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.060
friends.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.500
Welcome to decision Indecision.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.400
We're going to talk about how to set up.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.530
Kubernetes on irritably is for this We need to follow some of the steps which I have

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.030
updated.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.450
Never get Herb Repository.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.310
Let's jump into over get help repository and see what and all steps we should execute to

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.650
set up kubernetes on AWS.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.660
This is my get help repository where we help Kubernetes folder lots jumping and we have you

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.160
file called kubernetes set up dot MD opened this and they hear we held list off the steps

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.800
which we should follow to set up Cooper Nitties to set up communities on the AWS.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.530
First we should create and we've been too easy to instance Once a window system is creator

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.530
,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.650
we should install a laborious yearly.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.170
Next install Cube City,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.250
Ill Cube City Eliza Tool which is useful to manage our kubernetes cluster.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.620
In this case,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.930
if we are managing our kubernetes cluster by using open toe system,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.350
then cube cereal is necessary over here.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.460
Next,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.120
install cops on woman to system cops is useful to set up kubernetes cluster on air

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.750
oblivious.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.040
So we must install cops.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.200
After that,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.160
we should jump into your obliques council creating and I am user our rule In our case we

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.330
are creating window system money audibly s account itself so role would be fine.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.860
This role should have access to route 53 Easy toe.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.820
I am under history So these services we should helpful excess Once we have created rule on

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.760
the attach this I am rolled over 1.2 system After attaching,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.750
we should execute irritably as can figure in case If we are using I am user then we should

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.410
run a Publius configure probably the access Kid and secret access key.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.340
In our case,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.000
we only region name would be fine.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.170
Next to step in the AWS console itself we should create a route 53 private horse sturgeon

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.430
Even we can create a public coaster June If the domain is wound by you only want to access

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.250
it publicly.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.530
But we are doing for testing purpose.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.700
So even though this domain is wound by me,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.530
I'm creating your private holster.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.190
June our don't my name here is well acsi dot net are gyms that we are creating this cluster

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.620
for of Alexa Technologies.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.620
Next we should create as three bucket we can create as three bucket By executing this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.630
Cameron on Woburn to system Because by this time our window system has access to a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.590
Regrettably is council and it has as three full access So we can create from the Arab Lius

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.980
yearly.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.250
Still,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.520
we can create from the console Israel Either we would be fine once we have created bucket

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.100
we should export because our cops is going to store all the conflagration in our s three

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.550
bucket.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.390
Next,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.030
we should create ssh keys on Ruben to system because these a sausage keys are user to log

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.880
into over kubernetes cluster Next to step is to create a kubernetes cluster to create

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.110
kubernetes cluster.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.980
We should proffered that cloud.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.630
What is the cloud we are using?

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.040
We're using aws them Jones Nothing but available region on which available to John we are

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.840
creating didn't clustered name In our case,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.210
we are using cluster name is a dame.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.930
Okay,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.670
this will accede Darknet and ah DNS June.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.930
It is a galaxy dot net under the N s tape.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.850
It is private.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.980
So we are providing this information and also we can provide vpc are any customization you

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.950
want to do You can do over here.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.130
But this command would be sufficient to create our cluster definition.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.210
It won't create actual cluster it.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.320
Just create the definitions to create cluster.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.680
We should exclude this command.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.060
Whenever we exclude This commanded actually creates our cluster honorably as counsel,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.110
we can see that I am rolls Route 53 Regard certain artist scaling group Easy to instances.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.390
All these are getting created while running.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.120
This command undertakes a well to set up our cluster.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.350
We should wait five or 10 minutes to see that one.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.820
And we can exhibit cops validate cluster to check whether our classroom is ready or not.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.090
Once it is ready,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.440
we can start exuding cubes Ideal comments Even you can run these cubes.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.580
It'll comments by logging into our master account as well.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.700
But they're also we should install Cube City l I will just to show you I will just to show

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.190
you How can we do that one Once it is done,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.650
If you don't want to this cluster anymore,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.820
we can execute this command toe Delete the cluster in over case we don't use it.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.850
But if you are practicing you want to delete over cluster.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.770
You can do that.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.950
One.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.920
Whenever we were executed to dilute all the definitions from Muriella Publius account on

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.740
the remove.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.950
The resource is all right.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.510
Once it is done,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.370
we are going to test our kubernetes cluster by creating parts,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.150
deployments and services.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.750
This we're going to see in the another station.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.200
So let's go on to do this one right now.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.080
So first we are going to create any C two instance I'm jumping onto my irritably as counsel

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.950
running instances.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.500
Jiro,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.650
A health stopped all my instances.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.060
These are our develops instances.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.850
Let it being stopped the state until our cluster is ready.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.410
Launch instance.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:28.050
So we are creating year movinto system which is user to manage our kubernetes cluster.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.350
This woman to system is not part off our kubernetes cluster.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:43.340
So to do micro nothing to change here here as well ARD tags name your burden.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.000
It is management sort of it and name.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.830
It is a Cuban.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.150
It is management server.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.570
Next security group we are going to use the existing security group that is develops

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.910
Project SG then launch on.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.750
We are using existing keep it lunch it We've instances.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.850
Let's wait until it comes up.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.900
Okay?

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.450
Our surgeries and running state Let's connect with this system.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:30.990
Go Tomobe Extra Shushan This is Hitch I'm using Keep it for a woman to system user name is

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.350
goingto not easy to menace User,

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:46.130
please remember that I'm logging into server and let me increase the Frances Okay now ever

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:54.360
the who going to system is ready Clear the scream Become your route Let's execute the

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:03.140
commence from our document So first we should install irritably acea late This is the

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:16.790
command You don't look terribly a c l a bundle Unless we have burned ill Next we should

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:24.020
install on Jeep and fightin because by default to these packages are not available Yes,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:40.850
I want to install next Angie Power bundle terribly this year Labor deal that son gypped.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:55.090
Now execute this command to copy our files under us or local bin Okay,

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.650
now we haven't told irritably s your life.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.720
Let's sexy Good Yes,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.850
we can see before installing if we exclude this commanded Troy an error.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:14.920
Next we should install Cube CDL How we have set up our regrettably insulation larvae just

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.640
takes a good toe.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.760
Don't Lord Cube CTL which year filed.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.250
You can just to see that.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.030
Yes,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.030
we got your file.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.950
Just copy this one under us or local being before that,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.150
Our execution permission.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.950
Next.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.650
I'm copying it.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.850
Okay,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.960
that's done.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.510
Now just driving legs.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.150
Good cube.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.190
CDL It will tell you that syntax.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.600
Error of that's OK now I'm going to install before installing cops.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.200
I will just take the good you can see here.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.110
We haven't installed cops yet.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.750
Let's execute.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.050
No,

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:04.130
this is the commander.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.980
Toe down.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.850
Lower cops.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.890
Okay,

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.950
we heard downloader cops go back.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:19.750
Add execution permission for this to next.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.550
Copy this one on the to us or local bin.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.870
That's it.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.720
Our cops on?

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.500
Certainly no.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.780
This time it says Sendek said,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.600
That's okay.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.490
So far,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.150
we have set up our KUBERNETES management system.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.020
In next video,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.180
we are going to set up a remaining steps
