00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Hello.

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.060
Folks will come back in this section.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.870
We are going to see how to deploy on Docker using answerable.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.610
So far,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.350
we helped build under the play on DACA using Jenkins.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.140
But there are some limitations to use Jenkins.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.660
That's way we are going to introduce answerable as a deployment.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.170
It'll in our environment.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.200
So for our court is available in gate we can ableto build through Jenkins on our target

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.320
environment also is available Nothing better Darker host is available No,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
we should set up answerable so that by using answerable,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.460
we can able to deploy on Docker in this video I'm going to show you how to set up

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.650
answerable environment.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.190
I helped prepare your document to set a principal environment document has been updated in

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.550
over Get hub repository.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.250
Let's go and check it out.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.950
Simple develops project This is our document registry You goto answerable.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.560
We heard poor documents for answerable installation.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.910
This is for our hitch ill But we are going to use our measure.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.450
Lennox,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.820
there is a reason behind that We don't help Docker community reason for Redhead Lennox.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.080
So I'm going to choose a mission Lennox for this to install answerable prerequisites is we

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.140
need an incredibly Assisi to instance,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.450
as a control system.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.640
First we should install python,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.360
then piped on people by using people we are going to install a sensible then create.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.510
Unionists had been user because to manage sensible,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.140
we should have young separate user added this user two suitors fight then generally keep

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.250
areas a user so switchers they're in a sad minimally generate a keeper.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.260
Copy this.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.140
Keep it on target environment.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.880
In our case,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.370
our target environment is the darker host we'll copy over did Then we are going to install

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.850
doctor on our answerable system because the answerable is used to create a Dockery Mees

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.170
That's where we must have darker on the Rdn Assad Mental Docker Group so that Ennis had

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.440
been keen Able to create a darker images,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.930
we should create your directly called slash city Sensible.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.890
Usually this directly should get create in the world abortions but in to rotate we are not

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.880
getting this directly,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.570
so we are going to create it manually and created a host swell to store our hosts

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.350
information.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.480
But in our case,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.640
I'm going to store our doctor host under my answerable server details then we'll do your

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.330
pink test to check it out.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.250
Whether communication is fine or not.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.590
All right,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.550
so for this we need Ian.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.600
I'm a journey.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.760
See?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.400
Two instance.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.650
Let's jump into AWS console and created new You see two instance services issue too.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.950
We have already to running instances when one is Jenkins over.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.450
Another one is doctor host.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.290
Let me lunch New one Our mission Lennox Tito micro Nothing to change here.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:14.150
I mean answerable server Next choosing existing security group.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.850
Launch it.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.150
Let's wait until it get comes up.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.750
Let's refresh it.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.620
Okay,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.100
So where is intermittent state?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.990
Copy the public AP this shushan It's his hitch.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:45.740
You see two minus user I hold ordered my keep the razor.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.450
All right,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.450
become your route.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.640
Let's install python yum Install Fight on Yes,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.150
I want to install it Fight on minus minus Worship That's toward out seven then,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.390
um Install?

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.700
Yes.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.600
Okay.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.350
We have installed people's will know installed Danceable.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:32.250
Alright Installation is successful.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.020
It is saying PP that world or senders.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.450
Okay.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.750
And Sibyl minus minus.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.750
Fortune toe check out over Washington.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.150
It is to rotate and you can see conflict file.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:52.360
Usually this should be slash city Sensible and spilled out CFC but ah in latest worsen,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.340
we don't have answerable directly itself.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:01.350
Let's create one Um que the air slash CTC answerable.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.000
Next.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.750
We need to create your user.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.350
He was a add in that submarine.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.750
Said the passport for him.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.090
Okay,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.750
I have said the password next to are the issues that also does fail.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.250
You can add it by using V a pseudo.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.560
If if you are not familiar,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.450
you can exclude this command as well.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.150
What I have shown you in the document.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.650
There is a comment.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.070
Yes.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.230
You can build the says.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.400
Really?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.300
But let me do the V a sorrow sifter Ji,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:47.190
go to end off this point or in certain more in this Oddeman.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.670
Andi,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.860
I will kill you This so that it won't ask for the password whenever you are logging as

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.450
their route.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.380
All right,

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.510
we have done that.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.390
Next thing is we should install doctor as well as I said,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.460
because if we want to deploy on your doctors that work,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.730
we should create a darker images.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.900
Let me install darker Yum.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.650
Install Docker.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.050
Yes.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.000
They have installed a doctor.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.880
No,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.390
start to doctor services service.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.150
Darker status surgeries and darker start.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.620
I held starter Doctor Services.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.020
We should Arian.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.230
It's a mental doctor group for the use.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.250
The Mord minus C energy.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:50.030
Nothing but our group toe darker group user name is a innocent girl.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.840
So we have a hard area in this ad.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.000
Mental doctor group next by default to use their authentication is not enable the indoor

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.540
terribly.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.950
Assisi Instances.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.510
So we should A data password authentication should be Yes.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.050
From No in the associated the underscore conflict file.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.320
We have done this further.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.040
Doctor Host system Similar.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.270
Where we should do here for that of the a slash C.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.460
D.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.500
C s a shit.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.550
That's this year to do underscored conflict.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.750
Search for fast sword.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:31.050
You can see password authentication noise there not change it.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:37.550
Two years after that re lord sort of reassesses shit to do the real Lord.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.860
Mr.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.270
Thing is,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.750
we should generate keys for our Airness Admin user Solarte switch toe in a submarine

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.250
account.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:51.450
No,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.950
this is church.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:58.350
This is his Cajun is the commander to generate case.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.310
Okay,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.050
its creator keys usually kiss creates under.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.750
Doctor says it's holder.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.410
You can see idea.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.800
Underscore Odyssey I really understood our Sadat pub.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.820
This public e we should copy onto target environments on the private key.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.570
We should keep it as secure.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.750
If somebody have access to this one day can able to access your systems.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.010
Okay,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.510
so all sit on master note.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.890
I mean to say control node.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.370
One last thing,

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:40.650
what I will do is first let's switch back on the change Host name danceable control north.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:48.510
I'm giving okay so that it would be easy toward interpret for us.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.740
Next.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.750
Go back toe.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.170
Dr.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.220
Host here also,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.230
we should create user called the A nus.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.710
Add minutes said the password.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.320
So let's create user Carly in a sudden user.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.090
Ardian,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.680
this of me said the passport for Reina said,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:04.860
Well,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.350
pss stability.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.980
Use the same password.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.950
Whatever you use it in Master North.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.760
Okay,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.130
I have said the passport password authentication is enable so there is no issue to log into

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:21.850
the system.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.670
No,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.430
we should copy the keys.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.870
Unwto our doctor host system for that.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.250
The command is this is his called Ph D.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.940
Sorry we should do this one as a Ennis had been user list.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:45.050
Let's switch back to you in a submarine because we should copy keys under target system.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.980
No copy.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.580
Keys under target system.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.450
It's a search.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.980
Copy Iady in this area,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.450
man.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.750
As they enter,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.510
Sandman copied the keys.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.060
So host name?

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.450
Sorry,

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.050
I peered.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.520
Idiot.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.950
It will do the i P address.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.750
I'm using Private key.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:10.980
It can able to communicate with danceable sort through the private key because Diz Allah

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.050
and same vpc.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.980
Yes,

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:20.700
I want to connect to that server for stem unit to provide the password off incident user

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.850
password so that it can add the keys to target system.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.350
That's done no before Gillian,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.940
it's a minute.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.600
And I appear to us we can able to log into Target's system.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.650
We thought Password?

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.410
Yes,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.840
you can see here you have jumper from and supple control,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.560
nor to talk or host system.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.250
Right?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.650
So let's exit again.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.720
I came back toe danceable control note.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.340
Next,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.660
we need to test the connectivity by doing a pink test for that.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.210
As I said,

00:10:55.210 --> 00:11:02.910
we need to create a hosts file under answerable directly goto through this glass CTC and

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.450
simple.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.150
My thing is dead.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:16.880
Sodo Veet hosts here I'm marrying Manage the host ap as willows.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.120
Local host to local host.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.810
Nothing but my current system so well.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:30.330
Doping test toward doping Test answerable all my Nazi Um Ping?

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:30.650
Um,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.770
nothing but model.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.550
There is a model called Ping.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.950
Let's being it.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.800
Okay,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.910
you can able hoping to the remote system,

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.650
local system.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.070
You cannot,

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.170
because I haven't other case.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.730
Let me at it to our case we should,

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.250
from the commander of the search,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.850
call ph D local host.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.150
So it copies our case on to local host.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:02.650
So it's scuppered this time If I run so let me run it again.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:08.650
You can see here this time it's successful onboard the systems,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.810
right?

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.870
So I can say our danceable set up is fine.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.570
It can ableto talk our doctor host.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.170
So in case some images is there in the central,

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.850
nor it can able to copy on Dr Host.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.980
That's all for this video.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.740
In next video,

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.260
I will show you how to integrate answerable with the Jenkins so that whenever there is a

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:28.730
build,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.570
it can able to copy it into answerable system.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:37.700
Answerable system can convert to that of our people as your docker images on the with the

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.090
doctor.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:41.750
Um is it can able to create a docker container on the target system.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.750
We'll see that in over subsequent videos.
