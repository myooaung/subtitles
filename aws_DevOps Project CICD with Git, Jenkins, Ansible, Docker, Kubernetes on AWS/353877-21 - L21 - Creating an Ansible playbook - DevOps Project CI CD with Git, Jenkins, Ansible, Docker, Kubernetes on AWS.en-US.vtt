00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
Hello,

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.050
folks.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.070
Welcome back in the last video,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.470
we have seen how to copy.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.380
We are violent over danceable system.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.320
In this video,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.750
I will show you how to create a maze out off that.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.210
For that,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.060
Let's log in tow.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.060
Aranzabal system,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.950
This is Aranzabal system.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:23.210
We have our fine And if you see the pewter blue this last war pretty doctor to create your

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.490
doctor amazes me to this.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.010
We're fine.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.380
We should have your doctor fill.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.420
If you remember,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.700
We have it on your doctor point while we were creating your docker container on Docker

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.160
hosts.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.280
Same docker file.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.550
I'm going to copy here,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:44.990
so let's copy this.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.130
It's simple.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.500
If it's up to you whole complex Dr File do you want to write?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.650
But our demonstration is talks about How can we do the end to end the develops floor?

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.120
That's where I'm not concentrating to rate or complex.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.950
Docker files unanswerable points.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:09.470
So how copied?

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.830
Now we need to create a dock.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.670
Kareem is out of this But the purpose off using and so police.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.680
I don't want to do the manual steps.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.840
I want to automate everything for that we should radio answerable playbook which can able

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.250
to create your documents.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.460
Let's quickly radio answerable playbook which can create your docker images by using Docker

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.310
file and Rafael for that I'm going to create a file called Simple There waas.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310
You mean is docked.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.850
Wait a minute,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.170
I'm just naming it.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.350
I just simple develops in Mr Way A mill.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.860
If you don't know,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.340
I will quickly explain how to write danceable playbook Over here it starts with three.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.250
Minuses are high pins are in the next hype on hosts.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.500
Nothing but on which hosts do you want toe run this playbook?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:09.070
I will give just all we can change it while we run Playbook next become true Nothing but on

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.960
the remote system.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960
Do you want to become your route or not?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.510
It will tell you whether do you want to exclude comments at the root or not?

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.110
It is not necessary for display book way because every illness had been has enough

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:30.020
privileges Then talks under you can see the spaces Spaces is most important.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.050
Ah,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.800
this alignment is this index other ways it is like a simply looks language.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.290
Next name.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.450
It is like a comment.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.490
What do you want to do wind,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.920
Doctor,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.060
You means using graphite.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.750
Okay.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.170
On DA.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.170
Next to the Rezek.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.750
More deal called Command.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.950
So what is the command?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.060
We should use toe bilion emails.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.150
Same command weaken space for here.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.760
Dr.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.160
Bid minus state tag Start.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.430
I'm going toe you simple there.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.050
Warps.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.080
He made Dr Dark?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.410
Nothing.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.800
But in the current directory,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.830
you should execute Onda,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.170
uh,

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.210
dogs because we should switch.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.160
We're on which directly?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.650
We should exclude this command.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.710
This comment should be explored.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.450
I see it the year nothing but go to inside slash were PT doctor.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.610
So the meaning off this ended playbook is go inside to slash were pretty docker eggs eagled

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.450
this command.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.890
It creates enemies.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.480
That's it.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.120
This one you can do in other way.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.970
There is a There is a model called the documents Even you can use that model to create.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.620
And Dockery Mees I have updated that file in our documents repository you can just to go

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.490
through with that I will just show you so under Jenkins job.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.720
You can see here created documents,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.010
so I'm using the harbor One you can still use the below one.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.780
Okay,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.800
it's up to you either way will work.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.610
We have Option one and option toe.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.160
Let's go with option one because the purpose off this course is not teaching about

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.850
danceable.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.890
Let's understand simply and save it.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.890
No way.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.450
How written Answerable playbook toe.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.160
Create your doctor images using over docker file and were filled before executing.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.800
Doctor friend,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.510
Let's see water Nellie Majors are there in our system.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.450
Dr.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.550
Images,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.850
nothing Is there darker PS minus here.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.550
No country notes as well.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.270
Now I'm going to execute our answerable playbook to execute danceable playbook.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.150
The commander's answerable my honest minus playbook.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.760
Okay,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.620
we need to create an inventory file.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.850
I want to create a maison only answerable system.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.960
So for that,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.050
what you can do you can use the your hosts file which is daring slash city sensible.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.520
Let me carts.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.960
Classy,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.560
dizzy and simple hosts.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.470
If I use this host to the same,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.640
it's get creates on Dr Host as well as local.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:28.120
But I want to create only in answerable system one see Mrs created while deploying I can do

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.250
on my all my control hosts nothing but all target systems.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.280
So for that what I can do,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.340
I can create a host Well here itself.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.110
One more host.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.350
Well,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.180
while exuding your playbook,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.080
you can give your invent Refile.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.850
Ajay in port.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.910
Now,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.150
let me open my simple develops image file.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.410
Okay,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.130
There is no sin tax issued.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.600
OK,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.150
it's fine.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.370
Danceable minus.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.380
Playbook minus.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.040
I hosts simple develops playbook.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.360
Manus.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.700
Manus,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.510
check Check is going toe.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.370
Show you how the playbook is going to run.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.820
Okay?

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.780
No issues,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.310
No.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.050
Without check.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.000
So check doesn't actually create it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.650
It's just to see that whether everything is fine or not.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.250
Okay,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.290
it is building image.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.400
That's what it takes time Because we don't have any images.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.370
It is going toe.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.360
Pull the Tomcat.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.750
Timmy's That is about our Bassem is on the art of our photo.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.710
Our you miss.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.660
Okay,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.450
It's completed successfully,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.380
Doc.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.210
Could images,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.360
if you see Yes,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.270
you can see two images.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.010
One is from Tomcat.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.070
Nothing but basic.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.120
Miss Under by using Bassem is its creator yet.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.460
Simple dough optimists clear.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.690
But I want to do this one from the Jenkins itself.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.150
I don't want to run this playbook.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.510
Whenever there is a new wear friend,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.320
this should be get executed.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.050
Similar where we can write one more file to create a container are we cannot toe the same

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.410
Yamil file toe,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.490
Create a container.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.950
So let me edit it.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.140
Oh,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.110
minus name.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:20.720
You can add any number off tasks for same playbook Mine,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:32.750
asthma minus name Create container using simple There were ropes.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.750
You may is okay.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:41.510
No command Soto build it to create a container.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:53.150
Darker run minus did nothing but to detach More minus minus name Soon they're warps

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.620
container,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.480
container name.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.700
I'm giving simple develops container minus P port number Eijiro Yojiro expos on port number

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.960
Gero Gero Internally trans on a jury eijiro and,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.250
uh,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.560
amazing him.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:09.810
However,

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.010
Jamie's name is simple.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.950
Develops amiss.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.850
Okay,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:19.190
let me rename the file name because we are creating container as well.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.070
So young.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.010
Be simple.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:21.870
Develops emails.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.450
William L.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.650
Project Dart.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.250
William it.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.850
Okay,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.750
now let me execute this one again.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:38.220
Seem on my local host.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.050
I'm Trento,

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.800
creating minutes and created container.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.550
Let's see what will happen.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.280
Yes,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.250
it's successful,

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.380
Doc.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:47.750
Good.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.440
You may just You can see a doctor because it's already there.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.850
Nothing to change.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.990
Dr.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.350
P s Manus Year.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.020
You can see new container God created.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.590
It's running from 13 seconds ago Okay.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.680
This is how we can write danceable playbooks toe,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.050
create our containers.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.710
I'm stopping over here in next video,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.860
build Runda answerable playbooks by using Jenkins.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.230
And we'll see the water null.
