00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Hello,

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:00.990
folks.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.850
Welcome back.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.270
In previous video,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.870
we have seen how to set up deploy on kubernetes Siri job.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.950
In this video,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.150
we are going to create deploy on kubernetes,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.610
see a job to create a container.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.800
We should have your images that emails should be always latest so that we can have the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.910
latest application on our container.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.410
So in this video,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.000
we are going to create that see a job so that it creates Elliott estimates on the Serie job

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.050
can pull the latest image and create a container out off it.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.140
Oh,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.850
do that one.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.350
We should use the hour earlier job which we were creating your enemies Under deploying on

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.380
your docker container,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.420
we have a job called the deploy in your docker container.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.850
Using answerable playbooks.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.140
In this playbook we were creating Dockery Mies end of deploying on your docker containers,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.500
right?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.320
So instead of docker container,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.420
we are using kubernetes cluster,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.920
so there is no much difference.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.320
We can use the same job by modifying little bit before using you to Let's understand this

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.680
job.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.750
What is there in there?

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.050
Configured And ah,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.950
if you see here,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.070
it is going to pull the court from the get hub repository on the policy.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.200
Um,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.510
nothing.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.420
But whenever there is a change in the court,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:26.930
it pulls the court next it is building by using palm dot xml Once it build aware fell it

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.270
copies The var file on principles are were under slash were pretty docker Once it is copied

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.840
over there,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.850
we have your playbook in that folder which creates a e mais under attack.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.350
That image pushed The team is under Dr Hub.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.300
Then they lead the image.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.900
That is the task it do in this location.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.310
I've been logging toe my answerable system and show you this file.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.850
I am on my answerable server.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.280
Let's go to Syria slash were pretty docker and we are talking about create simple develops

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.460
Amazed out Wait a minute.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.650
If you see here Fostered creates enemies under slash war pt darker on the tag The seam is

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.450
as well angles because we want to push it in tow wearing guilt.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.060
Then push the same Isn't or doctor,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.340
huh?

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550
Remove the emails on local.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.450
That is what it would do.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.240
Onda,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.570
we how mentioned here as the host salt and to skip the all the North We are using the minus

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.520
minus local host instead of that one.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.950
So even we can create a group over here for the local host on to use it.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.000
But let it,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.310
before time being toe aware the confusion.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.330
And also we have docker file here and we're feel also getting copied over here.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.620
So nothing to change to this file looks jumping double Jenkins job and go back.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.350
I'm not changing anything over here.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.050
Let's create a new job,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.550
deploy on container,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.750
see a job.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.950
And we are going to copy this one from our answerable playbook.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.550
Okay,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:11.510
so description I'm going to give you create Docker.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.450
Amazed using without a fight.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.510
Next repository is same on the policy.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.990
Um let it be And it beats only here If we come,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.600
we are going to copy wherefore long principles or were years nothing to change here.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.890
We just need to remove it.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.550
That's it.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.010
So that it is going to create the container our play on Syria.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.900
Poor testing purpose.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.740
Let's build this one And also goto over hob dark docker dot com I have already logged.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.930
Didn't I think Okay,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.840
you can see here.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.750
Simple develops images updated eight days ago.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.200
It should be update.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.450
No,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.850
it's initialized.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.050
Let's open this one.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.080
Okay,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.580
it's running and pushing The image under Dr Hub their team is is getting up later.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.120
Here are not Yes,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.850
you can see here 84 it's subjected few seconds ago.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.350
So it means that our see a job is working fine.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.250
There is no issues.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.340
So to make it more relevant,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.560
what we can do is instead of building imagined a slash were pretty doctor,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.090
we can build on that slash war.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.910
Pretty kubernetes for that.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:46.170
We should copy these files so pseudo young be docker file as well as this foil onto slash

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.150
were pretty kubernetes.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.750
Let's go back slash Will pity Cooper notice.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.050
Now we can create images directly over here,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.310
but we should change this one little bit because we are creating outlier.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.350
We were saying that creating maze under slash were pretty docker.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:16.350
Now we are going to say that creating maze under slash your beauty burned kubernetes Okay,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.860
this is one thing.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.160
Another thing is they're less monetarily.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.670
Slash for preteen Cooper Nitties.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.610
If you see this is currently wound by root user.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.900
But as here as a Jenkins we are trying to log in to answer.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.620
Bulls are over as a Ennis had mean.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.570
If you remember,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.230
we help configure the A nus.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.350
Admit credentials.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.410
I will just show you,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.220
man.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:54.820
Is Jenkins so contradict system you can see here.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.080
This is Dr Host on Docker host to Dr Admin User and Simple Server.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.000
We are liking as a in a segment,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.060
so we should give the pre less toe This directory for Ennis had been further to see which

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.510
one minus are Yeah,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.750
genocide mean colon in a segment slash Will pity Cooper Nitties.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.250
Okay,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:27.370
there's this pseudo we should do so that this folder is wound way in a segment.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.770
And also the files which are there in this are warned by inside me and ah,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.110
our Yeah,

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.700
what image file Also we can do the little bit modification instead off all we can space

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.150
further answerable.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.950
Certainly So we were doing that we would spacing all over here.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:58.540
And also we were limiting toe execute on the only local host in stuff that one.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:05.180
I'm just giving that this group name so that it indirectly refers to the local host.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.220
We need not to space for a explicitly minus menace.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.050
Local host.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.050
Okay.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.620
And according to this,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.950
we need to change the job because our current answerable file is available in this location

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.670
on the hosts were also available in this location.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:28.750
So let's go back on a modified over the job on the march affair with job back to Jenkins.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.860
So see a job,

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.350
right?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.180
Con figure.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.400
We just need to change their part of where it should copy.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.250
The bear fell on the very It should execute this and simple playbook.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.010
So we want to copy.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.270
Over where file under Coover.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.910
Nitties.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.950
Let me increase it.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.790
So this partner,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:08:01.550
I'm also going to change toe slash Will Beauty Cooper Nitties here also because where does

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.910
it mean copied of our fell onto slash were pretty coburn.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:12.050
It is on the execute answerable playbook minus I slash were pretty kubernetes hosts.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.620
And also the Armel file is available under this location minus menace limit.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:23.200
Local host is not needed way because we have already specified in the horse execute only

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.350
unanswerable server.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.150
I'll play save it and ah,

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.760
let's build it again this time.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.750
What should happen?

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.870
It should execute on the copy.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.610
The var file into this location.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.090
So far,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.480
we don't have anywhere fell popular were failing to dislocation on.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:49.520
But this doctor fell used to create a It means on that emails get renamed and pushed into

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.250
darker hub.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:09:01.220
Let's go on to see if it is creating confusion.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.320
You can still create a minutes under.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.650
Slash were pretty docker,

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:10.310
but I just attacked that if we have the c A city job files in the same location,

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.660
so it would be easy.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.100
Now let me refresh it.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.760
This train,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.850
it should be 85.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.190
Yes,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.250
it's working print,

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.120
so I'll say two to execute our Jenkins job in next video.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.110
We can integrate see a city job so that whenever we do any changes to our court,

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.130
our see a job should execute.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.920
Then I would see the job get it.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.530
Regard on the new deployment should happen.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.250
We'll see how we can enable this one in the next video.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.180
Until then,

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.550
by suited
