WEBVTT

00:02.220 --> 00:04.630
So now did we got a header.

00:04.650 --> 00:10.950
We can continue and continue with the part where users can enter a number which the computer should

00:10.950 --> 00:15.920
guess thereafter and for this year in the app chips fall below the header.

00:15.920 --> 00:22.790
I of course want to have the the input area off the user now and justice before all handled this in

00:22.790 --> 00:29.780
a separate component and not here an app just to keep all components relatively lean and we could create

00:29.780 --> 00:34.850
this component here in the components folder that would not be wrong but since I now will work on a

00:34.850 --> 00:42.110
component that essentially is responsible for everything we see on the screen besides the header I treat

00:42.140 --> 00:47.600
this component that's kind of a special component I'll name it a screen and I'll store it in a screens

00:47.600 --> 00:53.000
folder because the finished game will essentially have three different screens one for configuring and

00:53.000 --> 00:58.040
starting the game one when the game is running and one when the game is over and I want to have these

00:58.100 --> 01:04.520
special components which technically are totally normal components but which fulfill a special purpose

01:04.730 --> 01:10.790
I want to have them stored in a separate folder and that's just my personal design decision here you

01:10.790 --> 01:16.790
don't need to store them they're technically there is no reason to do it or not to do it React Native

01:16.790 --> 01:18.750
simply doesn't care.

01:18.770 --> 01:24.200
So here are all stored in there and I'll name this start game screen daughter J.S. to also make it really

01:24.200 --> 01:30.740
clear in the name that this is a special component to me but as I said technically it's a normal component

01:30.770 --> 01:37.580
and therefore we import react from react and we'll all the import some things from React Native of course

01:37.880 --> 01:44.210
and we can already tell that we'll certainly need a view because while you probably can't build any

01:44.210 --> 01:49.060
component well you can but not that many components which you can build without views.

01:49.160 --> 01:54.620
So we'll import the view here and we'll definitely also need a style sheet for it some styling and we'll

01:54.620 --> 02:02.870
see what else we need we'll certainly also need a text I guess so we can already add that now with this

02:03.500 --> 02:10.130
all create a new constant here start game screen which is a functional component looking like this where

02:10.130 --> 02:19.330
we'll have a styles object with style sheet create like this and we're at an export start game screen

02:19.450 --> 02:27.430
like that and you could save this as kind of a template for any new component you add because 90 percent

02:27.430 --> 02:32.890
of custom components you build and React Native look like this basically you import react you import

02:32.890 --> 02:39.280
some stuff from React Native you define your component the name difference of course you have your styles

02:39.310 --> 02:40.740
object and you export it.

02:40.780 --> 02:46.740
That's pretty much always the same so you could kind of safe this as a template if you wanted to I don't

02:46.740 --> 02:52.800
want you here though so I'll just continue with working on the component itself and the question now

02:52.800 --> 02:59.760
is what do we render in this start game screen how is should it look like in the end in there I'll have

02:59.760 --> 03:06.960
a wrapping view surrounding my entire screen because I think that kind of makes sense allows us to set

03:06.960 --> 03:14.040
up some general styling I'll again add a screen property here to the stolid object which I can do it

03:14.040 --> 03:18.420
will not clash with the one an app J.S. we could have also chosen different names.

03:18.420 --> 03:23.760
These two are simply not related because these are independent JavaScript objects in the end managed

03:23.760 --> 03:29.790
an independent files so we can repeat names here or choose different names I'll go for a similar name

03:29.790 --> 03:36.390
here name this screen and set up some general styling for this surrounding view here the general styling

03:36.390 --> 03:42.810
is that I said this to flex one so that it takes all the space it can get which means that since I will

03:42.810 --> 03:47.760
added below the header it will take all the space below the header both vertically and horizontally

03:48.780 --> 03:55.350
and besides this I also want to add some some padding here of ten so that the content doesn't sits directly

03:55.350 --> 04:01.470
on the edges of this screen but there is some spacing to the left right top and bottom and I'll add

04:01.470 --> 04:03.860
a line items center.

04:03.930 --> 04:09.900
Keep in mind that every view by default uses flex blocks and by default uses flex direction column a

04:09.930 --> 04:13.960
line items it positions items along the cross axis.

04:13.980 --> 04:18.240
So since the default direction is column The Cross axis is left to right.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.000
So it's a horizontal axis.

04:20.070 --> 04:25.380
So this will align items in the center horizontally but not vertically.

04:25.380 --> 04:31.200
There we use the default of justified content flex start but since I used the default I don't need to

04:31.200 --> 04:39.210
set it so we'll just leave it as it is here and now assign this style here to this view and auto formatting

04:39.210 --> 04:41.600
closed my tag here which of course they want to do.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.830
Let me reverse this.

04:43.140 --> 04:47.070
And now we have that view for our game screen now to see where it works.

04:47.070 --> 04:49.220
I'll just output some text here.

04:49.320 --> 04:56.110
The game screen just some dummy placeholder reform a dead and now an app just lets you start screen

04:56.530 --> 05:05.880
by importing game start games screen from the screens folder and there starts.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.820
Game screen and then simply added.

05:09.890 --> 05:19.580
Here like this if we save this we see the game screen here and also on Android.

05:19.650 --> 05:20.250
So this works.

05:20.250 --> 05:27.270
We're using this second separate component which will now use as a full screen component basically or

05:27.360 --> 05:28.420
almost full screen.

05:28.430 --> 05:30.420
The part below the header in the end.
