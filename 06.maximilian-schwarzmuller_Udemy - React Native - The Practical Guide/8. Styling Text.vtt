So we spent quite some time on the look of these text inputs but I'm liking it now,

00:07.290 --> 00:10.250
one thing I don't like is our heading here though,

00:10.350 --> 00:11.480
please log in,

00:11.580 --> 00:14.180
that's not really looking the way I want it to look.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.730
So it would be nice to have this look as a header,

00:17.910 --> 00:27.100
of course we can do that by going to the auth screen and then adding something like text heading, whatever

00:27.100 --> 00:27.580
you want,

00:27.580 --> 00:32.430
any property name of your choice and there set the font size,

00:32.440 --> 00:34.060
always look at this cheat sheet

00:34.060 --> 00:40.430
I mentioned earlier if you're not sure which properties you can set and set it maybe to 28 pixels.

00:40.450 --> 00:46.030
Now if you set this up and you go up to your text, you can of course add the style here

00:47.810 --> 00:55.760
and set this to tile, styles text heading. Now if you save this, reload on

00:55.790 --> 01:02.830
iOS too, let me also turn on hot reloading here to get quicker updates, you see now we got a heading style,

01:02.840 --> 01:07.450
we could also give this a different font weight and by the way, as you might guess,

01:07.580 --> 01:13.880
font size and font weight, these are only available on text inputs and you might not have guessed this,

01:14.390 --> 01:17.360
if you try to assign them on the outer container,

01:17.540 --> 01:24.920
it would actually fail because there is a difference between view elements here and text elements

01:25.220 --> 01:28.190
and text elements take different styles than view elements,

01:28.190 --> 01:30.070
check out the cheat sheet I mentioned.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.210
So here, font weight can be set to bold

01:33.410 --> 01:41.920
but if we try to do the same on our wrapping container view when we save this, we actually get an error here

01:41.920 --> 01:42.430
on the right

01:42.460 --> 01:49.360
or a warning here in the simulator that we try to assign font-size to view which is not supported.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.520
So this is just what I meant,

01:51.520 --> 01:55.560
we can absolutely use it on our text though

01:55.720 --> 02:02.230
and now we got a fat header here which looks quite nice as it is.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.270
But what about reusability?

02:06.370 --> 02:08.550
We did it on the text input,

02:08.620 --> 02:11.880
it might also make sense here on this text.

02:11.890 --> 02:19.540
We might use a heading styled like this in other places of the app too, so creating a separate component

02:19.540 --> 02:21.840
for this might make sense, I'll

02:21.850 --> 02:29.290
name it heading text and you could name it heading one text even if you wanted to build different

02:29.290 --> 02:33.320
headings like we have them in html with h1, h2 and so on,

02:33.340 --> 02:40.020
I'm going to stick to heading text and there, import react from react of course,

02:40.350 --> 02:44.970
import two things from react native, the text and the stylesheet

02:50.700 --> 02:59.770
and then create a constant which I'll name heading text which gets some props where I in the end return some

02:59.950 --> 03:07.340
jsx and where I then default, export this heading text as the default of this file.

03:07.720 --> 03:15.820
And now here in my component, I will render the text and in-between the opening and closing tags, I'll

03:15.820 --> 03:23.110
use props children to render whatever we passed between our custom component text thereafter. And now

03:23.110 --> 03:27.960
we can use the same set up as before, we can distribute all props we get here,

03:28.240 --> 03:35.300
you could of course also store them in some sub-property like text config which we then would have

03:35.300 --> 03:36.590
to set from outside

03:36.770 --> 03:43.370
but I'm going to do it like this and then I'll override the style and create my own stylesheet down

03:43.370 --> 03:52.730
there, so create this styles object where I use stylesheet create and now copy the set up we defined

03:52.730 --> 04:01.540
here in our auth.js file, move it into our text heading file here and now just make sure to assign this

04:01.810 --> 04:07.240
styles text heading and to also allow this to be overridden,

04:07.660 --> 04:13.620
you probably want to turn this into an array too and there, also pass any styles you get from outside

04:13.750 --> 04:22.160
just as we did it in our default input. So with that, we got our reusable heading text component,

04:22.180 --> 04:23.380
let's now use it

04:23.450 --> 04:24.480
so back in auth.js,

04:24.510 --> 04:31.940
I will actually import it, I'll import heading text from

04:34.980 --> 04:36.110
components 

04:36.200 --> 04:37.040
UI,

04:38.260 --> 04:44.500
heading text heading text and I'll use it here instead of my text, I'll then remove the style I set

04:44.510 --> 04:48.270
here because I got the default styles in that component.

04:48.510 --> 04:54.310
If we now save this and we go back to the application, get the same look as before

04:55.210 --> 04:56.990
and everything works fine here

04:57.700 --> 05:04.430
but now this is set up in a reusable way again. If we toggle the inspector and we click on that, we see that

05:04.430 --> 05:08.560
indeed we do use our heading text component here and inside there,

05:08.660 --> 05:15.240
we got our text and we got all the default properties we set up distributed over that text.
