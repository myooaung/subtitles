00:02.500 --> 00:07.190
No I disabled lynching here so they don't have all these warnings and errors regarding code style.

00:07.190 --> 00:10.550
Of course you can adjust your code to follow that style.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.820
That's a personal preference in the end.

00:12.830 --> 00:19.070
Now what I want to do here is I want to show you how you can of course change that code but then also

00:19.130 --> 00:24.390
how we could add a native functionality in such a vanilla react native app.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.780
So for that all first of all simplify this starting app a lot.

00:28.850 --> 00:37.250
Just get rid of all that content here and just add a basic style set up here with Flex 1 justify content

00:37.400 --> 00:44.090
Center and the line items center to center my content on the screen.

00:44.090 --> 00:46.550
Get rid of this thing here.

00:46.760 --> 00:54.150
And from all these imports here I want to use the style sheet I want to use the view and I want to as

00:54.290 --> 00:59.720
use the button because what I want to add is the image picker functionality.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.660
So here I return my view.

01:02.750 --> 01:08.100
And my button and on the button I say take image.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.460
And then on press I want to open the image picker.

01:10.460 --> 01:11.990
Now how can we add this.

01:12.230 --> 01:19.740
Now since this is a risk native project without expo in any way we can't easily use the expo API is

01:19.740 --> 01:20.030
here.

01:20.040 --> 01:25.530
There actually is a way of using them and I'll come back to that later in this module.

01:25.530 --> 01:30.690
But you would need to configure a couple things so therefore what we can do instead is we can do something

01:30.690 --> 01:34.660
which you will do a lot if you're working with a vanilla react native app.

01:34.730 --> 01:39.810
We search for React Native which picker for example to find a package that helps us with that.

01:39.810 --> 01:43.060
For example this one there React Native image picker package.

01:43.320 --> 01:49.140
And now we can install this because now we can bring any third party package no matter if it adds native

01:49.320 --> 01:55.080
functionalities or not in your app previously with Expo this was not really possible theories you could

01:55.080 --> 01:59.520
only bring third party packages that did not tap into native device features.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.380
Now you got no restrictions.

02:01.470 --> 02:03.060
So now we can add this.

02:03.360 --> 02:09.810
And here we can install this by following the installation structures here so by going back into our

02:09.810 --> 02:18.690
project in India by running npm install dash dash save and then here it's React Native image picker

02:21.970 --> 02:25.430
like this by the way you can keep this process you're running and you should.

02:25.450 --> 02:30.730
So that code changes once you save your files are picked up and pushed to your devices.

02:30.970 --> 02:34.310
So let's wait for this installation to finish now.

02:34.330 --> 02:35.090
Now it's done.

02:35.110 --> 02:35.860
Took quite a while.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.240
And now we need to install this and do it.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.900
Thing is this package is very easy to install.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.770
You should only need to run this command here.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.250
React Native link React Native image picker.

02:47.340 --> 02:49.270
So run this in your project.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.550
Like this and you should be good.

02:53.730 --> 02:57.870
Now I will say there are third party packages that take more effort.

02:57.870 --> 03:00.960
It really depends on the package for Expo.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.540
It obviously was very easy you just ran Expo install that was very fast.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.720
Didn't take that long and you didn't need to do anything else.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.140
Here you need to run one extra command.

03:11.270 --> 03:12.870
But of course that's also not too bad.

03:12.870 --> 03:16.890
But again I will say not all packages support this command.

03:16.920 --> 03:22.950
Some packages require way more manual wire up work manual work where you don't actually need to dive

03:22.950 --> 03:28.250
into the Android and Iow folders to start working on some configuration files there.

03:28.290 --> 03:33.600
That's what you rack native link command did for you for example on Android if you dive into the app

03:33.600 --> 03:39.540
folder and their source and then in the source folder into built cradle you will see that there

03:42.290 --> 03:43.970
this line was added.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.710
This wasn't there from the beginning.

03:45.710 --> 03:48.610
This was added by the react native link command.

03:48.830 --> 03:52.250
And for some packages you have to add these entries manually.

03:52.250 --> 03:57.080
A lot of packages support you link command and with more recent versions of React Native.

03:57.080 --> 04:02.480
Some packages even support auto linking where does linking will be done automatically once installation

04:02.480 --> 04:06.550
finished but not all packages have that support so that's something to be aware of.

04:06.550 --> 04:12.680
Behind the scenes a lot of configuration was changed with that we can now use this package again as

04:13.100 --> 04:19.680
instructed in their docs so we can add this import here here.

04:20.000 --> 04:31.050
Then also add the pic image function your maybe it maybe and connect dad to our button

04:34.100 --> 04:37.360
and now here image picker works a bit differently than the expo one.

04:37.370 --> 04:42.400
Here we call image picture show image picker with options which we can set up.

04:42.410 --> 04:49.550
Options are configured as described up here or described in the docs in general and here I will just

04:49.640 --> 04:56.120
grab this entire code here like this.

04:56.140 --> 04:58.510
Copy that into the pic image function.

04:58.510 --> 05:00.450
Get rid of this sad state called.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.820
We're not in a class based components so that's not something we can do.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.560
Instead here in the office block I'll just console log.

05:06.590 --> 05:09.960
De response Uri which should be the pop of the image.

05:10.150 --> 05:11.160
Which was taken.

05:11.340 --> 05:15.940
And then we've got a couple of handlers for different scenarios here and with that let's see where that

05:15.940 --> 05:16.330
works.

05:16.330 --> 05:17.440
If we save this

05:20.110 --> 05:21.550
normally it should rebuild here.

05:21.550 --> 05:28.470
But due to our new package installed I will quit this process and rerun React Native run Android here.

05:28.490 --> 05:33.680
Now in my terminal integrated into visual pseudocode and therefore in this project folder and now it

05:33.680 --> 05:42.270
is will bring up is development server again and more importantly it will then all the relaunched the

05:42.270 --> 05:47.750
app on the emulator so that we hopefully can see it there and can test the image pictured here.

05:47.820 --> 05:51.060
So let's wait for that to finish for the build process to finish.

05:51.060 --> 05:58.260
Now here's the app coming up and if I press it I get this overlay I can click take photo and nothing

05:58.260 --> 05:59.700
happens.

05:59.700 --> 06:04.290
Reason for that is missing permissions and that's the manual work I meant we have to go into the Android

06:04.290 --> 06:11.610
folder there into source main Android manifest which configure the Android app and there you have to

06:11.610 --> 06:16.770
add a new permission you can copy does internet permission which you'll always need for the Android

06:16.770 --> 06:22.530
app to communicate to do with development server and they are you can now add the camera permission

06:22.530 --> 06:29.360
which you need to add for this app to be able to access the device camera otherwise this is not supported.

06:29.370 --> 06:35.820
So now we can rerun this process rebuild the application and make sure that we take this new setting

06:35.820 --> 06:39.090
into account and with that we should now be able to open this.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.070
So again it's an additional setup which we didn't need to do in the Expo world of course.

06:44.400 --> 06:49.180
On ISIS by the way you also need to do something similar whilst is rebuilt there.

06:49.200 --> 06:57.100
If you go into your right at our end without expert file you find the info list file and in that file

06:57.490 --> 07:02.630
you also need to add an entry to ask for does permission

07:07.760 --> 07:14.660
you need to add a new key here after an existing key value pair the exact position doesn't matter and

07:14.670 --> 07:19.920
you'll find detailed instructions on your official docs if that package they're under installed doc.

07:19.920 --> 07:25.710
If you click there you'll find instructions regarding which permissions need to be set for Android.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.100
I also forgot one.

07:27.150 --> 07:32.240
We need to set this external storage permission as well as let me go back to the Android manifest.

07:32.250 --> 07:38.380
Add this here and now rerun this on Android and for I was there.

07:38.410 --> 07:43.970
You need to set these keys here to copy all of that.

07:47.020 --> 07:53.410
And then go back to the IP list file I showed you here and now you can add these key value pairs here

07:57.460 --> 07:58.210
with that.

07:58.750 --> 08:01.750
Let's check the app on Android have enough.

08:01.930 --> 08:05.860
And if I now click on take photo now I'm asked for permission here.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.730
This now happens automatically the package does that for us.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.120
And now the camera opens up so this now works.

08:12.130 --> 08:17.350
But as you saw with a little bit of extra configuration and by following the instructions on the official

08:17.350 --> 08:23.260
docs and every package will have its own instructions there some packages don't even support you link

08:23.260 --> 08:23.830
command.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.530
There you need to do even more.

08:25.560 --> 08:31.380
Our packages require less work you have more flexibility but therefore all the more duties.

08:31.390 --> 08:37.240
This however is how you can bring third party packages that tap into native device features to react

08:37.240 --> 08:40.970
native only app for your component code which you write.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.630
That's the same code we rolled throughout the entire course.

08:43.630 --> 08:49.660
Same components same logic same way of how you build your app you can create the same folders you can

08:49.660 --> 08:52.540
add react navigation Dad all doesn't change.
