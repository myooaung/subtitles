00:02.270 --> 00:07.540
So this was a bunch of work which we spend here on this app on the shop app.

00:07.550 --> 00:14.360
You'll learn a lot about how to build apps in general how to handle user input how to store data on

00:14.360 --> 00:21.140
servers and how to add authentication with users scope data to your users how to at all to log in and

00:21.200 --> 00:21.950
order log out.

00:21.950 --> 00:23.440
And so much more.

00:23.690 --> 00:30.620
Now you can always dive deeper at authorization add extra checks use that refresh token and these are

00:30.620 --> 00:36.350
all great practices but with the things you learned in distant the previous modules you should have

00:36.350 --> 00:40.950
a very solid set of skills to gather with what you learned early in the course.

00:41.030 --> 00:46.460
Two already built amazing native applications with React Native with all these core features you need

00:46.460 --> 00:52.970
and so many applications no missing pieces which will be covered in the next modules of course are for

00:52.970 --> 00:58.730
example how you can tap into native device features like using the camera or maps and we'll have a look

00:58.730 --> 00:59.710
at this stair.

00:59.930 --> 01:01.280
So let's continue.
