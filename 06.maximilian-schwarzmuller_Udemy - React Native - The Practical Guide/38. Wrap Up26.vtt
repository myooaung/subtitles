This is it for this module.

00:04.650 --> 00:09.460
Our app isn't finished yet setting our filters here doesn't do anything after all.

00:09.510 --> 00:15.690
And in addition we also can't really work with favorites we just have our dummy favorites here.

00:15.690 --> 00:20.640
So of course there still is work left to do but we'll do this in the next course module when we dive

00:20.640 --> 00:28.020
into state management and using redux in such I react native app because we'll need to manage state

00:28.050 --> 00:33.930
across multiple screens and one of the easiest ways of doing that is with redox.

00:33.930 --> 00:39.270
So in the next module we'll finished his app and introduce redux and state management before we there

00:39.270 --> 00:43.970
after dive even deeper into React Native and many other cool things we can do with our apps there.
