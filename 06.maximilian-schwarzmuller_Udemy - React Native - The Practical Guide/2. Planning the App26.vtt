WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:07.410
So which kind of application will we build in this module here.

00:07.450 --> 00:15.580
We'll build a meals app app where we can view some recipes favorite some recipes and also filter recipes.

00:15.820 --> 00:19.370
And Ford is in his application will need some navigation.

00:19.390 --> 00:25.810
We'll have our header there with some title in the middle and with a menu but near on the left which

00:25.810 --> 00:29.210
allows us to open a side door to which I'll come back in a second.

00:29.470 --> 00:33.610
And at the bottom of this page here we'll have taps.

00:33.610 --> 00:42.700
We'll have two taps one for all meals all recipes and one for our favorites which will of course be

00:42.700 --> 00:45.310
able to add in this app.

00:45.310 --> 00:49.800
Now on that all page we'll have a grid of categories.

00:49.810 --> 00:59.310
So basically something like Italian exotic maybe German food.

00:59.470 --> 01:02.100
So basically different food categories.

01:02.200 --> 01:09.490
And when we tap one of these categories will be taken on a second screen which will then have a back

01:09.490 --> 01:13.660
button at the top to go back with the number title the category title.

01:13.660 --> 01:17.110
And on that screen will then have the recipes.

01:17.110 --> 01:24.910
So there will have multiple such cards with let's say an image a title and some extra information about

01:24.910 --> 01:29.250
the recipe like how long it takes to create it and so on.

01:29.260 --> 01:33.220
So when we click the back button we're of course taken back here.

01:33.250 --> 01:37.300
Now that's one part and that's all where we're on the all tab down there.

01:37.300 --> 01:44.470
So when desist act of tap now we're not done in this flow though of course we can tap a single recipe

01:44.890 --> 01:50.590
and that will take us to yet another page here where we can view the details about this recipe.

01:50.650 --> 01:56.530
So where we also have a header and an image of this recipe and also I have a back button which takes

01:56.530 --> 02:02.950
us back to this page here where we then also have more information about the recipe like for example

02:02.950 --> 02:11.740
the ingredients which is such a list and then also the steps it takes to create this recipe like cut

02:11.800 --> 02:12.860
onions and so on.

02:13.390 --> 02:17.370
So that's the information about the recipe we have here and we can go back.

02:17.710 --> 02:26.050
Important will all that have the functionality to mark a recipe as a favorite there for example here

02:26.050 --> 02:31.710
in the header we could have a star icon which allows us to do that.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.850
Well that's ugly star.

02:32.880 --> 02:39.790
But that's something we could have here to mark a recipe as a favorite and we'll add it to his favorites

02:39.790 --> 02:43.210
list because that's the other tab we got here right.

02:43.220 --> 02:50.980
That's D seconds tab we got here when we press this tab here we're basically switching the tab on this

02:51.040 --> 02:53.540
starting screen where we have that menu button.

02:53.740 --> 02:58.500
We still have our taps here with all and with favorites.

02:58.510 --> 03:01.750
But now let's say favorite 60 active tap.

03:02.050 --> 03:10.660
Well in this case if favorite zesty act of tap then here we essentially see a list of recipes which

03:10.660 --> 03:15.700
looks just like this list here of recipes when we click on a category.

03:15.700 --> 03:24.790
But now only a list of categories with a list of recipes excuse me with the recipes we marked as a favorite.

03:24.790 --> 03:30.890
Now we can still have a single recipe done and we're taken to dead recipe detail page up data.

03:30.970 --> 03:35.050
And if we now would press the back button we'd of course go back to this page.

03:35.080 --> 03:40.130
So the back button takes us to different pages depending on where we're coming from.

03:40.180 --> 03:47.980
Now what happens when we press that draw here though when we tap this menu button what happens in this

03:47.980 --> 03:49.110
case.

03:49.120 --> 03:56.860
Well in this case we open a side door which allows us to go to the meals app which in the end is this

03:56.860 --> 04:05.830
app we're starting on where we have all and favorites and also the filters screen now filters is a brand

04:05.860 --> 04:12.730
new screen which we have a design application where we also have a menu button to well go to that same

04:12.850 --> 04:22.150
menu here and possibly go back to the meals page and on filters we can set filters like glue teen 3

04:22.490 --> 04:30.740
or V again and we'll have some some switches here which allow us to toggle these options on and off

04:31.160 --> 04:38.690
and we all to have like a save button here at the top which allows us to then save our selection and

04:38.720 --> 04:48.430
then we can go back and the recipes we see here will be filtered by our selection on the filter screen.

04:49.070 --> 04:54.270
So this is the application we're building and now this sketch here shows two things.

04:54.290 --> 05:00.500
For one my drawing skills aren't that awesome should matter too much though because it is thankfully

05:00.590 --> 05:02.360
not a drawing class.

05:02.390 --> 05:07.330
The more important thing this sketch show is instead we'll have a lot of navigation.

05:07.370 --> 05:08.170
We have taps.

05:08.180 --> 05:15.760
We have a side draw and we have forth and back navigation so we'll go back and forth between pages.

05:15.800 --> 05:21.080
We'll have to change the title in the header based on where we're going we'll have to change the content

05:21.080 --> 05:26.510
on the screen based on where we're going and therefore we need a powerful navigation solution where

05:26.510 --> 05:33.200
we don't just use if checks as we did it thus far and of course not only because that would be very

05:33.200 --> 05:39.800
cumbersome to write but also because we want these beautiful animations these transitions between screens

05:40.250 --> 05:44.220
and that's something we thankfully can add in a relatively easy way.
