00:02.360 --> 00:03.830
So this is it.

00:03.830 --> 00:07.020
This is how you can add native device features to your app.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.850
We added a lot of features in this module.

00:10.070 --> 00:11.650
We added the camera.

00:11.660 --> 00:17.720
We made sure we can get the user location by order locating the user and also by showing a full map

00:17.720 --> 00:24.060
and interactive map where you can scroll and sue them and then select the place at a marker.

00:24.080 --> 00:30.620
We showed a map preview which was pretty neat and we stored that data not just in memory but we moved

00:30.620 --> 00:37.730
to file in our file system and we stored all data all the 50 help of sequel light in a real database

00:37.760 --> 00:42.150
that runs on our device and you learned how to set this all up and use it.

00:42.590 --> 00:48.230
Now as I mentioned multiple times in this module the official Expo docs are your friend does this everything

00:48.230 --> 00:52.940
which is building which should cover like ninety nine point nine percent of use cases you might have.

00:52.940 --> 00:58.850
There are so many amazing features you can add to your applications and as is so adding is super super

00:58.850 --> 00:59.470
simple.

00:59.540 --> 01:00.670
It's mostly one command.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.020
You have to run and then you can start using the package now.

01:04.100 --> 01:09.380
Nonetheless you might have some niche use case where you have some functionality you need which isn't

01:09.380 --> 01:15.220
provided by expo or you have some other reason why you might want to build an app without Expo and therefore

01:15.330 --> 01:20.480
also have a separate module as already mentioned where I will show you how to build a react native app

01:20.510 --> 01:25.430
without Expo and it will all just show there how you could still add native device features.

01:25.430 --> 01:32.180
My recommendation however would always be that you use Expo because it's such a breeze to add such features

01:32.180 --> 01:33.470
to that app as you saw.
