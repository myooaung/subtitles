00:02.220 --> 00:07.370
So in this module we added this icon package. As you saw,

00:07.430 --> 00:12.710
it's a little bit of effort to connect it to iOS and Android but not that difficult in the end,

00:12.720 --> 00:14.630
just a couple of steps you have to do,

00:14.910 --> 00:17.160
always read the official documentation,

00:17.190 --> 00:18.760
it's really helpful for that.

00:18.990 --> 00:22.950
And as you saw, it can really mess up your development process,

00:23.020 --> 00:23.650
quit it,

00:23.670 --> 00:24.450
rebuild it,

00:24.450 --> 00:27.770
feel free to reinstall the apps on the device

00:27.900 --> 00:31.790
if or on the simulator if it failed, this often fixes it

00:31.890 --> 00:36.550
and by the end, you should have a working workflow again, a working build process

00:36.630 --> 00:42.030
and you added native features or a library accessing some native features to your app.
