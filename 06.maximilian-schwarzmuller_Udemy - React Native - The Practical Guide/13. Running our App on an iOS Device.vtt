In the last lecture we saw how to run our app on the iOS simulator, all you need is Xcode installed,

00:09.090 --> 00:11.790
now let's run it on an iPhone

00:12.150 --> 00:19.350
and chances are that even if you have an iPhone connected to your device, that if you run npm run iOS,

00:19.800 --> 00:23.710
it will just spin up your simulator again.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.860
So how can you work around that then?

00:27.180 --> 00:35.460
Well the simple answer is you start Xcode which you installed anyways, in your react native project you

00:35.460 --> 00:42.270
got this iOS folder and there you find your Xcode project, you can simply double click on it with Xcode installed

00:42.270 --> 00:45.960
and it will unsurprisingly launch Xcode,

00:45.960 --> 00:54.830
now once you open the project in Xcode, you can simply choose your device up there in the dropdown,

00:54.900 --> 00:57.310
there you should see your attached device

00:57.600 --> 01:03.510
and then you press the play button to launch it. You can enable developer mode on this Mac if

01:03.530 --> 01:07.190
you don't have that already.

01:07.300 --> 01:13.940
What this will now do is it will now take this project to basically rebuild it which it can, react native

01:13.940 --> 01:16.000
where our workflow already built it,

01:16.040 --> 01:22.570
now it will simply recompile it which should finish without any real errors preventing it from succeeding,

01:22.970 --> 01:26.780
you may ignore any warnings or errors you get here on the left

01:26.780 --> 01:31.840
as long as it finishes, everything is all right and you will actually see a lot of warnings

01:31.850 --> 01:37.040
as you can see, this first build can take a bit longer by the way.

01:37.370 --> 01:39.890
And here it now failed,

01:39.890 --> 01:44.370
now you see the error here on the left, code signing error, signing failed.

01:44.390 --> 01:48.380
Now you need to sign your apps which basically means confirm that you are who

01:48.470 --> 01:55.430
you pretend to be for your build to finish successfully and for that, you need an iOS developer account.

01:55.540 --> 02:01.580
So you can click add account here and then you can sign in with your Apple ID and see if you do have

02:01.580 --> 02:06.110
a developer account or just for this, no paid account is required for this though,

02:06.170 --> 02:07.610
a normal developer account 

02:07.640 --> 02:14.070
does it. Once you did add your team here, you can pick it from the dropdown,

02:14.310 --> 02:18.120
this will now automatically create a certificate and sign your app.

02:18.120 --> 02:25.650
Now you may also restart Xcode just to be safe because sometimes it hangs after you added this new team

02:25.650 --> 02:30.630
and it still won't build successfully even though everything is set up correctly.

02:30.750 --> 02:31.890
So after this,

02:32.010 --> 02:36.880
finally make sure your device is selected here and hit this play button again.

02:37.140 --> 02:41.970
Now as a side note whilst this is rebuilding, you'll of course notice that this wasn't required for

02:41.970 --> 02:43.520
running it on a simulator,

02:43.530 --> 02:50.730
so this is really only required if you want to run it on a real device even if that is your own one.

02:50.910 --> 02:57.090
With that, the build should succeed and it should add your application with this dummy icon to your

02:57.450 --> 03:00.260
device and automatically launch it,

03:00.270 --> 03:04.590
you can now also see this debug console here which would throw any errors,

03:04.590 --> 03:11.730
useful for debugging, I'll come back to that later in the course and you now see your application run

03:11.820 --> 03:14.400
on a real device.

03:14.400 --> 03:21.720
So with that we saw all four options, running the application on an Android and iOS simulator and on an

03:21.720 --> 03:23.920
Android and ios real device.

03:24.150 --> 03:29.940
With that a lot of setup was done but that is super important for really testing our application and

03:29.940 --> 03:31.770
seeing it run as it will run

03:31.770 --> 03:38.250
in the end. Now what I will do for the rest of the course is I mainly will use the Android and iOS

03:38.250 --> 03:45.480
simulators and we'll now dive back into the code and learn more about the built-in components, how

03:45.480 --> 03:50.940
to use them. what they do and how to build our own components and finally how to build an app.
