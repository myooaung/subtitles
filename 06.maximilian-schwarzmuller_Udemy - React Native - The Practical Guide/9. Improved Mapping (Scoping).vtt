00:02.340 --> 00:04.660
So we're fetching data writing data.

00:04.660 --> 00:11.430
We're using our token to authenticate ourselves to get access to restricted resources refusing to use

00:11.430 --> 00:18.240
ready to scope our products and also to scope our orders.

00:18.270 --> 00:22.500
With that we have the application which we can see here.

00:22.500 --> 00:29.220
Now one thing I noticed here is that if a log in and I go to my admin section I still don't see the

00:29.220 --> 00:33.380
product that just created so something's wrong there.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.000
Let's check our products.

00:35.030 --> 00:41.960
Action creator where I fetched a product to where I do the filtering there I check that the owner I.D.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.760
on the product I'm looking at is equal to my User A.

00:45.820 --> 00:48.520
Yet here of course I have a error.

00:48.590 --> 00:52.850
I still have my hardcoded owner I.D. that you owner I.D. here.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.240
Well that should of course be retrieved from the back end.

00:55.250 --> 01:01.520
So there for rest state a key dot owner ideal want to take the owner I.D. I get from the date I fetch

01:01.520 --> 01:02.970
on firebase.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.660
So if this change in place.

01:04.760 --> 01:12.000
Now if we do this again and we do log in again if I now go to admin now I see my scarf there.
