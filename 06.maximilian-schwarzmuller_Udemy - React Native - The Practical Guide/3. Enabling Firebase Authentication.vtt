I'm back in our application and I will of course use my firebase backend for authenticating since that

00:08.910 --> 00:10.800
is the entire backend of this app.

00:11.190 --> 00:17.760
The idea is always the same though, you have some server side logic to authenticate user, create users,

00:17.820 --> 00:20.890
store users and create these tokens,

00:21.180 --> 00:25.110
so that is something you might need to look up if you're building the frontend on your own,

00:25.110 --> 00:29.160
how to create these tokens in your favorite server side language.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.940
Firebase conveniently already offers us some rest API endpoints we can send requests to

00:36.000 --> 00:44.940
to create users and also to get such tokens. You can simply search for firebase auth rest and you should

00:44.940 --> 00:46.660
find this firebase auth rest

00:46.680 --> 00:56.350
API documentation, it's an official firebase document or part of the firebase documentation and there,

00:56.350 --> 01:03.760
you find some API endpoints you can send requests to to create new users, sign users in and do all kinds

01:03.760 --> 01:06.820
of different things like verify an email address and so on.

01:06.950 --> 01:13.360
Now we'll keep it simple here, we'll just sign user in and up and later then also do something else. For

01:13.350 --> 01:14.380
that of course,

01:14.380 --> 01:21.620
we also need to make sure that in our firebase project, we can authenticate. For that you should

01:21.620 --> 01:29.310
go into your firebase console and in that console, you can go to authentication here on the left,

01:29.420 --> 01:35.300
now before you can do anything, you need to enable authentication and you do this here by clicking on

01:35.330 --> 01:38.990
set up sign in method. You get various sign in methods

01:38.990 --> 01:44.430
but I want to use email and password where we really store the user data on our server,

01:44.480 --> 01:46.780
well on the firebase server in this case but

01:46.880 --> 01:54.460
in the firebase project. Simply click on that method and switch enable to true, hit save thereafter

01:54.530 --> 01:58.120
and now you can use these API endpoints here,

01:58.520 --> 02:04.610
so for example we can use the API endpoint for signing a user up with email and password.

02:04.610 --> 02:06.890
Let's start with that in the next lecture.
