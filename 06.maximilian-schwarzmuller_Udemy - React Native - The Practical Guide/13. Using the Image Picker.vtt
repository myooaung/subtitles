00:02.610 --> 00:06.820
Now that we added this new image picker package in the last lecture,

00:06.900 --> 00:08.900
let's now make sure we can pick an image.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.250
We got this pick image component which we include in the share place screen, there in our jsx code,

00:15.300 --> 00:21.180
we've pick image and I want this to work similarly to pick location, that we can pick an image in there

00:21.270 --> 00:23.780
and then we just get notified here through an event

00:24.000 --> 00:25.830
if an image was chosen.

00:25.990 --> 00:27.660
So let's work in pickimage.js

00:27.750 --> 00:32.430
therefore, here we have a class based component too which makes sense because we're also going to manage

00:32.430 --> 00:34.690
some internal state in here

00:34.980 --> 00:41.430
and the state I want to manage in here clearly is of course the image we picked, so I'll name this picked image.

00:42.420 --> 00:47.390
Now picked image by default will be null,

00:47.470 --> 00:49.420
so that's what we start with,

00:49.510 --> 00:55.450
then we here have our image which we assign a source of image placeholder, well the times of that

00:55.450 --> 01:01.880
are over I'm going to remove it and I'm going to change this to this state picked image. Now let's save

01:01.900 --> 01:03.860
this and see what this looks like.

01:04.300 --> 01:07.930
If we reload the iOS app and we log in there,

01:11.110 --> 01:15.140
now we get this empty container which makes sense because we got no image yet.

01:15.860 --> 01:21.750
Now my goal is to make the pick image button do something, should no longer throw this alert,

01:21.770 --> 01:25.240
instead it should trigger this image picker package

01:25.250 --> 01:29.450
we imported or we added and do something with it.

01:29.450 --> 01:33.520
Now you can of course read more about this package on the official documentation,

01:33.530 --> 01:37.070
it exposes one crucial method to us in the end.

01:37.070 --> 01:43.930
So I will import a picture like this, it's the default export from react native image picker, like that

01:45.110 --> 01:48.480
and then I'll add a new method here in pick image,

01:48.610 --> 01:49.590
I'll name it

01:51.020 --> 01:55.050
pick image handler, here I want to start this whole process,

01:55.100 --> 01:56.690
no arguments are required

01:56.690 --> 02:05.450
here. The goal now is to use the image picker object here and pick an image with it, so we can use image

02:05.450 --> 02:12.890
picture here and there we get one useful method, show image picker which will just present this action

02:12.890 --> 02:14.800
alert and handle all the rest.

02:15.620 --> 02:19.170
To this method, we pass two arguments,

02:19.170 --> 02:24.070
the first is object where we configure this, where we can mostly set the title,

02:24.120 --> 02:30.320
so pick an image, the title which will be shown on this action menu which comes up.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.890
The second argument then is the response,

02:33.900 --> 02:40.290
so here we get the response and we can then handle it in this arrow function body.

02:40.320 --> 02:46.380
Now the response can have various forms, it can of course always fail or maybe the user started to

02:46.380 --> 02:50.270
pick an image, like he opened the camera but then canceled,

02:50.280 --> 02:52.800
so we need to check all these cases.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.720
So here we have response

02:54.720 --> 02:56.000
did cancel,

02:56.010 --> 02:59.190
these are all properties exposed by the response object we get,

02:59.190 --> 03:02.940
so this is all managed by the image picker library.

03:02.940 --> 03:08.790
There I will log user cancelled and depending on your app, you of course might want to do something

03:08.790 --> 03:09.410
else here,

03:09.420 --> 03:12.390
here it doesn't really matter to me because I just won't set

03:12.390 --> 03:15.720
the picked image, it will still be null so we won't have an issue here

03:15.990 --> 03:22.590
but if this is an important event to you, this is how you could check it. An alternative, so a different

03:22.590 --> 03:24.050
case we could check for

03:24.100 --> 03:25.750
is that we got an error,

03:25.890 --> 03:30.150
so the error property could also exist. If it exists,

03:30.150 --> 03:32.710
well we got an error during picking this,

03:32.760 --> 03:38.180
this could be for example if you don't give the right permissions or anything like that

03:38.400 --> 03:43.160
and then I want to print that error here so that we can get deeper insights

03:43.560 --> 03:48.820
or else if we get no error and we did not cancel, we are successful.

03:49.050 --> 03:56.070
In this case we will get a URL or some path to the image, if the user took an image, it will be stored in

03:56.070 --> 04:02.690
some temporary path or in the camera roll and we will get a path to that and if we chose one from the

04:02.700 --> 04:05.410
image library, we will get a path to that.

04:05.790 --> 04:13.360
So here what I will do is I will call this set state and set picked image equal and now not to the

04:13.380 --> 04:19.930
path but to an object where I have a URI property set equal to the path.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.780
Why?

04:21.010 --> 04:22.470
Because of the way

04:22.660 --> 04:25.200
image source works here.

04:25.420 --> 04:29.820
Remember that it needs an object which has an URI property,

04:29.830 --> 04:31.710
that's just what I am setting up here,

04:32.050 --> 04:32.960
the URI

04:32.950 --> 04:35.870
we get is then indeed

04:36.130 --> 04:44.380
the URI of the image, like that. If we now save this, the image should update as soon as the user did

04:44.380 --> 04:46.760
indeed pick one.

04:46.770 --> 04:51.190
So just make sure that you now also hook up this button down there,

04:51.210 --> 04:58.590
so replace this dummy function with this pick image handler, save the file, save all files and go back

04:58.590 --> 05:04.680
to the application, reload the application, let's go to share place,

05:04.800 --> 05:09.950
let's now click pick image and we should see this action menu with your title.

05:10.030 --> 05:13.920
Now you cannot take a photo on the iOS simulator,

05:13.920 --> 05:18.090
this will only work on real devices but you can choose one from the library. 

05:18.090 --> 05:24.690
Now you're asked if you want to give permission, so click yes and now simply pick one of these images and

05:24.750 --> 05:26.620
you see it up there.

05:26.640 --> 05:31.980
Now we won't use that image though right now, we use it here but we don't pass it on.

05:32.220 --> 05:34.510
So this is what we'll do in the next lecture.
