WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:05.140
Now did we worked on the text here.

00:05.140 --> 00:11.250
For one we can now go back to Andreas and get rid of this temporary change here where we always showed

00:11.250 --> 00:12.100
a game over screen.

00:12.100 --> 00:17.350
We don't want to do that anymore instead we want to start with the normal start game screen again.

00:17.350 --> 00:24.790
And in addition to this change I now also want to make one extra adjustment and that's this start game

00:24.790 --> 00:25.720
button.

00:25.810 --> 00:31.000
We're using the normal button here which of course is something you can do but sometimes you also want

00:31.000 --> 00:35.910
to create your own button you want to have full control over how your button looks like.

00:36.130 --> 00:40.610
And for this you can of course create your own button and that's exactly what we're going to do now.

00:40.950 --> 00:45.700
Hence in the components folder I'll add my own button and you can named as whatever you want you could

00:45.700 --> 00:46.390
name it button.

00:46.390 --> 00:49.400
But that's kind of already the name of the built in one.

00:49.480 --> 00:56.740
And whilst you could of course still name yours like this to a wide any name clashes or confusion I'll

00:56.740 --> 01:04.330
name my button your main but because it will be my my main my primary button which I use for for the

01:04.330 --> 01:05.710
big actions in this game.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.480
Like starting a new game.

01:07.720 --> 01:12.730
Now that's the file name in there we'll have a regular react component of course.

01:12.730 --> 01:14.470
Therefore we import react.

01:14.590 --> 01:18.160
We import a view here we will certainly need some text.

01:18.160 --> 01:23.960
We'll certainly need a style sheet from React Native like this.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.990
And then here we have the main button component which receives props and which in the end will return

01:29.990 --> 01:35.290
some J as X we'll have our styles object with Styles she'd create.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.310
And as always we'll export our main button.

01:39.310 --> 01:42.100
And now the question is how do you build your own button.

01:42.110 --> 01:48.640
Now it might sound very complex to do that but actually it isn't your own button is all just a combination

01:48.640 --> 01:56.890
of view and text and very important also a touchable component like touchable highlight or touchable

01:56.890 --> 02:01.300
opacity or touchable native feedback or even touchable without feedback.

02:01.360 --> 02:06.940
If you don't want to give any visual feedback so here I'll go with touchable opacity and we need that

02:06.940 --> 02:13.690
to give the user feedback regarding the fact that the button was pressed and to register on press event

02:14.320 --> 02:19.720
and Abbott and dad will just build our button with with a view which we styled in a certain way and

02:19.720 --> 02:21.370
a text in there.

02:21.370 --> 02:29.330
So now here in main button we can return our touchable opacity and then there have a view which we can

02:29.330 --> 02:34.120
use to then styled a button and in there maybe a text for a text a button should have.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.680
Now let's say our button should be usable such that we passed a text directly between the opening and

02:39.680 --> 02:41.600
closing tax of our component.

02:41.600 --> 02:46.030
Hence here we can use props children as the text I want to show on the button.

02:46.300 --> 02:55.990
And then here on this view I'll have a style of let's say styles button on this inner text here we could

02:55.990 --> 03:04.860
have a style of styles button text and these names are up to you of course and on the touchable pass.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.920
I'll add the on press listener and we'll have to do something there.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.430
So now we get the skeleton for our button.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.700
Now we can start adding some styles to it.

03:13.790 --> 03:18.450
Now of course you can styled it button in whatever way you want.

03:18.470 --> 03:20.410
I got a certain style in mind here which I'll add.

03:20.420 --> 03:24.490
But again definitely play around with that and apply your own styles.

03:24.530 --> 03:30.620
So for the button itself which is the view around the text I want to give the button a certain background

03:30.620 --> 03:34.850
color and you could also ensure that this can be set from outside of course.

03:34.850 --> 03:42.180
You can get really creative here all hardcoded color in here by of course using my colors constant here.

03:42.270 --> 03:48.960
So I'll import colors from constants colors whips colors like this.

03:49.100 --> 03:55.710
And then here use colors primary color the primary color maybe like that.

03:55.790 --> 04:00.380
So that's a background color does but you should have again you could also make sure that this style

04:00.380 --> 04:04.090
is set dynamically with the help of some prop you're getting from outside.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.290
But here are all hardcoded in here.

04:06.290 --> 04:11.180
In addition to that the button should have some padding so that the text doesn't sit directly on the

04:11.270 --> 04:13.130
edges of the button container.

04:13.130 --> 04:19.310
So if the box around the text but there is some spacing and you can use the same padding in all directions.

04:19.310 --> 04:22.590
But I want to use a padding vertical of twelfth.

04:22.640 --> 04:29.300
So not that much padding to top and bottom and a padding horizontal of let's say 30.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.550
So way more padding to left and right.

04:32.710 --> 04:36.830
That's the button now for the text of the button there.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.500
Also the color of white which should look good on our primary color.

04:41.500 --> 04:47.290
You could use black too because our primary color actually is a color where as you can see both white

04:47.410 --> 04:49.480
and black actually work.

04:49.480 --> 04:55.840
So you could use either but I'll go with white here for the button and I'll add a fun family of open

04:55.840 --> 05:01.780
sense to use this custom font there as well as you learn you need to set this on every text there is

05:01.780 --> 05:07.150
no inheritance there is no global font you could set up every text that should use this fund needs to

05:07.150 --> 05:15.840
get it and I'll add a font size of let's say 18 to have a bigger text here in this button now when the

05:15.840 --> 05:21.720
button is pressed then I actually of course typically don't want to handle this press event instead

05:21.720 --> 05:24.990
of the button but instead of the component where we use the button.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.160
So I simply want to forward it.

05:27.180 --> 05:33.330
And for Dad we can simply expect to get a function reference and event handler function on the let's

05:33.330 --> 05:36.490
say on press prop of our custom button.

05:36.510 --> 05:41.670
But you could named as prop anything you could name it on click because in the end it's you who uses

05:41.670 --> 05:42.510
your own button.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.540
And there you just have to make sure you pass a fitting function reference a fitting pointer at an event

05:48.540 --> 05:54.310
handler function to order on press or whatever you name it prop on your own button.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.680
So this name is up to you.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.610
Now let's use the main button and let's use it on a start.

05:58.610 --> 06:02.170
Game screen there we can simply import it.

06:02.190 --> 06:13.230
So import the main button from components main button and this main button now is used here for starting

06:13.230 --> 06:14.170
a new game.

06:14.230 --> 06:16.980
So I'll replace button here with main button.

06:16.980 --> 06:23.610
But keep in mind that on this button I configured the content the text to be shown such that it's actually

06:23.610 --> 06:31.440
the content which is passed between the opening and closing tax of our button and therefore back into

06:31.440 --> 06:32.790
started games screen.

06:32.790 --> 06:38.760
The title here is no longer passed on a title prop but instead now we have an opening and closing tag

06:38.760 --> 06:42.730
for our own for our own button and we add start game there.

06:44.110 --> 06:50.170
Now on press is still a prop we leave here because in the main button I forward to on press event.

06:50.230 --> 06:54.520
So to say to the function I get on my own on press prop here.

06:54.520 --> 07:00.870
Therefore we have to set the on press prop on our own button and therefore with that we should have

07:00.870 --> 07:04.500
a nice main button here a nice button when we start a new game

07:07.840 --> 07:09.280
let's give this a try here.

07:09.310 --> 07:13.680
This is how it looks like and that looks quite nice in my opinion the nice button.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.080
I'm not done though.

07:15.220 --> 07:19.360
I want to have rounded corners on that button for that back in the main button file.

07:19.360 --> 07:24.640
We can of course simply go to this button property here in the stalls sheet which is the style object

07:24.640 --> 07:32.650
getting applied to our view and there we can add a border radius of twenty five and if we do that then

07:32.650 --> 07:39.210
you'll see that if I now get this button it now has this nice look here pops.

07:39.450 --> 07:45.580
Let you also show it on Android now has rounded corners and has this nice opacity of fact when you tap

07:45.580 --> 07:46.120
on it.

07:46.270 --> 07:51.680
And by the way as mentioned early already you can change this opacity effect by going to detachable

07:51.730 --> 07:58.080
opacity component and there you can set the active opacity to the level of opacity you want to have

07:58.120 --> 07:59.090
when it's pressed.

07:59.140 --> 08:04.040
For example if you use a robber a high value here then this effect is less strong.

08:04.060 --> 08:10.930
Now it's only slightly transparent when we tap on it and not as transparent as before but that's totally

08:10.930 --> 08:11.980
up to you what you want here.

08:11.980 --> 08:15.530
All go for dot six year to have a slightly stronger effect.

08:15.610 --> 08:21.130
But again that's something you can configure and in general my suggestion would be that you play around

08:21.130 --> 08:28.950
with that and see how you can style that button how you can really find unit to your requirements now

08:28.950 --> 08:31.140
with the custom button add it.

08:31.140 --> 08:33.170
I also want to use it on the game over screen.

08:33.270 --> 08:42.380
So there are also import main button from components main button like this.

08:42.610 --> 08:49.110
And then simply add dead main button here when we show our new game button on there.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.620
Use the main button instead they have removed the title prop because that's not how we're setting the

08:53.620 --> 08:55.710
title on our own custom button.

08:55.720 --> 09:02.840
Instead we have to pass it here between you opening and closing tax of our well custom component tax.

09:03.040 --> 09:11.950
So therefore now here this should also look nicer if we quickly finish a game here trying to let the

09:11.950 --> 09:13.540
computer a guess 30 free

09:17.550 --> 09:20.730
here we are and now we see the nice button here too.

09:20.730 --> 09:24.540
We also see the correct output here regarding the number of rounds it took and the number we had to

09:24.540 --> 09:25.440
guess.

09:25.440 --> 09:30.510
And we can start a new game thereafter and also go for that again real quick

09:36.440 --> 09:36.770
yeah.

09:36.870 --> 09:44.900
That's all looking really nice the remaining thing I now still want to do is I want to work on these

09:44.900 --> 09:46.520
two buttons lower and greater.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.230
They look a bit boring.

09:48.290 --> 09:54.200
I'd say we can certainly make them look more exciting now one way of making them look a bit more exciting

09:54.200 --> 09:56.690
is that we use our custom button there as well.

09:57.020 --> 10:04.710
So of course here in the game screen we can also import the main button from components main button.

10:04.730 --> 10:09.650
So our own custom button and use that instead of the button we're currently using which is built in

10:09.660 --> 10:12.070
one so use our own button here.

10:12.200 --> 10:17.770
They offer of course used move the title between the opening and closing tax.

10:17.870 --> 10:24.710
So here that's lower than here for the second button that is greater.

10:25.220 --> 10:31.610
And now it is should look a bit nicer if we start a new game here.

10:31.640 --> 10:35.470
Now we use our custom buttons here though now we also see a problem.

10:35.590 --> 10:39.440
There is simply a bit too big there too close to each other.

10:39.530 --> 10:44.540
We can change that however by going down to the button container and giving this a bit more with maybe

10:44.540 --> 10:47.550
set the max with to 90 percent here actually.

10:47.560 --> 10:53.490
So now if he tries again Yeah that looks a bit better dairies at least some spacing between the buttons

10:53.490 --> 10:58.380
and for now it is will do because for now we're not optimizing for all screen sizes.

10:58.530 --> 11:04.140
Let's also increase this with here to 400 those so that if we have enough with we do actually use 400

11:04.140 --> 11:09.160
pixels and now this looks good here on Iowa's

11:12.590 --> 11:15.880
and also on Android now it looks a bit better as I mentioned.

11:15.890 --> 11:22.700
But wouldn't it be also nice if we had icons in there instead of text because text of course works but

11:22.700 --> 11:24.650
an icon might also do the trick.

11:24.650 --> 11:30.830
And we haven't used I can far since you off need them in mobile apps though it's definitely something

11:30.830 --> 11:36.980
you should also be aware of you should be aware of how to work with icons how to add icons inside of

11:36.980 --> 11:39.370
your app and debt step for what we'll do next.
