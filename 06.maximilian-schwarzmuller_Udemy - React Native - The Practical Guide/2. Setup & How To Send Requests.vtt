00:02.300 --> 00:07.040
Now for that I'm back in my coat and first of all we need a server.

00:07.040 --> 00:12.080
Now I won't write my own server side code because this course of course is not about services.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.300
Technologies like no jazz.

00:14.450 --> 00:20.870
Instead we can use Firebase which is a free to use service or free to get started at least where we

00:20.870 --> 00:24.890
don't need to write any suicide code to still get a service side API.

00:24.890 --> 00:25.960
We can work with.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.860
For that you just need a Google account.

00:27.860 --> 00:33.600
And with that on fire based on Google dot com you can go to that console and they are create a new fire

00:33.600 --> 00:40.440
based project simply click on Add project data and give it any name you want like our incomplete guide.

00:40.460 --> 00:46.490
Any name you like set this checkmark here and create the project and wait for this to be done which

00:46.490 --> 00:48.010
will be super fast.

00:48.070 --> 00:53.690
Now getting started with firebase won't cost you anything and you don't need a credit card to get started.

00:53.690 --> 00:59.210
Check out the firebase pricing documentation if you plan on using this in your production ready application

00:59.210 --> 01:00.630
of course.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.900
So this was created and now we're taking to this newly created app and firebase actually has a bunch

01:05.900 --> 01:06.850
of services.

01:06.920 --> 01:11.100
It's a fully managed backend which we all won't need.

01:11.270 --> 01:14.600
I just need to database there and that's important by the way.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.700
Firebase sounds like it's a database which we connect to our app.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.520
Actually you never directly connect a cloud database to your application.

01:23.540 --> 01:27.230
Instead your application will always communicate with an API.

01:27.230 --> 01:33.530
Typically arrest API which then in turn talks to a database because directly setting up a connection

01:33.530 --> 01:35.510
would be insecure.

01:35.510 --> 01:36.580
So that's how we'll do it.

01:36.590 --> 01:43.400
And firebase will give us both a rest api and then a database to which that API talks behind the scenes

01:43.580 --> 01:46.340
without us writing any query code.

01:46.370 --> 01:51.020
Still we need to enable that database by clicking on database here and there.

01:51.020 --> 01:56.900
Make sure you scroll down to the real time database and you click Create their real time database not

01:56.900 --> 01:57.650
fire a store.

01:58.130 --> 02:05.090
Instead use the real time database and important start and test mode which makes sure that the rules

02:05.090 --> 02:09.660
the security rules are set up such that no authentication is required.

02:09.740 --> 02:15.080
We'll change that later to require authentication but for now we have no users so we will start like

02:15.080 --> 02:16.180
this.

02:16.190 --> 02:21.800
Note this is later where you will see your data which you write to Firebase and its database and this

02:21.800 --> 02:28.970
is the you are L or a part of the you or l You need to send requests to to store data data or to fetch

02:28.970 --> 02:30.190
data from there.

02:30.300 --> 02:35.690
And the cool thing about firebase real time database is that it kind of gives you a database hidden

02:35.690 --> 02:42.410
behind the rest api where you can Target's dynamic arrest API endpoints which will then automatically

02:42.410 --> 02:47.360
be translated to write or update requests on your database.

02:47.360 --> 02:53.240
So it looks like your directly talking to a database but you always will talk to a rest api and then

02:53.240 --> 02:57.500
your incoming requests are kind of automatically translated to database Carys.

02:57.500 --> 03:04.290
You could say this however is to you or L or an important part of you or l We will talk to though.

03:04.580 --> 03:11.480
So with that you are Al will talk to you and why don't we start with making sure that we can actually

03:11.480 --> 03:16.190
create new products and stored them there so that when I submit a new product we don't just save it

03:16.190 --> 03:22.080
here in memory but we actually send the request to Firebase to store it on its servers.

03:22.100 --> 03:25.740
That is exactly what I want to do here because to me that makes a lot of sense.
