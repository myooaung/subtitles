In the last lectures, I had a look at the platform API, a super important API which allows you to render

00:08.930 --> 00:14.750
different things, whatever you want, depending on the platform you're running on.

00:14.750 --> 00:21.620
Now I mentioned on the slide that the alternative is to load different apps or layouts from your index.ios

00:21.700 --> 00:24.350
and index.android.js files

00:24.650 --> 00:30.410
What we do here and what you will see in quite a lot of apps is that we actually load the same entry

00:30.410 --> 00:34.230
point, we just load the app file and in the app file,

00:34.310 --> 00:39.920
we start our single screen app but theoretically of course, you could load totally different apps and

00:39.920 --> 00:45.380
I just wanted to highlight this. The code in these two files doesn't have to be the same,

00:45.470 --> 00:47.580
it might be but doesn't have to be

00:47.630 --> 00:52.520
and if you had very different layouts, very different apps and still somehow want to have them in the

00:52.520 --> 00:57.800
same project, you can use these different entry points to start different routes

00:57.890 --> 01:00.080
and of course you're still in the same project,

01:00.170 --> 01:03.830
so you still can reuse components across platforms.

01:03.950 --> 01:05.070
So the sky's the limit

01:05.120 --> 01:07.370
or your imagination is the limit,

01:07.400 --> 01:14.540
definitely use these tools to create an app that is as engaging as possible for the users using your

01:14.540 --> 01:14.810
app.
