In the last lecture we got our app to run on the Android simulator,

00:05.590 --> 00:06.180
now that's great

00:06.190 --> 00:08.150
but for now, I'll close it there.

00:08.170 --> 00:11.770
Now I want to run the application on a real Android device, for that

00:11.770 --> 00:18.820
I connected my Android phone and you need to turn on developer mode there and enable USB debugging,

00:18.820 --> 00:21.950
you can find instructions about this attached to this video.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.580
So now I will run npm run android again,

00:24.760 --> 00:28.750
the only other prerequisite is that the simulator isn't running anymore,

00:28.780 --> 00:34.750
otherwise it might launch it there. With all that, it will build the application and you already see here, it's

00:34.980 --> 00:36.490
shipping it to my phone.

00:36.490 --> 00:37.520
And here is my phone,

00:37.540 --> 00:39.760
that's the app running on my phone now.

00:40.030 --> 00:41.760
So that's another nice mode

00:41.770 --> 00:47.410
you can test your app on though I will mostly use the simulator during this course here since it's a bit

00:47.410 --> 00:49.170
faster and more convenient

00:49.330 --> 00:53.340
but this is it running on the device. So there, almost no set up needed,

00:53.380 --> 00:57.600
all the steps are mentioned in the document attached to this video.

00:57.610 --> 01:01.630
Now with that, let's see how we can run the app on an iPhone simulator.
