WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:08.770
So he saw the installation of Riak native navigation on iOS and that hasn't changed since I recorded

00:08.770 --> 00:09.880
the course.

00:09.940 --> 00:13.690
The installation on Android has changed a little bit.

00:13.690 --> 00:20.230
Generally you should still follow the steps you see here in their official docs and that is what all

00:20.230 --> 00:21.760
now do together with you.

00:21.770 --> 00:27.430
And if this were you I recorded originally but then we'll have to do a little adjustment which I'll

00:27.490 --> 00:28.390
also do with you.

00:28.390 --> 00:31.660
So now let's first of all follow fruity steps again.

00:31.690 --> 00:36.970
Don't worry if you see me browse a different web page data simply because I recorded this in the past.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.440
But the steps are the same and it will work in the same.

00:39.460 --> 00:40.170
No worries.

00:40.180 --> 00:42.900
So let's go for that right now.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.400
Now where does your First of all need to install the package.

00:45.400 --> 00:51.940
If you haven't done this already and as I said in the Iowa section yarn at that's just non-target of

00:51.940 --> 00:56.520
two NPM you can replace it with NPM installed dash dash save.

00:56.710 --> 01:02.980
So I already ran this command but of course if you haven't make sure to run NPM install dash dash save

01:03.220 --> 01:07.870
re-act dash native dash navigation like this.

01:07.870 --> 01:13.410
Now one important note to highlight here is that you want install question one which you force by adding

01:13.410 --> 01:16.530
at at one ofter the installation command.

01:16.600 --> 01:22.660
So after Riak dash native dash navigation you add at one end you get Riak native navigation Where's

01:22.750 --> 01:23.610
one.

01:23.710 --> 01:29.290
Now once you do this you have to add something to your Android settings Graylock fall LaFalce so copy

01:29.290 --> 01:36.360
that code they provide here in this snippet and then your project go into the Android folder there.

01:36.400 --> 01:43.270
You can now simply go into your settings cradle fall right on the top level of this android folder so

01:43.260 --> 01:48.400
or so settings cradle and there are loads of vector icons for example.

01:48.510 --> 01:55.090
Anstiss code here you just copied which basically says same code as 40 vector icons just for you Reyk

01:55.090 --> 02:04.260
native navigation package with a path to this package as a next step go to Step number free.

02:04.340 --> 02:10.510
And now you need to update your project dependencies in the Android app built cradle of fall.

02:10.820 --> 02:14.200
So if we're dead we actually need to update two parts of that fall.

02:14.450 --> 02:22.460
Let's copy the first part from that Android section and let's go to Android app and there it is built

02:22.490 --> 02:27.530
cradle file and search for it has Android part in there.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.810
Here it is easy read.

02:29.810 --> 02:34.050
Now we have a STK word against We're compiling of 20 free.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.020
This library requires 25.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.390
So let's just paste in the code we just copied.

02:39.760 --> 02:48.100
Now as a nextstep we copy that code here and search for the dependencies area in that file year and

02:48.100 --> 02:51.100
below the Riak native vector Aikins code.

02:51.250 --> 02:59.570
We enter our code we just copied with that we can move on to Section 4.

02:59.740 --> 03:03.310
We have to edit our main activity dot of fall.

03:03.400 --> 03:09.690
It should extend does splash activity class here instead of re-act activity.

03:10.030 --> 03:16.020
So you can find this fall under Android app source main Java.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.530
And there it's in this main activity file.

03:18.820 --> 03:25.900
And as it says on the documentation we should no longer extend to react activity but dishcloths instead.

03:26.140 --> 03:33.820
And of course you can also simply import dishcloths to not having to it you don't have to write the

03:33.820 --> 03:34.940
full pop your.

03:34.990 --> 03:43.120
You can also just extend splash activity if instead of this thing you import com react native navigation

03:43.120 --> 03:45.220
control a splash activity.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.950
So that's the first thing you have to do.

03:48.220 --> 03:54.790
The next step 5 is that we have to edit our main application java file there and we first of all have

03:54.790 --> 04:04.890
to add an import Let's do that simply adds that fall below vector I can import for example and there's

04:04.890 --> 04:06.260
a next step.

04:06.260 --> 04:10.500
We also have to change to continent this fall.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.820
Now here we will do this with care.

04:13.820 --> 04:20.840
I copy all the content from the main application class and I will comment out the existing code so that

04:20.840 --> 04:24.010
it's effectively deleted and paste in a new one.

04:24.020 --> 04:32.390
But remember that we already added the vector icons to our get packages method and the last course module.

04:32.390 --> 04:33.860
Of course we still need to do that.

04:33.890 --> 04:35.850
So still copy dead.

04:36.260 --> 04:40.980
And now we have a new package this fall and there we should enter this.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.650
And it actually even shows this as an example.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.860
So make sure to add this here in this list.

04:46.880 --> 04:51.150
Nothing else needs to be added re-act native navigation doesn't need to be added here.

04:52.060 --> 04:57.250
Now with this we're almost done but if we have a look at the documentation we see that we all need change

04:57.250 --> 04:58.370
to class.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.730
Our main application extends.

05:01.180 --> 05:07.480
So here when we extend application implemented re-act application we should change this to just extends

05:07.540 --> 05:09.280
navigation application.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.970
That's what we're importing here.

05:11.170 --> 05:17.590
Now after you followed all the installation steps for re-act native navigation on Android if you tried

05:17.590 --> 05:21.050
to run your app you'll most likely encounter an error.

05:21.190 --> 05:28.090
No you fix this error by following the steps you find in PTF document attached to this video and I just

05:28.090 --> 05:33.400
attach it so that you can conveniently copy in the commands I have there or add a text to code I have

05:33.400 --> 05:34.250
there.

05:34.270 --> 05:41.680
So first of all go to Step 1 which tells you which compile STK where to set and you do that in the Android

05:42.010 --> 05:44.800
app and there the built Grettel file.

05:45.630 --> 05:49.950
Isn't there you most likely replaced this year.

05:49.950 --> 05:59.900
Compile STK Worthen as instructed in these salacious Doxil for android with this code here where you

05:59.900 --> 06:02.030
said it to work and 22:5.

06:02.180 --> 06:03.350
Now don't do that.

06:03.470 --> 06:08.660
Basically set it back to disk code which you had in there originally and what you find in this attached

06:08.720 --> 06:14.930
PDF document and step one just replace decompilers to Kate Waren and built to work with that content

06:14.960 --> 06:16.240
you see on my screen.

06:16.370 --> 06:23.920
Don't use the content you see here on their docs page in Dead same file.

06:23.920 --> 06:32.140
You also want to scroll down to dependencies and there replace all the dependencies you find here with

06:32.140 --> 06:39.720
the dependencies listed in my attached PTF and the very important dependency is this design dependency.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.950
So you can also just add this if you already had all the dependencies your business the important one

06:45.460 --> 06:52.460
with all of that at it you should be able to run your project with Riak native navigation at it.

06:52.540 --> 06:57.670
Now you'll most likely see a wide screen because we haven't added any pages will do all of that in the

06:57.670 --> 06:58.700
next lectures.

06:58.960 --> 07:05.770
But does this now Riak native navigation installed in a way that should work and then simply rerun android

07:05.770 --> 07:08.860
with NPM run Android to rebuild your project.

07:08.860 --> 07:11.950
This can take a bit longer now since we changed a lot.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.520
Thereafter we should have a running application.

07:14.650 --> 07:20.900
Feel free to quit this development process and this extra terminal window with control Control-C too

07:20.950 --> 07:23.460
before you run this command.

07:23.560 --> 07:27.900
And here I got an error because there is a tiny mistake even though it's well-documented.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.030
Our main activity here.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.080
Of course I should get rid of this function.

07:34.090 --> 07:38.230
It even Sassone documentation documentation's so make sure to delete this and they're off to rerun.

07:38.230 --> 07:39.570
NPM run Android.

07:39.670 --> 07:46.120
With that we to successfully rebuild reac database application that's now do the same for iOS and continue.
