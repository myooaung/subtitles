00:02.420 --> 00:08.240
We covered a lot of ground in this module already and the basics of react native and how we work with

00:08.240 --> 00:14.960
it, how we work with these built-in components and how we can build our own components with these built

00:14.950 --> 00:19.830
in components, just like in the web where we use divs and spans instead,

00:20.150 --> 00:22.480
all that should be clear by now.

00:22.490 --> 00:26.030
Now there's one other thing I definitely want to highlight,

00:26.030 --> 00:29.980
always keep in mind that we are building a react app here right,

00:29.980 --> 00:34.160
so we're building react components with the normal react framework,

00:34.160 --> 00:37.060
you can tell that by the imports.

00:37.060 --> 00:42.730
Therefore every component we create, every class based component I should say of course also has the

00:42.740 --> 00:44.390
typical lifecycle hooks,

00:44.570 --> 00:51.800
so we can add compinentDidMount and so on here in this component, just as we can add it in a well web

00:51.830 --> 00:54.120
based react application.

00:54.140 --> 01:02.060
So all these lifecycle hooks can be used here and in general, all the things you know about react components

01:02.210 --> 01:05.830
from react web applications apply here too,

01:05.960 --> 01:11.710
regarding state management, refs, lifecycle hooks, prop type validation,

01:11.750 --> 01:17.000
all these things which I won't repeat here because you should have covered them already in some react

01:17.000 --> 01:17.990
course,

01:17.990 --> 01:20.160
all these things also apply here

01:20.270 --> 01:27.170
and I just wanted to emphasize this because it can be easy to overlook this, to feel like a react native

01:27.170 --> 01:33.080
app is something completely different and it just isn't. The biggest difference is that you use different

01:33.080 --> 01:36.860
components or elements for building your application

01:36.890 --> 01:41.840
and of course that you have to keep in mind that you're running your application in a different environment,

01:42.080 --> 01:48.660
so that you have access to some native device features which we'll also cover in this course like the camera

01:48.680 --> 01:53.900
and maps and add some other features you know from the browser might be missing.

01:54.170 --> 01:59.990
Let me dive deeper into that in the next lecture and let me explain which typical javascript features

01:59.990 --> 02:04.130
you can use in a react native app and which features you can't use.
