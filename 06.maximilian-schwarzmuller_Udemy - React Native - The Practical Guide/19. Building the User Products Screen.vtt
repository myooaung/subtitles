WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:08.380
Now that we have the basic flow down that we can navigate between our products add them to the cart

00:08.410 --> 00:13.900
and then also use the car to place an order and also view that order and of course also edit the card

00:13.930 --> 00:15.040
if we wanted to.

00:15.070 --> 00:20.530
Now that all of that is done it's time to move towards the last part of his application which is of

00:20.530 --> 00:24.430
course the part where you can add new products.

00:24.430 --> 00:29.960
No that's all that apart which will refine later on because later we'll of course dive deeper into you

00:29.980 --> 00:36.770
handling user input and we'll even store that data on a server but we can already get started here to

00:36.770 --> 00:37.910
get started.

00:37.910 --> 00:42.560
The user product screen and the added product screen will become important now because these are the

00:42.560 --> 00:47.450
screens where we see all our products and where we can also then added the products.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.720
So let's start with the user products screen.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.420
Let's turned into a react component by importing react from react.

00:53.600 --> 01:01.970
And unsurprisingly by importing stuff from React Native the stuff I want to import here is the flat

01:01.970 --> 01:06.250
list again because I'll output a list of products in the end.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.260
On this user products screen.

01:08.630 --> 01:15.650
Therefore here we have the user products screen component which receives props and where I then need

01:15.650 --> 01:22.960
to return some J.S. ex and at the bottom of the file I'll export this component as a default.

01:23.090 --> 01:29.670
That's my default component setup I used over and over again now in here.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.070
I want to output my components or my my products with a flat list and I will reuse that product item

01:38.070 --> 01:40.560
component we build earlier.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.130
So back in user products we can import

01:47.030 --> 01:51.020
the product item from the components folder.

01:51.020 --> 01:57.090
So let's go there and there to shop and then order and not order but product item.

01:57.230 --> 02:03.320
And here of course all the pass and some data now the data I want to pass in here should be the products

02:03.320 --> 02:06.140
that belonged to my locked in user.

02:06.140 --> 02:11.450
We have no locked in user at the moment but if you remember the products reducer there we are faking

02:11.450 --> 02:17.300
that we have because there we have that user products array which holds all the products which in this

02:17.300 --> 02:25.130
case here have a user I.D. owner I.D. of you one and I just assume for the moment to have some dummy

02:25.130 --> 02:31.930
data that this is our currently locked and user data later does will of course be a dynamic so user

02:31.930 --> 02:37.930
product is what we need back into user products screen we therefore need to get that data from redux

02:37.930 --> 02:44.540
with the help of use selector from react redux like this.

02:44.560 --> 02:55.680
And here we get our user products by calling use selector where we pass in that function it gets the

02:55.680 --> 03:02.520
state then reaches out to the products part of our store products because that's the identifier I use

03:02.520 --> 03:10.590
there and then as I just said access does user products field here so id and the user product screen

03:10.590 --> 03:18.990
here we access dot user products user products is now the array we feed into data as always here I will

03:18.990 --> 03:26.870
add a key extractor which gives me the idea because my product as stored here in user products uses

03:26.880 --> 03:31.860
of course my product model in the end and therefore has an idea that is a unique identifier which I

03:31.860 --> 03:38.400
can use so I will use it and then of course as always also we need to add a render item you obviously

03:38.400 --> 03:46.830
know that pattern already render item gets D item data here and I want to return a new product item

03:46.830 --> 03:53.130
for every entry here and product item if we have a look at it takes a couple of pieces of information

03:53.670 --> 04:05.790
it takes a on view detail prop here it takes a title prop a price prop an image prop and then also on

04:05.790 --> 04:07.300
Add To Cart prop.

04:07.400 --> 04:12.840
Now you might already see that not all these props really fit our purpose if we use that on the user

04:12.840 --> 04:18.840
product screen because this will not be a screen where we can shop for products this is not a screen

04:18.840 --> 04:26.310
where I want to be able to add products to a cart I want to output them as I do here with the image

04:26.310 --> 04:34.920
to price and so on but I don't care so much about whether we can click them or about these buttons so

04:34.920 --> 04:39.310
we'll start adding the product item like this but we will have to fine tune it.

04:39.510 --> 04:46.170
So what we need is titled price image and on view detail and on Add To Cart.

04:46.170 --> 04:53.430
So we need the image here and that of course is item data dot item dot image you are L because you must

04:53.430 --> 04:59.400
not forget that item data dot item in the end points as a product as the point here in the model hence

04:59.400 --> 05:08.540
will have this image you are L property and then here we also need the title which is accessible through

05:08.570 --> 05:17.840
item data not item title we need the price which is accessible with item data not item dot price if

05:17.840 --> 05:23.570
we have a look at the product item component that fulfills everything we need here but now we need on

05:23.570 --> 05:30.380
view detail on and on Add to Cart and then we'll add those temporarily but we'll have to find a different

05:30.380 --> 05:31.100
solution here.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.290
So on view detail so empty.

05:34.290 --> 05:41.760
Function at the moment and on Add To Cart also empty function and we'll implement this differently later

05:42.270 --> 05:47.370
for the moment however I'm outputting a product item here and therefore we can now navigate to the user

05:47.370 --> 05:54.600
products screen to get there it's time to go back to the shop navigator and at the end I want to add

05:54.600 --> 06:00.420
them to my draw and navigator but as a separate stack just like products and orders are a separate stack.

06:00.420 --> 06:03.120
This should also be a separate stack.

06:03.120 --> 06:11.160
We can't just copy the orders navigator stack here replicate this and import the user product screen

06:11.160 --> 06:11.550
here.

06:11.580 --> 06:19.440
So user products screen from the screens folder they are from the user folder and then user product

06:19.440 --> 06:27.180
screen and map this in the newly copied stack down there which I'll not name.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.140
Orders navigator cause I have that name here already but I'll name it let's say admin navigator maybe

06:35.570 --> 06:43.900
and here I have my user products identifier which points at the user products screen now here.

06:43.920 --> 06:51.170
As I can in the draw I want to have the M.D. create and I w create icon and algorithm that should be

06:51.170 --> 06:51.670
fine.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.460
Now we just need to add this navigator to our draw navigator.

06:55.460 --> 07:02.830
They are all at the admin key and point at Edmond navigator so now we should actually be able to reach

07:02.830 --> 07:08.980
that if we go back to the app we have to admin entry and if I click it get a problem regarding my user

07:08.980 --> 07:14.080
products state undefined is not an object.

07:14.090 --> 07:19.880
Let's have a quick look at the user product screen Yeah.

07:19.910 --> 07:25.880
That should be products because our slice is named products here and combined reducer.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.990
So here it should all be products.

07:28.080 --> 07:34.590
Little typo from my side now does looks better and now might look like nothing changed but actually

07:34.590 --> 07:40.830
you can see my navigation items are gone because now I am on a new screen but I have my my old list

07:40.830 --> 07:42.910
here but with less products.

07:43.020 --> 07:47.190
If you compare Android where I'm on the starting screen we have more products there.

07:47.190 --> 07:50.340
Now I only have the ones where you one is the own right.

07:50.730 --> 07:51.550
So that's good.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.850
But of course I don't like these buttons here.

07:54.930 --> 07:58.960
And I also want to have a header a menu item here and a header title of course.

07:58.980 --> 08:03.930
There are some things we need to fix these buttons of course are the most important thing or the most

08:03.930 --> 08:08.270
striking thing that's wrong though still.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.420
I'll start with the header in the user products screen here.

08:11.450 --> 08:19.910
We can add the navigation options user products screen navigation options and there set a header title

08:19.910 --> 08:30.130
of your products for example and we also need the menu button so we can actually also go to the product

08:30.160 --> 08:35.930
overview screen and from there copy does head or left part here.

08:36.020 --> 08:39.620
Go back to user product screen and add does here.

08:39.620 --> 08:44.900
Now however we need that function form of the navigation options where we then in the end return the

08:44.900 --> 08:50.210
object with all the options in there so that's something we need to change like this.

08:50.660 --> 08:55.880
And we also need to make sure we import header buttons item and header button.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.300
So back in the product overview screen there I have these imports here.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.310
Copy them from the product overview screen.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.990
Go to the user product screen and add them.

09:06.010 --> 09:09.050
They're like this for example.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.940
So did you import everything you need.

09:10.940 --> 09:16.400
We also need to import the platform API because we're also using that when setting up the header buttons

09:18.210 --> 09:25.800
now at least when we go to the admin area we have our title leader we have to the draw the menu button

09:25.800 --> 09:26.860
again.

09:26.940 --> 09:29.250
But now what about these buttons here.

09:29.310 --> 09:33.840
We will need to change the way our product item looks like.
