00:02.290 --> 00:08.230
Now with that input container defined and with a couple of new styles covered.

00:08.270 --> 00:12.580
For we can do something which I mentioned dead it would always be a good idea.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.380
We can split our application into multiple components.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.800
This look here.

00:17.800 --> 00:24.100
This input container look discard look is probably something we want to use in other parts of the application

00:24.100 --> 00:24.890
as well.

00:25.060 --> 00:28.450
We might have different items which we want to present in such a cart.

00:28.450 --> 00:32.680
Consider you're building an online shop where you have each product in such a card.

00:32.680 --> 00:39.160
On the overview screen now to a wide repeating this style definition over and over again we can outsource

00:39.160 --> 00:45.130
it into a separate component a component that doesn't really have much logic in it but which controls

00:45.160 --> 00:46.950
the styling of its content.

00:47.080 --> 00:53.050
Pure presentational component therefore technically it still is a regular react component and hence

00:53.050 --> 00:58.450
all create a new file here and the components folder and name ID card name is up to you but it is this

00:58.450 --> 00:59.400
typical card looks.

00:59.410 --> 01:01.510
So it sounds like a fitting name to me.

01:02.220 --> 01:11.290
Now here as always import react from react and then also import the view from react.

01:11.290 --> 01:20.830
Native here and then create the card component a functional component like this which you in the end

01:21.310 --> 01:22.900
export as a default.

01:22.900 --> 01:28.630
And obviously since it's all about presentation here will needs to style sheet to create a stylus object

01:28.630 --> 01:31.120
because that will be the core thing of this component.

01:31.120 --> 01:36.200
It should be there to wrap itself around any content and just apply some general styling.

01:37.270 --> 01:42.600
So now I'm going to the start game screen and I'll grab all the styles here off the input container.

01:42.700 --> 01:49.180
Copy them from there and add them to the card instead here I'll add a new card property and use my styles

01:49.180 --> 01:49.790
in here.

01:51.220 --> 01:54.880
And insert off the card component.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.670
I'll have a very simple markup so to say very simple J as X code.

01:59.670 --> 02:05.900
It's just a view which I return here which should be wrapped around props children props children instead

02:05.910 --> 02:11.880
special prop and react which is basically the content you pass between the opening and closing tax of

02:11.880 --> 02:18.570
your custom component so it can wrap itself around any content because the only goal of this card component

02:18.570 --> 02:25.400
is to apply some style to the surrounding container and we do this by adding styles card here.

02:25.510 --> 02:32.610
There is just one thing there are certain styles in here which probably should not be set from from

02:32.610 --> 02:33.790
inside of the card.

02:33.810 --> 02:41.580
Not every card might have this width or max width and not every card should center its content.

02:41.580 --> 02:47.220
Hence I'll cut these free items front from there and only have the shadow and the padding set up in

02:47.220 --> 02:50.890
here and I want to make this a bit more flexible.

02:50.970 --> 02:57.780
Besides the card styles it would be nice if we could also assign our own styles from outside and maybe

02:57.780 --> 03:07.440
even overwrite some of the card styles we can do this by passing in a new object to the style prop and

03:07.530 --> 03:13.730
distributing all the properties all the key value pairs of our cards style here into this new object.

03:13.800 --> 03:20.400
This is the spread operator a modern javascript feature which pulls all the key value pairs of object

03:20.460 --> 03:23.910
out of that object and adds it to a new surrounding object.

03:24.150 --> 03:28.170
So we copy all the styles to find down there into this new object.

03:28.170 --> 03:34.170
And I'm doing this so that I can also add another key value pair year were another set of key value

03:34.170 --> 03:41.370
pairs where I take all the styles defined in props styles so in the style prop I passed my own custom

03:41.370 --> 03:42.090
component.

03:42.090 --> 03:48.060
I take all the key value pairs defined there and merged them into this object and since I do this second

03:48.240 --> 03:53.760
this will overwrite any key value pairs set up in styles card so that we can overwrite any styles set

03:53.760 --> 03:56.700
up in there from outside when we use our component.

03:56.700 --> 04:02.100
And when we add additional styles outside of the component it will all emerged in and consider it.

04:02.140 --> 04:08.160
And with Dad we can all of sign our own styles from outside of the card component when we use the card

04:08.160 --> 04:12.730
component and using the card component is something that would make sense as a next step.

04:12.750 --> 04:20.040
So let's go to these start game screen and import card from the components folder and there from the

04:20.040 --> 04:28.220
card folder and replace our input container view here with card like this just like this with opening

04:28.220 --> 04:29.920
and closing tax.

04:29.930 --> 04:35.420
Now again I want to set my own style as I want to set my own with Max with an a line items.

04:35.510 --> 04:39.040
So I'll keep input container in the stalls you down there.

04:39.320 --> 04:46.030
But now get rid of all the obvious styles and air all the styles which are now set up in the card.

04:46.100 --> 04:46.650
So did we.

04:46.790 --> 04:54.920
We only keep the width and alignment here and then add this here to card on the style prop which is

04:54.980 --> 05:01.280
accepted or which has an effect because in the card component it's that style prop which I merge with

05:01.280 --> 05:10.250
my average sells so for that style prop I'll point at Styles input container now with debt if we save

05:10.250 --> 05:12.330
debt I'm getting an error.

05:12.350 --> 05:17.350
Object is not a function near req native style sheet.

05:17.420 --> 05:24.070
So in the card J.S. fall as it points here something's wrong even gives me the line No it's line 10.

05:24.060 --> 05:24.250
That's.

05:24.260 --> 05:30.890
So what does number here means and yeah my problem here is that I use stall she'd like this.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.640
That's wrong.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.760
Instead we have to called style sheet dot create to define our own styles.

05:35.780 --> 05:37.010
So that's the right syntax.

05:37.010 --> 05:42.240
So it's a syntax error not technically a syntax error but I'm using the style sheet object incorrectly.

05:42.410 --> 05:46.430
So it's the error from my side the error message helped us with that and now we have to say look as

05:46.430 --> 05:52.420
before but we have that reusable card which we can now use in any place where we want to have.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.280
Well exactly this look with the shadows ends on.
