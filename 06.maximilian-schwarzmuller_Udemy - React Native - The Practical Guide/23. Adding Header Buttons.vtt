00:02.250 --> 00:07.590
Adding a button to the header as I wanted here such a navigation button requires a bit of extra work

00:07.590 --> 00:11.670
initially but their offer is very straightforward.

00:11.700 --> 00:17.160
We have first of all need to install an extra package to make it easier because theoretically you have

00:17.160 --> 00:18.540
a lot of power here.

00:18.660 --> 00:21.690
You can add such buttons with the help of the navigation options.

00:21.690 --> 00:27.450
So here on the meal detailed screen beside setting a header title you can set header left and had a

00:27.450 --> 00:30.330
right to add buttons on the left of the right of the title.

00:30.330 --> 00:36.330
Typically you want to use right because the left is reserved for the back button and generally you can

00:36.330 --> 00:39.310
simply return a j as X element there.

00:39.450 --> 00:47.220
So you can simply set this to text like favorite data something you could do here and actually let me

00:47.220 --> 00:51.870
show this to you and therefore restart the server before we use a package.

00:51.870 --> 00:58.890
Because whilst you can just add a component here getting the styling right the positioning right for

00:58.950 --> 01:05.430
all the different platforms as specially if you're not just using text here but also maybe an icon which

01:05.430 --> 01:11.160
you typically want to have there that can be really cumbersome and That's while we'll install extra

01:11.160 --> 01:14.810
package that makes that way easier than it otherwise is

01:18.260 --> 01:25.510
so let me restart this with NPM start not npm install NPM start and with that running again.

01:25.850 --> 01:34.320
Let's reload this here and Iow let me show you what we have here now that I render a text.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.930
You see this text here.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.180
So this is getting rendered.

01:37.190 --> 01:43.010
But as I said having the right padding the lot right alignment to write style the right size.

01:43.010 --> 01:47.870
Super annoying if you do it all on your own because you're not just doing this for one device but for

01:47.870 --> 01:49.300
many devices.

01:49.370 --> 01:54.320
That's why I will actually install a special package here which helps us with this.

01:54.320 --> 02:01.250
So quit the process for now the running deaths a death process and use npm install dash dash save and

02:01.250 --> 02:10.130
install the react dash navigation dash header Dash Buttons packet which is a package that helps you

02:10.310 --> 02:16.220
surprisingly if you have a look at the name with setting up some buttons in your header so in that top

02:16.280 --> 02:24.850
toolbar here does a package which then will make it really easy to add such buttons with it add added

02:24.850 --> 02:30.490
I'll restart my dual open server with NPM start and now I'll try the new helper component myself in

02:30.490 --> 02:37.290
the components folder which will name helper by a header button not helper header button there I'll

02:37.300 --> 02:44.210
import react from react because this will be a normal react component which we create in their and import

02:44.570 --> 02:51.980
something from this new react navigation header buttons package we just installed and that's something

02:51.980 --> 03:02.650
which I import is header button besides dead let's also import something from at Expo slash vector icons

03:02.680 --> 03:08.830
which should be a way lable but just to be super safe you can definitely also run npm install dash dash

03:08.830 --> 03:16.270
save at Expo slash vector icons to install this package as well because you'll need that

03:19.050 --> 03:24.630
and the thing we need to import from that package is ironic once of course you can use any I can set

03:24.630 --> 03:30.270
you want I covered icons earlier in this course and you're free to use any I can you want in your head

03:30.270 --> 03:35.250
or button I'll just work with I only comes because I use them in the rest of this course as well but

03:35.460 --> 03:40.440
again you can use any icons you want and of course in the header you don't have to use icons you could

03:40.440 --> 03:45.900
use our text as well but typically you do use icons of course that's what users typically are used to

03:45.900 --> 03:49.470
from well other apps.

03:49.740 --> 03:58.040
In addition I'll also import colors from Constance colors and now create my component here.

03:58.070 --> 04:04.850
That's the let's say custom header button or just header button whatever you want to name it but we're

04:05.030 --> 04:09.290
already importing this that we have to pick a different name here to not have a name clash.

04:09.650 --> 04:17.390
And this will receive some props and we'll return the header button we're getting from this package

04:17.390 --> 04:22.280
which we installed but we'll soon add some extra configuration which is why I'm wrapping this in a separate

04:22.280 --> 04:27.800
component so that we don't have to repeat that configuration for every button we're using anywhere in

04:27.800 --> 04:28.990
the app.

04:29.140 --> 04:33.250
And then of course I'll export my default custom header button.

04:33.340 --> 04:39.850
So now it does header button I'm using here from this package we installed that will first of all receive

04:39.850 --> 04:45.790
all props we're getting with this nice little trick we can use and react where we forward all props

04:45.790 --> 04:51.700
with this shortcut by pulling out all the key value pairs and passing them to this object which just

04:51.700 --> 04:53.060
component in the end is.

04:53.110 --> 04:56.790
So that's the first thing we need to forward all the props and that's super important.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.670
Don't forget this.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.470
Otherwise it will not work correctly.

05:00.490 --> 05:07.540
The second step is that we add the icon component prop with a capital I.

05:07.540 --> 05:13.580
That's a prop the header button we're getting from this package expects and there I pass an ionic and

05:13.580 --> 05:20.730
so this expects vector I can package which can be used for rendering icons doesn't have to be ionic

05:20.730 --> 05:27.800
pins but has to be from either at Expo vector icons or from the underlying react native vector icons

05:27.800 --> 05:34.850
package on which the expo package is based on and you can also parse an icon size and I will standardize

05:34.850 --> 05:40.370
this so that all my header buttons across the entire app have the same size of 20 free which I found

05:40.370 --> 05:48.470
to work quite well last but not least I'll also set up a color here and I'll use my primary color though

05:49.160 --> 05:59.360
of course we have to make sure that we differentiate by platform so I'll also import platform from react

05:59.390 --> 06:06.210
native because on Android our header will have the primary color as a background so they are we want

06:06.210 --> 06:08.000
to use I can color of white.

06:08.150 --> 06:15.320
So here all check platform OS if debts equal to Android then I want to use white here and only if it's

06:15.360 --> 06:18.350
ISIS I want to use the primary color.

06:18.470 --> 06:21.020
So now we have to pre configured header button.

06:21.020 --> 06:26.840
Now we can use that in the place in the component where we want to add it to our header and that's the

06:26.840 --> 06:31.030
meal detail screen in this case there.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.520
We now need to import something else from the newly installed package.

06:34.720 --> 06:41.140
So from react navigation header buttons from this package here we have to install or import header but

06:41.140 --> 06:47.710
tense so not header button which we use in the other file but header buttons plural we add this here

06:47.770 --> 06:53.650
because now down there where we set up the navigation options for this component instead of using our

06:53.650 --> 06:58.200
text component there I want to use header buttons.

06:58.250 --> 07:04.940
This component I just added the import for and wrapped is around another element.

07:04.960 --> 07:11.940
We have to import from react navigation header buttons and that's item item is number component we import

07:12.090 --> 07:16.710
which we can now use between the opening and closing tax of the header buttons.

07:16.710 --> 07:26.600
So here we add item and item as a self closing component where we describe the icon we want to render

07:26.600 --> 07:31.970
in the end we can always gives us a title which would be rendered as a fallback and all named his favorite

07:32.000 --> 07:35.170
but we normally won't see this instead here.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.670
I can also set up I can name it now.

07:37.670 --> 07:46.280
This should be for example Iowa's star which is a valid eye on Eakins icon and you can search that Expo

07:46.280 --> 07:51.440
vector icons list I showed you earlier in the course which you also find attached to this video for

07:51.440 --> 07:53.570
possible icons you can use here.

07:53.570 --> 07:59.540
Just make sure that you use an icon from the icon set you used in your header buttons on my case from

07:59.540 --> 08:01.990
my own icons.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.830
Now this indicates which I can use.

08:03.830 --> 08:09.680
Now here we can also add on press to register a function that should be triggered when that I can is

08:09.680 --> 08:12.570
pressed or when that item in the header is pressed.

08:12.650 --> 08:19.220
And for now I'll just say Mark as favourite here locked us in the console so that we see that this worked.

08:19.220 --> 08:22.720
We're not entirely there yet because we're not using our custom header button.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.870
That's the last missing piece.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.370
We need to import this component to be created.

08:28.430 --> 08:35.120
So import header button from components and then there from header button that's Dee button we worked

08:35.120 --> 08:42.740
on and we passed this two header buttons here because this expects a header button component prop where

08:42.740 --> 08:47.870
we point at the component that should be used to render this item in the end.

08:47.870 --> 08:52.220
Now this is all very complex as you can tell a lot of nested components.

08:52.220 --> 08:57.500
Does is just a setup which is a little bit cumbersome the first time you do it but when you then use

08:57.500 --> 09:01.790
it in other components it's really just all about copying the same setup here.

09:01.790 --> 09:05.860
Changing the title changing the icon and changing the logic and your data.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.970
So that's all you have to do in the future.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.740
It's just initial setup that said that some extra work here with all that setup.

09:12.740 --> 09:14.540
However if we now save this

09:19.710 --> 09:25.770
we should be able to see our star here does this the eye can we see and we can press this and as I press

09:25.770 --> 09:35.290
it you'll see Mark as favourite is getting locked here in the console also see that on Android there

09:35.300 --> 09:40.150
we always have to start and if I press this star here we also see Mark as favourite.

09:40.160 --> 09:47.100
So that's working little side note I just saw if we have multiple recipes we might want some extra styling

09:47.100 --> 09:52.470
they're totally unrelated to the header button just seeing it so in the meal item J.S. fall on the meal

09:52.470 --> 09:56.460
item I'll actually add some margin vertical of 10 again.

09:56.520 --> 10:02.520
Totally not something you need here just there to make sure that this looks nicer if we have multiple

10:02.520 --> 10:03.050
items.

10:03.060 --> 10:08.670
Important thing here of course is that we have our header button this icon and this is how you can add

10:09.180 --> 10:13.100
buttons or icons items here to your header.

10:13.170 --> 10:18.570
And of course you can add more than one here name you'll detail a screen you can have multiple such

10:18.600 --> 10:24.770
items between the header buttons here which is set up on header right on the navigation options.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.220
This is how you add items here.

10:26.220 --> 10:33.750
You can have more than one for example here we could all have Iowa's star outline which is another icon

10:33.750 --> 10:37.260
which looks a bit different so that you can see the difference here.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.630
Now we have queue here.

10:38.790 --> 10:45.600
So that's possible of course you shouldn't overload this so that your UI stays clean and just works

10:46.710 --> 10:55.010
but this is how you can add icons here to your screen by the way the warning I'm getting here regarding

10:55.010 --> 10:59.910
the double keys the title here is also used as a key for your items.

10:59.930 --> 11:03.350
So if you have multiple items you shouldn't use the same title.

11:03.350 --> 11:08.640
But I just added this for demonstration purposes anyways so I'll simply get rid of it and we're good.

11:08.810 --> 11:12.290
Now our star icon doesn't do anything yet.

11:12.320 --> 11:17.660
That's something we'll add later but at least we see it and that's really important in a module where

11:17.660 --> 11:20.300
we talk about navigation and working with the header.
