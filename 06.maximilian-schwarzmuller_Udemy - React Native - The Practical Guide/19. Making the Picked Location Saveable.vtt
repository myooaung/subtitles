00:02.230 --> 00:12.550
So I want to have a safe button in my header and for that of course we need to at map screen navigation

00:12.550 --> 00:19.620
options and use the function form there so that we have access to this nav that object with the navigation

00:20.070 --> 00:25.500
object and in there I want to return my consecration object.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.070
You could add a header title but I'm actually happy without one.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.040
But I want to set header right here and now important here.

00:32.190 --> 00:39.960
You can use header buttons of course and render a nice icon but actually all render Some text here so

00:40.350 --> 00:46.080
all import the text component or make sure that you do have an export import it render Some text here

00:46.330 --> 00:51.720
where I'll just say save and you could of course all to add a platform check to make this opera case

00:51.720 --> 00:53.050
on Android if you wanted to.

00:53.130 --> 01:02.510
I'll just say save like this and then add a style here where I add my header button text cell and around

01:02.510 --> 01:09.050
that I want to have a touchable views all use touchable opacity here which is there for all the need

01:09.050 --> 01:15.770
to import not from there but actually from HREOC native so touchable opacity should be imported from

01:15.770 --> 01:24.050
React Native and with that imported we can wrap this around this text to make our own buttons so to

01:24.050 --> 01:31.770
say and dare I also want to add a style and that style will be having an identifier of header button

01:31.770 --> 01:40.270
let's say now Upon pressing this I want to save what we added or save our location we chose but that's

01:40.270 --> 01:46.780
something I'll do a second for now let's styled is so down there in the style sheet for the header button

01:46.780 --> 01:53.440
which is that touchable opacity all add a margin horizontal of 20 to have some spacing around the button

01:53.440 --> 01:58.060
to the left and right and on the header button text here it's of course up to you what you want to add

01:58.060 --> 02:05.920
there but I'll add a font size of sixteen let's say and important to color for that I need the platform

02:05.920 --> 02:11.440
API because the column needs to differ since this is on the header which is having a solid background

02:11.500 --> 02:19.960
on Android but not on I guess I can set my color here my text color to platform OS equals Android so

02:19.960 --> 02:26.550
to check this in on Android I'll send it to white and otherwise I'll set it to colors dot primary and

02:26.620 --> 02:32.610
for Dad as always make sure you're importing your colors constant from up there.

02:32.690 --> 02:38.180
So now we have the save button when we press the safe button I want to trigger a function that should

02:38.180 --> 02:43.370
be defined in the component and that's all the something we did multiple times in the course I showed

02:43.370 --> 02:50.360
you how you can communicate between your component and also your navigation options here so we can essentially

02:50.390 --> 03:00.090
add a new function here save picked location handler whatever you want to name it and dysfunction or

03:00.110 --> 03:05.100
a reference to this function should be passed to the navigation options and for Dad we can use the good

03:05.100 --> 03:12.150
old use of fact took and use callback to a white does infinite loop if you remember and we can therefore

03:12.150 --> 03:21.520
then wrap this with you as callback and then use the fact you're to tell our navigation options about

03:21.520 --> 03:32.600
this by using props navigation set pyramids and then I want to set my safe location param here to the

03:32.610 --> 03:39.390
safe picked location handler so pass a reference to this function to this param or with this param to

03:39.390 --> 03:46.590
my headers and use effect of course depends on the safe pick location handler functions all added as

03:46.590 --> 03:55.040
a dependency here and important now use callback here all as an array of dependencies because in here

03:55.160 --> 04:00.130
I want to basically leafed as page and go back.

04:00.230 --> 04:05.630
So here I can use props navigation go back and we'll tweak this in a second but for now we can do this

04:06.940 --> 04:13.420
in Dafur normally of course this go back function would be my dependency but to avoid an infinite loop

04:13.450 --> 04:18.180
with this approach we have to use by using parents to update the component we already are on.

04:18.370 --> 04:24.280
I'll actually add an empty array here as a dependency so that this function effectively isn't rebuilt

04:24.310 --> 04:25.420
right now.

04:25.480 --> 04:30.790
So with that we can extract this safe location param in our header.

04:30.790 --> 04:41.190
So here I want to point at my save function which I get with nav data dot navigation dot get param pointing

04:41.190 --> 04:48.480
at the safe location identifier and then save function is the function I hook up to the on press handler

04:48.480 --> 04:50.050
on the touchable opacity.

04:50.070 --> 04:59.030
So this should trigger this save function is safe pick location handler function here with that saved

04:59.060 --> 05:00.710
if we go back let's give it a try.

05:00.740 --> 05:08.210
Let's go to pick on map and if I now click Save it should simply go back and it does.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.280
So that works but of course right now I'm not saving any location I'm not using any location that's

05:13.280 --> 05:15.080
the next step.

05:15.080 --> 05:21.110
And for that we need to pass the location user picked back to the previous screen with go back.

05:21.110 --> 05:25.970
That's relatively hard but instead we can use a pattern which I hadn't really used before in this course

05:26.540 --> 05:34.010
I can use navigate here as well to then go back I can navigate to my new place screen with the new place

05:34.070 --> 05:41.810
identifier as set up here in my places navigator and since I'm already on a screen ahead of that new

05:41.810 --> 05:42.990
place screen.

05:43.070 --> 05:48.260
Don't forget that this is a stack of screens and I'm on a screen on top of the new place screen.

05:48.290 --> 05:53.040
This will actually not push this new place screen on top of the existing screen.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.020
We could force this with push but I don't want you.

05:56.030 --> 06:03.890
Instead it will go back but now by using navigate I can append some parents here I can add my picked

06:04.040 --> 06:12.980
location and their point at my selected location prop which hopefully holds my picked location now since

06:12.980 --> 06:18.320
I use selected location in here and since this changes I'll add this as a dependency to use callback

06:18.650 --> 06:23.900
so that dysfunction is re created when we have a new location picked and I want to make sure that we

06:23.900 --> 06:30.800
do have a location here so I will check if selected location or to be precise.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.300
If we don't have one.

06:32.330 --> 06:37.580
So if this is undefined which means the user hasn't picked one yet then I'll return and not continue

06:37.820 --> 06:44.750
and we can also show an alert here if you want to know I'll not do that here but you could show an alert

06:44.780 --> 06:46.780
if you wanted to.

06:46.950 --> 06:52.110
So now will only be able to click save if we do have a location picked but if we do so we'll actually

06:52.110 --> 06:54.740
set it on the parents of our a go back.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.250
Action let's give it a try.

06:57.250 --> 07:03.250
Let's go there click a pic on map and now please note I haven't picked any location yet I haven't clicked

07:03.280 --> 07:04.630
anywhere yet so click save.

07:04.630 --> 07:09.160
Nothing happens if I do pick a location I click save I do go back though.

07:09.970 --> 07:17.560
So now we can use the data we're passing back from map screen in our location picker ultimately to update

07:17.590 --> 07:18.890
the map preview there.

07:18.910 --> 07:20.290
So that's next thing I'll do.
