WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:09.860
In this module, we had a closer look at how we can handle user input, how we can handle input and validation

00:09.920 --> 00:13.470
of input in text inputs,

00:13.470 --> 00:20.020
that was a lot of inputs and of course the same concepts could be used on other inputs types like a

00:20.020 --> 00:25.650
toggle or something, there you can also bind the value, get the value to which it is toggled

00:25.660 --> 00:27.550
and find out if it is valid,

00:27.550 --> 00:28.890
set up your own logic.

00:29.020 --> 00:35.190
The key takeaway is that in react native just like in react for web, you have to write this own logic,

00:35.260 --> 00:37.780
there is no built-in validation.

00:37.840 --> 00:44.500
You also learned how you can output or change the state depending on the validity and you learned how

00:44.500 --> 00:52.570
you can manage this keyboard, set it to the right type, make it dismissible and also make sure that user

00:52.570 --> 00:57.040
can always see what he needs to see when typing something.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.740
These are all very useful things

00:58.750 --> 01:03.570
and with that, we can move on and see which other things we can get from the user,

01:03.580 --> 01:05.610
maybe something like an image.
