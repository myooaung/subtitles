00:02.350 --> 00:07.800
So let's have a look at how we add this to Android and we're going to start with the standard steps

00:07.810 --> 00:12.390
you always have to do for any library that accesses native device features.

00:12.460 --> 00:20.020
First of all, copy these two green lines and you will always find these instructions for any library

00:20.170 --> 00:21.700
you install,

00:21.970 --> 00:30.490
go into the Android folder and there, to the settings.gradle file. Simply add them somewhere below

00:30.490 --> 00:32.140
the content that's already in there,

00:32.140 --> 00:34.940
make sure to remove that plus here.

00:34.990 --> 00:41.410
Now this of course is the code specific for this library but whichever library you use, in the end here,

00:41.410 --> 00:43.000
it's always the library name, 

00:43.120 --> 00:47.020
so is the case here and all the other code is the same,

00:47.050 --> 00:52.210
you then also just have a path to the library and there to the Android folder.

00:52.330 --> 00:57.310
So these are the things you need to exchange and for pretty much all libraries you're using,

00:57.400 --> 01:00.810
you'll find the exact instructions in the documentation,

01:00.830 --> 01:03.140
I just want you to understand what's happening here,

01:03.220 --> 01:10.230
with that we're basically making Android aware of the Android specific code of that library we're using.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.040
We're not done yet though,

01:12.250 --> 01:22.830
we also need to add some code to our build gradle file in the app subfolder, so Android app build gradle,

01:22.980 --> 01:26.710
don't put it into the build gradle file we have directly in the Android folder,

01:26.730 --> 01:27.990
that's a common mistake,

01:27.990 --> 01:35.100
take the one in the app folder and there, simply scroll down until you reach dependencies.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.950
There you will find react native

01:36.990 --> 01:43.800
and now you add this line where you also add compile project with your library name.

01:43.860 --> 01:51.000
Now onto the last step, you have to add an import to your MainApplication.java file,

01:51.030 --> 01:56.040
you can find it in Android app source, Java

01:56.370 --> 02:03.880
and there's the MainApplication.java file and in there, simply add the import below the other imports

02:05.290 --> 02:13.810
and then you need to add one entry to a function you'll find here, protected lists get packages.

02:14.020 --> 02:19.570
Simply add a comma after new main react package and add this one

02:19.570 --> 02:24.930
and if you add more libraries, simply add commas and add them after and after. And that's it,

02:24.940 --> 02:31.590
these are the standard steps for connecting a native feature dependent library to Android.

02:31.600 --> 02:38.380
Now for this library, we also need to do something to copy over the fonts just as we did with iOS, we

02:38.380 --> 02:39.970
could do this manually here,

02:39.970 --> 02:49.410
copy fonts into Android apps source main assets fonts or use this approach to basically copy it automatically.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.990
Now since it's recommended, I'm going to do that,

02:52.180 --> 02:54.230
so I'm going to copy this line of code

02:54.250 --> 02:58.940
and again, this is just specific to this library now, not a standard step you always have to do,

02:58.990 --> 03:02.040
it's just for this library because we need the fonts.

03:02.350 --> 03:06.370
So there, we also go to Android app build gradle,

03:06.460 --> 03:14.520
so the build gradle in the apps folder not the one on the root folder and there, we add this line somewhere in

03:14.520 --> 03:15.040
there,

03:15.060 --> 03:21.750
so simply add it at bottom. This however is only used if you want to copy all fonts, if you just want

03:21.750 --> 03:22.570
some of them,

03:22.590 --> 03:26.760
copy the next code snippet instead and use that instead of the code we just based it in.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.420
And there,

03:28.440 --> 03:37.100
I'm just going to copy my ionicons and no other fonts, so I'm going to remove that and here, this line is

03:37.100 --> 03:38.460
still needed.

03:39.020 --> 03:45.980
So with that, we get this all set up and the next time you build your Android app with npm run Android,

03:46.280 --> 03:50.080
it should copy over all these fonts and enable

03:50.090 --> 03:52.640
this application, this library.

03:52.880 --> 03:58.940
So let's close all these folders and let's see if that works by simply trying to use that library and add

03:59.000 --> 03:59.930
an icon to our app.
