WEBVTT

00:02.340 --> 00:05.010
So we're able to detect that the game is over.

00:05.010 --> 00:08.970
Now it would be nice to also output a summary on the game over screen.

00:09.110 --> 00:14.430
Now we can dive deeper into the styling at the detail output there later for now let's just make sure

00:14.910 --> 00:20.070
that we may be at least output the number of rounds it took the computer to win we're what it means

00:20.070 --> 00:22.550
to win to guess our number.

00:22.770 --> 00:27.870
So number of rounds is something I want to output here on the game over screen and that's of course

00:27.870 --> 00:32.610
a value we need to get from our props because we're managing this number of rounds and the app component

00:32.610 --> 00:35.400
at the end here in guess rounds.

00:35.400 --> 00:43.200
So in the game over screen we get this on props rounds number or whatever you want to name this is up

00:43.200 --> 00:52.010
to you how you named as prop and maybe all the output the number the computer had to guess number was

00:52.250 --> 00:56.260
and then props user number maybe.

00:56.270 --> 01:00.060
So these are two props we now need to set on the game over screen.

01:00.230 --> 01:01.850
Number and user number.

01:01.850 --> 01:06.220
So back in the app component on the game over screen we set Rollins number and user number.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.030
User number of course should be our user number.

01:10.030 --> 01:16.430
We have their user number between the curly braces now refers to our user numbers state here user number

01:16.430 --> 01:22.810
before the equal sign simply refers to the prop we're passing game over stream and rounds.

01:22.820 --> 01:24.700
Number of course is guess Rollins.

01:24.700 --> 01:29.090
So that's the number of rounds it took to computer to guess this.

01:29.120 --> 01:33.560
So this is now forwarded to the game over screen and can be output there.

01:35.340 --> 01:39.740
On the game over screen I also want to have a button that allows the user to restart the game.

01:39.780 --> 01:41.260
So let's add a button here.

01:41.430 --> 01:44.880
And for Dad you need to import the button from React Native.

01:45.230 --> 01:52.230
So let's add a button here and the title of this button could be a new game.

01:52.500 --> 02:00.360
And on a press I well want to start a new game now again the app component is where we in the end control

02:00.420 --> 02:04.840
where the game is running or not where we present the different game screens.

02:04.860 --> 02:09.470
So it's here where we need to change something if a new game should start.

02:09.750 --> 02:15.480
And it would make sense that India app component we therefore have a new function can be defined anywhere

02:15.480 --> 02:22.410
all defined here as a first function because it's the function that allows us to configure a new game.

02:22.410 --> 02:31.560
So maybe you configure new game handler you can name it whatever you want and there.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.520
I expect no arguments.

02:33.700 --> 02:40.880
But I want to set my guess rounds to zero therefore actually we don't need to do this here when we start

02:40.880 --> 02:47.000
a new game because we're definitely doing it right before we configure a new game even so we can set

02:47.000 --> 02:48.880
the guess runs to cedar or.

02:49.160 --> 02:54.640
And by doing that we already ensured that in our if check down there this condition will not be met

02:54.660 --> 02:59.650
anymore because if we set guess rounds to zero it's certainly not greater than zero anymore.

02:59.780 --> 03:07.140
So we'll certainly leave the game over screen and then however we would display the game screen again.

03:07.220 --> 03:11.960
So to see the start game screen again which we want to see because that's the screen that allows us

03:11.960 --> 03:17.960
to configure and start a new game we have to make sure that we also reset the user number.

03:17.990 --> 03:19.490
So the selected number.

03:19.580 --> 03:27.260
So here we can all the set user number to null to reset this to a false social value and now configure

03:27.260 --> 03:30.640
a new game handler resets everything that we check down there.

03:30.830 --> 03:33.050
Hence we should see the start game screen.

03:33.080 --> 03:38.450
Now we just need to pass a pointer at configure a new game handler down to the game over screen.

03:38.810 --> 03:43.150
So all add a prop on restart maybe.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.250
And that points at configure the new game handler.

03:46.250 --> 03:53.230
So now we can use the on restart prop inside of the game over screen but binding it to this button dear

03:53.240 --> 03:59.660
upon a press I want to execute on restart whips as a function without parentheses here because here

03:59.720 --> 04:03.030
I just pointed it so dead on press registers.

04:03.020 --> 04:10.440
This pointer and when partners pressed dysfunction will execute let's give all of that a try.

04:10.440 --> 04:17.130
Let's enter a number 41 maybe and start a game and then lower.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.740
That was fast but well that's OK.

04:19.830 --> 04:20.600
Two rounds.

04:20.610 --> 04:21.740
The number was forty one.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.950
That's correct and if I click new game we're back here.

04:25.050 --> 04:27.210
Let's give it a try 66.

04:27.510 --> 04:29.110
Greater Greater.

04:29.160 --> 04:29.930
Lower.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.850
Lower.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.070
Lower.

04:32.070 --> 04:32.580
Even lower.

04:32.580 --> 04:33.240
Greater.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.230
Lower.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.480
Well that's taking long.

04:35.490 --> 04:36.200
Lower.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.560
Greater writer.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.470
Lower.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.120
Lower.

04:39.120 --> 04:39.780
Greater.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.550
Yeah.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.560
Fourteen rounds so it can also take longer.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.720
But the main thing is our logic here works.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.580
And that's actually already the finished logic of the entire game.

04:50.580 --> 04:55.730
Now what's not finished however is the overall styling I want to have a different button here.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.350
Want to have different buttons here.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.860
Once use my own fund.

04:58.860 --> 05:06.930
Once use some icons and I also want to make sure that we show a little image on the screen where the

05:06.930 --> 05:09.400
game is over so here.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.650
I also want have a little image.

05:10.660 --> 05:13.000
So these are all the things we'll tackle next.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.630
Lots of styling and image adding to be done.
