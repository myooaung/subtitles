00:02.110 --> 00:07.000
So in a new place screen I want to be able to add a place and for that all first of all add the text

00:07.030 --> 00:12.190
input component which of course has nothing to do with native wise features but we simply also need

00:12.190 --> 00:19.330
that because in there we can now add such a text input that allows the user to enter the title and therefore

00:19.330 --> 00:24.350
I'll also add a text component here where I say title that should act as a label for it as text input

00:24.370 --> 00:25.360
here.

00:25.360 --> 00:32.450
And overall I also want a scroll view in here to wrap all my content because I don't know which device

00:32.520 --> 00:37.540
to user is going to use but will add more than just a title will also add a image picker and now place

00:37.540 --> 00:43.120
picker it as module and therefore being able to scroll this page is really important.

00:43.180 --> 00:48.820
So now we have that title label in the text input that belongs to it which for now will and will not

00:48.820 --> 00:52.450
do anything but which will soon allow the user to enter a title.

00:52.540 --> 00:55.840
I also want to make sure that of course this form can be submitted.

00:56.170 --> 01:02.500
So what I also want to do is I want to add a button component here and after the text input here I'll

01:02.500 --> 01:10.450
have my button where I say save plays for example add a color here and set this to colors thought primary

01:10.540 --> 01:15.730
and for Dad you need to make sure you're importing the color is constant here and on press will later

01:15.820 --> 01:19.750
submit this form for the moment I'm not doing anything here.

01:19.750 --> 01:25.030
The text input of course also can be configured though most basic configuration is fine here I don't

01:25.030 --> 01:29.920
need to change to keyboard type and so on but some styling would be nice and that's actually true for

01:29.920 --> 01:31.360
the entire page.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.330
So for this view here for example I want to add a style of form here so in a style identifiable forums

01:37.330 --> 01:41.140
sort of that can style the overall form for the title here.

01:41.140 --> 01:50.980
I'll add a style of label for the text input I also want to add my own styles and I'll use the identifier

01:51.100 --> 01:55.210
text input here with Dad.

01:55.210 --> 02:00.180
Let's go down to the solitude and make sure we do add some styling here for the overall form.

02:00.220 --> 02:05.350
I'll add a margin in all directions of 30 so that it doesn't sit directly on the edges of the screen

02:06.160 --> 02:07.480
for the label.

02:07.780 --> 02:15.640
I want to set a font size of let's say 18 and also add a margin to the bottom of 15 so that we have

02:15.640 --> 02:20.530
some spacing between the label at the text input and on the text input itself.

02:20.860 --> 02:27.670
Well in order to be able to see it I'll add a border bottom and set its color to this light grey here

02:27.670 --> 02:36.460
with this hex code of CCC and a border bottom with here of 1 and then also have a margin to its bottom

02:36.490 --> 02:43.060
so to the content below it the button right now of 15 and what I'll also add here is a little bit of

02:43.060 --> 02:48.300
a vertical padding just for a little bit of horizontal padding.

02:48.670 --> 02:52.100
Just to if I saved it let's have a look.

02:52.150 --> 02:57.310
If I go to the new place the screen does what I have and this doesn't look too shabby.

02:57.400 --> 03:03.360
Also on Android this is something we can work with I guess and this is something we can build up on.

03:03.460 --> 03:05.970
Now of course this input isn't doing anything.

03:05.980 --> 03:13.390
I of course want to capture what the user entered and to keep this simple here all not add super complex

03:13.390 --> 03:15.770
validation or anything like that.

03:15.790 --> 03:22.030
Instead I'll just capture the value and that's it you can of course add validation you can't add a reducer

03:22.330 --> 03:23.360
as we did it Indigo.

03:23.370 --> 03:28.680
The user input module where you learned how you can manage more complex forms in all ways.

03:28.690 --> 03:36.490
Here again I will keep this very very simple and therefore I will just import the U.S. State book from

03:36.490 --> 03:40.660
react here so that I can just capture my values here.

03:40.660 --> 03:49.360
So here I will have my title value and set title value function and use you state to initialize this

03:49.350 --> 03:53.140
to an empty string and I'll then add a function here.

03:53.230 --> 03:59.800
The title change handler which receives the text the user entered and where l then just set my title

03:59.800 --> 04:08.750
value to that text and here of course you could add validation but again to keep this simple I'll not

04:08.750 --> 04:09.470
do it.

04:09.470 --> 04:15.380
It's the title change handler that should now be bound to the on change text per prop here on the text

04:15.380 --> 04:16.040
input.

04:16.040 --> 04:22.190
So they're all point at Title change handler and I'll bind the value of that input of course to my title

04:22.190 --> 04:25.070
value because that's where a store the user input.

04:25.190 --> 04:33.050
With that we have a fully functional user input here where I also capture the values now with that we're

04:33.050 --> 04:35.530
able to get the title.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.640
We also have safe place.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.110
Whenever we pressed his button.

04:40.190 --> 04:46.370
I want to save it so I'll have my safe place handler which is a function I want to bind to this safe

04:46.370 --> 04:47.680
place button.

04:47.720 --> 04:54.050
So here instead of having this empty anonymous functional point at Safe Place handler on this safe place

04:54.050 --> 04:58.920
button in India I now want to make sure displaced desk gets saved.

04:59.030 --> 05:01.540
And for this I'll again use redux.

05:01.910 --> 05:10.880
So I'll install redux with npm install dashes save redux and also react redux and I'll also install

05:10.880 --> 05:13.660
redux thunk so that we can use that too.

05:13.670 --> 05:19.170
For now I don't need it because I'm not talking to a server but later once we add native device features

05:19.170 --> 05:24.230
you will see that there we also got some features that are asynchronous and where you might want to

05:24.230 --> 05:29.750
wait for their completion before we actually dispatch an action which is exactly where X thunk can help

05:29.750 --> 05:34.470
us so therefore with these free packages installed we can now set up read X.
