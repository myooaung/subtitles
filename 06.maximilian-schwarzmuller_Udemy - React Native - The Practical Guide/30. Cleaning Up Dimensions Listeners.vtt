So we spend a lot of time on the auth screen,

00:04.790 --> 00:11.160
now there's one thing you also have to do if you implement the responsive approach as we did. If we submit

00:11.160 --> 00:20.270
this and move on and we create a new place here for example, up here by adding Munich let's say, we share

00:20.270 --> 00:21.010
the place

00:23.680 --> 00:24.710
and we click on it,

00:24.710 --> 00:30.390
we get this warning that we can only update a mounted or mounting component.

00:30.500 --> 00:38.360
We should check the auth screen component and we should, our approach for reacting to dimension changes

00:38.450 --> 00:39.620
is fine,

00:39.630 --> 00:44.570
there's one important thing we have to do and you always have to do when applying this approach.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.920
I'm setting up an event listener here

00:46.970 --> 00:47.830
right,

00:47.840 --> 00:50.840
the problem is we never detached that listener,

00:50.930 --> 00:53.280
so we actually created a memory leak,

00:53.390 --> 00:57.490
we should detach it. Whenever this component does not exist,

00:57.500 --> 01:00.740
there's no need for us to listen to this change,

01:00.740 --> 01:09.780
so what I will do is I will add the componentWillUnmount hook here and in this step here, when it will

01:09.840 --> 01:10.750
unmount,

01:10.980 --> 01:18.480
then I will call dimensions remove event listener and remove my change listener.

01:18.480 --> 01:25.440
Now here we need to remove exactly the same function we hooked up here, to do that I'll actually create

01:25.470 --> 01:34.530
a new method here which I'll name update styles, like this

01:35.820 --> 01:39.720
and I'll put my set state call into this method here

01:40.080 --> 01:47.950
so that here I just call update styles, just need to accept dims as an argument here

01:48.390 --> 01:57.330
and by the way, that also allows us to optimize this and use dims window height but the old code also

01:57.330 --> 01:58.820
worked.

01:58.920 --> 02:07.000
But now with that, we can also, here it should be this update styles, we can use this update styles here too to remove

02:07.040 --> 02:08.210
that event listener.

02:09.280 --> 02:15.370
So with these changes in place, referring to update styles in both add and remove event listener, if we save

02:15.370 --> 02:25.230
that code and we reload our application, if we now submit and go to create a new place like Munich again

02:26.370 --> 02:32.930
and we share that place, if we now visit this, we no longer get that warning and we no longer create this memory

02:32.930 --> 02:33.370
leak.

02:33.500 --> 02:38.760
So cleaning this up is really important and something you should do when working with that approach.
