00:02.250 --> 00:08.310
Now a quick fix which I just noticed that we will need to implement our shadow is gone here on this

00:08.460 --> 00:09.880
category page.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.970
I didn't notice this earlier.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.210
This happens because of the category grid tile.

00:14.220 --> 00:15.780
I added overflow hidden.

00:15.780 --> 00:22.860
If I remove that here then we have the shadow back and it makes sense that we get it because with overflow

00:23.250 --> 00:29.250
hidden we basically say well the grid item which is does view around everything else here that basically

00:29.250 --> 00:33.650
defines what we can see the shape of this defines what we can see.

00:33.690 --> 00:41.760
And this simply crop Steed shadow as well and well that's of course something I don't necessarily want

00:41.760 --> 00:42.750
here.

00:42.780 --> 00:48.780
Now of course overflow hidden is important though to make sure that the ripple effect effect works correctly.

00:48.960 --> 00:53.340
And the solution therefore is very very simple.

00:53.460 --> 01:05.540
We can move our elevation year onto this grid item view which is does extra of you we added to restrict

01:05.540 --> 01:06.860
the ripple effect.

01:06.860 --> 01:11.620
So at the elevation dare maybe increase it to five so that we can see the better.

01:11.750 --> 01:17.330
And with that we can see dead will have the shadow back on on Android.

01:17.330 --> 01:19.190
We have the shadow now again.

01:19.190 --> 01:27.140
Now for I guess you could think that you simply move these shadow properties here onto the same styling

01:27.160 --> 01:27.530
object.

01:27.540 --> 01:32.710
So onto grid item as well but this won't do a trick as you can tell here on ISIS.

01:32.720 --> 01:38.360
We still have no shadow because they are overflow hidden still crops to shatter that simple simply a

01:38.360 --> 01:40.610
little a platform difference we have.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.310
But that's no problem.

01:42.350 --> 01:45.260
We can revert this we can leave to shadow on a container.

01:45.260 --> 01:47.610
We could also move it here does make a difference.

01:47.840 --> 01:53.690
What we can instead do is we can leverage the platform and make sure that we only set overflow hidden.

01:53.690 --> 02:00.590
If we're on Android because we really only need it there we really only need it there to crop the shape

02:00.740 --> 02:02.300
for the ripple effect.

02:02.300 --> 02:09.470
So we can check if platform OS is equal to Android and actually we only use the ripple effect if we're

02:09.470 --> 02:11.300
on working 21 or higher.

02:11.300 --> 02:18.020
So if platform dot where John is greater or equal to 21 if that's the case you want to set overflow

02:18.020 --> 02:23.660
too hidden because then we need to crop this to make sure that a ripple effect works correctly otherwise

02:23.930 --> 02:31.940
we can set as to visible which is the default so that we have no cropping which means on ISIS will not

02:31.940 --> 02:35.320
set this to hidden and therefore on us we now have the shadow again too.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.970
And on Android we also have the shadow.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.110
But we still have to correct ripple effect.

02:39.350 --> 02:41.160
So that's a little improvement.

02:41.750 --> 02:46.910
Totally optional improvement but of course there to fix our styling would you want to implement here

02:46.910 --> 02:49.250
to make sure we have to stall again which we wanted.
