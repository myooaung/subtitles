00:02.350 --> 00:07.890
In the last lecture, we made sure that we can pick an image but now I want to pass this on.

00:08.220 --> 00:15.270
So let's now go to share place and there, I expect to have an event I can listen to essentially, so on

00:15.300 --> 00:22.540
image picked, something like this where I can then execute a method where I handle the image. So I will add

00:22.540 --> 00:24.580
my handler method here,

00:25.360 --> 00:34.710
image picked handler, there I expect to get the image, we'll see which format this will have and I want

00:34.710 --> 00:36.270
to store that in the state here

00:36.370 --> 00:43.530
so I'll add a new control where I got an image where I also have a value which is null and the valid

00:43.530 --> 00:44.860
property which is false

00:44.940 --> 00:48.600
and this will work pretty much the same as the location did.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.520
So the goal is to set the image once we well got one,

00:52.530 --> 00:58.040
so here I will call this set state, also get

00:58.230 --> 01:02.760
the previous state here to not override any other controls we have

01:03.730 --> 01:08.950
and I want to return a javascript object in here of course, set the controls.

01:09.040 --> 01:16.690
First of all copy all the property from the old state controls and then override the image to set the

01:16.690 --> 01:18.340
value to the image object

01:18.340 --> 01:22.120
we're getting here and set valid to true.

01:22.150 --> 01:29.690
Now we need to connect the image picked handler to our on image picked event here, like this.

01:29.690 --> 01:35.760
So theoretically this would be how we store the image in a state of share place component,

01:35.780 --> 01:40.950
I also now want to forward this when we basically click the button,

01:41.000 --> 01:49.850
so here I will then call or also pass this state controls image value as an argument and I also want to

01:49.850 --> 01:55.590
disable the button if it's invalid, so I'll add another condition I want to check, this button should also

01:55.640 --> 02:00.620
be disabled if state controls image is not valid.

02:00.900 --> 02:06.180
And finally at the bottom where we map dispatch to props, we now also get an image which I also want

02:06.180 --> 02:14.620
to pass to add place and therefore we also need to go to the action file, so places in the actions folder

02:15.300 --> 02:16.580
and on add place,

02:16.590 --> 02:20.940
I now will also accept to get an image,

02:20.970 --> 02:25.690
so here, let's also add image and forward the image.

02:25.700 --> 02:32.250
Now in the reducer, here we're right now handling the image by hardcoding it in here,

02:32.250 --> 02:40.510
now if we have a look at pick image real quick here, we saw that we set up picked image by accessing the

02:40.520 --> 02:42.910
URI property on the response.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.090
Now response is a couple of other things too like the error and so on,

02:46.130 --> 02:52.310
that is why I extracted the URI here and created my own object. Well, whatever we forward should

02:52.310 --> 02:55.730
be something that also has a URI property.

02:55.730 --> 03:02.660
So in the reducer, we can therefore assign our own custom image object we're constructing here

03:03.260 --> 03:06.270
to an object which has an URI

03:06.410 --> 03:11.270
where we then access image action image URI, something like this.

03:11.360 --> 03:19.100
This should successfully add the image to this well store and use the image we just created or we just

03:19.130 --> 03:27.950
picked. So that's the reducer updated too, save all these files since the structure of our image here didn't change,

03:27.980 --> 03:30.260
the detailed screen still should work

03:30.260 --> 03:30.800
alright,

03:30.800 --> 03:33.520
we had a path in the past, we have a path now,

03:33.740 --> 03:36.290
so this always should have worked.

03:36.500 --> 03:43.530
What we can now do is or what we have to do, we have to make sure that since in share place, I listened to

03:43.610 --> 03:49.700
on image picked on the pick image component, that we basically have this as a prop and that we then can

03:49.760 --> 03:53.880
indirectly call image picked handler from within pick image.

03:54.110 --> 03:59.840
We want to call this here in the pick image handler of course after we set the state,

03:59.870 --> 04:08.590
so when we successfully picked an image here. Then I will call this props on image picked and there forward

04:08.590 --> 04:14.760
an object where I at least have my URI property, so we'll forward res.uri here

04:17.770 --> 04:19.450
and that should actually be it.

04:19.540 --> 04:23.680
Now let's save this and let's test it on Android by reloading the Android app

04:23.680 --> 04:29.980
and as always, logging in with some random credentials here for now,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.220
let's now click pick

04:33.220 --> 04:35.340
image. On Android,

04:35.380 --> 04:38.650
it's opposite to iOS, choosing from library

04:38.650 --> 04:41.060
won't work, there

04:41.080 --> 04:48.550
we won't find any folders on the simulator but you can take a photo, allow access, yeah

04:48.560 --> 04:49.290
thank you

04:49.460 --> 04:53.320
and then you've got this dummy screen where you can indeed take a photo,

04:53.420 --> 04:55.540
not super beautiful but it will do the trick,

04:57.960 --> 04:59.600
so that's the photo we want to use.

05:00.570 --> 05:04.050
Now thanks to this little introduction, it broke, so let's try this again,

05:04.050 --> 05:05.320
take photo,

05:05.550 --> 05:08.450
now if we take it, we're asked if we want to use that photo,

05:08.460 --> 05:09.420
yes we do,

05:09.570 --> 05:11.210
here's our photo.

05:11.580 --> 05:15.530
Let's now also pick some place and enter something here

05:16.930 --> 05:19.320
and with that, let's share this place,

05:19.720 --> 05:26.020
find the places and we see our photo which isn't super beautiful but it works,

05:26.020 --> 05:27.330
that's the key thing.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.990
Let's also see this on iOS,

05:30.190 --> 05:37.710
quickly log in here, share a place, pick an image, here again from library, maybe

05:37.750 --> 05:39.590
this again is really beautiful,

05:39.700 --> 05:44.270
let's pick a place, let's give this a caption, share the place,

05:44.410 --> 05:49.430
find the places, open it and we see our photo both in the preview and here.

05:49.660 --> 05:50.710
So that's really beautiful,

05:50.710 --> 05:54.430
with that we get this to work as it should.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.950
Now we can also delete it of course, that also still works

05:57.970 --> 06:01.990
and with that, you saw how you could use the image picker. Now there's one more thing I want to show you in the

06:01.990 --> 06:04.480
next lecture and then we'll conclude this module.
