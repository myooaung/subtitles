00:02.230 --> 00:08.380
So we had a detailed look at Dimensions orientations and rendering different styles and layout based

00:08.380 --> 00:14.030
on your table width and height and also how to react to changes on width and height when you rotate

00:14.080 --> 00:17.010
the device for example very important stuff.

00:17.680 --> 00:22.900
Let's now have a look at how you can actually render different styles or layouts or whatever you want

00:23.080 --> 00:25.660
based on the platform you're running on.

00:25.660 --> 00:31.120
Right now we have basically an identical app on both Iaw and Android with one exception and that's our

00:31.120 --> 00:32.240
button here.

00:32.320 --> 00:38.320
The buttons look different because the button component which we're using is a component baked into

00:38.320 --> 00:46.060
React Native and it's one of the very rare actually the only component React Native offers that automatically

00:46.060 --> 00:49.310
adjusts based on the platform your app is running on.

00:49.390 --> 00:56.290
No other component really does that but of course you can write code to adjust your styles layout logic

00:56.320 --> 01:01.000
whatever you want based on the platform you're running on to see an example.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.170
Let's go to our header component and there.

01:04.180 --> 01:08.020
Let's work on the way we present this header on Android.

01:08.020 --> 01:12.810
You might have this background color and then text in front of it on ISIS.

01:12.820 --> 01:19.240
We might want to have a white background color and only have a thin border at the bottom and instead

01:19.240 --> 01:21.750
have to text in our primary color.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.270
That would be a more typical IOW look after all.

01:25.360 --> 01:31.810
Now to find out on which platform you're running risk native has you covered it has the platform object

01:32.110 --> 01:37.630
where dimensions helps you find out the dimensions of the device running on platform helps you find

01:37.630 --> 01:41.750
out D Will platform off the device you're running on.

01:41.910 --> 01:45.270
So now here in the stalls you were creating.

01:45.270 --> 01:48.660
We could render a different background colour based on that.

01:48.810 --> 01:53.310
We can use platform and now there you have a couple of properties you can use.

01:53.310 --> 02:01.170
For example you have to OS property and O S is basically the operating system and it's one of the values

02:01.170 --> 02:02.220
you're seeing here.

02:02.220 --> 02:05.670
Most importantly IOW where Android.

02:05.700 --> 02:12.000
So here we can check if debt is equal to let's say Android and in this case I set my background color

02:12.000 --> 02:13.570
to colours primary.

02:13.770 --> 02:20.130
But if it's not Android and therefore if it's I Os I set this to let's say white.

02:20.130 --> 02:28.800
Now if we do that and we save this we see a white header here on the Iaw device and while colored header

02:28.980 --> 02:31.090
on the Android device.

02:31.260 --> 02:36.960
Now of course you don't need to set up any listener on platform and it also doesn't offer such a functionality

02:37.140 --> 02:42.090
because the platform can't change whilst the app is running it's all the same operating system all the

02:42.090 --> 02:43.800
time of course.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.240
Now let's finish the styling for ISIS.

02:46.650 --> 02:53.340
I said I want to have a thin border at the bottom so we can add a border bottom color and check the

02:53.340 --> 03:01.410
platform and if the operating system there is equal to Iowa's then I want to set the border bottom color

03:01.410 --> 03:07.950
to let's say this grayish color otherwise I'll send it to white or too transparent actually so that

03:07.980 --> 03:16.350
we can't see it on Android and at a border bottom with off let's say and there we also make that check

03:16.770 --> 03:25.590
for Iowa us off let's say one pixel on I was and zero on Android.

03:25.590 --> 03:31.410
So now we shouldn't see anything on Android but we have that thin border here on ISIS.

03:31.530 --> 03:39.530
Last but not least let's color the text by going to the title text here and titled text does indeed

03:39.590 --> 03:42.400
merge in any style we set on the style prop.

03:42.770 --> 03:48.950
So here on title text we can add a style prop and point at style start.

03:48.960 --> 03:55.440
Title here or whatever you want to name it and add such a title style object here in our style sheet

03:55.860 --> 04:01.380
where we set the color which is the text color also based on the platform.

04:01.770 --> 04:08.970
If is IOW let's say we set this to colors thought primary and otherwise let's set it to white it was

04:08.970 --> 04:09.830
black before.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.700
Let's now set it to white.

04:11.700 --> 04:18.990
Now we have a white title year on Android but a color title here on Iaw and this is how easy you can

04:18.990 --> 04:22.600
set different styles based on the platform you're running on.

04:22.620 --> 04:23.400
As you can see.
