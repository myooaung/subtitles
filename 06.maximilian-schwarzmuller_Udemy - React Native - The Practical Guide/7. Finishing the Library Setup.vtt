00:02.490 --> 00:08.260
So in the last lectures we added re-act native navigation for both iOS and Android.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.710
Friend right I already rebuilt the project.

00:10.710 --> 00:17.100
Now let's also do this for iOS and PM run Iowa system command might also take a couple of seconds since

00:17.100 --> 00:23.490
it has rebuilt the entire project and thereafter we should have two uptodate projects running on our

00:23.490 --> 00:30.060
simulators really using re-act native navigation so that we can start using their features.

00:30.060 --> 00:32.980
Now what you see is you've got huge errors.

00:33.240 --> 00:39.710
The reason for it is as soon as you start using re-act native navigation does single index change as

00:39.710 --> 00:40.120
follows.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.240
We use before doesn't work anymore.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.880
You need to add two separate ones.

00:44.880 --> 00:45.960
Now one important note.

00:45.990 --> 00:53.070
You might also not be seeing this error because in your words since you basically don't need to fix

00:53.070 --> 00:55.990
or add a change or add in the next seconds.

00:56.130 --> 01:02.810
So if you don't CD-R feel free to skip that fix which is me adding two additional indexed not js files.

01:02.970 --> 01:08.850
You can then just keep that single index j as value had but you can also add them and follow along just

01:08.850 --> 01:09.390
fine.

01:09.420 --> 01:12.080
It will not cause any damage.

01:12.150 --> 01:18.350
You need to add an index dot Iowa SJS fall and the index dot Android J as follows.

01:18.660 --> 01:24.990
Historically this was always required and it still makes sense if you have different ways of starting

01:24.990 --> 01:25.320
your app.

01:25.320 --> 01:30.810
Maybe a different layout you want to use a different starting screen here however will use the same

01:30.810 --> 01:37.510
set up so I'll just copy the code from it next to yes and paste it into index Aiwass and index Android.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.730
You don't get to do anything else with these files except for save them.

01:41.910 --> 01:46.080
With that added you should be able to reload your application.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.150
And their offers to splash screens.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.180
That's actually the default.

01:52.210 --> 01:58.570
You don't see your application anymore because now and we added re-act native navigation we have to

01:58.570 --> 02:00.630
load our app differently.

02:00.640 --> 02:06.070
Loading it like this with our read x component here doesn't work.

02:06.070 --> 02:10.040
Instead we can find out how to start in the official documentation.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.470
But hey you're probably watching this Klores to not read the entire documentation.

02:15.610 --> 02:21.280
So let me show you how to actually start to sap with a screen in the next lecture.
