With the important knowledge regarding how to navigate in your app and how to also manage state which

00:08.600 --> 00:15.470
is a crucial thing in pretty much any app you're building it's now time for another app in this and

00:15.470 --> 00:20.860
the next course modules will work on a shopping app and in this module we'll build it.

00:20.860 --> 00:26.310
Regarding the navigation we need there regarding the state management we need there of course will also

00:26.330 --> 00:33.650
work with components and add some styling so this module here is a great practice module and in the

00:33.650 --> 00:40.040
next lecture where I sketch the app and where we plan the app I'll also challenge you to build the app

00:40.040 --> 00:47.300
on your own as a practice and then we'll also used his basic app into subsequent modules to dive deeper

00:47.300 --> 00:50.330
into other aspects we we haven't really touched on yet.

00:50.420 --> 00:58.280
Like handling user input sending HDP requests adding authentication such stuff so therefore you can

00:58.370 --> 01:04.700
also skipped as module if you want to but then you should be willing to download the final version of

01:04.700 --> 01:10.790
the app and manually go through it understand the code understand what we did there and maybe jump into

01:10.790 --> 01:16.700
some selected lectures office module if there's something which is not clear to you because in the next

01:16.700 --> 01:21.800
modules will build upon this app but I would definitely recommend that you don't skip this module but

01:21.800 --> 01:24.230
instead follow along or try it on your own.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.150
Because it now is a great practice of all the things to learn thus far.

01:28.290 --> 01:32.000
With that let's dive in and let's see what we built before we didn't start building it.
