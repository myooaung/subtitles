WEBVTT

00:02.300 --> 00:07.270
To stop the separate items I'll again create a separate component and I'll name it meal.

00:07.350 --> 00:11.620
Item Doc J.S. name as always.

00:11.640 --> 00:15.320
It's totally up to you and in there you know the game.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.200
We trade a react component by importing react.

00:18.440 --> 00:25.360
We'll also probably need view text and style sheet and maybe also some other things from react.

00:25.460 --> 00:32.610
Native then we set up the component meal item where we receive props and where we then return some J

00:32.610 --> 00:38.010
is actually and set up a solid sheet here stored in the stalls constant with stalls she'd create to

00:38.010 --> 00:46.090
which we pass an object and in the end we export our meal item here as the file default now with that

00:46.090 --> 00:48.100
here in mule item in this component.

00:48.100 --> 00:54.040
We of course need to return some tray as ex code for that meal item and that's something I get from

00:54.040 --> 00:55.750
the category meal screen there.

00:55.810 --> 01:02.260
I have this view with my text in here that's in the end what I want output but more complex than that

01:02.710 --> 01:07.150
but I'll cut it from there and move it over to meal item and their return.

01:07.150 --> 01:12.380
This view here but of course we're not done with debt for one.

01:12.380 --> 01:17.390
This also should be touchable because we can select a meal we can select such a recipe to be taken to

01:17.390 --> 01:21.010
the detail screen so I'll import touchable opacity.

01:21.020 --> 01:25.910
Now of course you could again make that differentiation and use the ripple effect with touchable native

01:25.970 --> 01:27.880
feedback on Android if you wanted to.

01:27.920 --> 01:35.270
I'll go with touchable opacity for now and wrap my view here with touchable whips touchable opacity

01:35.420 --> 01:44.350
like this so that we can actually tap our item here and on press I actually want to trigger a function

01:44.350 --> 01:49.000
that I expect to get on a property which we're not passing into the meal item yet but because we're

01:49.000 --> 01:54.460
not using the meal item yet anywhere but which I will pass in in the future maybe renamed named as on

01:54.460 --> 02:00.820
select meal or just on select whatever you want I'll name add ons like meal and I expect to get that

02:00.820 --> 02:06.950
prop on the meal item when we then use it in J as X so that's detachable opacity.

02:08.790 --> 02:16.050
In there I have my view with that title and actually that view should be a bit more complex than that.

02:16.740 --> 02:24.150
I want to have a view a nest that you in there like this and never view below that.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.530
So I want to have two rows.

02:25.530 --> 02:31.060
This will be set up as a column but these two views here will be set up as rows here.

02:31.230 --> 02:38.280
The first view should also render a background image so that the title sits in front of this background

02:38.310 --> 02:39.130
image.

02:39.180 --> 02:44.730
The second view the second row here should render some details about the selecting recipe.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.270
Like its complexity and duration.

02:50.190 --> 02:55.530
So let's start with that before we later at the image on both these views.

02:55.560 --> 03:00.660
I will therefore add the style property and point at Styles

03:03.050 --> 03:08.860
meal row or whatever you want to name this because it will be a row in my meal presentation here.

03:10.030 --> 03:18.140
And I'll add meal row down there day for and set the Flex direction here to row of course because well

03:18.140 --> 03:23.150
that should be rows of data now on the around the overall item here.

03:23.170 --> 03:27.290
I'll wrap another view where I want to set up a general style

03:30.050 --> 03:34.850
of styles meal item and meal item.

03:34.850 --> 03:40.670
That also is configured here in the style sheet of course and dare I want to give each meal a height

03:40.700 --> 03:46.940
of two hundred let's say each item in the list here and a width of one hundred percent to take the full

03:46.940 --> 03:55.390
available width and also maybe a background color of this grayish.

03:55.430 --> 04:00.570
Look here we can see where we want to keep that for now I'll use that.

04:00.810 --> 04:04.770
Now we can use the meal item here and we're not done with it yet but we can start using it here in the

04:04.770 --> 04:14.560
category meals screen by of course importing it import meal item from the components folder and they

04:14.560 --> 04:25.230
are from the meal item file and then render this here so return meal item here like this.

04:25.230 --> 04:32.010
And of course we now need to pass on some data data like the title which we get from item data dot item

04:32.010 --> 04:38.850
data title and the on select prop which I expect to get an email item which we in the end hook up to

04:38.850 --> 04:42.840
touchable capacities on press prop on select meal.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.030
That was the name I chose.

04:44.070 --> 04:46.820
That's all the something we need to set up here.

04:46.830 --> 04:51.330
When we used the meal item edition point that a function which for now doesn't do anything but which

04:51.330 --> 04:55.090
will later load the detail page for that meal.

04:55.110 --> 05:00.300
So now we get the title on the title prop Henson meal item here when we output the title we do this

05:00.300 --> 05:01.590
with the help of props.

05:01.740 --> 05:09.260
Title if we now save this we should actually be able to see something here so let's wait for this to

05:09.260 --> 05:10.580
reload.

05:10.580 --> 05:16.730
And yeah we see our meal here as certainly not too beautiful but at least we see a bit more than before.

05:16.730 --> 05:21.620
Now what I'd like to have here is a little bit of spacing around the list but ends up off the spacing

05:21.710 --> 05:26.930
the list items should take the full available with and not just the width of the widest item which is

05:26.930 --> 05:28.850
currently what's happening.

05:29.090 --> 05:35.800
And for that we can go to the flat list and there at the stall property and set this with two 100 percent

05:35.810 --> 05:39.470
to make sure that the flat list itself takes all the with it can get.

05:39.470 --> 05:42.020
With that we should have to look we want year.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.710
Now of course the meal items are not done though.

05:44.720 --> 05:51.380
They don't look the way I want them to look though we all slowly get there now in the meal item chest

05:51.380 --> 05:53.680
fall we still have some work left to do though.

05:53.690 --> 05:59.840
For example this view here with the title will later also hold the image and Daffodil should be way

05:59.840 --> 06:03.960
bigger than the row below it which will later just output some details.

06:05.500 --> 06:18.310
Hence here I will merge my meal row stalls with no style object so with the style set up in another

06:18.350 --> 06:26.530
style sheet object which I'll name meal header or whatever you want to name it and the same down there

06:26.530 --> 06:29.090
by the way for the details in the end there.

06:29.110 --> 06:36.920
I will merge this with Styles meal detail so that we have combined styles and let's start with the meal

06:36.920 --> 06:39.470
header which we can set up here.

06:39.470 --> 06:47.090
The meal header in the end will hold the image and also the title and I want the height of this to be

06:47.410 --> 06:49.580
let's say 80 percent of the available height.

06:49.580 --> 06:59.550
So this should be very very large the meal details automatically will therefore get the remaining 20

06:59.550 --> 07:07.470
percent obviously and to see whether that works let's output some details here so in that view here

07:07.470 --> 07:10.020
in that row below our title row.

07:10.020 --> 07:13.420
I also want to have some text here and there I'll output.

07:13.440 --> 07:21.920
Let's say props duration and then end there after 4 minutes because iteration will be a number which

07:21.920 --> 07:23.330
we treat as minutes.

07:23.330 --> 07:27.740
We just need to pass into duration from the category meals screen of course.

07:27.740 --> 07:33.140
So when we used to meal item besides passing in a title I'll set the duration prop because we're now

07:33.140 --> 07:34.940
expecting this only meal item.

07:34.940 --> 07:40.700
We get this from item data but item which is our meal and there will have a duration property because

07:40.760 --> 07:45.630
our meals as defined in the model here do have a duration property.

07:45.800 --> 07:50.690
And indeed if you have a look at the dummy data this year is your duration which has fed in

07:54.760 --> 07:56.560
if we save this.

07:56.560 --> 08:06.850
Now we see our duration down there and actually we can still change that height here to even 90 percent

08:06.910 --> 08:09.420
should be hired and it was here.

08:09.430 --> 08:10.630
That looks better.

08:10.750 --> 08:14.830
And of course you can experiment with this as well in the meal detailed row.

08:14.830 --> 08:22.680
I also want to have some horizontal padding the left and right off let's say 10 and justify my content

08:22.690 --> 08:32.650
here with space between keep in mind it's a row so this will justify it horizontally so that when we

08:32.650 --> 08:35.690
have multiple items they will be nicely distributed there.

08:35.740 --> 08:45.740
So we have 20 minutes let's output more information there by adding a number of text and their output

08:45.900 --> 08:47.030
the complexity.

08:47.030 --> 08:53.140
So here are output complexity and there after all output.

08:53.140 --> 09:01.950
These are for the ability of now we just need to pass and that data as well when creating our meal item.

09:01.990 --> 09:06.460
So here besides duration we pass in complexity which we get here.

09:06.460 --> 09:16.420
Item data item complexity and affordability that's of course item data.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.530
Dot item dot affordability.

09:18.740 --> 09:28.910
Like that and if we save this and let us we render now we see this output here still not super beautiful

09:29.000 --> 09:37.390
and we can definitely enhanced this but a nice start now is simple and affordable or our complexity

09:37.390 --> 09:45.000
and affordability therefore that should be stolid but differently we know it will be text and therefore

09:45.000 --> 09:51.680
I can use some Javascript functions or methods we have available on springs I will simply use to upper

09:51.770 --> 09:59.930
case to convert it to opera case entirely like this and now it is should already look a bit nicer than

09:59.930 --> 10:06.590
before now you can still tweak the styling it all go with with this styling and for now and let's now

10:06.620 --> 10:09.440
add a background image above.

10:09.440 --> 10:16.370
So for this we want of a background image behind this title text and thankfully react native makes adding

10:16.370 --> 10:23.930
such a background image really really simple react date of ships with an built in component to image

10:23.990 --> 10:29.690
background component which we can use to well render image in the background as you would imagine by

10:29.690 --> 10:36.020
the name you added next to the component behind which you want to add it and you added before that component.

10:36.020 --> 10:43.520
So here at Image background and on image background like on the normal image you set a source here my

10:43.520 --> 10:49.220
source is a web image so we pass an object if it would be a local image you would use require and what

10:49.220 --> 10:54.380
you learn about local images earlier in the course but here it's a web image so we pass an object with

10:54.380 --> 11:00.560
a you are I prop and dare we use props image which is where I expect to get that you are all in this

11:00.560 --> 11:07.370
component so of course we'll have to make sure we pass into you are L on that prop I'll also add some

11:07.370 --> 11:15.000
styling here and dad will be style start BJP image which we now going add to the style sheet down there

11:15.720 --> 11:22.110
wherever you want maybe here doesn't really matter an important thing here you have to set width and

11:22.110 --> 11:27.060
height because it's a much from the web and I will use them 100 percent for both because it should fill

11:27.060 --> 11:36.350
the entire space it gets now we just have to make sure we pass in that image prop here in category meals

11:36.440 --> 11:45.560
screen so besides the title here I also want to pass an item data on item dot image you are L is the

11:45.560 --> 11:51.020
name of it you can see that in the model image your ls so that sort of a passing in and we pass this

11:51.020 --> 11:56.960
to the image prop because that's what we're expecting and what we're setting here in the meal item and

11:56.970 --> 12:02.910
if you'd now save that and let's mix things up and test is on Android just takes a bit longer to load

12:03.000 --> 12:10.410
which is why I typically use I guess here but now if we test this we see our burger here which we don't

12:10.410 --> 12:19.010
see anymore is our title though to show the title again make sure that you actually wrap image back

12:19.010 --> 12:27.480
run around it this is how you tell React Native which content should be inside above that background

12:27.480 --> 12:34.320
image it's now with Dad here's our title not that easy to read and we'll fix that but it's there again

12:35.480 --> 12:41.050
so we're getting started with that recipe here now let's make sure the title is a bit easier to see

12:41.050 --> 12:50.760
by giving it a style here styles title which we can now set up down there and I want to set a fun family

12:50.850 --> 12:52.210
of open Sands.

12:52.220 --> 12:55.490
Bolt makes sense since we registered this fund.

12:55.590 --> 12:59.380
Give it a fun size which we increase a little bit maybe twenty two.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.310
You can play around with that of course.

13:01.440 --> 13:07.380
Give it a color of white to make it a bit easier to read and also sign a background color so that we

13:07.380 --> 13:10.600
can always see it even if the background image would be white.

13:10.620 --> 13:16.800
In which case white text would be hard to read by giving bizarre RG be a color which is a color that

13:16.800 --> 13:22.380
has built in transparency so to say and this is simply a black color which is a bit transparent

13:25.490 --> 13:28.400
and now also add a little bit of padding here padding vertical.

13:28.390 --> 13:35.000
All five should look good so that the background colored box here doesn't sit right on the edges of

13:35.000 --> 13:42.950
the text that's inside of the box and putting horizontal of 12 maybe with Dad we should always see our

13:42.950 --> 13:48.540
title and actually we can probably decrease that transparency here.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.790
Increased the transparency decreased opacity.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.210
Yeah that looks a bit nicer.

13:53.210 --> 13:53.630
I think

13:59.550 --> 14:06.420
like this and the only thing I want to do now is I want to move that title down at the bottom of this

14:06.420 --> 14:10.250
image and therefore on the BJP image style which I have here.

14:12.450 --> 14:23.230
I'll set justified content to flex end because the background image automatically acts as a flex box

14:23.230 --> 14:27.970
so to say like a view so we can justify our content in there.

14:27.970 --> 14:30.400
And now we have that title at the bottom.

14:30.430 --> 14:39.460
We could now also center the text by going to the title leader and adding text align center.

14:39.580 --> 14:42.210
And in case it's too long too big.

14:42.310 --> 14:46.400
Besides of course shrinking the font size which I'll do a little bit to 20.

14:46.420 --> 14:53.080
Of course you can go to that text here where you output a title and set number of lines to 1 and this

14:53.080 --> 14:55.870
will ensure that the Texas automatically shortened.

14:55.870 --> 15:06.780
If it's too large like here for you sell it with cherry tomatoes we also see a strange effect here on

15:06.880 --> 15:15.150
IAW where we have some extra background behind our text and not just the background colored box here.

15:15.160 --> 15:22.880
That's because I applied my background color ends on effect directly on the text to fix this we can

15:22.880 --> 15:29.510
cut it from the title here and only set up the color ends on there and instead add a title container.

15:29.540 --> 15:37.100
Here where we add this background color and so on and wrap this container around our title so I extra

15:37.120 --> 15:42.580
view we add here and it's quite normal and react native to next multiple such views and on that view

15:42.580 --> 15:51.580
we can now add style styles title container and if we save Dad we should get rid of that strange behavior

15:51.580 --> 15:52.640
on ISIS.

15:52.650 --> 15:52.860
Yeah.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.590
Now we don't have that extra box stair step.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.380
We just have one background color and the same on Android.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.270
So now this doesn't look too bad but I'm not one to hire entirely happy.

16:04.270 --> 16:10.480
I'd like to center my details here vertically as well and give it a little bit more space I guess.

16:10.480 --> 16:17.560
For Dad we can give the header maybe a 5 percent of the height and on the M8 meal detail here.

16:17.560 --> 16:23.650
Keep in mind that our Flex direction is row because we're merging meal row and meal detail here and

16:23.670 --> 16:26.080
therefore our across X is top to bottom.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.540
So if we want to center vertically that is the cross axis on which we need to center.

16:30.550 --> 16:37.540
So here we can set a line items which does the cross axis positioning to center and also change our

16:37.540 --> 16:43.280
color here a little bit to a little bit of a nicer color.

16:43.510 --> 16:49.170
This very light gray F5 F5 f fight 5 might look a bit better.

16:49.300 --> 16:49.530
Yeah.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.800
Definitely does.

16:50.800 --> 16:56.610
Now to make sure that we do reuse center vertically we just need to be more explicit about the height.

16:56.650 --> 16:58.660
Our meal details should take

17:03.480 --> 17:09.590
we take eighty five percent on the header so on the detail here we can set a height of 15 percent.

17:09.600 --> 17:17.230
Obviously to take the rest Yeah and I'd say this looks quite decent here.

17:17.420 --> 17:20.620
Certainly list items with which we can work here.

17:20.630 --> 17:25.670
I'll now just add a little bit of a border radius because you know I like border radius so I'll add

17:25.670 --> 17:33.500
a border radius of 10 year so that we have some rounded corners and with that if you go back we're almost

17:33.500 --> 17:38.820
there but you'll notice that the image actually doesn't respect the border radius.

17:38.870 --> 17:46.780
Now to fix that on the mule item we just have to say overflow hidden so that no child item can go outside

17:46.780 --> 17:49.130
of this space or does shape.

17:49.130 --> 17:49.910
We're building here

17:53.550 --> 17:56.880
and with that that's a start something we can work with.

17:56.880 --> 18:02.070
Now of course you want to make sure that when we tap such a item we actually go to the detail page.
