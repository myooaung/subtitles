Here's our familiar application set up again, I got both simulators running,

00:07.210 --> 00:12.910
I also started react native debugger which is attached to my iOS simulator because using it on both

00:13.060 --> 00:17.040
simulators simultaneously actually leads to errors,

00:17.050 --> 00:23.800
so that's why I use it on the iOS one but of course we'll always validate all our styles on both devices,

00:23.800 --> 00:26.110
on both platforms.

00:26.140 --> 00:33.460
We get plenty of work ahead of us, so why don't we just start by diving into how styling works before

00:33.460 --> 00:36.280
we add more life to our application?

00:36.280 --> 00:42.760
If we dive into our application with all the screens and so on, right now we use very little styling,

00:42.850 --> 00:49.570
for example in the auth.js file where we have our view and the text, there we don't apply any styling

00:49.630 --> 00:50.760
at all.

00:50.770 --> 00:55.750
Now in typical react applications, you want to use styling and we already had a brief look at styling

00:55.750 --> 00:59.220
in the earlier modules, you learned that for example

00:59.230 --> 01:07.050
view components use flex box to align the items we have in them, like text or the button

01:07.240 --> 01:09.650
and here's some general important

01:09.670 --> 01:12.790
takeaway, the main components

01:12.790 --> 01:16.750
you can style are view and text.

01:17.020 --> 01:19.670
Now there also are some other components

01:19.810 --> 01:23.030
and you might also wonder which styles can you add,

01:23.050 --> 01:25.890
can you use any css style?

01:25.930 --> 01:32.610
First of all it's important understand that as you learned you don't use a css style, instead if we have

01:32.610 --> 01:36.260
a look at for example the side drawer where we have some styling,

01:36.370 --> 01:39.410
you see that we use padding top, background color

01:39.430 --> 01:44.830
so we always use the camel case notation, we can't use background-color like this

01:44.860 --> 01:51.730
and we also can't use this if we wrap it in quotation marks, that would be technically correctly written property

01:51.730 --> 01:53.120
in a javascript object

01:53.260 --> 02:00.100
but if we save this and we reload our Android app, you actually see we get a styling error, that background

02:00.100 --> 02:02.790
color is not a valid style property,

02:03.040 --> 02:04.940
so this is not supported.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.110
There we also see one issue, here we get the error,

02:08.110 --> 02:12.700
that's nice but how can we know in advance what is supported and what not?

02:12.890 --> 02:15.300
Now actually getting this error isn't too bad,

02:15.310 --> 02:18.460
you see a full list of supported styles here,

02:18.670 --> 02:23.650
it's not the most convenient way but it's always nice to have a look at this if you get the error to

02:23.650 --> 02:28.540
see which styles you can use if you try to use one which is not supported.

02:28.540 --> 02:34.030
But of course you sometimes want to write your code without getting the error first, for this case

02:34.100 --> 02:36.640
there's a useful cheat sheet I can recommend,

02:36.670 --> 02:42.770
you'll find it in an article at the end of this lecture under useful resources, alternative

02:42.860 --> 02:48.130
you can also google for react native styling cheat sheet and you should find this github repository

02:48.130 --> 02:55.060
here which is constantly updated where you'll see an overview over the styles you can set up and how

02:55.060 --> 02:57.850
to write them and which values they support.

02:58.130 --> 03:00.770
You see the flex box related styles here

03:00.910 --> 03:07.180
but then you also get a component related styling cheat sheet and there, you see we got four components

03:07.180 --> 03:13.170
where we can add styles because all the other components either don't except styling,

03:13.330 --> 03:20.780
don't leave a physical footprint on our screen or are just composed from these base components.

03:20.890 --> 03:23.190
So there, you see mostly style the view

03:23.320 --> 03:30.120
and here are the styles you can use on that, the text input and also the scroll view and text element

03:30.310 --> 03:36.640
and there you always see how you may style all these elements to look the way you want them to look.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.500
So that's a really useful resource which I can only recommend

03:40.840 --> 03:45.790
and if we had to take a look at it, we would have noticed that background-color like this is not allowed,

03:45.980 --> 03:49.160
that we have to use backgroundColor like this instead.

03:49.600 --> 03:56.470
So this is how we can learn what to use and how to use and it's important to keep in mind that vanilla

03:56.530 --> 03:58.680
css is not built-in here,

03:58.780 --> 04:06.800
it's just emulating css, so it looks like css but it doesn't offer all the features css offers and

04:06.800 --> 04:09.100
it uses a different syntax.

04:09.100 --> 04:13.870
And when we talk about missing features, one thing you will notice here is that for example we don't

04:13.870 --> 04:17.070
have media queries or anything like that in here,

04:17.290 --> 04:24.010
so we'll have to come up with our custom solution for that and we will do so later in this module.

04:24.040 --> 04:30.490
Now with that out of the way, let's go back to that auth screen and let's add some styling to that,

04:30.640 --> 04:32.590
let's work with flex box,

04:32.590 --> 04:37.540
we have worked with it before but it's really important to understand how it works and how to distribute

04:37.540 --> 04:38.680
content with it.

04:38.690 --> 04:40.940
So let's do this in the next lecture.
