00:02.800 --> 00:07.120
So we had a look at how we can set breakpoints in the last lecture,

00:07.210 --> 00:12.490
wouldn't it also be awesome if we could inspect our elements and here, we can do with the

00:12.490 --> 00:13.360
inspector

00:13.360 --> 00:14.830
but it's not that great,

00:14.830 --> 00:22.990
we get only limited information here and overall, we might prefer a different setup, a different way

00:22.990 --> 00:24.540
of inspecting this.

00:24.910 --> 00:27.160
Well you can actually do that, 

00:27.220 --> 00:33.510
I can strongly recommend react native debugger, you can simply google for it to find this package on github,

00:33.510 --> 00:34.480
.

00:34.540 --> 00:40.840
it's a tool you can install to connect to your react native app to get advanced debugging capabilities,

00:41.140 --> 00:49.400
like accessing your elements and the state of your react components there as well as redux.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.720
So for that, we just have to install it,

00:51.730 --> 00:57.430
you can click on the releases link here to be taken to the releases page where you can download it for

00:57.430 --> 00:58.850
your operating system,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.490
so I'm going to choose Mac OS here.

01:01.840 --> 01:08.110
Once you did successfully download it, you can of course extract it and in there, you'll find a program

01:08.110 --> 01:12.110
you can execute, so I'll execute it here,

01:12.110 --> 01:14.240
the react native debugger app

01:15.300 --> 01:16.850
and here it is,

01:16.860 --> 01:22.760
so let me move this over here so that we can give this a little bit more space.

01:22.770 --> 01:26.300
Now here you see it saying another debugger is already connected,

01:26.460 --> 01:31.150
so for this to work, we first of all need to quit our existing debugging process

01:33.920 --> 01:35.940
and now it should be able to connect,

01:36.280 --> 01:37.070
yeah this looks good,

01:37.070 --> 01:40.900
so I just reloaded the app a couple of times, now it's connected here.

01:40.970 --> 01:48.320
You can obviously arrange this in a way that you have more room for everything but the cool thing is here,

01:48.320 --> 01:56.990
you can for example down there dive into your your dom so to say, so the structure of your application.

01:57.290 --> 02:03.230
You see here redux is attached, we got the provider app, connect is the wrapper around our app component and there,

02:03.230 --> 02:08.180
you also see the prop self, that component, you see all the props which are essentially added

02:08.180 --> 02:09.780
by react redux.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.390
You see we got this view in there

02:12.800 --> 02:15.540
and you also get more information about that view here.

02:15.560 --> 02:19.110
You see its children, its styling here

02:19.930 --> 02:26.200
and the cool thing is you can even go in there and edit it and watch on the left how this updates

02:26.200 --> 02:27.440
in real time,

02:27.460 --> 02:34.200
so here, you can for example give this a red background color or go back to white which looks better.

02:34.270 --> 02:35.620
So that's pretty cool,

02:35.620 --> 02:38.760
you can edit your styles here on the go,

02:39.100 --> 02:41.320
you can even add new styles,

02:41.320 --> 02:47.230
so if you want to play around with that and really have the full flexibility of debugging your app and

02:47.230 --> 02:54.460
finding out what's causing it to behave strangely or differently or anything like that, you can always

02:54.460 --> 02:55.250
do that here.

02:55.260 --> 02:58.710
So that's a great tool which I can only recommend using,

02:58.930 --> 03:04.090
so if you want to play around with your app and find out why it's behaving strangely, why it's looking strangely,

03:04.180 --> 03:06.850
you can always do that here and you can play around with it,

03:06.880 --> 03:07.870
change the styles,

03:07.870 --> 03:12.560
inspect your different elements and the state of these elements,

03:12.580 --> 03:15.190
see what's wrong in there, which props they have

03:15.400 --> 03:17.130
and you also got redux here.

03:17.230 --> 03:24.570
So if I add a place here like this, you would see it here but redux isn't connected yet, 

03:24.730 --> 03:26.270
so we'll do this in a second,

03:26.290 --> 03:30.040
we'll connect our redux store to the dev tools in a second.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.410
Before I do this, just one quick note,

03:32.440 --> 03:36.370
you of course also can access sources here just as I showed it before,

03:36.370 --> 03:38.130
so this also works in this tool,

03:38.170 --> 03:45.800
so it's just like the other debugger in Chrome but in a better version which offers even more capabilities.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.890
So with that I strongly recommend using react native debugger,

03:48.940 --> 03:54.760
it's an awesome tool to really get deep insights into your app and be able to fix that error that's

03:54.760 --> 03:56.110
blocking you.

03:56.110 --> 04:01.400
Now let's also connect redux to it so that we can even inspect redux here in this tool.
