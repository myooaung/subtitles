00:02.290 --> 00:05.850
To set up redux all follow the same approach as I did early on the course.

00:05.950 --> 00:13.980
I'll add a store folder and in there I'll have my places actions J.S. file in my places reducer J.S.

00:14.020 --> 00:14.470
file.

00:14.470 --> 00:16.310
That's of course a bit different than before.

00:16.330 --> 00:19.310
There I had a actions and a reduce hers sub folder.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.520
You can absolutely do the same here.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.950
Since I have only one action and one reducer though I'll keep this in two files.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.820
But you could have some folders ends on.

00:27.820 --> 00:34.840
That's totally up to you now in the places reducer all define how my state should look like for this

00:34.840 --> 00:37.990
part of my total state and debt will be very simple.

00:37.990 --> 00:43.510
My initial state here is just a javascript object where I wanna have a place as key which is empty and

00:43.510 --> 00:47.810
empty array at the beginning because I'll have an array of places and that's it.

00:47.830 --> 00:53.830
So therefore here I can export this reducer function which takes a state that is set to the initial

00:53.830 --> 00:54.190
state.

00:54.190 --> 01:01.450
If no other state is passed in and an action and in there for now I'll just returned at State soon of

01:01.450 --> 01:08.320
course will add logic to handle different actions and for example add a new place in the places actions

01:08.320 --> 01:16.890
file I'll export a new constant add place which is one action identifier I'll need and I'll add action

01:16.890 --> 01:23.640
create or function add place which should take some data about the place and for the moment that's just

01:23.640 --> 01:26.290
a title later that will be more.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.420
And here I want to return my action object.

01:28.420 --> 01:35.560
Then where to type is at place and where I then just have my place data let's say which at the moment

01:35.560 --> 01:41.200
of course is only made up of the title but later again that will be more.

01:41.260 --> 01:43.630
That's the basic read except now of course an app.

01:43.660 --> 01:50.670
We need to wire everything up so in there as you learn it in this course we can import something from

01:51.280 --> 02:02.010
redux and also something from react redux and also import redux thunk from well redux func.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.160
So from this package we all installed now from redux.

02:05.160 --> 02:12.270
We need to create store and combine rid users and also apply middleware to apply redux thunk and from

02:12.270 --> 02:15.210
react reduction we need the provider component.

02:15.690 --> 02:21.240
And with that just as we did it multiple times in the course we can create our root reducer with the

02:21.240 --> 02:23.120
help of combined with users.

02:23.130 --> 02:26.370
This takes an object where we merge already users together.

02:26.370 --> 02:33.090
Now obviously we only have one reducer here and that's the places reducer which we import from the store

02:33.090 --> 02:37.140
folder and their IDs to places reduce our file.

02:37.140 --> 02:43.680
But of course you could have more with users in your app and I'll map this to places so the places reducer

02:43.710 --> 02:46.690
is map to the places identifier here.

02:46.890 --> 02:53.460
Now with that we can create our store with the create store function and this function takes the root

02:53.490 --> 03:00.300
reducer and we can also pass in a second argument where we call apply middleware and parse redux thunk

03:00.330 --> 03:07.800
to dead function so that the redux func package is kind of locked into our redux flow here with all

03:07.800 --> 03:15.810
of that setup we can wrap our places navigator with the provider component because every screen in our

03:15.810 --> 03:21.750
app in our navigator should have access to the store and to provider we pass the store through to store

03:21.750 --> 03:30.160
prop that's the redux setup we also saw multiple times wrote this course with redux setup we can go

03:30.160 --> 03:35.380
to the new place screen and make sure that here in the safe place handler which is triggered when we

03:35.380 --> 03:41.530
click this button we do actually add a new place which for the moment only consists of its title but

03:41.530 --> 03:49.450
of course that will change from this course to do that we can import use dispatch from a react redux

03:50.730 --> 03:57.300
and simply get access to the dispatch function by executing use this patch up their and also of course

03:57.390 --> 04:03.930
import our action for example again with using this import merging syntax here with import everything

04:04.380 --> 04:14.370
as places actions from the store and they're the places actions file and with that we can go to safe

04:14.370 --> 04:21.960
place handler called this patch here and dispatch places actions at plays and forward the title which

04:21.960 --> 04:29.500
is of course stored in our title of value so in this year now with Dad we'll be able to dispatch this

04:29.650 --> 04:32.170
action in the places reducer.

04:32.170 --> 04:44.400
We can now switch our action type or use if checks of course and look for the at place state or action

04:44.400 --> 04:50.400
which we import from places actions all that the default case by the where but by the way where we just

04:50.400 --> 04:56.160
returned a state and therefore we can get rid of this return statement down there and now is at place

04:56.220 --> 04:57.240
is what we got.

04:57.930 --> 05:04.260
Well then we can create a new place here and for that all the just as before in this course I'll add

05:04.260 --> 05:10.290
a model's folder with a place J as following there where I wanted to find how a place should look like

05:10.290 --> 05:15.900
in this application simply just to have an easy way of creating new place objects that are always the

05:15.900 --> 05:17.190
same.

05:17.190 --> 05:24.510
So here I'll create a class and export this asked of file default and now of course is up to you how

05:24.510 --> 05:30.180
you want your place to look like all the fine line with the help of the constructor to have an idea

05:30.570 --> 05:31.460
and a title.

05:31.530 --> 05:32.670
And later we'll add more.

05:32.670 --> 05:34.020
But for now that's it.

05:34.230 --> 05:41.280
And I'll store my I.D. here and I store my title here in a property with Dad we have a blueprint for

05:41.280 --> 05:45.390
new places back in the places reducer.

05:45.630 --> 05:46.440
We can now use that.

05:46.440 --> 05:55.170
So there we can import place from the models folder and there to place J as file and then here create

05:55.170 --> 05:58.080
a new place by calling new place.

05:58.080 --> 06:04.560
So by initializing or by instantiating a new place based on our class and for the idea of for the moment

06:04.560 --> 06:12.050
use a dummy I.D. of the current date timestamp and the title however is of course something we can set

06:12.060 --> 06:17.130
because that's part of our action there in the place data will have a title property which holds the

06:17.130 --> 06:18.720
title the user set.

06:18.720 --> 06:24.630
So here I can set this to action place data dot title.

06:24.630 --> 06:26.530
This creates a new place object.

06:26.670 --> 06:33.600
And now we can return a new state here where places and I don't need to copy the old state because I

06:33.600 --> 06:39.480
have nothing else in my state here and I won't add anything so I can just return a brand new state object

06:39.900 --> 06:44.020
where places is now state DOT places Kong cat.

06:44.040 --> 06:49.710
So that takes the old array adds a new item and returns a brand new Array which replaces the old the

06:49.710 --> 06:51.050
right here in our state.

06:51.300 --> 06:59.310
And I conquered my new place of course with that we should have a list of places which we manage in

06:59.310 --> 07:00.220
the next lecture.

07:00.240 --> 07:06.390
We can now worry about outputting this here on the place list screen just one other thing when we add

07:06.390 --> 07:09.310
a new place here by clicking the safe place handler.

07:09.390 --> 07:12.560
I also want to go back to the places list screen so here.

07:12.570 --> 07:20.610
After dispatching this action I'll actually use props navigation to go back so to go back to the place

07:20.610 --> 07:25.530
list screen and now let's work on that places list screen and let's make sure we do actually output

07:25.530 --> 07:26.760
a list of places stair.
