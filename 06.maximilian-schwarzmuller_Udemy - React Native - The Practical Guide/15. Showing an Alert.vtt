00:02.270 --> 00:08.210
Now to shows such an alert React Native has got us covered from React Native we can import alert and

00:08.210 --> 00:15.260
that's also not a component we use but instead object where we can call a native API where we can call

00:15.260 --> 00:22.670
a native feature so here where we return if one of these conditions is met and deal for we're not having

00:22.670 --> 00:30.380
a valid number data we can call alert dog alert and now throw an alert which you can configure as described

00:30.380 --> 00:35.930
here you can set a title you can add a message and you can also add buttons and some general options

00:36.280 --> 00:39.230
note a title could be invalid.

00:39.230 --> 00:48.680
No the message string could be number has to be a number between one and ninety nine.

00:50.020 --> 00:53.680
Buttons then is an array of alert buttons.

00:53.680 --> 01:01.420
What you add here are simply JavaScript objects where each object can have a certain style a text and

01:01.480 --> 01:11.200
a press so a click handler basically and I will add a text here where I simply say OK where I then define

01:11.200 --> 01:14.650
a style and style here is one of free text values.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.100
It's not a style you defined with a style sheet.

01:17.170 --> 01:21.520
Instead it's one of these free predefined style identifiers.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.180
It's either a cancel style default or destructive.

01:25.180 --> 01:33.220
This changes the colour and presentation here and I'll give this destructive as a style and I'll also

01:33.220 --> 01:39.980
add my own press handler where I point at the Reset Input handler because I want to reset the user input.

01:40.060 --> 01:46.000
If it was invalid anyways with that the alert is configured and this alert will now be shown if the

01:46.000 --> 01:47.350
input is invalid.

01:47.350 --> 01:50.640
Here let's give it a try and save this.

01:50.790 --> 01:55.560
And if I click confirm here I actually get to not a number.

01:55.590 --> 02:02.500
We'll have to fix that but if I enter 0 here now I get this alert with the okay button and if I click

02:02.500 --> 02:05.060
it does is reset and we're good.

02:05.080 --> 02:12.630
But let's make sure that we also get as if we have not a number of chosen number is not a number.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.700
And the reason for that is that this check won't work in JavaScript.

02:15.700 --> 02:21.470
Instead you have a special is an end function which you wrap your value around.

02:21.500 --> 02:26.000
And now this will check for you if this is not a number and if Dad's returns TRUE WE MAKE IT INTO IT

02:26.010 --> 02:28.330
AS IF block at the would throw this alert.

02:28.330 --> 02:31.570
So now submitting an empty value also is invalid.

02:31.630 --> 02:32.600
So that's important.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.080
Use is not a number instead of that equality check.

02:37.090 --> 02:41.030
So now we're checking for this valid values are still allowed.

02:41.110 --> 02:46.990
And with that let's work on this confirmation presentation so that we can soon also enter the next stage

02:46.990 --> 02:47.890
and start a game.
