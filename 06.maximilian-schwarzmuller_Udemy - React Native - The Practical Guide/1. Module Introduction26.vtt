Thus far in this course you'll learn quite a bit about native and how to build user interfaces screens

00:09.460 --> 00:10.270
with it.

00:10.270 --> 00:16.000
But what you didn't really learn is how to build a real app with multiple screens between which you

00:16.000 --> 00:18.190
can navigate forth and back.

00:18.190 --> 00:21.920
Yes we of course had our number of guests per game and there we.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.520
We had multiple screens.

00:23.530 --> 00:26.260
We had the three screens we used stair.

00:26.380 --> 00:32.710
But actually what we did there is that we only rendered these screens under different conditions.

00:32.710 --> 00:37.750
So in the end we just had a couple of if checks there to then render one of the three screens.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.270
Now for this little application for this little demo.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.150
This work.

00:42.160 --> 00:49.600
But what was missing there was some real navigation between screens with a header with a back button

00:49.810 --> 00:54.110
maybe with some taps at the bottom or a side door or you could open.

00:54.130 --> 01:00.100
So basically all the navigation patterns you know from most apps you download from the app stores and

01:00.100 --> 01:05.170
therefore that's exactly what we'll have a look at and this module will have a look at how you can add

01:05.290 --> 01:11.920
real navigation between screens to your react native app and for this we'll also build a brand new app.
