00:02.400 --> 00:09.500
Now with that if we go through the next screen where we have a running game we face the next problem

00:09.520 --> 00:10.610
there in portrait mode.

00:10.610 --> 00:15.680
It looks good but if we rotate the device then this doesn't look too good.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.520
Now here a solution simply could be that we changed the styling a little bit.

00:20.570 --> 00:23.320
If we don't have that much height weight level.

00:23.420 --> 00:28.150
Alternatively we render a totally different layout based on the available space.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.470
Both would be options you have.

00:30.470 --> 00:36.920
You could for example try to render to side by side by simply adding if check here in your game screen

00:36.920 --> 00:42.620
where you return totally different J has X code and maybe alter with totally different styling and therefore

00:42.620 --> 00:49.820
layout ing based on the available with or height and then you would just need to setup a listener that

00:49.820 --> 00:51.200
re renders your component.

00:51.200 --> 00:56.150
So with set stage just as we did it here in the start game screen to render your component whenever

00:56.150 --> 01:02.560
that's the case I think that would be kind of interesting and therefore debt something I'll do here.

01:02.570 --> 01:08.740
What all do is I want to render my buttons here to the left and the right of the number of container.

01:08.740 --> 01:13.370
If we only have a limited height available and render it like we always did.

01:13.390 --> 01:15.160
If that's not the case.

01:15.460 --> 01:20.560
So I want to render totally different J has X code base than light dimensions.

01:20.560 --> 01:30.540
So here I'll add if check and say if dimensions get window height let's say if debt's smaller than 500

01:30.670 --> 01:33.850
and we'll see if that value works then I want to return.

01:33.850 --> 01:37.770
Basically this j is X code from down there.

01:37.860 --> 01:47.770
So copy that put it between brackets here parentheses but I don't want to have my card here.

01:47.770 --> 01:55.390
Instead I'll have the first main button before my number a container the next one after the number of

01:55.390 --> 01:59.530
container and I'll have all of that inside of a new

02:02.410 --> 02:09.000
view here which I'll wrap around this which should lay these three things out in a row.

02:09.010 --> 02:16.180
So add a brand new style here styles let's say controls or whatever you want to name it.

02:16.300 --> 02:21.400
And now I add this to my style sheet here and that's the same style she does before because it just

02:21.400 --> 02:27.460
sets up styles that I can use anywhere my component no matter under which conditions I render what.

02:27.460 --> 02:31.540
And here all set this flex direction to row.

02:31.540 --> 02:38.890
The default this column and now we want to have a row here and I'll set justify content to space around

02:39.070 --> 02:48.360
and we'll see how that looks like we now safeties and we start a new game here in landscape mode.

02:48.390 --> 02:49.470
Doesn't look too bad.

02:49.470 --> 02:54.690
Still some work to do but this is now what I get here in landscape mode or on devices with limited height

02:55.350 --> 02:57.370
on the biases with more height.

02:57.480 --> 03:01.530
I still get the old view here which is of course exactly what I want.

03:01.620 --> 03:08.260
Now let's fix this view here and therefore we can simply go to controls and give that a width of let's

03:08.260 --> 03:16.340
say 80 percent so that the overall container is bigger and very important and set a line items here

03:16.340 --> 03:24.340
to Center so that the number of container and two buttons are all centered vertically and now with that

03:24.340 --> 03:33.560
if we give that another try here we enter this Des looks way better and it works in the same way as

03:33.560 --> 03:38.950
before but now we have a different layout based on our dimensions.

03:38.990 --> 03:44.960
Now of course the problem is this layout doesn't change if we rotate not the end of the world but we

03:45.050 --> 03:49.560
might want to change back to that old layout and you'll learn how that works.

03:49.670 --> 03:54.690
We just need to manage this with state and set up a listener.

03:54.690 --> 04:00.200
Now I already have use state and use a factor in the game screen so all we need to do in our game screen

04:00.200 --> 04:08.180
component is start by setting up that state here and in the end what we want to manage here is our the

04:08.370 --> 04:18.370
vise with which changes over time maybe named this away little device with to make it clear that we're

04:18.370 --> 04:21.960
not setting the device with here we're just setting detect it.

04:22.030 --> 04:25.370
Device with you could therefore alter named as detected device with.

04:25.450 --> 04:34.090
I'll name it a way little device with and set away lable device with a managed as with use state where

04:34.090 --> 04:43.930
I use dimensions get window with to get the available device with and of course I just recognized this

04:43.930 --> 04:44.470
is wrong.

04:44.470 --> 04:46.480
We're interested in the height not the width

04:49.520 --> 04:52.850
but will need the width as well for this check here so we'll need both.

04:53.300 --> 04:59.250
So we have the away little device with and I'll also manage never stayed here.

04:59.270 --> 05:00.560
That's our available.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.990
The Y's height here also.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.300
This is set a way lable the vice height at the upper here.

05:07.300 --> 05:11.700
Initially we get the available device height and now we need to change both.

05:11.710 --> 05:19.710
When our orientation changes for Dad we can use a fact for example here set up a function that runs

05:19.710 --> 05:29.310
whenever our component renders and in this function here all setup dimensions add event listener.

05:29.330 --> 05:35.810
Listen to change events and setup a function which should trigger when that's the case update layout

05:35.810 --> 05:39.720
for example is a fitting name because that's exactly what we're doing.

05:39.850 --> 05:51.420
And then there I call set a way lable device with an eye set as two dimensions get window dot with and

05:51.420 --> 05:59.410
of course all the set away lable device height two dimensions get window height update layout a Stanford

05:59.410 --> 06:05.680
a function we point at on our event listener on dimensions and justice before we need a cleanup function

06:06.010 --> 06:14.080
to a wide unnecessary renders in a dysfunction we simply use dimensions remove event listener change

06:14.170 --> 06:23.010
where we point at update layout and we're good now we just need to use our two states here away lable

06:23.040 --> 06:25.390
device with and the way little device height.

06:25.500 --> 06:32.190
So in this if check here I use a whale device with and here where a where I'm interested in the height

06:32.220 --> 06:40.170
I use a whale device height if we now save this we should have a layout where if we start a game we

06:40.170 --> 06:47.070
have this look but if we then rotate into landscape mode this changes and of course all the changes

06:47.070 --> 06:55.830
back it needs to hear on ISIS we have this look and we have this look if we rotate so now this is really

06:55.830 --> 07:03.500
looking good and this is giving us the look we want based on the available width and height and it also

07:03.510 --> 07:06.960
respects changes to that when we rotate the vice.
