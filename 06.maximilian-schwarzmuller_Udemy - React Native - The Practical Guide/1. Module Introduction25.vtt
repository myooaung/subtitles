00:02.200 --> 00:07.450
Now did you had a thorough introduction to how you generally work with React Native and build react

00:07.480 --> 00:09.120
native applications.

00:09.170 --> 00:10.000
It's of course.

00:10.090 --> 00:17.350
Time to dig a bit deeper and also learn how we can build applications that look great on both platforms

00:17.350 --> 00:22.510
on both ISIS and Android and that maybe also we have kind of the default look you would expect there

00:22.960 --> 00:29.690
and of course that all look great on different devices different device sizes.

00:29.740 --> 00:36.220
That's what's called responsive to sign your app should be designed such that it automatically looks

00:36.220 --> 00:42.400
great on all possible device sizes and therefore in this module you will learn all about the tools you

00:42.400 --> 00:44.490
need for that specifically.

00:44.800 --> 00:49.320
We'll have a look at how you can find out how big the device is on which you're running.

00:49.330 --> 00:55.180
So how broad it is how much with you have how much height you have and maybe which orientation it has.

00:55.210 --> 01:01.270
Because maybe you also want to present a different layout for different orientations for portrait mode

01:01.270 --> 01:06.130
and for landscape mode and therefore will also have a look at how you can adjust your styles and your

01:06.130 --> 01:11.500
layouts based on the size and orientation because there are a couple of different tools you get by React

01:11.500 --> 01:11.890
Native.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.220
Now the sizes are one thing.

01:15.250 --> 01:20.670
The other obvious thing which you might want to cover is the platform you're running on.

01:20.680 --> 01:26.170
You're building an app that you typically want to distribute to both ISIS and Android because debt is

01:26.170 --> 01:27.880
the cool thing with React Native.

01:27.880 --> 01:34.120
You use javascript to get an app for multiple platforms and still sometimes you need to adjust your

01:34.120 --> 01:40.870
styling or your layout or maybe even some business logic based on the platform you're running on.

01:40.900 --> 01:47.140
So you want to have a certain layout or a certain color on ISIS and you might have a different color

01:47.140 --> 01:48.280
on Android.

01:48.280 --> 01:54.130
In this module you'll learn how you can adjust your code or your user interface in general based on

01:54.130 --> 01:54.880
the platform.

01:54.880 --> 02:00.190
So these are the big topics will dive in in this module and for this I'm back on the app.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.620
We worked on this as the app we saw there.

02:03.680 --> 02:10.550
This basic quiz we worked on and I want to now step by step make sure that this looks good on different

02:10.550 --> 02:16.130
device sizes that we maybe also learn how we can switch around the layout based on the space we have

02:16.130 --> 02:22.610
a way lable and of course all when to make sure that we maybe also have some different looks based on

02:22.640 --> 02:24.200
the platform we're running on.
