Now that we know how we can adjust for different platforms,

00:05.480 --> 00:10.180
let's see how our application actually adjusts to different orientations.

00:10.270 --> 00:15.950
For that I'll reload the application and just rotate it with command or control and the arrow keys for

00:15.950 --> 00:17.240
example.

00:17.420 --> 00:25.940
Now on the login screen, it's ok but we can see that here we faced a problem of too much content getting

00:26.270 --> 00:28.150
crunched into that space,

00:28.160 --> 00:34.040
it's working on this device but on a smaller device, we might actually lose some content and if we lose

00:34.040 --> 00:36.230
the submit button, we've got a big problem.

00:37.000 --> 00:37.360
Here

00:37.370 --> 00:43.940
the issue is that flex box tries to fit everything onto the screen because it orders it from top to

00:43.940 --> 00:44.810
bottom

00:45.080 --> 00:50.760
but with all the margins and so on we set up, it can only do so much.

00:50.870 --> 00:58.100
It gets even worse if we continue and we add a new place, here we can do that without issues because we

00:58.100 --> 01:06.140
got a scroll view and here, Android supports us and opens the keyboard in a new full size window

01:06.530 --> 01:13.400
but if I share the place and go back and open the place, we see just the window and I can't reach the trash

01:13.400 --> 01:14.220
bin.

01:14.270 --> 01:17.840
Now always keep in mind this is a big device, on smaller devices,

01:17.840 --> 01:20.050
the issue might be worse.

01:20.420 --> 01:24.680
Of course you can always limit the orientations your user may use,

01:24.710 --> 01:31.310
you can limit that in the config files, I'll come back to that but sometimes limiting is just a cheap way

01:31.310 --> 01:32.320
of avoiding work

01:32.330 --> 01:39.700
as a developer. So what you can also do if it would make sense to offer your application in both dimensions,

01:39.980 --> 01:46.070
you can use some features react native gives you to determine which orientation you're currently having

01:46.130 --> 01:47.510
or better than that,

01:47.570 --> 01:50.780
how much width and height you have at your disposal

01:51.050 --> 01:54.430
and then you can reorganize your layout accordingly.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.980
So let's have a look at the tools you've got and then let's implement these fixes,

01:58.040 --> 02:03.370
in our case for the auth page and for this place detail page here.
