WEBVTT

00:02.220 --> 00:05.560
We installed the library, now we need to link it. For this,

00:05.560 --> 00:07.730
I'll start our project in Xcode,

00:07.780 --> 00:13.030
you can simply go to the iOS folder in your Windows Explorer or Mac Finder and double click on this

00:13.060 --> 00:15.250
Xcode proj file here.

00:16.420 --> 00:22.260
Now in Xcode, for every library that touches native device features, there are at least two steps you

00:22.260 --> 00:23.190
always need to do

00:23.250 --> 00:27.350
and further steps can always be taken from the documentation of that library.

00:27.420 --> 00:32.410
The first one is to right click on the library's folder here on the left panel,

00:32.490 --> 00:37.740
if you don't see that, click that button here on the top right to add it or remove it.

00:37.950 --> 00:44.040
So click on libraries and then click on add file to and there is your project name.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.070
Now in the opening window which should automatically be navigated into your project, click on node modules

00:50.190 --> 00:55.700
which is where all your dependencies are stored and there, simply pick the one you just installed,

00:55.710 --> 01:02.940
react native vector icons. In there, you typically always have something like an iOS folder or anywhere

01:02.940 --> 01:06.240
else, you have a Xcode project,

01:06.240 --> 01:08.010
so ending with .xcodeproj

01:08.010 --> 01:09.400
.

01:09.600 --> 01:15.270
this one in this case. Could be in the iOS subfolder, in this case it's in the root folder,

01:15.330 --> 01:20.130
simply click add to add this to your libraries.

01:20.250 --> 01:23.810
The next step is to click on your project itself here

01:23.880 --> 01:29.750
on the top of the left panel and then click on build faces here in the middle.

01:30.830 --> 01:38.120
On build faces, click on link binary with libraries and there on the plus icon at the end of the list,

01:39.280 --> 01:45.280
you may now simply search for some words that occurs in your library name like in this one, search for

01:45.280 --> 01:52.870
vector and you should find a lib rn for react native, in this case vector icons, whatever your library

01:52.870 --> 01:56.020
is named, click add and that's it.

01:56.020 --> 01:59.910
These are the core steps you need to do in every iOS project

02:00.160 --> 02:05.680
and then as I mentioned, the specific library you're using might require some additional steps,

02:05.830 --> 02:13.390
in this case here, we also need to drag the font we want to use from node modules and the library folder

02:13.660 --> 02:20.020
into our Xcode project and then edit the info plist which is like an asset list or information list

02:20.020 --> 02:25.150
for our iOS app containing some important information this app needs for running correctly.

02:25.300 --> 02:29.850
By the way, I use the first manual approach, you can use Cocoapods,

02:29.860 --> 02:32.050
I'm not going to dive into this here in this course,

02:32.140 --> 02:33.310
I'm not using them,

02:33.340 --> 02:38.550
I also found them to behave a bit buggy when using them with react native.

02:38.770 --> 02:44.180
So let's do these two steps now, for that'll first bring up the finder

02:44.350 --> 02:46.910
and in the finder, I'll go into node modules

02:46.960 --> 02:53.260
in my project folder, search for the package, react native vector icons and then just because we need

02:53.260 --> 03:00.430
to do it in this package, we are instructed to copy the fonts folder or just the one we want in your

03:00.430 --> 03:01.790
Xcode project,

03:01.870 --> 03:06.330
so I'm going to do this. I'm going to go into the fonts folder and I want to use the ionicons,

03:06.400 --> 03:12.560
so I'm going to drag the ionicons.ttf file into my project, just here at the top.

03:13.500 --> 03:20.070
And then here, make sure to check your project name under add to targets, if you copied the whole folder,

03:20.070 --> 03:22.770
make sure that you check create groups

03:22.770 --> 03:26.310
otherwise this setting here is correct.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.420
So click finish,

03:27.420 --> 03:34.300
now we edit this and now we need to add our info plist and that can all be found on the official documentation

03:34.440 --> 03:39.290
and there, you can simply right click on information property list,

03:39.450 --> 03:44.300
add a row and simply type fonts provided by application,

03:44.310 --> 03:46.060
it should auto complete,

03:46.170 --> 03:50.820
that's an array which you can expand and then simply add your font 

03:50.820 --> 03:53.370
you want to use, so the file name you just added,

03:53.400 --> 03:58.640
in my case it's ionicons.ttf and that's it.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.720
With that, you got your Xcode project prepared,

04:01.730 --> 04:04.520
you're now prepared to use these icons.

04:04.520 --> 04:04.960
Let me in the

04:04.970 --> 04:10.100
next lecture show you how you do the same for Android studio and for Android apps.
