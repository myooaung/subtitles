00:02.350 --> 00:08.960
Now here's a big picture of the steps you typically go through when you deploy your app.

00:09.010 --> 00:14.770
The first step is one you might already have finished that is that you should of course thoroughly test

00:14.770 --> 00:22.450
and polish your app and your code make sure that it works tested on different devices on real devices

00:22.450 --> 00:28.470
if possible tested on different device sizes different operating system versions.

00:28.630 --> 00:29.730
So all of that.

00:29.770 --> 00:34.630
That's something you should go through and make sure your app really works on all these devices and

00:34.630 --> 00:37.410
feels and looks the way it should look and feel.

00:37.450 --> 00:39.540
So that's really important.

00:39.550 --> 00:43.960
Now I assume that we did all of that for this module here.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.240
So the next step is that we configure the app and the deployment.

00:47.260 --> 00:53.290
That means that we set a name for the app an identifier which identifies that in the apps the words

00:53.350 --> 00:55.820
every app needs a unique identifier.

00:56.080 --> 01:02.140
Ends on in the Expo managed workflow does all the means that we can configure some additional nice features

01:02.140 --> 01:03.820
which I'll dive into.

01:03.940 --> 01:08.740
Now you obviously also want to add your own icons and a nice splash screen.

01:08.740 --> 01:12.490
So a loading screen before the app opens up to your app.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.690
Last but not least it's time to then build and deploy the app.

01:16.690 --> 01:22.030
Now these are actually two steps because building the app means that you now bundle up your app into

01:22.030 --> 01:30.280
a deployable app bundle and deploying then really means said you set up the store page in the Apple

01:30.280 --> 01:35.390
App Store or Google Play store and that you den gets your file into that store.

01:35.410 --> 01:36.900
That's the last step.

01:36.940 --> 01:41.410
And then of course it's all about tweaking that store page uploading some nice images there setting

01:41.410 --> 01:43.720
description texts and so on.

01:43.750 --> 01:49.630
So these are the steps you typically go through in this module we'll have a look at the deployment related

01:49.630 --> 01:55.420
steps that the configuration steps and I will show you how you can get your app onto the devices of

01:55.480 --> 01:57.560
our users.

01:57.630 --> 02:02.580
Of course there also is kind of a difference if we talk about Expo apps and non Expo apps if you want

02:02.580 --> 02:09.540
to call it like this with Expo apps I mean apps that use managed workflow which we used for this course

02:09.810 --> 02:16.140
and non Expo means spare app so we're using the bare workflow offered by X but we're not using exploit

02:16.170 --> 02:22.530
all created with the react made of Seelye in the managed approach you have the app Chase and followed

02:22.530 --> 02:29.340
you can use to configure your application assets like icons and splash screen are automatically created

02:29.340 --> 02:36.900
for you you just provide some some input assets there and then all the creation optimizations handled

02:36.900 --> 02:42.900
for you you have a command which you can run to publish your app and then commands to build for a different

02:43.470 --> 02:50.010
platform for the different operating systems and that build will happen on cloud servers provided by

02:50.010 --> 02:55.860
the expo team so you can even build for ISIS if you're running on Windows or Linux machine something

02:55.860 --> 03:01.830
you can not do if you have to build manually on your own then you can only build ISIS apps on a Mac

03:02.520 --> 03:07.920
and you even get a nice feature a nice extra feature which called over the air updates which allows

03:07.920 --> 03:15.330
you to push basic updates coach changes and so on to apps which are running on our devices over the

03:15.330 --> 03:23.040
air so over the Internet over expose servers without the need for those users to update your app physically

03:23.040 --> 03:28.350
so they don't have to install and you working from the App Store instead you can push such code changes

03:28.710 --> 03:35.010
behind the scenes you can live update these apps whilst they're running on our machines or on our devices

03:35.010 --> 03:36.690
which is pretty sweet.

03:36.690 --> 03:42.640
Now in non Expo apps you have to configure everything manually you have to set up the name identify

03:42.640 --> 03:47.770
trends on manually in different files you have to provide all the icons manually create them manually.

03:48.120 --> 03:54.330
So a lot of manual stuff involved there and you also have to orchestrate the entire build manually so

03:54.330 --> 04:00.780
you have to built the app wire Android Studio and X code and the deaths of course a lot of well simply

04:00.780 --> 04:07.350
manual work you have to do and you have no built in over the air updates there are other third party

04:07.350 --> 04:14.070
services you can use and therefore you can get that feature to work in this approach too but it's just

04:14.070 --> 04:19.520
not as easy as with the expo manager workflow that's just something to be aware of.

04:19.530 --> 04:24.270
So with that I want to start with the managed workflow and show you how you can publish and build your

04:24.270 --> 04:29.520
app there and there often I'll also briefly show you how it would work if you're not using Expo.
