00:02.230 --> 00:07.840
So we want to clear the share place page once we're done and navigate the user to find place once we're

00:07.840 --> 00:08.920
done.

00:08.950 --> 00:13.610
Now how can we do this? On the share place screen,

00:13.810 --> 00:20.550
we of course would need to reset our state here, the state of all these controls, reset the values, the validity,

00:20.560 --> 00:31.320
touched, all these things need to be reset. For that I'll add a new method which I'll just call reset and

00:31.330 --> 00:38.980
there, my goal is to simply call this set state and now I essentially want to reset my state to the original

00:38.980 --> 00:39.830
state here.

00:39.970 --> 00:46.780
Now the easiest way of course and it's appropriate here is to simply copy that whole controls object

00:46.780 --> 00:51.810
here and basically set the state like this, on the other hand,

00:51.820 --> 00:57.820
this means I can get rid of my initial state up here and we could also just call reset in componentWillMount

00:57.820 --> 01:03.640
for example, so we could add componentWillMount and then to make sure that our set is initialized

01:03.640 --> 01:04.160
correctly,

01:04.180 --> 01:08.650
we could call this reset here and this would set our state to this,

01:08.740 --> 01:13.450
it has the advantage that we now can also use reset when we really want to reset the page,

01:13.450 --> 01:15.810
so for not initializing as we do here

01:15.820 --> 01:23.680
but in any other place like for example here when we have the place added handler, after calling on add

01:23.680 --> 01:27.210
place we can call this reset.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.990
Now let's try this out

01:29.740 --> 01:33.090
and let me reload this app to fetch the latest version of the code 

01:33.330 --> 01:35.440
and now let's again pick an image here,

01:36.610 --> 01:37.660
this one maybe.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.340
Let's locate ourselves,

01:40.200 --> 01:43.550
try this resetting thing

01:44.540 --> 01:46.160
and share the place.

01:46.340 --> 01:54.510
And now you see, it kind of reset, it makes sure that the button is disabled and the place name was emptied

01:54.620 --> 02:01.700
but the image and the map wasn't reset and that makes sense because both are external components, pick

02:01.700 --> 02:03.100
image and pick location,

02:03.110 --> 02:07.580
the logic for these components isn't controlled by our state here,

02:07.640 --> 02:10.300
here we just use what these components give us

02:10.430 --> 02:16.730
and now we essentially made sure that what we have in share place is not in sync with our other components

02:16.730 --> 02:17.590
anymore.

02:17.810 --> 02:21.810
So we need to reset these two and there are a couple of approaches of doing that,

02:22.010 --> 02:28.790
one thing you can do is you can go into these components, like here pick image and we could add a reset

02:28.790 --> 02:29.670
method here

02:29.670 --> 02:33.050
too, and in this reset method here for pick image,

02:33.050 --> 02:39.530
I will simply call this set state and set picked image to null again.

02:39.950 --> 02:44.230
And I just noticed that there is a typo, it should be pick image not pick imaged,

02:44.450 --> 02:50.860
so we should probably replace this everywhere we're using it, pick image instead of pick imaged.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.860
So that was not the main thing though,

02:53.960 --> 02:57.870
fixing that type, we instead we now have this reset method here

02:58.160 --> 03:04.530
and I want to call reset from outside of course. Now we learned how to do that with the map view and

03:04.930 --> 03:08.450
can use the same approach on our custom components,

03:08.450 --> 03:13.660
we can make sure that we get access to our components through a ref,

03:13.820 --> 03:17.620
so here I can add this ref property,

03:17.810 --> 03:23.690
it takes an arrow function where we get a reference by react, so react creates that and then we can store

03:23.690 --> 03:30.320
this, this image picker equals ref. Let me bring this into a new line,

03:30.350 --> 03:33.560
now we can use this to reset the image.

03:33.560 --> 03:40.940
So now in our place added handler, I not only call reset in this component but I also call it on

03:40.940 --> 03:43.600
my image picker like this.

03:43.610 --> 03:47.020
Now if we save both files and we reload this app one more time,

03:47.030 --> 03:48.210
let's try it again.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.570
Let's again pick an image here,

03:50.930 --> 03:59.400
any image you like, locate yourself and enter some nice text, share the place and now you see the image

03:59.400 --> 04:01.660
is also reset up there.

04:01.670 --> 04:08.600
Now let's do the same for the location, there we can go to pick location and just as before,

04:08.660 --> 04:11.720
here I'll also add a reset method.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.180
So reset

04:13.880 --> 04:17.650
and the goal here is to reset our state back to this state of course,

04:17.750 --> 04:25.800
so here I will call this set state and I can just copy the entire state I have

04:25.810 --> 04:32.400
here, so focused location and location chosen, this of course means I can get rid of the state here

04:32.550 --> 04:33.830
and just as before,

04:33.930 --> 04:42.220
instead I could add componentWillMount and there, simply call this reset.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.880
Now we can also call reset from outside

04:47.930 --> 04:53.290
by again going back to share place and getting a reference to our own component,

04:53.300 --> 04:58.610
so getting a reference to pick location. With the same approach as before, using ref where we have

04:58.610 --> 05:05.000
an arrow function where we get the reference and then we create our own property in this class, the location

05:06.660 --> 05:11.470
picker and we assign this reference given to us by react to that property.

05:11.490 --> 05:17.270
So now we can use the location picker to call reset and I'll do this here in the place added handler,

05:17.570 --> 05:21.960
this location picker, let's call reset.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.060
Make sure to save all files again and let's it out one more time.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.390
I'll go to share places,

05:28.500 --> 05:30.180
pick an image,

05:30.360 --> 05:33.640
maybe this one here, locate ourselves,

05:34.980 --> 05:38.970
testing this again and now if I click share place here,

05:39.210 --> 05:44.490
you see the marker is gone and there, map therefore was also reset.

05:44.790 --> 05:50.790
Now we can of course try this again and use another image which still works,

05:50.850 --> 05:57.690
pick some place maybe manually and again, try that

05:57.940 --> 06:02.340
and now if we share the place, we should have shared this new place.

06:02.350 --> 06:06.940
One thing you might notice here though is that the map stays at the position where we navigate it to,

06:06.950 --> 06:13.680
now maybe you want this but maybe you don't want that, it's staying there because on this map

06:13.720 --> 06:17.240
and keep in mind, this component is not removed from the view,

06:17.470 --> 06:20.050
we have this initial region.

06:20.470 --> 06:27.090
So on pick location, there we have this initial region on the map view and this is really only set when this

06:27.090 --> 06:28.120
is first rendered

06:28.210 --> 06:33.070
and it's not re-rendered here, it's re-rendered but not for the first time here.

06:33.310 --> 06:37.710
So this doesn't change even if we update focused location.

06:37.720 --> 06:46.360
So what we could do here is we could also bind region to this state focused location and see if that fixes

06:46.360 --> 06:50.220
it to always center it to the latest picked location.

06:50.470 --> 06:51.650
Let's try this out,

06:51.820 --> 06:58.840
if I now manually click somewhere, it instantly jumps back to it, so our nice animation

06:58.870 --> 07:01.020
now is gone again due to this change,

07:01.030 --> 07:03.190
so this is not how we can do it.

07:03.190 --> 07:10.240
Instead what we should do is we should simply check if this state location chosen is not true because

07:10.240 --> 07:15.740
that means we haven't picked a place we don't want to animate, then we can set this location

07:15.910 --> 07:20.580
otherwise we set this to null and if we set this to null, it will basically be ignored.

07:20.590 --> 07:26.990
So now if we do that and we reload this page, if we go back and we click here, now you see the animation

07:26.990 --> 07:28.870
still works absolutely fine,

07:28.880 --> 07:34.650
also if I locate myself but if I now do submit everything, if I do create this new place,

07:38.200 --> 07:43.030
now you see it jumps back to the center and clears everything.

07:43.030 --> 07:48.280
Now we have an application that correctly resets this, we of course also want to make sure that the

07:48.280 --> 07:54.880
user is forwarded to the find place page. We'll do this or we'll implement this in the next lecture.
