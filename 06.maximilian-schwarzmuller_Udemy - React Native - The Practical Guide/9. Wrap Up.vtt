Over the last lectures, we added redux to react native app

00:06.060 --> 00:11.870
and as you saw, it's pretty much exactly the same as in a normal web driven react app.

00:12.090 --> 00:17.910
The only difference is here in the index.js file where you create your helper component essentially

00:18.150 --> 00:20.510
which you then mount into register component

00:20.640 --> 00:23.810
but let's be honest, that's not really difficult.

00:23.850 --> 00:31.950
So using redux in react, really simple, we'll revisit this later once we add a more elaborate navigation

00:31.950 --> 00:32.850
concept

00:33.090 --> 00:38.910
but this should already show you how easy it is to use redux here and that you really can work with

00:38.910 --> 00:42.730
the same tools you work with in web driven react apps.
