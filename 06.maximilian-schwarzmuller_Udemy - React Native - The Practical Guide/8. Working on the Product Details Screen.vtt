00:02.180 --> 00:07.440
On the product detailed screen we started working on that already but we're not really.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.240
Well outputting anything useful there.

00:10.250 --> 00:11.600
Now it's time to change this.

00:11.690 --> 00:17.570
For that I'll replace a j as X called recurrent using there with a scroll view because as I mentioned

00:17.570 --> 00:19.790
earlier will output our image there.

00:19.790 --> 00:23.510
Our product description and this could be a very long description or we're simply viewing this on a

00:23.510 --> 00:25.790
smaller device or in landscape mode.

00:25.850 --> 00:28.410
So we definitely want to have some scroll content there.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.020
And by the way we don't need flat list here because the content will not be infinitely long.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.420
We know pretty much that it will not be that long in advance.

00:36.440 --> 00:42.020
So scroll use perfectly fine and in that scroll you can now add an image component which outputs that

00:42.020 --> 00:50.210
product image at the top let's say and below that we can then maybe add our button to allow us to add

00:50.220 --> 01:01.560
to a cart and below that we can have our text like displaying the price and then maybe the text for

01:01.560 --> 01:04.260
the description so 40 image.

01:04.270 --> 01:08.980
We need to set up the source prop and that is an object which has a you or I property.

01:09.330 --> 01:14.530
And of course we have our select the product here so the source is just select the product dot image

01:14.620 --> 01:20.680
you are L because I'll select the product is of well the type we defined in our products model on the

01:20.680 --> 01:26.530
button here we can add a title of add to cart because that's the and what this button should do.

01:26.620 --> 01:32.970
And on press well does nothing for now but later will add this to cart then here.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.390
I want you out with the price.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.600
We don't need God but the title because that's already part of the header.

01:37.600 --> 01:43.630
So we see the title there but here I want you out with the price in dollars by referring to select the

01:43.630 --> 01:47.810
product a price to fixed to which I did before.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.410
And then down there all the descriptions.

01:50.410 --> 01:56.170
So here we have select a product dot description like this.

01:56.200 --> 01:56.560
OK.

01:56.590 --> 01:57.670
So that's looking good.

01:57.670 --> 01:59.380
Now it's time for some styling of course.

01:59.380 --> 02:04.270
For example for the image will definitely have to set a width and height because it's a network image.

02:04.270 --> 02:09.350
So here I'll add the image style which I have to add to my style sheet.

02:09.460 --> 02:15.040
Now for the texts here this textured of a style of price maybe which we have to add.

02:15.580 --> 02:24.490
And then this here this text should have a style of description maybe sounds like a fitting name.

02:24.490 --> 02:31.690
Now into style should we have to add all these things so let's start for the image.

02:31.980 --> 02:34.580
They're all add a width of 100 percent.

02:34.580 --> 02:38.730
This should really take the full available width and the height of three hundred maybe.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.570
And of course you can play around with that.

02:40.570 --> 02:46.810
You could also use a percentage value for dad or use the dimensions API to kind of calculate this dynamically

02:48.000 --> 02:52.970
there after I went to have my price.

02:53.080 --> 03:01.810
That price text should have a font size of 20 because people should of course be able to see it a colour

03:01.870 --> 03:09.670
of dad a grayish historic grayish colour I used early already and a text alignment off center so that

03:09.670 --> 03:11.780
it's always centered.

03:11.850 --> 03:20.640
Also a margin on the vertical axis of 20 maybe so around it of 20 and then they're offered the description

03:21.240 --> 03:30.660
description actually can have a fun size of let's say 14 let's see where that works and in there also

03:30.680 --> 03:38.810
use text align center something like that if we save that let's have a look at that doesn't look too

03:38.810 --> 03:47.420
bad now for the button I went to set a different colors I'll add colour here and set this to colors

03:47.450 --> 03:56.170
which we need to import of course from our constants folder colour start primary and now if we save

03:56.200 --> 04:03.500
this does looks quite nice on Android you see that the buttons it's directly below the image though

04:03.680 --> 04:06.300
and that it's a full with button.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.900
It's the same here for ISIS there.

04:07.910 --> 04:08.830
We just don't see it.

04:08.840 --> 04:13.940
But if I tap here you also see that this button gets pressed and that's actually not what I want here.

04:14.150 --> 04:14.590
So.

04:14.600 --> 04:23.310
Well do as all Raptors button in a view which I'll give a style of let's say actions.

04:23.310 --> 04:28.160
Even though it's only one action here you could maybe have multiple buttons here for different things.

04:28.350 --> 04:32.890
So I'll add my actions key here to the style sheet.

04:33.030 --> 04:40.530
And there we can set for one a margin on the vertical axis of 10 to top and bottom and align your items

04:41.930 --> 04:43.260
in the center.

04:43.430 --> 04:50.740
Which because the devil flex direction is column centers it horizontally and now we have more spacing

04:50.740 --> 04:53.750
here and we see this even better on Android more spacing.

04:53.780 --> 05:00.100
And but now does not stretch as it would be it's twofold a line item setting anymore but instead only

05:00.100 --> 05:05.230
takes as much with as it needs and is aligned in the center.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.310
So this is the setup.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.050
I'll go with.

05:07.070 --> 05:11.480
Of course you can still tweak this in different ways if you wish to.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.150
To me this doesn't look too bad.

05:13.160 --> 05:18.360
Let's all of you like a different item maybe also this one.

05:18.440 --> 05:18.670
Yeah.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.820
That's all looking quite nice.

05:20.870 --> 05:25.790
Now for a longer text here though you see that's not that beautiful there should be more spacing.

05:26.240 --> 05:34.700
So actually on the description of all to add a little margin horizontal all that say 20 so that we have

05:34.700 --> 05:42.600
spacing around this so that if we have another look at this you see now it is automatically jumps into

05:42.600 --> 05:43.890
a new line which it should.

05:44.970 --> 05:45.290
OK.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.290
So that's looking good.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.380
Now we have the broad act detail screen.

05:48.480 --> 05:53.970
Now before we continue I want to bring my own fonts and use those because I'm not happy with the default

05:53.970 --> 05:54.420
fonts.
