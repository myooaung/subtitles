00:02.160 --> 00:09.210
So I want to go to the map screen and I actually want to add a marker there right from the start which

00:09.210 --> 00:11.050
is also something it doesn't support right now.

00:11.100 --> 00:13.910
And that one to make sure that I can't pick a new location there.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.990
So a couple of restrictions.

00:15.990 --> 00:21.960
So when we click the map review on press I want to navigate to the different screen right.

00:22.020 --> 00:28.330
So I'll add a new constant here to hold a function which will name show map handler.

00:28.590 --> 00:33.300
Of course you could have also used to inline function and all connect the show map handler to my on

00:33.300 --> 00:35.340
press prop here on map preview.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.970
This will be triggered when we clicked the preview when we tap it.

00:39.130 --> 00:47.430
And of course I want to navigate of course that can be done with props navigation navigate and then

00:47.430 --> 00:49.200
go to the map screen.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.520
The problem just is if we do it like this.

00:51.520 --> 00:58.830
Unsurprisingly if we have a look at this on Android once this reloaded if I click on this I load the

00:58.830 --> 01:05.790
maps screen but I don't have the place I selected preselected and I can also click here and save and

01:05.790 --> 01:10.120
go back to my app place screen and that's definitely not how this should work.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.860
So that's wrong.

01:12.890 --> 01:19.640
Instead I want to pass some data to the map screen where I can for one set us to read only let's say

01:19.880 --> 01:23.140
so I'll pass a read only prop and set this to true.

01:23.450 --> 01:32.870
And I also want to set an initial location and set this to an object for example where I basically pass

01:32.870 --> 01:35.990
in while this location I also show on the preview.

01:35.990 --> 01:46.870
So this year I can cut it from there and create a new helper constant here select that location is no

01:46.870 --> 01:54.310
justice here and I pass this as an initial location here to select a location and I pass it to my map

01:54.310 --> 01:57.440
preview on the location prop.

01:57.510 --> 02:01.160
And with that we're passing the data to the map screen.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.430
We now need to use it there.

02:02.430 --> 02:08.940
So we need to use the read only prop or param to make sure we can select the new place and initial location

02:08.940 --> 02:11.670
to still have a marker in there right from the start.

02:12.620 --> 02:19.990
So now to use all that information here in the map screen I can get my data from the parents I received.

02:20.000 --> 02:30.380
So I get my initial location by accessing props navigation get param initial location which might be

02:30.380 --> 02:37.940
set of course this also might be undefined but it also might be set and I get to read only with props

02:37.970 --> 02:42.980
navigation gets param read only which also might be undefined.

02:43.150 --> 02:45.860
Now the initial location can be used to initialize the state.

02:45.860 --> 02:51.680
Now notice will not reinitiate ices whenever it is re renders but instead react manages to such that

02:51.680 --> 02:56.450
this sets the initial state and for subsequent re render cycles does is simply ignored you could say

02:57.650 --> 03:03.530
so now when we have an initial location our state will be initialized to that location which is great.

03:03.590 --> 03:09.290
Now keep in mind that what I passed the initial location is of type object with lat and long.

03:09.290 --> 03:13.510
And that of course should match what we manage with our state in here and that is the case because there

03:13.510 --> 03:18.950
I also set my state to an object with left and long if it would be different you would need some logic

03:18.950 --> 03:25.490
for normalizing this now read only the obvious thing I'm extracting and I can use this in a select location

03:25.490 --> 03:31.220
handler which is the function that triggers whenever we press the map and there we can check if read

03:31.340 --> 03:37.940
only is true and if it's undefined it will be false but if it's true I just return here which means

03:37.940 --> 03:44.090
I don't continue I don't pick a new location with dad picking a location should be disabled.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.900
Now I also want to get rid of the safe button if we have nothing to save.

03:47.900 --> 03:53.630
So if we're in read only mode and we can't save anything so how to write should only be set.

03:53.780 --> 03:58.790
If we're not and read only mode so here I'll also extract read only mode with the help of navigation.

03:58.790 --> 04:02.200
Get param read only which I can do here as well of course.

04:02.600 --> 04:09.230
And therefore now here if we're in read only mode if Data's true then the configuration I return is

04:09.230 --> 04:10.550
an empty object.

04:10.550 --> 04:14.240
So without any button let's give this a try.

04:14.300 --> 04:22.550
Let's save it and go back and if I now click on this item here and I click on the map it opens but I

04:22.550 --> 04:28.430
got no safe button and also no marker so that doesn't work but at least I can't select a new one that's

04:28.430 --> 04:32.030
good but the marker is also not working now before we fix this.

04:32.030 --> 04:37.540
Let's go to the new place screen and see if we dare can still set a marker and that is the case.

04:37.550 --> 04:40.700
We can pick a place where the dad works.

04:40.700 --> 04:48.640
So the only thing that doesn't really work is loading this map with a marker chosen and actually that's

04:48.640 --> 04:49.360
not correct.

04:49.360 --> 04:57.600
We do have a marker just not here on the screen we preselected in San Francisco if we go to the Google

04:57.600 --> 04:58.260
plex

05:01.440 --> 05:02.750
down there.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.160
Here is the marker so it did save this.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.880
It just didn't focus on that when we loaded it.

05:09.300 --> 05:13.970
So that's a little tweak we should also add on the map screen there.

05:14.190 --> 05:22.240
We should make sure that this map reach and we set here also takes the initial location into account.

05:22.240 --> 05:26.590
If we have one so here the latitude we set initially.

05:26.620 --> 05:32.770
Well if we do have an initial location then I want to use initial location dot let instead of the default

05:32.920 --> 05:36.550
only use the default otherwise same of course for the long etude.

05:36.550 --> 05:42.010
If we have an initial location I want to use the long etude of that initially instead of the default

05:44.060 --> 05:50.390
now is that if we saved as we should be able to have a map which is automatically centered on our marker.

05:50.390 --> 05:54.050
If we open it in the read only mode so here.

05:54.470 --> 05:55.960
Indeed that works.

05:56.180 --> 06:01.840
And if I of course add a new place that also still works there we open it on the on the default place.

06:01.850 --> 06:08.840
So somewhere here in San Francisco this state for all works.

06:08.870 --> 06:13.190
And now I just want to test it on some real devices before I wrap up this module.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.240
And we're done with adding native device features to our ReACT native app.
