How does sending http requests in the react native apps work?

00:06.960 --> 00:08.890
Well we get our react native app

00:09.030 --> 00:13.940
and we got a server where we want to store our data, on that server,

00:13.950 --> 00:22.830
we have some database and we have some endpoints, some urls we can connect to because clearly

00:22.890 --> 00:27.470
our react native app isn't html rendered by the server,

00:27.630 --> 00:35.880
the server is a standalone thing just exposing some gates you could say, some entry points, so-called

00:35.970 --> 00:42.870
API endpoints to which we can send requests with specific payloads which then get processed on a server

00:42.870 --> 00:46.790
which then may get stored on the database or fetched from the database

00:47.070 --> 00:48.660
and where we then communicate,

00:48.690 --> 00:50.100
so that is how it works.

00:50.220 --> 00:56.130
We send a request from the react native app to the server and we'll eventually get a response which

00:56.130 --> 00:58.400
typically contains json data.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.120
This simply is the data we want

01:00.120 --> 01:06.370
like for example, the location of a place, a link to the image we want to display, something like this.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.830
And that is it,

01:07.920 --> 01:11.200
it's just that easy, it's a restful server,

01:11.280 --> 01:15.280
it's not a server rendering any views or html,

01:15.360 --> 01:19.710
it's just providing some endpoints to which we can connect. Now to connect,

01:19.710 --> 01:23.230
we need a fitting client on our react native app

01:23.400 --> 01:26.820
and this is what we'll also have a look at in this module of course.
