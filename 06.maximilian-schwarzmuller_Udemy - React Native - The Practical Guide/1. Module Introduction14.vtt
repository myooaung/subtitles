WEBVTT

00:02.890 --> 00:10.820
Welcome to this module. In this module, we'll cover a core concept of any native app you can build, navigation.

00:11.020 --> 00:13.160
So how to get from A to B

00:13.330 --> 00:18.820
because as you might be able to guess, it's quite different to a web app where you have urls

00:18.850 --> 00:22.840
and where you use the react router to parse the url,

00:22.870 --> 00:25.900
that's not how people navigate in mobile apps.

00:25.900 --> 00:33.310
Therefore in this module, we'll have a look at what's special about navigation in native apps, which navigation

00:33.310 --> 00:40.490
solutions we may have a look at, how we can implement stack based tab based navigation and side drawers

00:40.510 --> 00:46.210
and what all these things are and how we can of course also pass data around between all these different

00:46.210 --> 00:48.080
pages we can load in our app.

00:48.340 --> 00:53.080
And finally of course, we'll also have a look at how we can add redux to all of that because we will

00:53.080 --> 00:57.790
have to apply some changes but we'll still be able to use redux,

00:57.790 --> 00:58.610
no worries.

00:58.810 --> 01:04.890
So with that, let's dive into it and let's find out what's different if we compare it to a web app.
