Before we dive into styling, which styles we can use and some patterns we use when applying styles to

00:09.140 --> 00:10.110
objects,

00:10.430 --> 00:18.290
here's one thing you might have ask yourself, why do we use stylesheet to create this styles object

00:18.730 --> 00:21.240
and no normal javascript object.

00:21.470 --> 00:26.270
So why do we use this approach and not this approach?

00:26.270 --> 00:32.480
Technically, they both give us a javascript object where we can reference some property container in

00:32.480 --> 00:36.080
this case and then get the styles we set up here,

00:36.140 --> 00:40.250
so why would we use the left approach if we end up with the same result?

00:40.700 --> 00:42.970
Well it only looks like the same result,

00:43.040 --> 00:45.090
technically, different things happen.

00:45.320 --> 00:52.490
We should use stylesheet create whenever possible for creating style definitions because it doesn't

00:52.490 --> 00:54.720
just create a javascript object,

00:54.860 --> 00:56.810
it also validates the styles,

00:56.840 --> 00:58.430
so can we use them,

00:58.430 --> 01:04.980
did we set up valid styles in there and it also sends them to native code more efficiently.

01:04.970 --> 01:11.330
Now that certainly sounds strange but always keep in mind that your code in the end is compiled to native

01:11.330 --> 01:18.170
code, your components are compiled to native code and therefore your styles which are crucial parts of

01:18.170 --> 01:24.200
the components you are using also need to be compiled to native code and that is done more efficiently

01:24.260 --> 01:26.400
when using stylesheet create.

01:26.510 --> 01:33.920
You can use the other approach and in this module, I will actually show some examples of when we just can't

01:33.920 --> 01:35.670
use stylesheet create

01:35.840 --> 01:41.630
but if you can, define your styles with stylesheet create.

01:41.810 --> 01:49.760
So that's what's behind stylesheet, with that why don't we just dive into it and start styling our application

01:49.760 --> 01:52.610
and seeing how we style and which styles we can use

01:52.610 --> 01:53.620
and all these things.
