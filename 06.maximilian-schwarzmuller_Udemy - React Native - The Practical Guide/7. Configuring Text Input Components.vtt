00:02.410 --> 00:04.650
We added a lot of functionality to our form

00:04.660 --> 00:08.450
but there are still some things missing or not as good as they should be,

00:08.470 --> 00:15.970
for example the keyboard. We can also turn on the soft keyboard here on iOS by going to hardware

00:16.060 --> 00:20.140
keyboard and then uncheck connect hardware keyboard,

00:20.140 --> 00:22.820
Now you have to use the soft one which is now coming in.

00:23.140 --> 00:27.680
And one thing we notice is that this form doesn't really scroll up here

00:27.790 --> 00:34.600
if we start working on that which makes it really hard to get to the well input below that, we essentially

00:34.600 --> 00:36.920
have to press return to get there,

00:37.030 --> 00:39.690
also dismissing the keyboard is not that great,

00:39.700 --> 00:45.790
we have to press return which is ok but it would also be nice if we could tap somewhere else. And we see

00:45.790 --> 00:51.040
the keyboard is wrong, here for email it would be better if we had the @ sign on the first page of the

00:51.040 --> 00:54.430
keyboard and not somewhere on the second page.

00:54.430 --> 00:58.160
Additionally if we start typing, it starts with an uppercase character,

00:58.180 --> 01:02.650
so it would be great if we could change this too. A lot of things we can change,

01:02.650 --> 01:08.640
so a lot of things we thankfully can configure on the text input which we in the end are just wrapping

01:08.650 --> 01:09.910
with default input

01:10.030 --> 01:16.090
and since we pass on props, we can use any props text input accepts. If we go to the official documentation,

01:16.090 --> 01:21.880
you scroll down to the components docs, there if you have a look at text input, you'll see there are

01:21.880 --> 01:28.240
quite a lot of things you can configure, for example auto-capitalize which also sounds useful for not starting

01:28.240 --> 01:32.660
with the big, with the capitalized first character, autocorrect,

01:32.680 --> 01:35.550
also always annoying on email addresses

01:35.630 --> 01:42.430
and we also have the keyboard type which allows us to define which kind of keyboard we're seeing.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.600
You get a lot of different keyboards, though

01:45.610 --> 01:52.340
only the bottom four here work crossplatform but there is an e-mail address keyboard which is great.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.590
We also have another useful thing here,

01:56.800 --> 01:59.740
if you scroll further down,

01:59.740 --> 02:06.580
you can add secure text entry to hide the password, something we're also not doing right now. So let's

02:06.580 --> 02:13.470
add all these useful things in the auth screen now, there I'll start with the e-mail input

02:13.690 --> 02:24.360
and first of all, I'll add autocapitalize and set it to false, I'll also add autocorrect and set it to

02:24.360 --> 02:32.450
false so that I take advantage of these two properties I just mentioned, autocapitalize and autocorrect to

02:32.460 --> 02:34.160
not get this annoying behavior.

02:34.950 --> 02:37.610
I'll also set the keyboard type,

02:40.080 --> 02:48.780
keyboard type and there, if I scroll back one more time, you see keyboard type.

02:49.090 --> 02:52.790
I want to use e-mail address which has a dash between email and address,

02:52.870 --> 03:01.060
so I'm just assigning this as a string, e-mail address and that is actually it. Now I'll move on to the

03:01.060 --> 03:04.210
next input which is my password input, there

03:04.210 --> 03:07.350
I don't care about the keyboard type,

03:07.360 --> 03:08.690
I want to use the default one,

03:08.710 --> 03:13.930
I don't care about autocorrections on because I can get a nice behaviour anyways by setting it to

03:13.930 --> 03:15.470
secure input,

03:15.460 --> 03:19.930
so basically what we had down there, secure text entry,

03:19.930 --> 03:21.050
this is what I want to add.

03:21.220 --> 03:26.140
And if I just add it like this, I don't need to assign a value because it's a boolean, if I add it like this, it will

03:26.140 --> 03:30.880
be treated as true, the same should be done on the confirm password field of course.

03:30.880 --> 03:36.220
So there in the render function where we set up the confirm password input,

03:36.240 --> 03:39.030
I'll also set this to secure text entry.

03:39.310 --> 03:43.230
Let's reload everything and see how this behaves,

03:43.350 --> 03:47.940
I'll quickly connect my hardware keyboard again so that I can use the reload shortcut and so on.

03:47.950 --> 03:49.280
Now there is a mistake here,

03:49.290 --> 03:53.390
auto-capitalize, tiny mistake shouldn't be true or false,

03:53.440 --> 03:58.140
this actually is just a string, it

04:01.660 --> 04:03.010
should be set to none.

04:06.040 --> 04:14.050
Now with that, here if I start typing, it stays lowercase, it starts lowercase and you see the password

04:14.050 --> 04:15.730
now is also hidden.

04:15.730 --> 04:22.930
Now if I unconnect my hardware keyboard, you see now I'm also getting the @ sign on the first

04:22.930 --> 04:23.620
page here,

04:23.650 --> 04:28.610
so now we really got an e-mail friendly input. For the other input it's the normal one.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.960
So we're taking advantage of this,

04:31.010 --> 04:32.830
this is the first important thing.

04:32.830 --> 04:38.340
Now let me also show how to handle this soft keyboard in the next lecture.
