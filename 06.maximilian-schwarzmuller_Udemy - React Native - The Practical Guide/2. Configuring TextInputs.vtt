WEBVTT

00:02.260 --> 00:07.540
So for dead as mentioned I'm back in the project we worked on and of course now the edited product screen

00:07.540 --> 00:09.640
here is what I'm interested in.

00:09.640 --> 00:16.060
This is the screen where I have these text inputs here with my labels and then the text input where

00:16.060 --> 00:19.540
we currently have a very basic input handling.

00:19.540 --> 00:25.390
We are at least fetching the user input and storing it with the help of you react state with the use

00:25.450 --> 00:26.460
state hook.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.200
We're then feeding the android values back into the input and that's it.

00:30.310 --> 00:37.210
This allows us to capture and use the user input but for one we can improve how we do that we can write

00:37.210 --> 00:42.730
does it no more reusable way and we're not doing any validation whatsoever.

00:42.760 --> 00:46.510
So these are the things I want to change in this module.

00:46.530 --> 00:50.850
In addition we also are not configuring our inputs in any way.

00:50.940 --> 00:53.850
That means that right now all text inputs are equal.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.140
We don't want to change the type of keyboard we're presenting.

00:57.270 --> 01:02.910
We're not offering multi line input for example for longer texts like here for the description.

01:02.910 --> 01:08.370
None of that is happening and therefore let's actually start with configuring these inputs before we

01:08.370 --> 01:15.120
move on to validations on one important configuration which you can add to your keyboards is the keyboard

01:15.180 --> 01:21.420
type the keyboard type prop can be set and there you've got a couple of values available now you've

01:21.420 --> 01:26.970
got quite a bit of value is here but you official box are also plays which you should consult when thinking

01:26.970 --> 01:33.230
about the type you want to sign here because when you it the official text input documentation you of

01:33.230 --> 01:38.270
course see some examples but then you also see all the props you have and there you can learn more about

01:38.270 --> 01:41.450
each prop and how you may configured and for the keyboard type.

01:41.450 --> 01:46.010
For example we learned that only these types are supported cross platform.

01:46.160 --> 01:52.080
So whilst we have specific Iaw and Android types of way lable these types can only be used together

01:52.130 --> 01:53.750
with a platform check.

01:53.750 --> 01:58.310
So did you make sure you don't use the type on Android which isn't supported there and which therefore

01:58.310 --> 01:59.560
wouldn't have any effect.

02:00.230 --> 02:06.430
Hence I will stick to the cross platform types so that I don't have to add extra platform check in there.

02:06.440 --> 02:11.600
Typically for let's say normal text we would stick to default which of course therefore is a type we

02:11.600 --> 02:18.110
don't have to assign but that for example changes when we have a look at our price input there I want

02:18.110 --> 02:24.860
to make sure that people only enter valid numbers that they don't enter any text and therefore of course

02:24.860 --> 02:27.850
I want to show the right keyboard to help them with this.

02:28.130 --> 02:33.170
And if we have a look at the official documentation we see that there are three main cross platform

02:33.350 --> 02:40.460
types of keyboards we can show no pat decimal pattern numeric and there for example decimal pad as an

02:40.460 --> 02:46.250
input which allow us to user to enter decimal numbers which is just what I want here for my price so

02:46.250 --> 02:50.660
therefore setting this keyboard to type here makes a lot of sense because now if we have a look at this

02:51.080 --> 02:58.460
price input here and I toggle the soft keyboard which you can do with the command K shortcut here on

02:58.520 --> 03:07.340
ISIS or with the hardware menu up there then keyboard toggles software keyboard you see that.

03:07.340 --> 03:12.860
Now I got this decimal keyboard opening up here whereas on the other inputs I have a normal text keyboard

03:13.220 --> 03:14.750
and of course that's the same on Android.

03:14.750 --> 03:20.590
If we go to admin there and then have a look at the price we also see that there were presented with

03:20.590 --> 03:26.200
this no friendly input instead of the normal text keyboard which we get on the operating input fields.

03:26.480 --> 03:33.840
So this is how we can configure decent is of course an important configuration we can all configure

03:34.010 --> 03:38.840
of things for example here on the title input here.

03:39.060 --> 03:43.950
If you hit control space and you have a look at the autocomplete you see there are a bunch of things

03:43.950 --> 03:49.560
you can configure for example whether this should be auto capitalized dear you have different values

03:49.560 --> 03:55.590
which you can set for example that character should be capitalized only full sentences or words and

03:55.590 --> 04:01.020
here all go for full sentences for example to help with capitalizing those.

04:01.140 --> 04:07.350
You also can turn on auto correction and by adding it like this you ensured that auto correction is

04:07.350 --> 04:12.540
turned on for does it input by setting it to fall as you could disable it or by just omitting it of

04:12.540 --> 04:18.120
course that's also an option and zone there are a bunch of things you can configure and I would strongly

04:18.120 --> 04:23.730
recommend as always that you have a look at the official docs as well to learn about the way label configuration

04:23.790 --> 04:25.930
options and what they do.

04:25.980 --> 04:32.400
Also simply play around with those so that you get an idea for what you can do there and what each option

04:32.400 --> 04:40.090
does and well what might make sense for your next application one other value which one is that for

04:40.090 --> 04:42.580
example is to return key type.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.920
This can be set to a couple of values.

04:44.980 --> 04:50.350
And again if you check your official box you will learn that not all values are available on all platforms

04:50.440 --> 04:56.260
only these five are available cross platform and there you can basically configure this button in the

04:56.260 --> 05:00.130
bottom right corner if you have a look at your input here

05:06.070 --> 05:12.090
and you click into any of the inputs it's this button here in the bottom right corner which says return

05:12.090 --> 05:15.950
here for the image you are L now on the title I set it next.

05:15.960 --> 05:21.870
So if you click into the title field you now see here it says whiter which is German for next and this

05:21.870 --> 05:27.770
is just because I'm a German emulator here and let me also restart this on Android because it crashed

05:27.770 --> 05:29.660
there so that I can show it there as well.

05:30.730 --> 05:36.280
If we go to our input there click onto the title you see this next button here on the image your l You

05:36.280 --> 05:41.080
have just done button here and that can be configured with the return key type though.

05:41.080 --> 05:47.020
Please be aware that this only controls how it is this displayed what it says Dear what's the label

05:47.020 --> 05:49.150
on there or which kind of buttons percent.

05:49.300 --> 05:55.150
It does not automatically change what this button does for example fit like the white or button this

05:55.150 --> 05:56.200
keyboard closes.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.990
The same is true for click the return key here.

06:00.150 --> 06:05.040
And when we talk about behaviors of text inputs then all the events we can listen to our interesting

06:05.340 --> 06:09.190
with on you get an idea of all the events you can listen to.

06:09.210 --> 06:15.350
For example there you got on blur which fires whenever I input it loses focus on change would fires

06:15.420 --> 06:21.090
on every keystroke and gives you the full input event on change text which also fires on every keystroke

06:21.150 --> 06:25.230
but only gives you the text which was entered which typically is what you're more interested in though

06:25.980 --> 06:35.000
on end editing where we can also get an idea for when this fire is so by enter on end editing here let's

06:35.010 --> 06:37.440
see when this prints in the console.

06:37.440 --> 06:46.710
If I now go here to my input and please note I'm on the Tidal input so if I type data test we see didn't

06:46.710 --> 06:49.350
fire here the click out of this.

06:49.350 --> 06:54.930
Now it fired on end editing The same is true for click the wider button here for example.

06:54.930 --> 07:01.920
So basically whenever we leave this keyboard with the focus or in general when we click that's done

07:01.920 --> 07:03.890
button there as well.

07:03.960 --> 07:10.620
In addition we also have other listeners for like on focus which obviously fires when this input gains

07:10.620 --> 07:19.640
focus or also on selection change when we select text and there or on submit editing which is fired

07:19.640 --> 07:21.860
wind does return button is clicked.

07:21.860 --> 07:30.820
So if I add ons up Mitt editing here when I add this listener as well and all that a consular statement

07:30.820 --> 07:31.390
you see that.

07:31.390 --> 07:37.820
Now this will fire whenever I type in here does not fire whenever I click out of here.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.130
It also doesn't fire.

07:39.130 --> 07:45.600
We only got to get the on end editing log here but it will fire if I pressed the wider key here.

07:45.610 --> 07:47.290
There you see on submit editing.

07:47.290 --> 07:52.870
So this is a listener you would use to listen to when the return key is clicked and then you can do

07:52.870 --> 07:59.230
whatever you want to do like submit your data or automatically move the focus to the next input with

07:59.230 --> 08:03.090
the help of references for example if you want to.

08:03.200 --> 08:08.240
This is how you can configure this and as I said I would recommend that you dive into this to get a

08:08.240 --> 08:10.370
feeling for how it is works.

08:10.400 --> 08:16.160
I now will move one or whoever and I want to make sure that we don't just listen to inputs and stored

08:16.160 --> 08:19.460
the values but that we also validate what the user enters.
