00:02.210 --> 00:05.510
So I want to start by adding some maps to our project.

00:05.660 --> 00:12.090
As I mentioned in the last lecture, Maps, Google Maps, Apple maps aren't built into react native but there's

00:12.110 --> 00:19.070
a great third party library by AirBnB which you might know that they probably need some maps and

00:19.070 --> 00:22.030
their app which by the way is built with react native,

00:22.310 --> 00:26.240
so there is this library from AirBnB which is called react native maps.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.460
Now if you open this on github,

00:28.580 --> 00:31.500
you can simply search for it and then open the github repository,

00:31.730 --> 00:34.580
then you will find detailed instructions on how to use it,

00:34.610 --> 00:41.060
you'll find installation instructions, set up instructions and an example project, the full API, you can do a

00:41.060 --> 00:47.870
lot with this package and I can only encourage you to dive into that to really get the features you

00:47.870 --> 00:48.830
need.

00:48.830 --> 00:53.360
I will show you how to include it and how to use some of the features but obviously, I won't go through

00:53.360 --> 00:54.890
the entire set of features

00:54.890 --> 00:56.750
you have here but be aware

00:56.750 --> 01:01.400
you can also see some nice gifs here that you can do a lot with this package.

01:01.580 --> 01:05.590
The most important for us of course right now is how we can install it.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.850
So for that, let's click on the installation instructions to see how that works

01:10.880 --> 01:14.280
and you see first of all, we obviously install it through npm,

01:14.630 --> 01:21.090
then here this is some automatic linking process which I described earlier in an article in this course,

01:21.260 --> 01:25.420
I will do the manual connection though, so I will show you how this works.

01:25.490 --> 01:32.030
And then finally at the end, once we got everything installed, we can thereafter dive into the various

01:32.720 --> 01:33.960
features we want to use.

01:34.130 --> 01:36.350
So first of all let's install it though,

01:36.590 --> 01:44.950
for that I'll go back to our project and run npm install --save react-native-maps,

01:44.950 --> 01:52.420
that's the name of the library. That will download it and add it to node modules as always and thereafter,

01:52.460 --> 01:55.660
we obviously need to connect it to both Android and iOS

01:55.670 --> 02:04.130
and you can find the manual installation steps here under iOS, there if you scroll down to option 3,

02:04.190 --> 02:04.870
manually,

02:04.910 --> 02:06.790
that's what I'm going to do here.

02:07.770 --> 02:10.430
Let's first of all add it to iOS,

02:10.450 --> 02:14.190
so I'm in Xcode and there you know the procedure in general,

02:14.190 --> 02:21.480
you click on libraries, right click, add files to our in-course or to your project name, go to node modules,

02:21.960 --> 02:29.910
search for the react native maps package there and in there, you should find the Xcode project, to

02:29.910 --> 02:34.810
be precise in this package you will find it in the lib folder in react native maps,

02:34.830 --> 02:39.340
there's the iOS folder, here's the Xcode project which you should add.

02:39.750 --> 02:44.190
So next step click on your project name, click on build faces,

02:44.250 --> 02:51.240
click on link binary with libraries on the plus at the end of the list and there, search for maps and

02:51.240 --> 02:54.760
you should find lib air maps, click add now.

02:55.240 --> 02:59.390
Now if you have a look at the official description, that were the steps 1 and 2,

02:59.590 --> 03:06.270
now in the third step, we should then click on this included air maps Xcode project file and go to build

03:06.270 --> 03:14.520
settings and double click the text to the right of header search paths there and verify that it is this as well

03:14.610 --> 03:16.510
as this path.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.330
So let's see if that's the case,

03:18.390 --> 03:25.040
let's go back and let's click on air maps Xcode project here on the left, build faces, build settings,

03:25.110 --> 03:33.730
excuse me, there you may filter for header search paths and now if you double click on that,

03:33.920 --> 03:39.430
you'll see two paths here, react native react and react native libraries image,

03:40.010 --> 03:42.520
these are the paths which are mentioned here,

03:42.560 --> 03:44.260
so that should be all right.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.330
So we don't need to do anything here in step three

03:49.440 --> 03:51.590
and with that, we're done.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.950
So that was it for iOS,

03:53.970 --> 03:56.660
let's now do the same for Android.

03:56.660 --> 04:03.900
For this the first step is in the Android app, I build gradle file, that we do add this line here to

04:03.900 --> 04:04.850
dependencies,

04:04.860 --> 04:10.570
so let's go to the Android folder, there under app in the build gradle file,

04:10.590 --> 04:15.660
make sure to pick the one in the app folder not the one in the Android folder, there under dependencies

04:15.930 --> 04:20.430
just add compile project react native maps,

04:20.430 --> 04:21.870
that's the first step.

04:22.230 --> 04:26.840
The second step is here, the play services which you need,

04:26.910 --> 04:33.390
now this is actually something we will have to add here to have it work correctly, to add Google Play

04:33.390 --> 04:34.500
services,

04:34.530 --> 04:37.070
so let's instead grab this code here

04:38.110 --> 04:41.180
and replace the line we just added with that.

04:41.260 --> 04:46.120
So now the compilation is a bit more complex because it basically will pull in the Google Play services

04:46.300 --> 04:52.390
which are needed to use Google Maps in Android, especially use this if you didn't use it before, so

04:52.390 --> 04:57.820
if you went with this approach and then got some errors regarding Google Play services, well you probably

04:57.820 --> 04:58.630
want to use that

04:58.660 --> 05:04.730
then. Next step is in android settings gradle, we should include these two lines,

05:04.750 --> 05:06.460
so let's copy them here

05:06.670 --> 05:08.990
and let's go to Android

05:10.050 --> 05:13.860
settings gradle and there, simply at the end of the file,

05:13.860 --> 05:18.060
let's add these two lines and you see the pattern with all the other libraries,

05:18.060 --> 05:21.130
we use the same approach there.

05:21.190 --> 05:27.660
And now to use Google Maps on Android which it of course will use, you need a Google Maps API key.

05:27.670 --> 05:32.110
Now you can click this link if you already have a Google Maps project for which you want to add the

05:32.500 --> 05:34.310
credentials for this key,

05:34.330 --> 05:40.030
you can also search for Google Maps API key and you should find this page on the Google documentation

05:40.420 --> 05:46.130
and there you can click the get a key button here where you now need to select or create a project.

05:46.300 --> 05:53.590
I will pick create a new project and name it rn-course, you can of course pick any name you want or

05:53.590 --> 05:57.050
let's name it awesome-places, I'll name it like this.

05:57.610 --> 06:01.800
Create an enable API and now this may take a second

06:02.230 --> 06:08.760
but once it's done, you will actually have an API key you can use just like that in your project.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.650
So now you can just copy that key here,

06:12.650 --> 06:15.590
clicking this button here for example and that is it,

06:15.590 --> 06:20.050
now leave that open in case I kind of need to use it later again

06:21.120 --> 06:28.230
but with that, we can proceed with the next step where we need this code here and need to add it to our

06:28.230 --> 06:35.130
Android apps source main Android manifest xml file. This file is kind of setting up the configuration

06:35.280 --> 06:37.120
for our project,

06:37.170 --> 06:43.380
so in there, you see we add this in the application part and actually we don't copy the full application tag

06:43.380 --> 06:44.010
here,

06:44.130 --> 06:46.280
we only need to add this meta tag here,

06:46.290 --> 06:47.800
this metadata tag.

06:48.030 --> 06:55.200
So in the existing application tag, don't overwrite this, instead next to the activity, either at the start

06:55.200 --> 06:56.280
or maybe at the end,

06:56.310 --> 06:59.000
so not inside an activity but next to it,

06:59.040 --> 07:02.160
add your metadata here. There,

07:02.220 --> 07:04.900
the name stays as it is,

07:04.980 --> 07:09.920
so we're basically setting up some information for the API key for Geo

07:10.140 --> 07:13.800
but then here, you paste in the API key you just got.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.520
So here I just did this, this is my API key which I now added.

07:22.580 --> 07:27.890
Now one last step we need to do on Android is we need to go to the Java folder in app source main Java

07:28.550 --> 07:31.730
main application and there,

07:31.730 --> 07:46.640
first of all we need to add an import, it's import com.airbnb.android.react.maps.mapsPackage,

07:49.380 --> 07:59.540
like this and then if you go down to this list function, the get packages function

07:59.540 --> 08:05.370
I mean, there you need to add a comma after new vectors package and then you add new maps package.

08:05.630 --> 08:08.410
And with that, save it, save all the other files too,

08:08.420 --> 08:15.060
you're done with the set up for Android. And with that added, make sure that you have Google Play services

08:15.070 --> 08:15.950
installed,

08:16.160 --> 08:19.900
now on your physical device you see how that is done

08:20.070 --> 08:24.640
and if you're using a simulator created through the AVD in Android studio,

08:24.690 --> 08:28.670
you should have these services installed on the device.

08:28.860 --> 08:32.840
With that we got it installed, we got react native maps installed,

08:32.850 --> 08:35.270
this was almost the hardest part,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.270
let's now dive into the other docs here by

08:38.470 --> 08:44.730
clicking on docs and see how else we can use this or I guess we don't even need the v-docs,

08:44.730 --> 08:46.580
that's why you were viewing this course.

08:46.620 --> 08:51.190
So let's dive into how we use react native maps in our react native project.
