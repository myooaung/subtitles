00:02.660 --> 00:08.660
So how can we get information about the category we clicked on we selected from this category screen

00:08.660 --> 00:15.240
to the category meals screen while on the categories screen where we navigate to category meals.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.870
For it is navigation action.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.930
Besides the rude name we can also pass the parents.

00:21.950 --> 00:29.510
That's another key does optic you past navigate accepts and this takes itself the object of key value

00:29.510 --> 00:35.060
pairs of any key value pairs and as many key value pairs as you want.

00:35.060 --> 00:40.980
So these are simply parameters extra data you're passing to the new screen which is being loaded.

00:41.330 --> 00:46.760
Now they are you could set up a parameter named category I.D. and the name is only a few that could

00:46.760 --> 00:47.880
be just I.D..

00:47.930 --> 00:54.590
See I.D. or my hobby whatever your building and whatever data you need to forward here we're forwarding

00:54.590 --> 00:57.640
a category idea hence I will name it such.

00:57.650 --> 01:01.410
This now should be in our scenario here of course.

01:01.410 --> 01:03.980
The idea of the category we tapped on.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.650
Now of course we're getting our item data here for each grid item which is rendered.

01:07.670 --> 01:12.480
This holds the item and this has a title a color and well an I.D..

01:12.650 --> 01:16.780
So the category idea is item data dot item dot I.D..

01:17.180 --> 01:23.430
Now we're forwarding that I.D. to the new screen which is being loaded.

01:23.630 --> 01:26.210
That of course is important thing here.

01:26.210 --> 01:34.620
This allows us to then use that data in that new screen how well let's go there.

01:34.650 --> 01:39.550
Let's go to the category meals screen and see how we can extract that parameter.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.400
We know that we'll get one.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.990
How can we now get access to it.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.740
For this we can again use props navigation.

01:46.740 --> 01:52.350
So this special Prop. getting because this component here is getting loaded with the help of a react

01:52.350 --> 01:58.860
navigation navigator and on navigation we don't just have navigate and portions on.

01:58.860 --> 02:07.410
We also have get Perrin a method provided to extract a parameter we receive get param takes a string

02:07.410 --> 02:12.450
with the name of the parameter we want to extract and of course that should be the name you chose here

02:12.840 --> 02:15.590
as a key in that parents object.

02:15.600 --> 02:21.330
So here I added category I.D. hence that's the name I want to use here.

02:21.330 --> 02:29.160
This will give me the cat idea that category I.D. This will give me the value we're storing here on

02:29.160 --> 02:30.350
that key name in this case.

02:30.360 --> 02:30.960
That's the idea.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.700
So that's devalue.

02:32.700 --> 02:36.360
We're extracting for category Eddie in the category meals screen.

02:36.360 --> 02:44.100
So now we have the cat idea and we can now use that to of course get access to all the meals that fit

02:44.100 --> 02:45.120
into this category.

02:45.120 --> 02:51.360
Right now we have no meals so we'll have to postpone this but at least we can also use this to get our

02:51.360 --> 02:58.920
category title and use that here and for that all we need to do of course is we need to import categories

02:58.920 --> 03:08.220
or categories array here from data dummy data and we have to I.D. We have an array of categories of

03:08.220 --> 03:15.600
course we can find our selected category or whatever you want to name it by having a look at categories

03:15.960 --> 03:21.950
and there we can use find which takes a function which it executes on every element in the array.

03:21.950 --> 03:27.830
So in every category and gives us the item where this function returns true which should be the case

03:27.830 --> 03:33.700
of the idea for the category we're looking at matches the cat I.D. We're retrieving from our parents.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.740
This gives us these selected category.

03:35.750 --> 03:42.010
And to prove that this works I'll output it here in a text component I'll output selected category data

03:42.020 --> 03:53.370
title here now with that if we go back and we navigate to that category we see Italian here right above

03:53.370 --> 03:56.280
my buttons we see quick and easy now.

03:56.430 --> 04:01.310
So that is working this is how we're passing data forward and how we're extracting it.

04:01.410 --> 04:07.710
And of course you can pass multiple parameters as many as you need and parameters don't have to be I.D.

04:08.010 --> 04:15.270
you could pass objects you could pass text numbers and erase whatever data you need to pass you can

04:15.270 --> 04:22.620
pass you might notice however that of course with Dad we're able to use our category here in our screen

04:23.040 --> 04:25.420
but we want to use it here in the header.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.030
Well let's tackle that in the next lecture.
