In the last lecture we styled our heading text,

00:05.520 --> 00:13.680
now one thing you might want to do in your application is set some default font size or font family

00:13.800 --> 00:15.930
every text should use.

00:15.930 --> 00:23.370
Now the thing is you can't do this on a wrapping container so you can't set up cascading styles like this,

00:23.370 --> 00:29.960
you can't go to the container and set my default font family should be arial or whatever you want to use, if

00:30.450 --> 00:35.400
you do that, you will actually end up with a warning that this is not supported.

00:35.640 --> 00:42.270
Now doing it on every text input is pretty cumbersome though even if you do outsource them into reusable

00:42.390 --> 00:47.970
building blocks, you have to set it in every building block and if you then decide to switch application

00:47.970 --> 00:53.890
wide, you have to revisit all your text building blocks and exchange it there.

00:54.390 --> 00:58.160
So you could add a new component in the UI folder,

00:58.440 --> 01:07.710
maybe name it main text which should be some master wrapper around all text elements because there's

01:07.710 --> 01:10.620
one cool thing with the tab built-in text element,

01:10.770 --> 01:17.610
you can wrap other text elements with it and there, that's the only exception, the styles will actually

01:17.610 --> 01:19.200
cascade.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.900
You can read more about this in the official documentation but here I'm going to show you how it works.

01:24.900 --> 01:32.550
So first of all, we import react from react of course as always, then we'll import text and stylesheet

01:33.090 --> 01:41.940
from react native and then I'm going to grab a constant, main text where I get some props and where we

01:41.940 --> 01:48.680
return some jsx and you guessed it, we're going to export this as the default.

01:48.680 --> 01:57.260
Now in here, we create a text component where we will set up our master style

01:57.320 --> 02:07.380
so let's set up a styles constant here where we use stylesheet create, pass a javascript object and

02:07.390 --> 02:17.170
in there, I'll add a main text and there, we could set the color to let's say this gray-ish color here

02:17.180 --> 02:19.020
by default.

02:19.110 --> 02:27.410
We could then add the style property to our text and set to to styles main text and then distribute

02:27.410 --> 02:31.380
whatever we pass between the opening and closing tag of our custom component

02:31.520 --> 02:33.440
via props children.

02:33.720 --> 02:40.870
If we save this, we can go to the auth file and import main text from

02:44.180 --> 02:45.430
components

02:45.500 --> 02:53.700
UI main text main text and now wrap whichever text should get our default styling with it,

02:53.700 --> 02:57.400
so wrap heading text with that for example.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.100
If we now save this and we reload the app,

03:03.440 --> 03:06.360
you'll see now we got this gray-ish look here.

03:06.710 --> 03:10.550
Now obviously we still have to wrap everything with this component,

03:10.550 --> 03:17.450
we can't wrap it around the entire application to have every text styling like this because the text component

03:17.480 --> 03:23.690
which we're in the end using here in main text can't wrap a view for example, at least not on Android.

03:23.900 --> 03:29.620
But the big advantage is we now got this master text with some general text styles

03:29.810 --> 03:35.810
and whenever we have text in the application that should be affected by this, we wrap it with that, whenever

03:35.810 --> 03:42.320
we then have a heading, we use that and maybe we would also define a paragraph text so that we have different

03:42.620 --> 03:49.670
text building blocks with different levels of styling that allow us to build reusable UIs with

03:49.850 --> 03:57.650
reusable styles that actually do something like cascading, a really useful pattern to make sure that

03:57.680 --> 04:04.790
if you ever have to change your default text color here, you just do it in one place and everywhere where

04:04.790 --> 04:06.540
you used it, it takes effect.

04:06.560 --> 04:13.800
So I'm switching this back to black effectively making this irrelevant but you still see the pattern, I guess.
