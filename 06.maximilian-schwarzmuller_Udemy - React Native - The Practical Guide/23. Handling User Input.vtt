WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:07.790
Now I will say that we'll have an in-depth look at how to work with user input and so on.

00:07.790 --> 00:13.530
In a separate module in the next course module therefore I'll not dive deeply into it right now.

00:13.640 --> 00:19.460
The only thing I want to do right now is add a text input here to the edit product screen and then output

00:19.460 --> 00:25.730
a couple of text inputs here which allow us to fetch user input and in the end allow us to add or edit

00:25.730 --> 00:31.010
product without any validation or anything special in there.

00:31.010 --> 00:37.900
So I'll also import a scroll view because I'll begin by wrapping everything with a scroll view because

00:37.940 --> 00:43.160
you could certainly be viewing us on a small device or in landscape mode where not everything fits into

00:43.160 --> 00:52.000
one screen now in there we'll have a couple of views with the different text inputs so here we'll always

00:52.000 --> 00:57.640
have a text with a label like the title of the product which you should enter and below that a text

00:57.640 --> 01:03.700
input that allows you to enter this title and in the end I will repeat that for all the different things

01:03.850 --> 01:04.500
you want to add.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.170
Now some styling will be required.

01:07.170 --> 01:14.220
So here for the text input I'll add a style of input and on the text above that I'll add a style of

01:15.000 --> 01:20.310
styles label.

01:20.440 --> 01:27.760
You can also give this view and overall style of form control for example whatever you want to name

01:27.760 --> 01:28.250
it.

01:28.390 --> 01:38.710
And now we can repeat that for the title for the image you are L here for the price and libs price and

01:38.800 --> 01:47.470
all the last but not least for the description I'll also wrap these things overall into a number of

01:47.460 --> 01:47.810
the U.

01:47.930 --> 01:55.000
So all these form controls in the end which I'll give a style of styles for.

01:57.490 --> 02:00.370
Now it's time to work on these styles here.

02:00.400 --> 02:07.490
So down there in the style sheet for the form all set a margin of 20 in all directions so there is some

02:07.490 --> 02:13.690
spacing around these inputs for my inputs here for the formal control label and input.

02:13.690 --> 02:22.800
I also want to add some styles so yea I'll have to form control my label and then all of the input itself.

02:22.810 --> 02:29.270
So the text input itself for the form control I want to set a width of one hundred to make sure that

02:29.270 --> 02:33.390
this is as wide as possible for the label.

02:33.430 --> 02:39.450
I'll set the font family to open Sand's bold to have some bold text here and then a margin vertical

02:39.450 --> 02:45.090
of a to have some spacing on top at bottom and for the input itself which is this text input element

02:45.510 --> 02:47.580
I want of a padding horizontal off too.

02:47.580 --> 02:53.580
So a very small padding so that when we enter texture not directly on the edge of the input and a padding

02:53.580 --> 03:00.800
vertical of 5 so a small padding to top and bottom and a border bottom colour of this slight grayish

03:00.810 --> 03:12.900
look with this hex code of CCC and then a border bottom with whips border bottom width of one that's

03:12.900 --> 03:21.630
the style all go with for now know if you have a look at that by going to admin and then for example

03:21.660 --> 03:25.340
clicking on you adding a new one this is how it looks and doesn't look too bad.

03:25.380 --> 03:29.450
Certainly not configured in any way but some to get started with.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.220
And of course now I want you all to submit this and save this as well.

03:33.420 --> 03:34.960
For Dad and the addict products.

03:34.990 --> 03:44.160
I want to have a action button so button indeed And the header hence here whips before to stalls maybe

03:44.220 --> 03:50.730
order doesn't matter but I like to have it right next to the component I'll add to navigation options

03:50.730 --> 03:56.910
where I need dat dynamic syntax because we'll need to do something dynamic from inside the header and

03:56.910 --> 04:02.670
then here we returned that config object where for one you can set the header title indentured all to

04:02.670 --> 04:09.090
be dynamic because their 1 output WEBER We're editing or adding that will depend on the fact whether

04:09.090 --> 04:17.490
we have a product or a deep param or not so we can already access NAF data dot navigation but get param.

04:17.490 --> 04:23.010
Now if you have a look at the user product screen you'll notice that when we click on the edit button

04:23.370 --> 04:33.630
we do pass in the product I.D. param here to edit product navigation when we clicked on the ad icon

04:33.630 --> 04:34.190
in the header.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.150
However we don't past it.

04:36.480 --> 04:41.420
So the product the de param if that's available we know we're an added mode.

04:41.550 --> 04:46.410
So here I can check if we can get a value for it added if data is true ish.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.640
Then I show added product as a title.

04:48.650 --> 04:54.390
Otherwise I'll show ad product because that's a clear indicator to me whether we're editing or adding

04:55.350 --> 04:59.050
you header title is not everything that should be part of the configuration though.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.260
I also want to have that header right.

05:01.260 --> 05:07.140
Part to have a button that allows it to save my data and for Dad I'll go to the user products screen

05:07.170 --> 05:12.140
and copy this setup I have data with the header buttons.

05:12.330 --> 05:19.740
Copy that over to the edit product screen and of course therefore also copy over the imports of header

05:19.740 --> 05:29.850
button and header buttons and item over to edit product screen and add this here and I'll of course

05:29.850 --> 05:35.280
we need to tweak does a little bit because certainly I add button does not make sense here save seems

05:35.280 --> 05:42.570
to be a more appropriate label and the icon I want to use therefore is empty checkmark and Iow checkmark

05:42.600 --> 05:49.220
which renders a nice well checkmark icon of course here I also don't want to navigate to edit product

05:49.250 --> 05:55.470
but instead I want to submit my form and that's something we'll work on in a second.

05:55.490 --> 06:01.250
First we need to make sure that we can save all the user input and that we all did pre populate this

06:01.250 --> 06:11.520
form in case for editing so to save the user input we can use to use state hook from react and simply

06:11.520 --> 06:14.810
manage to state for each of these text inputs.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.560
We'll have four states here in the end with use state.

06:19.620 --> 06:26.920
Each initialized to an empty string initially and then we have the title and set title and repeat that

06:26.920 --> 06:36.190
basically to also have like the image your URL and set image your l and then here half the price and

06:36.580 --> 06:37.990
set price.

06:38.140 --> 06:46.390
And then here also have the description and set description and again we'll refine this in the next

06:46.390 --> 06:49.340
module where we dive deeper into handling user input.

06:49.360 --> 06:55.210
For now I'll just bind this to my text input value here is bound to title for this first one which is

06:55.210 --> 07:04.090
my title input and on change text here I get my text here that changed and I'll save this back to set

07:04.350 --> 07:11.920
title in this case here sort of update my title state with the newly entered title text and now it's

07:11.920 --> 07:15.550
this pattern which we add to all these text inputs here.

07:15.730 --> 07:22.270
Here of course for the second one we're talking about the image you are L and set image you are L but

07:22.270 --> 07:25.390
I've written that it's the same forward price.

07:25.390 --> 07:31.700
Unsurprisingly we pass back in the price and we call set price but other than that it's the same.

07:31.720 --> 07:36.550
Please note that price they offer of course is also managed as a string year because whatever to use

07:36.550 --> 07:45.880
ranchers always is text and here for the text input I will pass in my description and set my description

07:45.880 --> 07:46.340
here.

07:47.980 --> 07:57.550
With that data is managed now to repopulate Dad when we have a recipe when we are loading a product

07:57.550 --> 08:07.590
and bird added mode we just need to get our product I.D. with the help of props navigation get param

08:08.010 --> 08:17.250
their product I.D. is a parameter we can fix retrieve and if proper I.D. is set well then I know we're

08:17.250 --> 08:24.060
an added mode and then I of course want to pre populate my fields here with the values.

08:24.190 --> 08:31.870
No actually that means I want to load my product based on the prod idea from my redux state.

08:31.870 --> 08:47.340
So we import use selector from react redux here and now here we can get our edited product by reaching

08:47.340 --> 08:51.170
out with you selector to our redux state.

08:51.210 --> 08:56.640
Now of course we need to dive into our products slice and you can always check out your reducer if you're

08:56.640 --> 09:01.740
not sure how it was structured again and there we see in the products part of our reducer of our redux

09:01.800 --> 09:06.180
store I should say we have that user products array in the end.

09:06.270 --> 09:07.820
So that's what I'm interested in here.

09:07.850 --> 09:13.870
You reach out to user products and now I want to find the product with that prod I.D. So here I'll have

09:13.870 --> 09:19.060
a look at every product defined function just as for me I want to return true if the idea of the product

09:19.060 --> 09:24.330
I'm looking at is equal to the prod I.D. I retrieved from my parameters.

09:24.730 --> 09:29.710
Now of course sometimes this will not yield anything if product is not set because this parameter is

09:29.710 --> 09:36.370
not set which is always the case when we clicked on this add button then this parameter will never be

09:36.370 --> 09:44.620
set but that's OK so edited product will then simply be undefined which is totally fine otherwise if

09:44.620 --> 09:50.470
added the product is not undefined if it is Saturday 0 4 we know we are in edit mode and therefore we

09:50.470 --> 09:58.210
can pre populate our values therefore actually I'll do this first before I initialize my states because

09:58.230 --> 10:03.120
that is something I want to initialize depending on whether we loaded a product or not.

10:04.320 --> 10:09.750
So title here actually there I will check if added product if that is set.

10:09.750 --> 10:15.720
If it is set then I will initialize the title to be edited product title otherwise it will be an empty

10:15.720 --> 10:21.560
string and I'll have the same logic for the image you are L here.

10:21.600 --> 10:28.980
So here I do that for image you or L not for the price because the price shouldn't be changeable but

10:29.070 --> 10:31.250
I will do it for the description.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.520
So the default value of title immaterial and description depends on whether we have an additive product

10:36.520 --> 10:43.870
or not and now with that since we set this on the state this will automatically be fed into our text

10:43.870 --> 10:48.910
inputs and the only thing is I need to make sure that they remove the the price input here.

10:48.910 --> 10:56.490
If we're an added mode so we'll check if added that product is set here and if that is the case then

10:56.490 --> 10:58.180
it will return null here and only.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.820
Otherwise if it's not set.

10:59.820 --> 11:07.380
So if I'm in at Mode not an added mode I will render that price input here so that the price input is

11:07.380 --> 11:12.300
removed if we're editing because I can't edit it anyways.

11:12.400 --> 11:20.910
So now with that let's give this a try and let's go back to the admin screen for click on ads.

11:21.020 --> 11:26.990
Yeah I need to reset the platform import because I'm using data in the header button for rendering the

11:27.040 --> 11:29.950
checkmark the icons depending on the platform.

11:30.050 --> 11:35.150
So let's make sure we import platform on the edit product screen but now if I click on add we see all

11:35.150 --> 11:40.670
four imports all empty at the beginning for click on added on the rent that are pre populated and I

11:40.670 --> 11:43.840
don't see the price input which is exactly what I want.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.280
Now it's time to make sure that when we submit this we ever update our product.

11:48.290 --> 11:52.770
If we're editing or if we're adding it we're adding a new product.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.360
Again for now I will not add any validation we'll do that later.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.860
So for now we can also submit a empty product later after the next module.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.450
This will not be possible anymore.
