Now there is one extra thing when building mobile apps for modern phones we can kind of see this here

00:09.810 --> 00:13.880
on the iPhone which I rotated it has this notch here.

00:13.890 --> 00:14.520
Right.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.380
And this notch can sometimes overlap your content.

00:19.380 --> 00:26.010
The same is true for this home screen Task Manager indicator bar here at the bottom on the iPhone.

00:26.010 --> 00:32.280
You see it's overlapping our new game button and yes I can scroll up but it bounces back and it always

00:32.370 --> 00:33.990
is above that button.

00:33.990 --> 00:40.370
So these are elements which are part of the wise which kind of can distort our interface.

00:40.380 --> 00:47.310
For example if we had left aligned text it might be overlapped by this notch or in this case it is home

00:47.370 --> 00:48.930
screen button where it is.

00:49.290 --> 00:54.250
Well task manager is which are indicator bar is overlapping our content.

00:54.660 --> 00:57.090
And of course that's not just the case on iPhones.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.760
You could have a similar issue on Android devices.

00:59.780 --> 01:04.080
There you also have devices with a notch or with anything like that.

01:04.140 --> 01:11.640
Now to make sure that your app always looks good on all different devices React Native has a special

01:11.640 --> 01:19.680
component you can use a component which automatically adjusts your your content to fit onto the screen

01:19.680 --> 01:23.830
of your device and respect notches and other things.

01:23.850 --> 01:29.280
So for example here in the game over screen where I have this issue here on the iPhone we can import

01:29.310 --> 01:33.750
this special component React Native offers and that's the safe area view.

01:34.080 --> 01:41.640
It's called like this because it's a wrapping view we can put around our content which is marking the

01:41.780 --> 01:50.430
safe area the area in which we can position our content because there we won't have problems with notches

01:50.460 --> 01:51.660
and so on.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.770
Now how do you use to save area of.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.590
You simply take it and wrap it around your content.

01:57.600 --> 02:04.710
So around our scroll view here for example we can wrap all of that on the game over screen with the

02:04.710 --> 02:08.660
safe area view and that's important by the way.

02:08.660 --> 02:12.640
Safe Area views should always wrap your topmost view.

02:12.650 --> 02:17.170
So in this case this scroll view here so now is that safe.

02:17.180 --> 02:26.140
If we go back and we go through our game real quick here on the iPhone start a new game fifty five is

02:26.140 --> 02:28.480
the number and solve this

02:33.070 --> 02:38.200
then what you see is something interesting the issue got even worse.

02:38.200 --> 02:45.910
Well before we take care about this please note that these scroll bar you see here on the right is now

02:45.910 --> 02:48.040
actually indented a bit.

02:48.040 --> 02:53.500
It's not totally on the right and that already is d safe area view having some effect that add some

02:53.500 --> 03:01.840
padding on the left and the right to make sure that well that we respect the de notch that would take

03:01.840 --> 03:09.730
up some space there and give us some padding that our content is definitely not overlapped by the notch.

03:09.730 --> 03:13.030
But of course we have a problem down there at the bottom.

03:13.030 --> 03:18.040
Reason for that is that I'm not really using the save area view as my top most view.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.930
So let's remove it from there from the game over screen because what is our top view.

03:23.020 --> 03:26.190
Well that's in the app chess file in the end there.

03:26.230 --> 03:33.750
We have our content this view here where we have to header and then whichever viewer loading.

03:33.770 --> 03:39.100
So for example the header is not part of his save area view and it definitely should be.

03:39.110 --> 03:49.130
So let's import Safe Area view here in the app jazz file and let's wrap this view here with it like

03:49.130 --> 03:49.550
that

03:52.480 --> 03:58.760
so now with this let's save it and let's have a number look with the wait for the app to reload and

03:58.850 --> 04:02.750
what we see is an empty screen now solution is simple.

04:02.780 --> 04:08.360
Let's take the style we applied to this you and apply to the Save area of you and now get rid of this

04:08.380 --> 04:08.980
other view.

04:08.990 --> 04:15.090
Because now it just replaces our normal view here and now does works and now let's go for that game

04:15.180 --> 04:19.590
again let's quickly solve this

04:23.720 --> 04:28.160
what you now see is dead here at the bottom.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.960
We now have some extra spacing between that.

04:31.100 --> 04:36.700
I want to go to the task manager bar here and the new game button which we didn't have before.

04:36.740 --> 04:42.350
We also have the spacing on the left and the right here to respect the notch so that this never overlaps

04:42.350 --> 04:42.790
content.

04:42.800 --> 04:48.690
We might have on the left there and we've got some extra padding at well the top and the bottom.

04:48.770 --> 04:56.180
Now of course our header doesn't look super beautiful with this extra spacing here and that's actually

04:56.180 --> 05:01.270
something we'll take care about in the navigation module or actually we'll be taken care about for us.

05:01.280 --> 05:05.690
We will not have to do much there but again this is not something we have to worry about.

05:05.690 --> 05:11.460
Therefore what we can worry about though is that our content is always visible and with the safe area

05:11.460 --> 05:14.210
of you you can ensure that it is.

05:14.210 --> 05:20.050
Now that does not mean that you need to wrap all your content or your entire app in a safe area view

05:20.060 --> 05:26.930
all the time as you will see in the next module when we all to talk about navigation in a lot of apps

05:26.930 --> 05:33.800
you'll actually use a library that takes care about this in a lot of cases for you the navigation library

05:33.830 --> 05:34.700
will use there.

05:34.940 --> 05:39.980
So in a lot of apps because most of your apps will have navigation you will not have to manage just

05:39.980 --> 05:40.790
manually.

05:40.940 --> 05:46.460
But if you're building an app where you have no other library that's taking care about this like this

05:46.460 --> 05:52.760
app here you mind when I consider wrapping your content with a save area view if otherwise content is

05:52.760 --> 05:53.420
overlapped.
