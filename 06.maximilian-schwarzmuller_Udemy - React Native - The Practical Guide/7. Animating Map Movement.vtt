00:02.300 --> 00:07.970
So with the marker added in the last lecture, let's now make sure that the map actually smoothly transitions

00:07.970 --> 00:10.810
to the marker whenever we pick a location.

00:10.910 --> 00:16.730
The react native maps API provides a method for this too, you can learn more about it in the docs,

00:17.720 --> 00:23.530
on the map view, there you will see that we got a method,

00:23.730 --> 00:26.960
animateToRegion at the very bottom of the documentation.

00:26.990 --> 00:35.180
The question just is how can we call a method on this map view which is a component in our jsx code? We can

00:35.180 --> 00:40.670
use a react concept called ref for this, we can get a reference to the underlying object and

00:40.670 --> 00:43.940
use that in our other javascript code. For this,

00:43.940 --> 00:48.820
we add a property to map view, ref and this is a default react feature now

00:49.370 --> 00:57.050
and there we have to pass an inline function, an arrow function where we get the reference as an argument, react

00:57.050 --> 01:04.740
will generate this for us and then we can bind some property of our class to this reference.

01:04.970 --> 01:07.440
You access the class with the this keyword,

01:07.470 --> 01:09.450
the class is this overall class here,

01:09.470 --> 01:14.600
so our pick location class. We access this with this, then here

01:14.600 --> 01:19.340
I'm going to name this map but you can choose any name you want and assign that to this ref.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.350
So this creates a property in your class which holds a reference to this object and you can then use

01:24.350 --> 01:26.690
this object in your code.

01:26.690 --> 01:33.320
Now I want to do this in the pick location handler, right before we call set state though that would run asynchronously

01:33.320 --> 01:35.510
so doing it after it would also work

01:35.540 --> 01:37.640
but still, let's do it like this.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.140
I will call this map,

01:40.190 --> 01:46.700
so that's now refering to this property we just added which will refer to our map and there, 

01:46.910 --> 01:49.090
animateToRegion.

01:49.100 --> 01:54.200
Now this method needs a javascript object to configure this region we want to navigate to,

01:54.230 --> 01:57.200
you can find more information on the official docs.

01:57.210 --> 02:03.020
You see the arguments actually are the region and then the duration over which you want to navigate

02:03.200 --> 02:04.160
or to animate,

02:04.160 --> 02:09.070
you can leave away duration and it will then automatically pick a nice one.

02:09.260 --> 02:18.540
So the region I want to go to is this state focused location, use all the properties from there with the

02:18.540 --> 02:19.890
spread operator

02:20.160 --> 02:22.780
but then I want to override latitude and longitude,

02:22.800 --> 02:29.730
so I just want to use the deltas. Latitude should be coords latitude of course and longitude should

02:29.730 --> 02:33.540
be coords longitude therefore, like this.

02:33.540 --> 02:40.800
With that change in place, we can also remove the region property from map view because now I no longer

02:40.800 --> 02:41.960
need that, initial region is

02:41.970 --> 02:48.870
all I need now because I will animate to the new region, we don't need to hard code it in here.

02:48.870 --> 02:53.550
So with this set up, let's save all of that and let's reload it on ios,

02:57.390 --> 03:03.470
sign in and now let's click somewhere and you see that it's smoothly animates there.

03:03.510 --> 03:04.630
So that's much better

03:04.680 --> 03:07.920
and it will work exactly the same on Android.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.100
So with that we also added an animation and that's just awesome

03:11.100 --> 03:13.800
and you saw how super simple this was

03:13.880 --> 03:18.900
and along the way, you learned how to use different components from the react native maps package, how

03:18.900 --> 03:25.920
to configure it with props and how to also use the methods these components provide by using this ref trick

03:26.010 --> 03:31.170
which is not really a trick but a built-in feature, just one you don't use that often normally.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.610
Now that is all nice, we can add

03:33.630 --> 03:35.670
and we should add one more thing though,

03:35.670 --> 03:37.870
hook up this locate me button

03:38.030 --> 03:44.220
to also give the user the alternative of not picking a location manually but instead take the user

03:44.220 --> 03:45.510
location.

03:45.510 --> 03:47.250
Let's do this as a next step.
