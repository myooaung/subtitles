00:02.430 --> 00:05.640
So let's start working on this app then.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.270
And for this I have a brand new app here.

00:08.280 --> 00:12.390
You'll find it attached in case you want to build up on this same starting app.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.020
This simple app gives us this year a very ugly app where we have some text which is overlapped by the

00:19.020 --> 00:21.440
status bar by the notch.

00:21.450 --> 00:26.800
Now we could fix this with safe area view as you learned earlier but will not need to because we'll

00:26.820 --> 00:33.210
not keep this content anyways and we'll use a third party library that allows us to easily navigate

00:33.210 --> 00:36.530
between different screens and get nice animations along the way.

00:36.690 --> 00:38.310
So we don't have to take care about that.

00:38.310 --> 00:44.610
And this third party library will also managed to notch on the device and give us this safe area out

00:44.610 --> 00:45.880
of the box.

00:45.900 --> 00:52.230
Now before we add that third party library let's start writing some code though because we can only

00:52.230 --> 00:56.020
navigate between screens if we have multiple screens.

00:56.040 --> 01:01.950
So for that I'll create and use screens folder here and I'll also already create a components folder.

01:01.950 --> 01:07.410
The difference will be that in the screens folder we have these react components which we then use as

01:07.470 --> 01:07.830
well.

01:07.860 --> 01:15.420
Full screen screens I guess and in the components folder instead will have the components for use on

01:15.420 --> 01:16.430
our screens.

01:16.440 --> 01:23.280
So for example when we have that grade of meal categories of food categories then our great item would

01:23.280 --> 01:30.200
be a component d And higher grids the entire food categories screen however would be well a screen.

01:30.450 --> 01:37.530
And I guess this makes sense now as sketched as laid out in this app will need a couple of screens and

01:37.530 --> 01:43.860
I'll treat all the files already and we'll fill them with life for all this module of course we'll need

01:43.890 --> 01:49.440
the categories screen and I'll name to follow categories screen to make it really clear what's inside

01:49.440 --> 01:50.200
there.

01:50.250 --> 01:57.270
This is the screen where we can select a category like Italian German American so where we can select

01:57.270 --> 02:04.170
a food category so we'll add content that reflects this will add such a grid on this screen in this

02:04.230 --> 02:06.420
screen component later.

02:06.420 --> 02:14.100
Now once we selected a category we will see a list of meals that fits into this category and I'll name

02:14.100 --> 02:20.190
this screen which will then see which will navigate to category meals screen because this is the screen

02:20.190 --> 02:23.390
that loads the meals for a chosen category.

02:23.460 --> 02:28.240
So that's a no screen we need and another screen will be able to navigate to.

02:28.320 --> 02:35.100
Now we also will need a favorites screen which is the screen that holds all our favorite recipes our

02:35.100 --> 02:42.300
favorite meals and we'll all need a meal detailed screen that's the screen we see if we tap on a single

02:42.300 --> 02:48.390
meal inside of a chosen category or on the favorite screen distance shows us the ingredients and the

02:48.390 --> 02:51.120
detailed steps for this meal.

02:51.120 --> 02:58.020
Now and last but not least as laid out we'll need a filters screen and this filters screen is the screen

02:58.020 --> 03:05.700
that allows us to set well filters like vegan food so that we only see recipes which are vegan or vegetarian

03:05.790 --> 03:08.110
or gluten free or lactose free.

03:08.130 --> 03:14.950
These will be the four categories all happiness app so these are the screens that will add components

03:15.040 --> 03:18.410
as we need them and not add all the files in advance.

03:18.430 --> 03:25.390
And with that we have the well very very very basic setup we need here though of course all our screens

03:25.720 --> 03:31.330
are totally empty now we'll populate them with more live step by step but I at least want to set up

03:31.330 --> 03:34.160
a basic component in each of these screens.

03:34.390 --> 03:40.000
So I'll start in the categories screen and of course we need to import react from react there because

03:40.000 --> 03:46.750
we'll build a react component and we'll also import something from React Native because obviously we'll

03:47.050 --> 03:52.600
build a react component here that uses some React Native components to be precise.

03:52.630 --> 03:58.110
I will start simple here and import a view in a text from reactive and then create my component the

03:58.120 --> 04:04.630
categories screen in this case which takes props or which might receive props at least because it's

04:04.630 --> 04:11.530
a normal react component after all and where I will export this as my default component I'll also add

04:11.530 --> 04:16.870
a stall sheet because chances are we'll need this and if we don't we can still delete it later.

04:16.870 --> 04:19.150
So I'll set up my styles here with style.

04:19.150 --> 04:22.060
She'd create like this.

04:22.330 --> 04:26.440
So that's a very basic react component doesn't render anything though.

04:26.440 --> 04:32.730
So inside of the component function here we'll have to return something and that something is some ASX

04:32.770 --> 04:39.920
code where I want to render a view and in there a text and here I say the categories screen.

04:40.240 --> 04:49.270
Now I'll also give that view some style where I say styles dot screen with a very basic screen layout

04:49.270 --> 04:56.260
or a screen styling here where at flex to one and then justify content to center and a line items to

04:56.260 --> 04:58.980
center and as you learned this will do one thing.

04:59.080 --> 05:04.850
It will center the content on the screen so it will center this text on the screen Indian.

05:04.960 --> 05:09.880
This is the base component and I'll copy that content into all of our screens.

05:09.910 --> 05:14.920
And of course this is not the final content we'll have there just some dummy content so that we can

05:14.920 --> 05:19.210
start navigating between some of these screens and see something.

05:19.210 --> 05:25.900
So here we have a category meal screen that's this component here and that step for what we need to

05:25.900 --> 05:37.880
export here and here I will therefore say that category meal screen like this now I'll also add this

05:37.880 --> 05:41.650
to the favorites screen and renamed as two favorites screen.

05:41.690 --> 05:43.700
And of course they are for export.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.000
Favorite screen here.

05:45.110 --> 05:48.720
And then here I can say the favorites screen.

05:48.740 --> 05:53.060
Copy that into the filters screen and do the same thing there.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.920
Still filters screen.

05:55.940 --> 06:02.240
I renamed it and I export at this and also say that filters screen here in our text.

06:02.390 --> 06:06.110
And last but not least this is the meal detailed screen.

06:06.110 --> 06:09.000
So here we have to meal detail screen.

06:09.740 --> 06:15.140
Also name at meal detailed screen here and export the meal detailed screen.

06:15.140 --> 06:19.930
So with that we got that all set up in these screens.

06:20.060 --> 06:23.390
Now we're almost done with all the preparation.

06:23.450 --> 06:29.240
I just want to add some special fonts to this app and thereafter will dive right into adding some navigation.
