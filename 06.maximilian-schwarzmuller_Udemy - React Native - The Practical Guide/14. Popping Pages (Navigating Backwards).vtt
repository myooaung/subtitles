In the last lecture we learned how to push a new screen,

00:05.780 --> 00:11.540
now I want to pop it I want to go back and I want to go back when we click this button. Now we could

00:11.540 --> 00:19.160
handle this with props and so on but I want to directly connect place detail to redux to my store so

00:19.160 --> 00:23.050
that I can directly dispatch the delete action from here.

00:23.060 --> 00:35.850
So for that let's simply import connect from react redux and then let's implement our constant, map

00:35.960 --> 00:43.470
dispatch to props here at the bottom which is equal to dispatch which was passed into a function where

00:43.470 --> 00:47.130
we have to return our mapping object in the end.

00:48.200 --> 00:53.200
And there, I want to bind some property,

00:53.210 --> 00:59.330
let's maybe name it on delete place to a function where I receive the key of the item which has

00:59.330 --> 01:00.170
to be deleted,

01:00.290 --> 01:01.400
that will be new,

01:01.430 --> 01:05.930
I need that because we have no selected items stored in the store anymore

01:06.500 --> 01:09.310
and then I will dispatch this action

01:09.320 --> 01:13.850
I want to dispatch. First of all, I need to change the action

01:13.880 --> 01:22.310
so let's go to store, actions, places.js, delete place now requires a key and I will need to pass this

01:22.310 --> 01:26.950
on, so place key should be passed on to the reducer

01:27.120 --> 01:31.280
because as I said, we no longer have the selected items stored in the store

01:31.370 --> 01:36.380
so we need to pass that information with that action now. In the places reducer

01:36.380 --> 01:41.530
therefore when we delete a place, we can no longer reach out to selected place key,

01:41.630 --> 01:48.560
we instead have to use action and there, I stored it in a property named place key,

01:48.560 --> 01:50.360
that's what I just did here,

01:50.400 --> 01:54.160
place key here has to be place key here.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.580
So now we get the information we need for deleting

01:56.600 --> 01:56.890
right

01:56.900 --> 01:58.670
with the action.

01:58.670 --> 02:05.490
So with that back in the place detail component, I need to import this,

02:05.630 --> 02:09.720
so we'll import my actions from

02:09.720 --> 02:16.020
and now let's go up to the store folder, to the actions file, to the index file where I bundle all my exports

02:16.590 --> 02:18.690
and import delete place

02:19.160 --> 02:23.290
and with that imported, this is what I want to dispatch, delete

02:23.360 --> 02:27.690
place where I also pass on my key.

02:28.060 --> 02:33.920
So with that, I just need to make sure that this gets executed whenever we click this button

02:34.450 --> 02:39.550
and for this I could write this inline but I'll actually now turn this into a class based component

02:39.610 --> 02:40.440
too,

02:40.660 --> 02:50.890
so I'll import component from react too, turn this into class place detail with a capital P that extends

02:51.160 --> 02:54.560
component and in the class body,

02:54.650 --> 03:02.600
I will have my render method where I return some jsx, the jsx we return is the jsx we also had

03:03.100 --> 03:05.410
in the view before that,

03:05.690 --> 03:09.390
so here let's remove that part down there.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.350
And now with that I can

03:14.770 --> 03:17.080
first of all take that new name and export it

03:17.080 --> 03:25.670
before I forget it down there and now add a method which I'll name place

03:25.660 --> 03:27.700
deleted handler

03:28.860 --> 03:31.880
where I receive nothing

03:32.610 --> 03:40.260
but then in the end, I want to dispatch my action through that prop. To be able to do so, I

03:40.260 --> 03:47.190
first of all need to connect this, so I'll use connect and wrap place detail with the result of the connect

03:47.190 --> 03:57.350
call and to connect, I pass null for map state to props but then I pass map dispatch to props and

03:57.480 --> 04:02.300
I now of course can execute this on delete place,

04:02.460 --> 04:07.180
so this prop we set up down there in map dispatch to props,

04:07.220 --> 04:15.260
this is what I want to execute and for that, I need to pass on the key of that place. Now conveniently

04:15.260 --> 04:19.110
I can do that, I can simply access place

04:19.150 --> 04:25.640
and now to pass on the key, if we have a look at our reducer, we see when we add a new place we assign a

04:25.640 --> 04:30.790
key, a random number not a real unique key but it still does the job.

04:31.160 --> 04:37.730
So we'll pass on this key and I can conveniently access it on place key, not on place key excuse me,

04:37.730 --> 04:40.420
on this props selected place,

04:40.420 --> 04:47.030
that is what we get from the outer component which pushed this page. I now also need to adjust 

04:47.060 --> 04:53.210
all props calls in my jsx code to this props because we turned this into a class based one,

04:53.330 --> 04:58.070
so we access props on this props and selected place still is the place

04:58.070 --> 05:00.870
we got from outside.

05:01.040 --> 05:06.180
So now we dispatch this action directly from within our component here,

05:06.500 --> 05:08.480
we delete the place,

05:08.480 --> 05:11.990
I now also want to get rid of this page once we did so.

05:12.350 --> 05:19.850
So I will access this props navigator, this property we get from react native navigation and then, I can

05:19.850 --> 05:23.840
just call pop in there. You can learn more about pop in the documentation,

05:23.840 --> 05:26.440
you can also configure this, for example set if

05:26.450 --> 05:33.110
it should be animated or not but this will simply remove the current page or screen from the stack,

05:33.230 --> 05:35.390
hence navigating back.

05:35.390 --> 05:37.400
Now let's try all of that out,

05:37.400 --> 05:42.180
one important thing we have to do though is since we connect the place detail to redux,

05:42.260 --> 05:45.090
in the app.js where we register this component,

05:45.150 --> 05:56.370
I now also need to pass store and provider as arguments to register a component for the place details screen.

05:56.580 --> 06:02.460
Now with that, we can save all of that and go back to our application and reload it, log back

06:02.460 --> 06:09.110
in and enter Munich here, find a place, go to the place

06:09.360 --> 06:16.840
and let's click the trash bin and if I go back, that doesn't look too promising, did it?

06:16.930 --> 06:18.060
Nothing happened.

06:18.890 --> 06:22.830
Well I forgot one crucial thing, in place detail,

06:22.850 --> 06:27.840
I of course also need to connect my button click, there on touchable opacity,

06:27.860 --> 06:33.130
I called this props on item deleted, I should call my place delete handler instead,

06:33.320 --> 06:34.740
so I will do that,

06:34.820 --> 06:41.380
this place delete handler. Now let's save this and go back and let's reload this again,

06:41.600 --> 06:42.820
let's try it again,

06:43.130 --> 06:46.660
let's add another awesome place, still Munich.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.140
Click on it,

06:48.290 --> 06:49.960
click the trash bin,

06:49.970 --> 06:53.260
now I'm warned that on delete place is not a function.

06:53.450 --> 06:57.340
So let's go back to place detail, this on delete place,

06:57.360 --> 07:01.430
yeah it's not a function, it should be this props ondelete place,

07:01.490 --> 07:02.770
so one more try.

07:03.470 --> 07:04.210
Login,

07:08.960 --> 07:13.850
add Munich, go to Munich and delete it

07:13.850 --> 07:17.010
and now we're taken back and you see the place is gone.

07:17.190 --> 07:25.020
And we can try the same on Android, maybe reload once just to be sure that it works,

07:25.780 --> 07:33.850
add Munich there too, click the add button, go to the other tab, go there, click the trash bin it's gone.

07:34.060 --> 07:36.350
So this is how we can pop back

07:36.490 --> 07:40.480
and also how we hook up this delete functionality.

07:41.370 --> 07:43.060
Now with that let's move on.
