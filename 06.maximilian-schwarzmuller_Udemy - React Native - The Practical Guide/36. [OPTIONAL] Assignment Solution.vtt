00:02.410 --> 00:05.710
Where are you successful let's animated together.

00:05.890 --> 00:12.580
First of all we need to add a second value to our estate which can be managed by re-act native and all

00:12.580 --> 00:14.610
name it places.

00:14.620 --> 00:20.920
And then the name is totally up to you again here awls initialize a value and we can start with any

00:20.920 --> 00:26.290
value you want but I want to any from an Apache of 0 to 1.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.170
So let's start at zero.

00:29.260 --> 00:35.380
Now we got the place loaded handler which we execute once the first animation is done and once we actually

00:35.710 --> 00:38.090
set our laces to be loaded.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.910
So any place is loaded.

00:39.910 --> 00:48.670
Handler all play any made its timings to execute this function again and there will change.

00:48.690 --> 00:51.550
Does state laces and them.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.540
Now let's configure this timing function.

00:54.700 --> 00:59.020
Let's go to a value of 1 because we start at zero and we want to fade it in.

00:59.060 --> 01:04.100
Let's go to one over a duration of 500 milliseconds maybe.

01:04.310 --> 01:07.270
And that's also used the native driver there.

01:08.820 --> 01:17.400
Now we just need to call start death starts the animation dead will change does state places and them.

01:17.480 --> 01:25.070
Now we need to take advantage of this in our render function here where we have places list we should

01:25.070 --> 01:33.400
wrap this in the animated dot view component which is the component which can handle this anymore.

01:33.430 --> 01:35.620
The value we're changing over time.

01:36.590 --> 01:42.040
Now you may of course play whichever animation you want and change with whichever styles you want.

01:42.350 --> 01:56.520
I will set style equal to a javascript object where all changed your past city to this state laces and

01:56.540 --> 01:59.650
then and again because it's animated you react.

01:59.670 --> 02:07.580
It was able to actually handle this strange value and change the opacity off the wrapped element.

02:08.930 --> 02:10.640
And now that is all.

02:10.640 --> 02:11.860
Let me save this.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.120
And that's reload our application.

02:14.390 --> 02:16.400
And let's see if we see our list.

02:16.410 --> 02:20.270
Fade in smoothly for dad.

02:20.280 --> 02:25.210
All First of all add new elements and I'll add Munich's.

02:25.260 --> 02:31.200
Munich a couple of times and then find my places and it fades beautifully.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.540
Let's also try that on Android.

02:33.750 --> 02:38.240
So I'll reload there quickly add a couple of new laces.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.770
Let's use San Francisco here.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.710
Let's also add a couple of times.

02:47.470 --> 02:49.450
And let's find the place here too.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.160
Looks beautiful too.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.030
That is the animation finished.

02:53.080 --> 02:59.310
That is our fate in animation and then with that to gabber we get a very nice animation in place.
