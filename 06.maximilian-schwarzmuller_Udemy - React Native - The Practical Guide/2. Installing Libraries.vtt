I want to add some icons and for that, you can google for react native vector icons. Then you should

00:09.160 --> 00:16.180
find this github repository here, react native vector icons, this is a repository or library that makes it

00:16.180 --> 00:19.800
easy for you to add icons to your react native app.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.930
You actually got a selection of icon sets you can use,

00:24.950 --> 00:29.890
I'm going to go with the ionicons but you can of course also use material icons or whichever icons

00:29.890 --> 00:36.100
you like, you can always click on these links here to also see a list of all the icons where you can

00:36.100 --> 00:41.100
search for specific icons to pick the one you want to use in your app.

00:41.140 --> 00:48.250
So these are our icon resources but to include them, we need this library, so to install it, we can

00:48.250 --> 00:51.520
simply execute this command here,

00:51.550 --> 00:57.680
so let's go back to our code and run npm install --save just as we did before with redux because

00:57.680 --> 01:00.910
it's a normal npm distributed package here

01:01.120 --> 01:05.830
and then it's called react-native-vector-icons,

01:06.100 --> 01:10.090
simply hit enter and it will download and install it.

01:10.150 --> 01:14.260
Now unlike redux, this won't work just like that,

01:14.500 --> 01:23.050
we instead need to add some things to our iOS and Android projects and code to connect this library

01:23.230 --> 01:25.280
to our native application

01:25.390 --> 01:32.300
because this library unlike redux doesn't just run with javascript but needs to run some native code

01:32.410 --> 01:37.630
and for that, we need to connect it to our native code projects which are stored in the Android and iOS

01:37.630 --> 01:39.010
folders.

01:39.010 --> 01:45.110
Now as for all libraries that reach out to native code features that you might add,

01:45.430 --> 01:51.190
you will always find installation instructions on the respective github pages and I strongly recommend

01:51.190 --> 01:56.650
reading through them because every library has its extra twist or something special which you didn't

01:56.650 --> 01:58.710
have to do for some other library

01:58.990 --> 02:00.580
and it's the case here too

02:00.700 --> 02:03.720
but there are some steps which are always the same.

02:04.060 --> 02:09.250
And there also is an automatic way of adding such libraries, I'll describe it in an article after this 

02:09.250 --> 02:14.350
video but I'm a big fan of showing the manual way because you learn more when doing this and the

02:14.350 --> 02:18.550
automatic one sometimes fails, the manual one always works.

02:18.970 --> 02:23.140
So for that, how can we add it? For this library,

02:23.350 --> 02:30.280
we theoretically wouldn't need to add much if we didn't want to use one specific capability of it which

02:30.280 --> 02:35.290
will become more important later in the course but which I'll already include here because it shows

02:35.290 --> 02:42.100
a typical way of connecting a native feature library to your app.

02:42.490 --> 02:48.180
So let's start with linking it to iOS, to iOS projects in the next lecture.
