00:02.490 --> 00:08.100
So we want to use re-act native navigation because it's a really nice library which just works very

00:08.100 --> 00:13.450
well here on their documentation off re-act native navigation.

00:13.470 --> 00:17.730
You'll find instructions using yarn which is an alternative to NPM.

00:17.730 --> 00:22.380
You can simply run NPM install dash dash save instead of an ADD.

00:22.650 --> 00:23.860
So this is what all do.

00:24.720 --> 00:33.720
I'll go back to my project and they're all just run NPM installed dash dash save reac dash native dash

00:33.810 --> 00:35.370
navigation.

00:35.370 --> 00:36.570
Now one important note.

00:36.600 --> 00:45.630
Just be sure to install version 1 and you can force this by adding at at one ofter NPM install dash

00:45.630 --> 00:49.130
dash save reac dash native navigation.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.760
That's the package name.

00:50.770 --> 00:51.920
Just download it.

00:51.930 --> 00:55.130
Last entry in the package don't chase and fall.

00:55.260 --> 01:02.120
And allows us to continue with the set up so that we can soon use it or it will take a couple of seconds.

01:02.190 --> 01:04.820
We're not done once to download it though.

01:04.950 --> 01:10.110
Instead what we'll do is or what we have to do is follow the steps which are laid out here.

01:10.290 --> 01:12.600
But it's really not that difficult.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.880
First of all we have to do the normal linking in X code which I already showed you.

01:16.890 --> 01:20.640
So make sure to open your project in X code to do that.

01:20.640 --> 01:28.140
Once you are in X code right click on libraries click on Add files to your project go to node modules

01:28.140 --> 01:33.700
in your project folder and search for you react native navigation package dare there.

01:33.720 --> 01:40.060
Go into the iOS folder and in that folder search for it is thought to X code project fall.

01:40.080 --> 01:48.680
Here it is simply click and thereafter and then click on your project name your in the top left bar.

01:49.440 --> 01:54.840
Click on build faces and they're on linked binary with libraries.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.670
Click on this last at the bottom of the list.

01:57.930 --> 02:01.620
Simply search for re-act native navigation here.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.470
It is already and click ADD.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.630
Now that's the first step.

02:06.630 --> 02:12.200
Now if you go back to the application we see that we actually covered steps 2 and 3 with data already.

02:12.270 --> 02:16.310
So we linked our binary we added it to the project.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.530
The next step is described pretty well here.

02:19.810 --> 02:23.780
So what do we have to do is we have to click on our project

02:26.820 --> 02:32.570
and then click on build settings next to build faces bold settings.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.340
Now there you probably have to click on all.

02:35.350 --> 02:45.740
So switch from basic to all and then you may search for hador here or even Hatter's search or SCA sauted

02:45.760 --> 02:49.530
you'll find these headers search postes your.

02:49.780 --> 02:51.520
Now you have to look at mentation.

02:51.620 --> 02:58.220
We can see that now on these headers search paths we have to enter this link here and you don't need

02:58.220 --> 03:00.390
to replace anything in that POV.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.920
Just add it to your headers search paths.

03:03.050 --> 03:07.680
Just double click here on the right and click on the small.

03:07.690 --> 03:14.890
Plus I can here and does parfum you just copy it and make sure to switch it from non-recursive to recursive

03:15.270 --> 03:16.290
and then just click anywhere.

03:16.300 --> 03:21.190
Out of this box it should now be added and an automated he picks your full path.

03:22.920 --> 03:28.850
Does this step 4 finished and you can even view some screenshots for all these parts if it's unclear.

03:28.850 --> 03:34.970
The next step is in X code to edit the app delegate dot M-file.

03:34.970 --> 03:38.270
So in your project you will find it here.

03:38.290 --> 03:46.700
App delegate dot M and now simply click on this reference links to a list on their page.

03:46.710 --> 03:49.950
There you find to contemned you should paste into that file.

03:50.010 --> 03:57.890
You can simply click on raw here to get just text which you can copy and with that go back and simply

03:57.890 --> 04:05.670
replace the entire content off this file with as content you just copied just like the AT and with that

04:05.720 --> 04:06.750
your.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.190
I was set up is completed.

04:09.260 --> 04:12.200
You should now be able to use this navigation.

04:12.200 --> 04:17.030
Now let's follow with the installation for Android in the next lecture.
