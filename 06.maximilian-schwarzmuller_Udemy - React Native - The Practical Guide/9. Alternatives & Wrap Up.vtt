So we worked on these forums here or on these inputs where we can fetch user input for adding new products

00:09.450 --> 00:14.840
and that of course is a core thing you'll probably have to do in any application.

00:14.850 --> 00:20.400
Now here I showed you all the nitty gritty details it takes to set this up from scratch on your own.

00:20.430 --> 00:26.400
And of course this is only one possible approach you could have managed all the state individually with

00:26.400 --> 00:35.730
multiple use state states in one component here instead I use use reducer and this merged state to have

00:35.730 --> 00:42.420
all the state that belongs together well together and I use a separate component for the actual input

00:42.420 --> 00:46.970
and its label and the error text and the validation of this input text.

00:47.100 --> 00:52.410
And of course that's all that's just one possible pattern now in production of course you might not

00:52.410 --> 00:54.750
want to reinvent the wheel all the time.

00:54.750 --> 00:59.910
So instead of writing all that validation logic manually here as I mentioned already you might want

00:59.910 --> 01:06.870
to check out solutions like validate J S which gives you reconfigured validation patterns and functionalities

01:07.290 --> 01:11.280
so that you don't have to well add your own email regex and so on.

01:11.280 --> 01:17.400
You can also look into packages like formic which is a third party react package that all the works

01:17.400 --> 01:22.770
for React Native which makes adding forms and validating forms even easier.

01:22.890 --> 01:27.710
And you can check out the official box to learn more about it and to also learn how to use it and react

01:27.720 --> 01:30.900
native apps because you'll find a description about that there.

01:30.930 --> 01:35.580
However I found it more interesting to show you what happens behind the scenes and how you can set up

01:35.580 --> 01:40.290
something like this from scratch because ultimately discourse is about becoming a developer and not

01:40.290 --> 01:42.700
about becoming a copy and paste or I guess.

01:42.750 --> 01:48.600
So I hope this was helpful for understanding what's happening behind the scenes how you can manage validity

01:48.600 --> 01:51.630
and value as elegantly and in a reusable way.

01:51.720 --> 01:57.810
And we will all reuse these inputs later in the authentication section once we all to add an off indication

01:57.810 --> 02:03.690
screen and there we will then also see how easy it is to add yet another form to this application.
