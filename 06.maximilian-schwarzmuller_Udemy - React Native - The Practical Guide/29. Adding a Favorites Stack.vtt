WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:06.680
Now with the tabs added We're missing content in the favorite screen.

00:06.740 --> 00:12.960
Now we don't really have functionality to add favorites yet if we click that star icon that doesn't

00:12.960 --> 00:13.640
do anything.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.370
And by the way I'm aware that we're missing content here as well.

00:16.380 --> 00:17.680
We'll add this later.

00:17.880 --> 00:22.140
So click on the star icon doesn't do anything yet and we'll only be able to make that do something a

00:22.140 --> 00:23.370
bit later.

00:23.490 --> 00:29.040
Still I want to populate this favorite screen a little bit more at least with some dummy meals we're

00:29.040 --> 00:30.340
loading there let's say.

00:30.480 --> 00:35.640
And at least with the functionality to also go to the meal detailed screen there because in the end

00:35.640 --> 00:39.080
the idea here is that we have a list of meals here just as we have it here.

00:39.090 --> 00:44.460
After we select that category that we can tab on a meal to go to the details page just as we can do

00:44.460 --> 00:45.620
it in the meals Navigator.

00:45.660 --> 00:50.940
So in the meals stack navigator I should say and therefore in the end what we need for favorites for

00:50.940 --> 00:58.620
our favorites tab is not a single screen but in numbers stack a stack for our favorites feature in his

00:58.620 --> 00:59.330
application.

00:59.340 --> 01:02.750
That's what we need here.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.960
This will then by the way also give us a header which we're currently also missing.

01:07.470 --> 01:10.020
Of course that's not too hard to implement.

01:10.110 --> 01:18.500
We can simply create a numbers stack navigator above our tap screen contact maybe and this will set

01:18.500 --> 01:21.390
up the stack Navigator for our favorites stack.

01:21.530 --> 01:26.630
So the object we pass here has to define all the screens you want to have in that stack.

01:26.630 --> 01:30.830
And that would be the favorites screen itself with the list of our favorite meals.

01:30.830 --> 01:36.470
And they I want to point at favorites screen and then I want to have a meal detail and I'll point at

01:36.710 --> 01:42.710
meal detailed screen and we're already using the meal detailed screen here in our meals navigator in

01:42.710 --> 01:44.000
our Amber stack navigator.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.230
But that's totally fine.

01:45.230 --> 01:49.030
You can use one and the same screen in different stack navigators.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.540
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:51.710 --> 01:58.340
So we can use meal detailed screen here in the favorites stack Navigator as well and now I just want

01:58.340 --> 02:03.550
to make sure that I also copy my options here my default navigation options.

02:03.560 --> 02:09.170
This second argument actually for a create stack navigator for the meals navigator to my favorites stack

02:09.170 --> 02:10.070
Navigator as well.

02:10.070 --> 02:15.680
So here as a second argument to create stack navigator I copy in that object where I set up my detailed

02:15.680 --> 02:22.430
navigation options so that for this stack I have the same defaults I have the same hairstyle and therefore

02:22.430 --> 02:29.330
of course we can also cut this from here and remove this from here and store a debt default setting

02:29.330 --> 02:39.100
in a constant here maybe our default stack nav options that's this object which sets up the header style

02:39.330 --> 02:45.670
we can then use the default stack nav options here in our meals navigator stack.

02:45.840 --> 02:52.800
And also here in our favorites stack navigator and all the stored is in the FAF navigator constant of

02:52.800 --> 02:55.330
course you can name this constant whatever you want.

02:55.410 --> 02:57.230
Now it's that fat Navigator.

02:57.270 --> 03:03.890
So that created stack Navigator a component in the end which I want to use in my tap screen config there

03:03.920 --> 03:09.420
for meals we were already using a stack Navigator for favorites I was using the favorite screen and

03:09.420 --> 03:10.720
this now has to change.

03:10.720 --> 03:16.620
This note should be the fat navigator so that here we all use a stack instead of a single screen.

03:16.680 --> 03:23.220
And with that already if we go to favorites we have our title here at least we have a header which already

03:23.220 --> 03:27.000
proves that we're using stack navigated here.

03:27.080 --> 03:31.870
Now of course a screen is not really that useful not something I want to say here.

03:31.920 --> 03:37.500
So I want to set specific navigation options for to favorite screen and we can either use stood here

03:37.560 --> 03:43.290
when we create the favorites stack navigator with the longer form where we set up screen and the navigation

03:43.290 --> 03:47.340
options for that screen here or we do it directly in our component.

03:47.370 --> 03:48.570
That's what it did thus far.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.330
That's what I'll do here as well.

03:50.340 --> 03:55.560
There we can set up favorite screen dot navigation options like this.

03:55.740 --> 03:57.610
Use the object here.

03:57.630 --> 04:03.900
We don't need to function because all not derived name dynamically here and in the navigation options

04:03.900 --> 04:11.700
here I simply will set the header title to your favorites and of course you can pick any text you want

04:11.700 --> 04:12.210
here.

04:12.330 --> 04:17.880
And if we now save that now we see our custom title here which is a bit better.

04:17.880 --> 04:24.090
Now as I said we don't really have the tools yet to store meals as favorites.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.410
That's something we'll do in a in a while.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.160
So for now I just want to display some dummy meals here.

04:29.160 --> 04:36.000
Let's say the meals with the idea M1 and M2 simply two dummy meals.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.670
And for that we can go to the favorite screen and instead of displaying this view here in the end I

04:41.670 --> 04:45.000
want to display the same as in the category meals screen right.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.480
I want to render a flat list which then renders my meal items here.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.620
The only difference is which meals I render.

04:53.640 --> 04:58.300
Dad logic will not be the same because that's different for my favorite screen.

04:58.320 --> 05:03.480
This however will be the same and since I will reuse that list creation logic and the only thing that

05:03.480 --> 05:09.570
differs is the data which I render it would make sense to outsource this list into a separate component

05:09.750 --> 05:15.140
so that we can reuse that component in the category meals screen and into favorites screen.

05:15.180 --> 05:20.970
So in the components folder I'll add a meal list J.S. fall and in there I want to have a react component

05:21.000 --> 05:30.210
so import react from react and we'll all need to import flat list from react native and we'll also need

05:30.210 --> 05:34.470
to import style sheet from react native of course.

05:34.470 --> 05:42.500
And then here we can create our meal list component where we get props and we export that as a default

05:42.500 --> 05:43.180
thereafter.

05:43.190 --> 05:49.940
We'll also need some styles so we can already add styles she'd create here like this and now I want

05:49.940 --> 05:56.690
to move over my list logic from category meal screen into this new component so all a cut doesn't ha

05:56.930 --> 06:04.640
J is X code which I return here in category meal screen and moved it here and return it in in meal list

06:04.910 --> 06:06.380
in the meal list component.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.720
So now here I will return that view.

06:08.720 --> 06:16.000
Therefore we also need to import the view here of course that also means we have to bring over the look.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.340
So here is screen style can also be cut from category meals and therefore here we don't need a style

06:21.340 --> 06:22.370
sheet anymore.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.700
We can get rid of the style sheet import as well.

06:24.700 --> 06:29.650
We can actually get rid of all react native imports because we have no react native specific component

06:29.680 --> 06:37.000
in here anymore and instead moved out to meal list so they're and histology I can add this screen which

06:37.000 --> 06:42.540
I just removed and a more fitting name therefore probably is lists all renamed us.

06:42.610 --> 06:47.590
Technically you don't have to rename it but it makes sense because this is now not a screen component

06:47.590 --> 06:52.570
anymore it's just rendering a list which then happens to be the only part on our screen but that's a

06:52.570 --> 06:56.590
different story so I'll just named as list have my flat list in there.

06:57.960 --> 07:02.240
They'll of course displayed meals which I want to render that won't work anymore.

07:02.240 --> 07:09.170
Instead I simply expect to get some data from my props here maybe name it list data you can choose any

07:09.170 --> 07:15.380
name you want here of course and render meal item that's all the missing for Dad and the category meals

07:16.190 --> 07:17.030
we can cut.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.570
Cuts this render meal item constant here.

07:20.570 --> 07:25.250
Cut it from the category meals screen and move Dad into our meal list as well.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.240
So they're in the meal list component.

07:27.290 --> 07:33.890
I'll add this constant which holsters render meal item function which has everything it needs to work

07:34.160 --> 07:37.650
except for one thing the meal item import is missing.

07:37.760 --> 07:49.160
So we need to import meal item from DOD slash meal items so from the meal item component when everything

07:49.160 --> 07:51.470
will be missing here in the Middle East component as well.

07:51.470 --> 07:56.300
And that will be the navigation prop because as I mentioned the navigation prop is only available in

07:56.300 --> 08:02.390
components that are loaded with the help of navigator by react navigation and only in that component

08:02.420 --> 08:04.100
not in nested components.

08:04.100 --> 08:09.620
So the thing is category meals is the component where loading with the help of the navigator.

08:09.620 --> 08:12.630
And if we then use to me a list in there which we'll do in a second.

08:12.690 --> 08:18.920
The meal list will not have access to proper navigation only the directly loaded component has access

08:19.400 --> 08:21.790
but that will be an issue that's easy to solve.

08:21.890 --> 08:30.530
First of all however let's import meal list here from the meal list component and let's return meal

08:30.650 --> 08:38.690
list here in the category meals component and now meal list of course needs stat list data prop which

08:38.690 --> 08:39.920
we're working with.

08:39.920 --> 08:46.900
So let's pass in list data and that should simply point at the array we want to render which in this

08:46.900 --> 08:48.130
case is displayed.

08:48.140 --> 08:53.110
Meals and now as I mentioned will have a problem with the navigation prop.

08:53.260 --> 09:00.760
Well we can just forwarded though we can use navigation at such a prop here to meal list and forward

09:00.790 --> 09:01.960
props navigation.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.170
That is how easy we can forward this to the meal list.

09:06.200 --> 09:11.660
So now in the meal list in that component will have a navigation prop again because we are forwarding

09:11.660 --> 09:16.940
it we're adding our own navigation prop and we're pointing at the data we get on the navigation prop

09:16.940 --> 09:18.810
provided by react navigation.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.480
That's how we have access to it again.

09:20.540 --> 09:26.850
Here and with that we should have a setup that works.

09:27.240 --> 09:33.570
So that should be our category meals screen let's save it and let's ignore the favorite screen for the

09:33.570 --> 09:40.110
moment and just see that our stack navigator here still works and it seems to do that.

09:40.160 --> 09:48.820
If I test that that definitely still works here as it was before now let's make sure we all used as

09:48.820 --> 09:50.620
in the favorite screen.

09:50.620 --> 09:55.320
So here on the favorite screen we don't need to import anything from react native.

09:55.330 --> 10:01.270
Instead we just need to import to me a list component we just created from components and then meal

10:01.600 --> 10:06.670
list and simply return meal list.

10:06.730 --> 10:11.500
And now the difference to the category meal screen where we all return your list is of course the data

10:11.510 --> 10:12.150
we want to render.

10:12.190 --> 10:14.410
The logic for deriving that data.

10:14.410 --> 10:15.880
That's the difference.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.250
And no difference between the components is of course our navigation option setup and the header title

10:20.260 --> 10:21.450
we're setting.

10:22.030 --> 10:26.680
We can't get rid of the stalls you'd here we don't need that anymore here the favorite screen and now

10:26.680 --> 10:27.820
the data I want to render.

10:27.970 --> 10:30.010
Well that depends on my meals.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.960
So we'll import meals

10:34.440 --> 10:42.060
from now from the dummy data J.S. file and as I mentioned here since we have no real way of setting

10:42.080 --> 10:47.120
favorites I'll just use some some dummy favorites which I come up with.

10:47.160 --> 10:55.710
So here my favorite meals that could be my meals array and there I want to filter for two specific meals

10:55.860 --> 10:57.500
so I'll have a look at every single meal.

10:57.540 --> 11:05.510
But I only return true if meal idea is equal to M one or if meal I.D. is equal to Amcu.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.480
And that's of course just some dummy logic so did we have something here.

11:09.600 --> 11:15.330
We'll replace this later once we really know how to manage our state and how to manage the currently

11:15.330 --> 11:17.580
set favorites.

11:17.610 --> 11:23.730
Now to me a list to our component here we can forward the list data prop again which we need in there

11:23.820 --> 11:36.840
so we can forward list data and set us equal to fast meals just like that.

11:36.850 --> 11:38.980
So now we should have some favorites as well.

11:39.010 --> 11:40.990
And we do we got two favorites.

11:40.990 --> 11:47.440
However if I click on it we get on the find is not an object where we try to call props navigation navigate

11:48.670 --> 11:54.520
and yeah the problem of course is that in the meal list as I mentioned reusing the navigation prop and

11:54.550 --> 11:59.560
that's only available in the component that is directly loaded through a navigator.

11:59.590 --> 12:05.440
So in this case that's the favorite screen and in category meals we solve this by forwarding the navigation

12:05.440 --> 12:11.080
prop of course we need to do the very same thing here for our favorite screen.

12:11.080 --> 12:17.170
So we need to provide that navigation prop here on me list and forward props navigation so that that

12:17.170 --> 12:22.800
navigation prop with the navigate method is available in the meal list component as well.

12:22.870 --> 12:29.940
Now with Dad if we go to favorites we are indeed able to go to the detailed screen.

12:30.130 --> 12:37.690
So this is working that's pretty decent pretty nice as you see these two stack navigators all the work

12:37.720 --> 12:38.700
independent of each other.

12:38.700 --> 12:44.200
We can be on the detailed screen in both stacks separately here I'm on the detail screen of the Selman

12:44.470 --> 12:50.410
in the meals tab and I can go to the toast to y detailed screen in the favorites tab can go back here

12:50.530 --> 12:54.840
and the meals tab and I'm still on it hosts the Y details page here in the favorites stack.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.670
So these two stacks were separate from each other.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.350
Totally independent and that's how it should be.

13:00.610 --> 13:06.130
And this is how we can reuse some logic and how we can have different stacks merged into one and the

13:06.130 --> 13:07.760
same tab navigator.

13:07.810 --> 13:11.900
And even though some logic is still missing the logic to really add favorites.

13:11.950 --> 13:17.620
This is a huge step forward and hopefully shows you the power of rack navigation and how to set up this

13:17.620 --> 13:24.490
common navigation pattern where you have taps and then different nested stacks one navigation pattern

13:24.490 --> 13:25.920
is missing which I want to show you.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.210
And that's a side draw.
