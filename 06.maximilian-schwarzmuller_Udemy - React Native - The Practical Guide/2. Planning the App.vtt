WEBVTT

00:02.390 --> 00:04.640
So what will we build in this module.

00:04.670 --> 00:11.390
We'll build a simple app and then this app will not focus too much on the app itself or build a basic

00:11.390 --> 00:17.240
app here will not add too many features because I instead want to focus on all these coordinate device

00:17.240 --> 00:17.930
features.

00:18.080 --> 00:24.140
So we'll build a a simple application which allows us to manage some great places we found let's say

00:24.530 --> 00:29.820
so on the starting screen we'll have a list of those places where we maybe have an image.

00:29.930 --> 00:36.110
Then the title and then here the the address of that place and we'll have such a list here where we

00:36.110 --> 00:38.090
can view all these places.

00:38.090 --> 00:46.130
Now once we tap such a place where taken to the to the detail screen for that place where we see a bigger

00:46.130 --> 00:56.510
image where we then also see the address and below that we see a map preview which we can also tap to

00:56.510 --> 00:58.780
open a full screen map.

00:58.790 --> 01:05.360
So to go to a new screen essentially where we of course also can go back just as we can go back here

01:05.390 --> 01:06.130
by the way.

01:06.260 --> 01:12.320
So where we can go back where we then see a full screen map representation of that place.

01:12.320 --> 01:19.790
Now of course to add new places we'll have a way of doing that will have a plus or a create button here

01:19.880 --> 01:20.950
in the menu.

01:21.020 --> 01:29.120
And when we tap this button we're taken to yet another new screen which allows us to add a place.

01:29.120 --> 01:36.080
Now on this screen we can enter a title with a regular text input but we can all do and that's not the

01:36.080 --> 01:37.440
interesting part.

01:37.490 --> 01:40.790
We can also take a image and display a preview here.

01:40.790 --> 01:50.960
So we have a take image button here below that which we can press and dad would open up the device camera

01:50.990 --> 01:58.010
of course so that we can take a photo with the device camera and below that I or I will all they have

01:58.010 --> 02:02.180
a map preview and we can locate the user.

02:02.210 --> 02:14.170
So we have a locate button here or choose on map button which obviously should fit onto the page and

02:14.350 --> 02:15.230
not overlap it.

02:15.340 --> 02:20.260
But these are the two buttons we'll have here choose on map and locate and dad will then while you were

02:20.260 --> 02:26.020
picked the location where the user is currently at and populate this map preview with it or if you click

02:26.020 --> 02:29.880
choose on map will also open that full screen map here.

02:30.040 --> 02:35.200
But now in a mode where we can tap on a place there and then this place will be selected and we can

02:35.200 --> 02:43.120
then click save up here to save that place and use that place here for this screen and there ultimately

02:43.120 --> 02:46.810
will also have a save button which we can press to at this new place.

02:47.020 --> 02:54.690
Now new places will be stored in a sequel light database.

02:54.690 --> 02:59.790
Now of course you might want to store them on a web server but you already learned how that would work.

02:59.790 --> 03:05.160
So in this model I want to focus on a new storage technique which you also need in some apps where you

03:05.160 --> 03:08.290
store something on the device and on device database.

03:08.520 --> 03:14.580
And that is of course also a common scenario not all data needs to be stored on web servers maybe you

03:14.580 --> 03:18.960
have an app where you need to store everything on a web server but you also might have some data in

03:18.960 --> 03:22.580
some apps which you only need to store locally on the device.

03:22.590 --> 03:26.470
The advantage of storing it locally of course is that you need no Internet connection.

03:26.490 --> 03:29.210
The disadvantages that it can't be shared with our users.

03:29.220 --> 03:34.640
But if it's exclusive to this app installation then you might absolutely want to store it locally.

03:34.710 --> 03:39.720
So down for this is what we're about to build regarding the navigation on it's not the most complex

03:39.720 --> 03:46.140
app because we had plenty of practice with that but we'll have plenty of amazing native device features

03:46.140 --> 03:51.160
in their camera maps user location files storage and also sequel Lite.

03:51.180 --> 03:56.310
So with Dad you'll have a solid understanding of how to tap into such features and ATM to your application

03:56.490 --> 03:58.050
when you're done with this module.
