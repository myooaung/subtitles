00:02.500 --> 00:05.370
In the last lecture we styled our text inputs,

00:05.370 --> 00:12.880
now let's say we want to have a standard text input which has the same styling all over the application.

00:12.900 --> 00:17.760
Let's first of all style it appropriately to have that styling, for that,

00:17.790 --> 00:25.440
let's say our text input which we style here with the input property should have a border width of

00:25.490 --> 00:30.120
one, should have a border color of maybe a light gray-ish

00:30.120 --> 00:37.450
look here, should then have some padding, maybe five and some margin, maybe eight.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.230
If we now save all of that,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.020
we let our application reload,

00:41.220 --> 00:43.760
we get these inputs here.

00:43.830 --> 00:48.410
Now you see on Android we still got that underlying color, to get rid of that,

00:48.450 --> 00:55.740
we can go to the text input and actually add an extra property which is underlineColorAndroid,

00:55.860 --> 01:00.190
this will simply be ignored on iOS which we can set to transparent.

01:00.420 --> 01:04.560
We do that, then we should get rid of that on Android too,

01:04.570 --> 01:07.170
now here we go.

01:07.170 --> 01:10.380
So this could be our default text input

01:10.380 --> 01:11.610
we want to use,

01:11.670 --> 01:17.010
the problem is we defined our style here in the auth file, whenever we want to use it anywhere else, 

01:17.010 --> 01:23.680
let's say in the share place file where we also create or where we also handle some user input or in

01:23.680 --> 01:24.750
the place input component

01:24.750 --> 01:30.100
therefore, whenever we use it somewhere else, we have to redefine these styles.

01:30.120 --> 01:36.570
So for styling reasons alone, it makes a lot of sense to create some custom components which basically

01:36.570 --> 01:43.980
give you pre-styled elements and the best approach would be if you then could override the styles you

01:43.980 --> 01:45.540
set up there. For that,

01:45.540 --> 01:51.020
I'll go into my components folder and I'll create a new sub-folder which I'll name UI, to indicate

01:51.020 --> 01:57.450
that this holds some UI components which don't have much logic in there but really are just basic building

01:57.450 --> 02:00.840
blocks with some default styling. In there,

02:00.840 --> 02:10.290
I'll add my default input, you can name it whatever you want with the DefaultInput.js file.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.820
Now I'll turn this into a functional component,

02:12.910 --> 02:16.660
default input, which receives some props therefore

02:16.990 --> 02:23.650
and of course wants to return some jsx so I'm going to import react from react so that we can render

02:23.650 --> 02:25.000
jsx

02:25.150 --> 02:32.800
and ultimately, I'm going to export default input as the default of this file.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.840
Now here my goal is to render a text input,

02:35.980 --> 02:44.890
so I should probably import text input from react native and then I'm just going to grab the text input

02:44.920 --> 02:46.140
I have here

02:47.310 --> 02:51.080
from my auth component and render it here,

02:51.850 --> 02:55.050
let me also distribute the properties over multiple lines.

02:55.060 --> 02:57.960
Now obviously I don't want to hardcode the placeholder,

02:58.090 --> 03:07.060
I'd expect to get this on props and I could say props placeholder but an easier approach is to simply

03:07.060 --> 03:14.300
add some dynamic expression here and then use the spread operator to distribute any props

03:14.350 --> 03:19.540
we don't pull out explicitly anywhere else over the text input,

03:19.540 --> 03:27.160
this allows us to use this default input just like the normal text input and add any props that the

03:27.160 --> 03:33.470
normal text input supports and we don't explicitly have to bind them here, so we can get rid of this.

03:33.520 --> 03:39.840
I do want to bind my style here though and I do want to leave underlineColorAndroid here because my

03:39.840 --> 03:43.060
default input shouldn't have that in this app

03:43.060 --> 03:49.570
and now I also need to import stylesheet here to set up these default styles for the text input.

03:49.840 --> 03:55.460
Let's go to the auth file and let's copy the entire styles object,

03:55.540 --> 03:58.260
I can already remove input here

03:58.410 --> 04:02.710
and let's go to the default input, add the entire styles object

04:02.710 --> 04:09.420
and of course remove everything but the input. With that, we get our default styling set up here, we assign

04:09.420 --> 04:16.620
it here then, styles input and with that, we have a reusable default input.

04:16.620 --> 04:24.390
We can now go back to auth.js and import that so let's import default input with a capital D at the beginning

04:25.250 --> 04:33.090
and let's move to our components folder to the UI folder and then to the default input file we just

04:33.090 --> 04:34.050
created.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.710
And now we can replace text input with default input,

04:37.710 --> 04:44.280
we can still bind placeholder because we distribute the props on the default input but we can get rid

04:44.280 --> 04:47.980
of these styles here because we don't need them anymore,

04:48.330 --> 04:52.970
we can get rid of underlying color transparent because we also don't need that anymore,

04:53.010 --> 04:56.080
we set this up by default in our input.

04:56.110 --> 05:01.620
So now if we save this and we go back to the application, it looks just as it did before

05:01.840 --> 05:08.280
but now we have this in a reusable component which of course ensures we can use this anywhere where

05:08.290 --> 05:09.670
we want.

05:09.670 --> 05:17.400
Now in the next lecture, I want to show you how we can combine this idea with basically replicating cascading

05:17.480 --> 05:22.120
style sheet functionality, let's start with this in the next lecture.
