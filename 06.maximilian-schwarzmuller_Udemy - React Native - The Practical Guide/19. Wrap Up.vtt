00:02.480 --> 00:06.130
We added a lot of navigation functionalities to our application,

00:06.260 --> 00:08.430
we got tabs, we get the side drawer

00:08.600 --> 00:15.620
and if we add an awesome place like Munich again, then we then find this place and click on it, we can

00:15.620 --> 00:16.880
also go on that page

00:16.910 --> 00:21.530
and don't forget that authentication page we had before all of that tabs stuff here,

00:21.760 --> 00:23.540
this one here.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.040
This is all looking very nice,

00:25.040 --> 00:27.700
a lot of features were implemented here.

00:27.710 --> 00:35.690
Now what we can still do is we can change the styling of our application but I got an entire module

00:35.690 --> 00:43.510
coming up on styling, how to adjust styles to different sizes of the device, to different operating systems,

00:43.550 --> 00:47.300
so why don't we do all of that in this module.

00:47.360 --> 00:54.070
So let's now move on and let's work on adding more functionality to the app and to setting up a nicer

00:54.080 --> 00:55.070
styling,

00:55.130 --> 00:57.290
all of that in the next modules.
