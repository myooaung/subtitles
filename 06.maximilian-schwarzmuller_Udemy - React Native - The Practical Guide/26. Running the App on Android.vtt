00:02.310 --> 00:05.270
So let's now all the test is on Android and for dad here.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.450
I have to explode up on Android Open now.

00:07.530 --> 00:15.360
Let me take a picture of this QR code and permits does overlay and now it is should open up the app

00:15.360 --> 00:18.050
here in Android on my real phone of course now.

00:18.180 --> 00:22.950
And here again all enter a little test title here.

00:23.040 --> 00:29.120
Then take an image and allow access to that.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.940
Take this image here let's say it looks beautiful.

00:33.010 --> 00:35.500
Also crop it accepted.

00:35.650 --> 00:37.020
Now forward location.

00:37.030 --> 00:45.510
I'll pick that on the map maybe your safeties and that looks good.

00:45.510 --> 00:48.850
And now if I click save here that's all looking good.

00:48.870 --> 00:52.720
Here's my item here's the place it just created.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.410
I can go to the map and do it there.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.010
And now if I close this

00:58.810 --> 01:06.690
and I again scan does again to reopen the app I should hopefully Lotus and yes I do from my local sequel

01:06.700 --> 01:08.330
storage I have.

01:08.380 --> 01:16.870
So with that I get this working on Android and also on I was on real devices and with that we added

01:16.900 --> 01:19.090
native device functionality to our app.
