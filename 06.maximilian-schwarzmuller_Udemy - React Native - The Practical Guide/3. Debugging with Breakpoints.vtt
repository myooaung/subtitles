In the last lecture I showed you how to use console log to do some debugging,

00:09.380 --> 00:14.160
now make sure to also actively debug js remotely here if you're running two simulators as I do,

00:14.180 --> 00:21.340
so really both are connected and now I want to show you something else. In your code, you can also set breakpoints,

00:21.380 --> 00:27.860
so in this debugging tool I said the elements tab would not be helpful as most other tabs but the sources

00:27.860 --> 00:29.490
tab is helpful.

00:29.840 --> 00:33.430
There you can go into your debugger worker.js path

00:33.450 --> 00:37.720
here, let me just increase this, access localhost,

00:37.730 --> 00:45.020
there you should see your project folder and you can go into source, into any of your react files,

00:45.020 --> 00:47.150
into any of your javascript files,

00:47.150 --> 00:52.750
so here I'll go into the app.js file and then you can add a breakpoint here before adding the place

00:52.760 --> 00:53.830
for example.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.850
Now I added a breakpoint,

00:55.850 --> 01:01.020
now let me go back to the simulator and let me enter Munich and hit add,

01:01.070 --> 01:02.240
now you see it's stuck,

01:02.240 --> 01:03.800
it's not adding it.

01:03.800 --> 01:11.450
The reason is it's paused here and now, we can use the normal debugging capabilities we always had here,

01:11.630 --> 01:19.000
we can inspect the value of place name, it's Munich and we can walk through our code step by step or whatever

01:19.010 --> 01:22.500
we want to do, whatever you normally do in your javascript debugger.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.760
So that's extremely useful of course,

01:24.770 --> 01:30.250
this allows you to really dive into your code and find mistakes you might have.

01:30.470 --> 01:37.310
And whilst console log is nice for some quick and easy state output debugging, this is the best way to really

01:37.310 --> 01:41.620
dive into your code and find that error that's blocking you.

01:41.630 --> 01:48.020
So let me now resume execution and you see the place is now added, we can interact with it as always

01:48.020 --> 01:55.670
but now, you know how to set breakpoints and that is a huge feature that really helps you and your productivity.
