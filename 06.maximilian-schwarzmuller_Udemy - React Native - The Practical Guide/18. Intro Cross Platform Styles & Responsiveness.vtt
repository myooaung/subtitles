00:02.480 --> 00:06.250
So we already covered quite some ground in this module,

00:06.260 --> 00:12.590
we had a close look at all the different things you can do when it comes to styling in react native apps

00:12.830 --> 00:16.800
and our course project evolved quite a bit.

00:16.940 --> 00:22.050
Now we've got some problems though and we might not even see them, so what is the problem?

00:22.400 --> 00:25.490
We're developing for different platforms right,

00:25.490 --> 00:32.930
we're developing for iOS and for Android and you might have noticed that for most components, react native

00:32.930 --> 00:39.380
doesn't provide any default styles and it certainly doesn't automatically style them for the different

00:39.380 --> 00:40.420
platforms,

00:40.640 --> 00:46.790
the button component was an exception from that but most of the time, we got no styling or just the same

00:46.790 --> 00:47.690
styling,

00:47.900 --> 00:55.060
so we don't really get out of the box cross-platform styling, so that is something which is missing.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.020
Take our icons for example,

00:57.020 --> 01:00.260
we're using the same icons on both platforms.

01:00.630 --> 01:06.480
Now another problem we might have is the orientation of our device,

01:06.500 --> 01:14.400
right now we always code for portrait mode and we also use rather big screens, rather modern devices.

01:14.510 --> 01:21.650
What if we have smaller screens or the user rotates the device, we might end up with a layout that just

01:21.650 --> 01:23.170
doesn't work anymore.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.540
So the problem here is that we get no built-in responsiveness,

01:27.920 --> 01:35.510
our application, our UI doesn't automatically adapt. Well to some extent it does, if we use flex box because

01:35.510 --> 01:41.720
it will still just distribute the available space but we may end up with the situation that our objects

01:41.790 --> 01:47.510
just get crunched into each other due to limited space being available.

01:47.510 --> 01:54.120
These are the issues I want to solve over the next lectures when we'll have a look at how we can style

01:54.140 --> 02:00.660
for different platforms and for different devices or device widths for different sizes.
