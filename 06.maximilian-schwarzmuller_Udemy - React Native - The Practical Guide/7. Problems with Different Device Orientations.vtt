00:02.350 --> 00:05.330
Right now our app is always fixed to portrait mode.

00:05.350 --> 00:11.440
If you rotate the device which you can do with your emulator controllers here on Android with these

00:11.440 --> 00:14.230
two buttons here you can rotate it.

00:14.320 --> 00:19.960
It's then resized here but you can rotate it and when I was on the simulator you can use the top menu

00:19.960 --> 00:26.080
here to rotate left or right or use the shortcuts you see here which by default should be command.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.090
Or on windows in the next control and then the left and right arrow key.

00:30.130 --> 00:36.400
So with Dad you can always rotated but what you'll see is that your screen doesn't rotate and that happens

00:36.400 --> 00:44.710
because in Expo apps you can easily lock the device orientation in your app Jason File in this file

00:44.710 --> 00:49.930
you configure your app and we'll come back to this file for this cause to change different things.

00:49.930 --> 00:55.670
The one thing we're interested in right now is this orientation prop. You see here it's set to portrait

00:55.670 --> 00:56.160
here.

00:56.170 --> 01:00.160
And that means that this app can only be used in portrait mode.

01:00.160 --> 01:05.110
Now that's a useful feature to have because some apps really need to be locked.

01:05.140 --> 01:11.410
Some apps make no sense in landscape mode and you have a lot of apps out there in the wild which actually

01:11.470 --> 01:12.450
are locked.

01:12.460 --> 01:17.110
So if you have an app where you know it only works in portrait mode you can set this to portraiture

01:17.200 --> 01:18.730
to lock it to that.

01:18.880 --> 01:24.160
You can also set it to landscape to make sure that your app can only be used in landscape mode.

01:24.160 --> 01:30.970
Some games need that for example you can also set this to default and default means that it can be rotated

01:31.080 --> 01:33.190
that both orientations are supported.

01:33.220 --> 01:35.120
So let's use this now.

01:35.380 --> 01:42.430
If you save debt you'll see that if you now rotated it still doesn't change what you need to do is you

01:42.430 --> 01:48.910
simply need to open the task manager on your emulator or real device and close the app once all the

01:48.910 --> 01:50.520
year on Android.

01:50.770 --> 01:57.160
And with that closed if you restarted here but pressing a and I hear in that terminal where NPM start

01:57.160 --> 02:03.300
is running it will restart the app and now you'll be able to rotate this year on us and on Android.

02:03.400 --> 02:09.740
But there you first of all need to pull down from the top here to open this menu here and that enabled

02:09.750 --> 02:15.940
rotation by clicking this button with it enabled you can also rotate on Android now what you'll of course

02:15.940 --> 02:19.610
see is that when you rotate it might be broken again.

02:19.660 --> 02:29.140
For example here in Android we can't really reach our start game button and on ISIS it's the same there.

02:29.200 --> 02:35.470
We also have the additional issue that our soft keyboard is overlapping does input if we open it.

02:35.470 --> 02:37.470
That's of course not ideal.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.590
I also can't close it anymore.

02:39.640 --> 02:45.920
So here I'm basically stuck No I can close it here in the simulator but on a real device that would

02:45.920 --> 02:46.880
be a problem.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.240
And I also can't reach my start game button here.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.040
So that's something you also need to test when building an app and you can even make sure that it always

02:55.040 --> 03:01.670
works by locking your orientation or as we should do it now but making sure that this all looks good

03:01.850 --> 03:03.840
because right now it doesn't with these buttons.

03:03.950 --> 03:07.640
And most importantly works on all orientations.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.440
So that's the next thing we'll dive into.
