00:02.710 --> 00:06.120
Again a lot of functionality was added over the last lectures,

00:06.190 --> 00:10.460
let's now add a side drawer, so some side menu we can use.

00:11.050 --> 00:14.600
You can again dive into the official documentation to learn more,

00:14.620 --> 00:21.030
it's on the top level API and you register such a side drawer directly when you start a tab or

00:21.040 --> 00:22.450
single screen app,

00:22.690 --> 00:30.010
so there you got this drawer option you can set to register a drawer that comes in from the left or

00:30.010 --> 00:31.010
right,

00:31.090 --> 00:34.590
there are a couple of other steps involved though and I will show you how that works.

00:35.320 --> 00:40.100
First of all before we can start, we need a screen that acts as our drawer,

00:40.180 --> 00:43.560
so that is the screen that comes out from the left or the right.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.720
So I'll add it here and let's simply name it side drawer because that's what it is,

00:50.030 --> 00:54.350
here's our SideDrawer.js file.

00:54.520 --> 01:02.950
So the side drawer now simply is a normal react component, can be a functional one, a functional component

01:02.980 --> 01:04.990
or a class based one,

01:05.170 --> 01:10.770
I'm going to go for the class-based one as pretty much for all my screens,

01:10.770 --> 01:16.400
so let me import this from react and then I get my class and I'll name it side drawer,

01:16.500 --> 01:18.260
you can name it whatever you want.

01:18.390 --> 01:20.930
It extends my component

01:21.160 --> 01:23.690
and in there as always we have our render method and so on,

01:23.690 --> 01:26.990
so it's just a normal react component in the end,

01:29.320 --> 01:39.310
we return some jsx and of course we export this side drawer as the default of this file.

01:39.710 --> 01:45.730
Then I'm going to import some components from react native to actually build something here

01:46.180 --> 01:48.830
and for now, let's simply add a view here

01:49.650 --> 01:54.350
where we output some text side drawer

01:54.370 --> 01:59.090
maybe, we can fine tune this later. For that,

01:59.090 --> 02:01.510
I need to import these two components so I'll

02:01.520 --> 02:06.810
import a view and a text and this is our side drawer component,

02:06.950 --> 02:11.080
all we need for now. Now to load it,

02:11.180 --> 02:18.080
I go to start main tabs because as I just showed you in the documentation, you register your side drawer

02:18.160 --> 02:18.870
there.

02:19.070 --> 02:25.130
Well actually, you first of all go to app.js because you need to register it as a screen,

02:25.360 --> 02:29.380
this can be a screen with or without redux, whatever you need,

02:29.720 --> 02:32.630
I'll register it without because I don't need it right now,

02:32.780 --> 02:35.660
so awesome places and I'll just name it side drawer,

02:35.690 --> 02:38.120
you can name it side drawer screen if you want.

02:39.270 --> 02:43.430
I need to import it in this file therefore to be able to register it,

02:43.440 --> 02:46.410
so let's import side drawer from

02:49.440 --> 02:51.810
source screens,

02:52.680 --> 02:55.630
not that but side drawer

02:55.640 --> 02:57.800
and there, the side drawer file

02:59.050 --> 03:03.040
and in our generator function, we simply return the side drawer

03:03.040 --> 03:16.500
now. Now with it registered as a screen, now we can use it in our start main tabs file because there, where

03:16.520 --> 03:24.650
we have this object configuring our tab based app, we now don't just pass our tabs but after that, I will

03:24.650 --> 03:30.110
now also set up the drawer configuration which is a javascript object and you can learn more about this

03:30.110 --> 03:33.360
in the react native navigation documentation of course

03:33.920 --> 03:38.070
and there you can specify either left or right

03:38.180 --> 03:43.370
and now I want to get a drawer from the left. And now we can configure this left drawer here, it's another

03:43.370 --> 03:46.660
javascript object and we have to set a screen,

03:47.120 --> 03:51.780
so here it's awesome-places.SideDrawer,

03:51.860 --> 03:56.020
so that identifier you chose here.

03:59.890 --> 04:02.550
With that, you registered a side drawer,

04:02.710 --> 04:10.180
now if you save all files and you reload your app and you login, do you see a side drawer here? Well

04:10.180 --> 04:17.120
you can actually see it if you manually slide in from the left, you don't have a toggle button up here

04:17.380 --> 04:21.070
and you see that the side drawer text is below the status bar

04:21.220 --> 04:26.640
but technically it's here. Now on Android let's also reload there, login,

04:29.640 --> 04:31.490
there this slide part

04:31.500 --> 04:32.550
doesn't really work

04:32.550 --> 04:38.670
so there we would need to add a menu button and it would be nice to have one on iOS too because otherwise

04:38.670 --> 04:40.290
it's totally random

04:40.290 --> 04:44.460
if a user finds out that we have a side menu or not.

04:44.460 --> 04:48.020
So this menu button is not added automatically,

04:48.210 --> 04:53.130
instead we have to add it and we have to add it for each tab screen,

04:53.250 --> 04:58.230
so here when we set up our tabs, here is where we also can register buttons that should show up in

04:58.230 --> 04:59.510
the navigation bar

04:59.700 --> 05:03.750
and that's not limited to the menu button, so this button which opens the drawer

05:03.750 --> 05:09.750
by the way. Any buttons you want to have up here like a plus button to add a new item,

05:09.750 --> 05:12.200
you would register it here.

05:12.270 --> 05:20.180
So let's first of all fetch a new icon for this, so I'll get an image source and the icon i want

05:20.190 --> 05:22.470
is ios-menu,

05:23.280 --> 05:24.360
pick size

05:24.450 --> 05:29.290
30 here too and then for the first tab,

05:29.390 --> 05:36.470
I'll add a new option, new configuration which is navigator button, so buttons which should be added

05:36.620 --> 05:38.020
to the nav bar.

05:38.220 --> 05:43.700
It's a javascript object and there you can add buttons on the left and right and you can always learn

05:43.700 --> 05:44.350
more about this

05:44.380 --> 05:50.750
as I said in the documentation, there if you inspect the tab set up, you will find the navigator buttons

05:51.050 --> 05:56.180
configuration and you can find the details for that configuration a little bit further down.

05:56.180 --> 06:03.950
So here we can set up left buttons which is an array of all the buttons we want to add and each button

06:03.950 --> 06:10.910
is a javascript object now where you can set an icon, there it's sources with index too now because

06:10.910 --> 06:12.100
it's my third icon,

06:12.340 --> 06:18.850
the icon coming from this promise and maybe a title menu which optionally is displayed.

06:19.720 --> 06:23.560
Now let me copy this because I want to use the same set up on the second tab,

06:23.680 --> 06:29.020
it by default doesn't add it to all the tabs because maybe you don't want to use such a button on one

06:29.020 --> 06:29.940
of the pages,

06:29.980 --> 06:33.480
maybe the side menu should only be available in one tab,

06:33.580 --> 06:36.190
that's why you have to add it to every tab you want to use it,

06:36.220 --> 06:39.250
it doesn't make any assumptions about this.

06:39.280 --> 06:45.220
Now if you save that file and you reload your app and login, now you have this button but it doesn't

06:45.220 --> 06:47.460
do anything, on Android

06:47.530 --> 06:49.150
it even crashes now.

06:49.690 --> 06:51.150
We'll take care about the crash later

06:51.160 --> 06:56.480
but it's also a pity that it doesn't open the drawer when we click it on iOS.

06:56.500 --> 07:01.600
The reason for this is that now we added a button but remember that I said you could add any buttons

07:01.600 --> 07:02.650
you want,

07:02.650 --> 07:04.620
how would react native navigation

07:04.620 --> 07:08.160
know that this button should toggle the side drawer?

07:08.200 --> 07:14.010
It might be logical for you but you could have added any button, a button which adds a new place which

07:14.010 --> 07:16.210
should fetches the user location, it

07:16.450 --> 07:18.160
could be anything.

07:18.250 --> 07:23.430
So we have to manually wire this button up to our side drawer and

07:23.630 --> 07:26.590
we do this in our screens we're loading,

07:26.620 --> 07:32.630
so in the share place screen and in the find place screen. Let's start with share place,

07:32.740 --> 07:35.320
how do we hook this up?

07:35.360 --> 07:42.080
We need to listen to some navigator events. Let's learn how this works in the next lecture because that's

07:42.080 --> 07:43.590
an interesting part on its own.
