WEBVTT

00:02.150 --> 00:09.140
So let's get started with implementing authentication and one very important step towards that is that

00:09.140 --> 00:16.370
we add a new screen to off screen which is the screen that should present a log in or sign up form which

00:16.370 --> 00:19.910
the user can use to well log in or a sign up.

00:20.130 --> 00:24.080
And therefore here in the off screen all important react from react.

00:24.260 --> 00:31.070
And I'll also import some things from React Native because from there from React Native I want to have

00:31.070 --> 00:36.740
the the scroll view because we'll build a forum and I want to make sure that users on all device sizes

00:36.740 --> 00:38.420
can interact with it.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.290
I will add a stylish sheet here and that should be it for now.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.690
We can always add more if we need more.

00:44.960 --> 00:50.990
We can also already include a view and the keyboard avoiding you I guess to make sure that all inputs

00:51.050 --> 00:52.970
are always reachable.

00:52.970 --> 00:58.160
Now speaking of inputs of course will add a form and therefore I will reuse the input component we built

00:58.160 --> 01:02.630
in the forums section which I can find into components UI folder.

01:02.720 --> 01:07.670
So make sure you watch this section to know what this component does and how we can manage a form with

01:07.670 --> 01:09.620
it.

01:09.620 --> 01:17.650
With that we can create you off screen component here which receives props and we can also create that

01:17.650 --> 01:22.140
Stiles object with the style sheet the create method there.

01:22.150 --> 01:27.510
And of course export the off screen like this.

01:27.540 --> 01:33.150
Now obviously the question now also is how do we present this off screen how do we make sure that we

01:33.150 --> 01:35.520
see this if we're not logged in.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.620
Now that's something we'll refine for this module but to get started we can go to the navigator and

01:40.620 --> 01:46.200
make sure that when the app launches we see that off screen and for this we can use a special new navigator

01:46.200 --> 01:51.930
which we haven't used before which is specifically built for you could almost say for dis authentication

01:51.930 --> 01:56.950
use case and that sticks creates which navigator function that helps us there.

01:56.970 --> 02:02.550
So it creates such a switch navigator the special thing about this navigator is that it always displays

02:02.550 --> 02:08.160
exactly one screen and you can't go back to to another screen if you then navigate to a different one.

02:08.160 --> 02:13.710
So going back is explicitly not allowed which is exactly what we want because you shouldn't be able

02:13.890 --> 02:18.040
to go back to the log in screen if you did just log in.

02:18.090 --> 02:24.750
So they offer here at the bottom of the file I'll create a new navigator maybe my main navigator the

02:24.750 --> 02:31.770
name is Said hoodie up to you of course with create switch navigator and justice before this navigator

02:31.920 --> 02:38.670
takes an argument where we can figure it so an object where we configure it and there I want to bind

02:38.880 --> 02:46.260
my off screen and also of course my shop stack there after no to have a nice header I will also create

02:46.260 --> 02:55.560
my off navigator here which is a stack navigator created with create stack navigator and in there I'll

02:55.560 --> 03:00.430
just map the off screen which I just started working on and for this of course we need to import it.

03:00.450 --> 03:09.210
So in that shop navigator J has file we can import off screen from screens off is user off screen like

03:09.210 --> 03:10.060
this.

03:10.180 --> 03:16.880
And with that import added If we go down we map this here too often the off navigator and the off navigator

03:16.880 --> 03:23.640
and then maps two off here in the switch navigator and shop is of course mapped to the shop navigator.

03:23.640 --> 03:28.770
And now it's the main Navigator which we wrap with create app container and therefore with that if we

03:28.770 --> 03:34.110
saved us we will actually rendered you off screen as the first screen which right now will not render

03:34.140 --> 03:35.820
any valid J as x.

03:36.060 --> 03:43.980
So we get an error but we can work on that of course because they're the goal now is to render dis authentication

03:43.980 --> 03:53.880
screen where we can well log in and do our thing so here I want to present these inputs and I'll actually

03:53.880 --> 04:02.750
also import the card component from components UI card to have this nice card look here and have my

04:02.750 --> 04:07.400
inputs in there and of course this is totally optional but here I'll add it here I'll add the card and

04:07.400 --> 04:14.030
in the card we can add to the scroll view so that we can scroll inside of that card of course you could

04:14.030 --> 04:19.100
also add the scrolled you around the card so that you can scroll on the overall screen but I'll do it

04:19.100 --> 04:27.650
like this also add my own style here to the card which I'll name off contain or maybe name is totally

04:27.650 --> 04:36.540
up to you and I'll all the wrap a view around all of that here as a wrapping view where I will add a

04:36.540 --> 04:46.880
style which I'll name screen actually here we can already use the keyboard avoiding you I guess with

04:46.940 --> 04:56.730
a behavior of padding and then this vertical keyboard vertical offset off let's say 50 so now instead

04:56.730 --> 05:04.720
of deads drove you here which we have in our card we can start adding the inputs the customer input

05:04.720 --> 05:11.590
we built earlier in the course for example here and input with the IDF email and a label of email because

05:11.590 --> 05:19.780
there I want to fetch thee well user email address and therefore do keyboard type of email dash address

05:19.810 --> 05:22.750
which is supported both on ISIS and Android.

05:22.750 --> 05:28.980
It should also be required and I want to use the email validator these are two of the validation functionalities

05:28.990 --> 05:36.540
I built into the input earlier and this course also auto capitalized should be turned off so I'll set

05:36.540 --> 05:42.630
a non because capitalized in the email address is really not helpful and the error message I want to

05:42.630 --> 05:52.190
show if we have something wrong and there is please enter a valid email address something like that.

05:53.210 --> 05:58.460
Now when the value changes so on value change we want to do something but for now I'll not do anything

05:58.460 --> 05:58.670
here.

05:58.670 --> 06:04.790
Just provide a empty function so that we don't get an error in the initial value which I want to show

06:04.790 --> 06:05.120
here.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.260
Well that's just an empty string.

06:08.270 --> 06:12.530
In the end because I don't want to provide any other initial value.

06:12.530 --> 06:17.420
Now of course it's not the only input so I'll repeat this because I also need a password input here

06:17.900 --> 06:26.810
with a label of password and keyboard type here should be default because I want you off the normal

06:26.810 --> 06:27.500
text keyword.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.490
But I want to obscurity input sort of we can't see it.

06:31.490 --> 06:34.630
And that can be done by adding to secure text entry here.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.250
This is of course not a prop supported by my custom component.

06:38.330 --> 06:44.000
But keep in mind that in this component we forward all props to the built in text input and the built

06:44.000 --> 06:48.710
in text input supports this secure text entry property here.

06:48.710 --> 06:51.050
So that's why I can set this here.

06:51.100 --> 06:55.370
The validation should also not check for that being an email address but make sure that we have a min

06:55.370 --> 07:02.450
length of let's say five characters auto capitalization can be turned off here as well.

07:02.450 --> 07:08.660
Error message would be Please enter a valid password and with that I just saw that here of course I

07:08.660 --> 07:14.510
have a typo that should be email address here password and I'll leave this here as it is

07:17.440 --> 07:19.650
now in order to be able to submit this.

07:19.660 --> 07:29.020
I also need a button so here I will import button from HREOC native and add two buttons actually in

07:29.020 --> 07:29.790
the card.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.370
And therefore also instead of the scroll view the first button has a title of log in let's say and will

07:38.370 --> 07:44.940
later switched us to be evil or log in or sign up depending on the mode we're in and the color is important

07:44.940 --> 07:52.570
towards is added with the help of the colors constant which you should import in all these colors constant.

07:52.670 --> 08:01.190
I will use colors dot primary and on press at the moment can simply point at an empty function and I

08:01.190 --> 08:06.320
will repeat this because I won't have a second button where I say switch to sign up and of course this

08:06.320 --> 08:13.550
will alter then later say switch to log in if we are in sign up mode and there we can maybe use our

08:13.550 --> 08:18.720
AXON color if we now say that we should have a basic log in screen.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.870
Here it is doesn't look the way it should look but we have our inputs here.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.580
We have these two buttons.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.970
Also on Android once this is done loading.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.040
Here we go.

08:28.180 --> 08:31.360
And now of course I like to stylus appropriately.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.570
So let's go down to the style sheet.

08:33.570 --> 08:40.550
And please note I have two styles in the end assigned screen and off container so here into styles I

08:40.550 --> 08:43.920
want to add both screen and off container.

08:43.920 --> 08:50.390
These are the two styles I plan on working with now for the screen all set flex to one and then justify

08:50.390 --> 08:57.050
my content in the center and align the items in the center to have centering both on the vertical and

08:57.110 --> 08:58.730
horizontal axis.

08:59.120 --> 09:04.090
And on the off container I want to set a width of let's say 80 percent to not take the full available

09:04.100 --> 09:10.100
width and a max with actually a 400 pixels in case 80 percent would be more than that we restricted

09:10.100 --> 09:22.710
to 400 pixels and maybe a height of let's say 50 percent but a max height of all the 400.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.150
Let's see how that looks like.

09:24.150 --> 09:25.950
We saved this.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.230
This is what I get here.

09:27.230 --> 09:32.960
Now I can scroll in there because I setup such a scroll view and actually that's not the behavior I

09:32.960 --> 09:33.910
want.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.570
I'll not set a height here.

09:35.570 --> 09:39.620
I'll just add a max height so that this is capped at a certain height.

09:39.620 --> 09:44.500
But by default it just takes as much height as required and therefore I Robert instead.

09:44.540 --> 09:49.820
Add some padding so that we have some space around the inputs and it doesn't sit on the edge of the

09:49.820 --> 09:50.440
card.

09:50.450 --> 09:56.420
So this looks much nicer and let's see how that looks like on Android Yeah.

09:56.440 --> 09:57.870
Looks generally OK.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.730
If I tap in there does all the scrolls up.

10:00.730 --> 10:06.860
So to keyboard avoiding you is doing its job but of course I still get an error here that on input change

10:07.040 --> 10:11.190
is causing an error because yeah I added on value change here.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.070
That should be on input change not on value change.

10:15.070 --> 10:18.370
So that's a little fix but we're heading in the right direction.

10:18.430 --> 10:20.740
Now I'm not done though I want to have a header title.

10:20.740 --> 10:24.950
And how about some background color here that would also be nice probably.

10:25.080 --> 10:32.680
So for that regarding the header title of course we can add offscreen dot navigation options and work

10:32.680 --> 10:39.070
with some static options for now because I just want to add a header title here and set this to please

10:41.480 --> 10:46.700
authenticate or just authenticate something like that.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.090
And for the background.

10:48.110 --> 10:53.680
Well of course we could give our view here which holds everything a background color.

10:54.380 --> 11:01.280
But I actually want to show you a new component which we haven't used thus far for this we need to install

11:01.280 --> 11:09.480
a brand new package and that's the expo dash linear gradient package which you installed with NPM installed

11:09.480 --> 11:12.480
dash dash save Expo linear gradient.

11:12.510 --> 11:16.190
This is a package which allows us to add a linear gradient with ease.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.270
So in a very simple way.

11:18.570 --> 11:25.080
And after this has been installed you just need to install at just import from X bowl in your gradient

11:25.800 --> 11:32.760
and you do import a component which does exposes the linear gradient component.

11:32.770 --> 11:39.730
Now that's a component which you can use in your page and here all use it inside of the keyboard avoiding

11:39.730 --> 11:47.770
view linear gradient like this and wrap it around all the other content like this here and now you can

11:47.770 --> 11:48.600
configure that.

11:49.240 --> 11:56.060
And there I want to make sure that this has a color is key which allows us to set the colors but we

11:56.200 --> 12:02.080
should transition because a gradient is simply a a gradient between multiple colors at least two.

12:02.080 --> 12:08.040
But you can't add more and there you can now just add colors like red or by adding the hex codes.

12:08.230 --> 12:16.510
And I want to transition between f f EDF F and let's say an amber hex code F F E free f f and of course

12:16.510 --> 12:19.020
you can experiment with different colors here.

12:19.030 --> 12:26.860
Now we also need to add a style here and I will named as styles gradient which we can now add down here

12:28.330 --> 12:36.040
and this gradient will take a width of 100 percent and a height of 100 percent so we'll take all the

12:36.040 --> 12:40.560
width and height it can get does this same for how it looks like.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.890
But now we have a problem.

12:41.940 --> 12:46.300
Of course our content isn't centered anymore to ensure that this is the case.

12:46.440 --> 12:52.410
We now need to add justified content in the line items again and deal for a here on the surrounding

12:52.410 --> 12:53.010
screen.

12:53.010 --> 12:55.880
We can't get rid of that.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.490
Now we have the same look as before.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.930
Obviously we can therefore also achieve this by not setting width and height but just flex one.

13:02.200 --> 13:07.210
So now with this setup here and it's important that the screen doesn't try to center because otherwise

13:07.210 --> 13:08.610
degraded will be centered.

13:08.620 --> 13:15.510
But with this setup we now have this look with this nice gradient and to see our header title here we

13:15.510 --> 13:21.960
just need to make sure that in the navigation setup in the shop navigator we assign our default navigation

13:21.960 --> 13:23.850
props to the off Navigator.

13:23.970 --> 13:29.670
So I'll add the second argument to create stack navigator and default navigation options just points

13:29.670 --> 13:34.980
at default nap options which sets up the header coloured headed hydra color ends on

13:39.730 --> 13:45.190
of course make sure you have no typo here and you off screen navigation options in the off screen as

13:45.190 --> 13:46.480
I do.

13:46.480 --> 13:50.950
So is that fixed does this the setup we have here of course you can experiment with the colors and use

13:50.950 --> 13:54.830
different colors if you prefer that I'm happy with that.

13:55.060 --> 14:01.480
And now the only remaining thing I want to fix here is my styling for the buttons some spacing around

14:01.480 --> 14:09.650
them would be nice and that can easily be added by wrapping the buttons in views here both buttons actually

14:12.500 --> 14:22.640
so do this here and now give each view style here maybe styles button container duties on the first

14:22.760 --> 14:24.980
view and on the second view.

14:24.980 --> 14:29.500
And now we can give that button container a styling down there in the style sheet.

14:29.750 --> 14:35.930
And here we can set a margin top for example of 10 to make sure that every button has a little margin

14:35.930 --> 14:40.760
to to top so that the buttons don't sit directly next to each other which I think really would help

14:40.790 --> 14:41.900
our buttons.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.350
So this looks good on I.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.280
Let's also check it out on Android.

14:45.290 --> 14:46.910
Yeah this doesn't look too bad.

14:47.810 --> 14:53.090
So it's that we have the basic setup now let's make sure that this also does something useful in that

14:53.090 --> 14:55.160
we do actually try to log in with that.
