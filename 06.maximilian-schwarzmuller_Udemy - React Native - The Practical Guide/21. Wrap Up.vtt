So a lot of content was covered in this module. We added authentication, quite complex authentication

00:09.400 --> 00:16.440
flow, quite verbose, I guess there are places where you can write that a bit leaner and split it up

00:16.440 --> 00:21.870
over multiple functions but I really wanted to keep it like this to make it really clear how the flow

00:21.870 --> 00:25.510
of things is and in which order the things are executed.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.960
I hope that worked and I can only encourage you to dive into that code and carefully work your way

00:30.960 --> 00:34.320
through it to fully understand it if you get any issues,

00:34.350 --> 00:35.900
we covered a lot of ground,

00:35.970 --> 00:42.310
this isn't trivial we have a lot of checks to do but we should have a good working authentication here.

00:42.780 --> 00:49.170
Obviously you can always build a more elaborate one, cover more cases, test it more thoroughly but this

00:49.260 --> 00:51.110
should work really nice and

00:51.300 --> 00:55.230
with that, let's move on and see how else we can polish our app.
