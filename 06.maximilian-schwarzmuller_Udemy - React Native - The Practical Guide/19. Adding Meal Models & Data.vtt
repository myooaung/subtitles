WEBVTT

00:02.390 --> 00:08.050
Now the recipes of course should be rendered on the category meals screen which is the screen reloading

00:08.050 --> 00:09.850
loading when we selected a category.

00:09.920 --> 00:14.030
And obviously to render any recipes we need them.

00:14.030 --> 00:20.930
We need recipes or meals as I also called them here and I will start by adding a new model meal J.S.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.880
where I define how a meal should look like in a app.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.840
Now does extra definition is optional.

00:25.850 --> 00:30.060
But I think it makes a bit easier to reason about our data and its structure.

00:30.230 --> 00:32.540
So I'll set up a class here and export it.

00:32.690 --> 00:39.110
And in that class add a constructor that allows us to create new reconfigured meals based on the structure

00:39.110 --> 00:41.090
we're about to set up here.

00:41.090 --> 00:44.540
Now a meal will be more complex than category.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.710
It will have an I.D..

00:46.100 --> 00:49.550
But it all will have some category I.D. to which it belongs.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.890
So multiple categories to which a meal can belong.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.380
It will have a title.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.280
So a name.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.750
And then it will have some extra feels like the affordability of a meal.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.890
So is it pricey is a cheap.

01:03.290 --> 01:09.990
The complexities of how complex it is to to make that dish based on that recipe image.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.950
Your L which point to the image on the web where this where we have a nice picture of that meal the

01:15.950 --> 01:23.470
duration it takes in minutes to to create that meal all the ingredients which should be an array.

01:23.570 --> 01:31.220
The steps we need to take to make that meal soda instructions and then for fields which help us filter

01:31.820 --> 01:40.520
is gluten free which marks Weber does is gluten free or not so this will be a boolean is vegan is vegetarian

01:42.620 --> 01:44.240
and is lactose free.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.590
These are the four fields which I'll use in this app.

01:48.590 --> 01:53.350
Now all of that data we're getting here will then be stored in properties.

01:53.390 --> 02:02.000
So here I'll set this I.D. equal to I.D. This category I.D. equals two equal two categories I.D. category

02:02.000 --> 02:09.860
I.D. this title equal to title this image you are all equal to image you are L and so on of course.

02:09.890 --> 02:16.850
So just store all the arguments we're getting in properties off that while object in the end will be

02:16.850 --> 02:18.850
created based on the class.

02:18.920 --> 02:28.250
So we'll also get our steps here of course we'll store the duration will store the complexity We'll

02:28.250 --> 02:36.260
store the affordability here of course in a property we'll store whether this is gluten free and also

02:36.260 --> 02:38.990
all the other filters of course.

02:38.990 --> 02:48.770
So is v again this is a veggie Terry and should all be stored of course and is lactose free.

02:48.770 --> 02:52.150
That will also be stored and yeah.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.450
With that I'm storing all that data.

02:54.450 --> 03:00.890
Now we can add some dummy data some dummy meals and of course you'll find those attached again.

03:01.020 --> 03:10.090
All you need to do in a dummy data jazz file is import meal from the models folder and there from yield

03:10.110 --> 03:16.320
dot JSA or just for a meal like this and now attached in the javascript file you find attached you also

03:16.320 --> 03:24.270
find that meals at REI which you can add here that is now just a bunch of recipes I prepared for you

03:24.480 --> 03:29.290
which uses or which use all the fields we set up in our model.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.510
Now that's dummy data we work with.

03:31.530 --> 03:37.470
Now let's start working with that and let's render a list of these meals on the category meals screen.

03:37.470 --> 03:43.860
Of course only meals that fit into the category we select it so that half our category I.D..
