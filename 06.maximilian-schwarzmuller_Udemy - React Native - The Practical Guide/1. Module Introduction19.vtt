WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:05.140
Our application is becoming better and better,

00:05.150 --> 00:10.970
we're nearing the end of this course but one crucial feature is missing, authentication.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.460
We got that auth screen

00:12.530 --> 00:14.280
but right now it isn't doing anything,

00:14.300 --> 00:21.770
we can't really sign users up or in and therefore anyone can use our application right now, anyone can

00:21.800 --> 00:23.410
access our backend.

00:23.510 --> 00:29.300
Now in some applications you want this but in this app, I want to add authentication. Therefore in this module,

00:29.300 --> 00:32.170
we'll have a hook at how we can protect our app,

00:32.270 --> 00:34.970
we'll have a hook at how it actually works,

00:34.970 --> 00:37.860
how does authentication work in a react native app

00:37.880 --> 00:45.090
because it is different to a traditional web app where you have views and probably work with a session

00:45.170 --> 00:49.100
and of course you will not only learn how it works but also how to implement it

00:49.340 --> 00:57.590
and along the way, you will learn about using async storage, a crucial API or tool provided by react

00:57.590 --> 01:03.240
native that allows you to store data even across app restarts,

01:03.260 --> 01:09.720
extremely important for persistent user sessions but of course useful for storing any data.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.830
So this is what we'll dive into,

01:11.900 --> 01:12.650
let's start.
