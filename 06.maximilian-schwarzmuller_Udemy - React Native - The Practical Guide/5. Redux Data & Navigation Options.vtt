How can we solve that problem that we here need to find a specific meal and we can't really use our

00:10.600 --> 00:13.600
selector here in the navigation options.

00:13.600 --> 00:19.960
No there are two possible fixes fixed number one is to be again used to good old parents to communicate

00:19.990 --> 00:22.190
between component and navigation options.

00:22.210 --> 00:29.470
As I showed it in a navigation module here in the component we are loading our meal self chorus here.

00:29.470 --> 00:37.310
We can use props navigation set parents and now set the parents to a new value here and now we can use

00:37.310 --> 00:43.300
set parents to forward the selected meal or its title to the header and whatever you set here is paradise

00:43.300 --> 00:48.340
by the way will be merged with the existing parents so this will not override them so you'll not override

00:48.340 --> 00:52.630
your meal ideas which you're retrieving here that will still be there you're just adding something new

00:52.870 --> 00:56.840
you're only overwriting a param if it already exists in the parents.

00:56.920 --> 01:04.030
So here we could add the meal title key and set this to selected meal.

01:04.050 --> 01:13.120
Title but this means that I sent these parents to my header when does component render is in the end

01:15.800 --> 01:20.270
now since this will change props we would typically end up in an infinite loop.

01:20.270 --> 01:24.710
So to break this we'll use use effect here.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.780
As I showed it in the navigation module and actually do that instead of use a fact.

01:29.780 --> 01:32.690
So here we can use use fact

01:35.230 --> 01:41.430
and as a dependency I'll specify an empty array for now and then set param here instead of the use affect

01:41.440 --> 01:42.320
function.

01:42.520 --> 01:47.290
And I won't have an empty array here instead my dependency here is my selected meal.

01:47.290 --> 01:55.150
When that changes I want to forward the new information to the header now we'll see if that works.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.250
Let's go to the header.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.050
And there we can now retrieve that form from the parameters.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.720
So here I have my meal title.

02:02.080 --> 02:09.240
I can get this with navigation data dot navigation get param meal pile.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.660
That was the name I chose when setting the parents

02:19.700 --> 02:21.590
now with the meal titles selected here.

02:21.590 --> 02:28.190
We can set header title to the meal title and comment this line out because it won't work any ways.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.140
And let's give this a try.

02:30.140 --> 02:35.660
Let's save this and go to the detail page and watch this works.

02:35.660 --> 02:40.410
You'll see a problem when it's loads initially there is no title and this only pops in.

02:40.430 --> 02:42.140
After a while.

02:42.140 --> 02:47.350
So only after it is fully loaded we see that title pop in.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.530
Which isn't too beautiful.

02:49.790 --> 02:55.340
And the reason for Dad simply is that our logic here works but since he was in fact runs after the component

02:55.340 --> 03:00.770
has been rendered for the first time we wait for the component to render for the first time until we

03:00.770 --> 03:06.980
send the parents to the title and that means that when this transition is still playing and the rendering

03:06.980 --> 03:12.400
hasn't been fully finished we're not really showing that title.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.630
That's why does might not be the optimal solution here.

03:15.650 --> 03:20.960
And I will comment this out a better solution here as cheap as it might sound.

03:21.060 --> 03:26.310
But there's also a solution which you can often use instead you simply forward the title which will

03:26.310 --> 03:31.800
need here from inside the component you're coming from so that you loaded when you are in the component

03:31.800 --> 03:36.510
that will go to this component and you send it to this component before it's loaded.

03:36.510 --> 03:42.090
So let's send the data in advance and where it coming from even add to Favorites screen or to category

03:42.090 --> 03:49.880
meal screen there we're in the end tapping item in the middle list and in both items and both components

03:49.890 --> 03:54.240
favorite screen and category meal screen we are using me a list which is good because that means we

03:54.240 --> 04:00.420
can go to meal list here and there we have this navigate action and now simply besides passing the meal

04:00.420 --> 04:06.330
ideas would be good if we hear already passed the meal title because here we have it available right

04:06.540 --> 04:13.350
item data item title that's our title of the meal by simply supplying it here we solve all the problems

04:13.350 --> 04:17.950
we have on the other screen so that's definitely the approach we want to use here.

04:18.090 --> 04:24.060
So by setting that param here on the component where we triggered a navigation action to the meal detail

04:24.060 --> 04:30.270
page we fixed this issue because now you see the title is there right from the start and we have no

04:30.270 --> 04:36.180
problem at all there and the same of course also on Android if we give it a try there my emulator is

04:36.180 --> 04:43.380
just a bit slow but you can generally see it there as well so that is how we can work with data in the

04:43.380 --> 04:50.850
header when we needed from redux and with that we have a solid first state we're able to use our redux

04:50.850 --> 04:54.830
data what we're not really able to do is change it.

04:54.900 --> 04:59.790
So that's the next step we want to add some logic so that we can change to data that we can mark favorites

04:59.880 --> 05:01.890
and that we can filter our data.
