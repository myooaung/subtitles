WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:07.030
So let's make sure we can see all the data we're working with in the place.

00:07.030 --> 00:09.310
Item i already got a feel for the address.

00:09.310 --> 00:14.820
I just need to make sure I fit that into there from the place list screen when I use the place.

00:14.830 --> 00:20.940
Item instead of passing null for the address of course we should pass item data dot item dot address

00:20.940 --> 00:23.820
in there because we should have to address stored.

00:23.820 --> 00:33.960
So if we try that and this reloads we see dummy address here and now if we add a new item with should

00:33.960 --> 00:41.260
work as a title and then the image to take a nice image and we can even move around here a little bit

00:41.260 --> 00:43.600
by pressing the key U.S. down there.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.480
So now if I take the image here.

00:45.700 --> 00:46.630
Yeah looks good.

00:47.870 --> 00:55.760
This one and confirmed by clicking on crop up there.

00:55.850 --> 00:56.900
That looks good.

00:56.900 --> 01:02.600
Now get the user location maybe and then save this does looks good.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.350
This is the address of the Google headquarters.

01:04.350 --> 01:05.550
Does looks like the image I took.

01:05.550 --> 01:06.630
So that's nice.

01:06.630 --> 01:12.240
Let's make sure that on the detail page we also see a bit more about this for that on the place detail

01:12.570 --> 01:19.890
screen here we of course can tweak this and add a scroll use so that we ensure that we can always see

01:19.890 --> 01:25.460
everything don't need a flat list here because we not have an infinite amount of items maybe just a

01:25.460 --> 01:28.690
little bit of scrolling that is required based on the device size.

01:29.180 --> 01:32.840
And then in there I definitely want to be able to output that image.

01:32.840 --> 01:36.410
So here all output my image and below that.

01:36.410 --> 01:43.270
I also want to be able to output my address and then also actually a map preview.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.190
So I'll import this as well and we'll need to tweak that component a little bit.

01:47.200 --> 01:55.110
Therefore but for now I'll just import map preview from components map preview like this and output

01:55.110 --> 01:57.830
is below my text here.

01:57.890 --> 02:06.650
Now in the text I want to have my address text in the end that's of course all data which I expect to

02:06.650 --> 02:11.040
get passed as parents or with the help of parents.

02:11.120 --> 02:16.660
So to be precise we already when we select the item we already pass into place idea here.

02:16.700 --> 02:25.200
So in the place detailed screen I can get the place I.D. by accessing props navigation get param place

02:25.230 --> 02:32.430
IDC identifier I used and then we can of course use use selector to get D fitting data from our redux

02:32.490 --> 02:33.530
store.

02:33.540 --> 02:36.680
So from react redux that's where we import this from.

02:36.780 --> 02:47.260
And then here we can get our selected place with the help of use selector pass and a function and access

02:47.300 --> 02:57.950
state places not places and then defined method to find a specific place where the place I.D. should

02:57.950 --> 03:03.920
be equal to the place I.D. We're extracting from our parents that's the place we loaded for this screen

03:03.920 --> 03:11.420
and this selected place of course therefore has an address field which we can access because that follows

03:11.420 --> 03:17.750
our place model in the end and for the image we can of course then also bind to source and set to you

03:17.750 --> 03:26.600
are I on this object we passed the source to select that place dot image you are I because in my place

03:26.690 --> 03:30.510
model there I named his image.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.440
You are eyes.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.640
That's what I'm extracting here.

03:33.940 --> 03:38.380
And for the map preview I want to pass in my location.

03:38.390 --> 03:42.590
Good thing is my map preview of course takes a location.

03:42.590 --> 03:49.430
It looks for a dislocation prop so I can pass this in and this should be an object actually with let

03:49.520 --> 03:57.340
key so we can use select the place to left for this and the LNG key which is select that place not LNG.

03:57.360 --> 04:01.540
So now we pass all of that in there.

04:01.590 --> 04:09.030
Now I'll also wrap the texture into a view and then assign some stylings here.

04:09.070 --> 04:19.490
So on the image here I want to have a style of style is not image on this view here which wraps my entire

04:19.490 --> 04:21.670
location based stuff.

04:21.800 --> 04:28.350
I want to have a style of let's say location container on this view here.

04:28.370 --> 04:29.600
A style of

04:31.980 --> 04:44.550
address container on the text your style of address and on the map reveal all the set of style and name

04:44.550 --> 04:46.400
this map.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.860
Preview like this.

04:51.410 --> 04:56.630
Now if you use the exact same names attached you find some styling which I set up for you.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.010
You can just replace your styles object with that.

04:59.120 --> 05:04.220
And this sets up styles for all these identifiers that just added to make that all look the way I wanted

05:04.220 --> 05:04.520
to look.

05:04.520 --> 05:09.200
So that's attached and you can use that to make sure you get the same styling out of the box without

05:09.200 --> 05:13.730
me writing all these styles because we've written so many styles wrote this cause here I really want

05:13.730 --> 05:18.430
to focus on the native functionality and not write those all again.

05:18.490 --> 05:23.420
And one important thing on the scroll view you all should set the content container style and they are

05:23.420 --> 05:29.300
all use a quick and dirty inline styling to set a line items here two centers so that everything is

05:29.300 --> 05:37.710
nicely centered on the horizontal axis with that we should be able to view the details about a place.

05:37.710 --> 05:41.590
One important note I use to color is constant in the styles I provided to you.

05:41.620 --> 05:50.490
So you need to make sure to import dad import colors from constants colors and with that import added

05:50.490 --> 05:56.970
here as well if you save that and this reloads you should be able to see these places on Android and

05:56.970 --> 06:00.480
of course you could show a fallback text if you have no places.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.360
But now here you see the places.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.570
And if I click on it this is the detailed screen.

06:06.750 --> 06:10.170
Now the one problem I have with that is it looks nice.

06:10.170 --> 06:10.890
That's good.

06:10.980 --> 06:17.300
But if I click on the map nothing happens and of course there I want to go to the map screen as well

06:17.300 --> 06:23.650
but in a non editable way so that I go to the map screen without being able to edit it there.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.250
That's the remaining piece.

06:25.250 --> 06:25.880
We need to add.
