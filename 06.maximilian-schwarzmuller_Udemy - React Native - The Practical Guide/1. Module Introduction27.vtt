So now did we know how to navigate a route in our application.

00:05.300 --> 00:11.270
An important building block has been covered because you'll need navigation in basically any mobile

00:11.270 --> 00:12.740
app you're about to build.

00:12.740 --> 00:19.280
What you'll also need in most mobile apps your building is a state management solution and here we'll

00:19.280 --> 00:24.600
use redux for that which is a popular state management solution for react.

00:24.710 --> 00:31.290
Now state management simply means that we need to manage the data our app relies on.

00:31.370 --> 00:37.130
Like for example in the app we built in the navigation module where we had meals where we could mark

00:37.130 --> 00:44.390
meals as a favorite and set filters where we have data that we set in one area of our application and

00:44.390 --> 00:51.710
we needed in another area too and getting debt data around effectively and updating Part B of our app

00:51.770 --> 00:53.620
if Part A changes.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.820
That's what state management is about.

00:55.850 --> 01:01.190
That's what's currently missing in this app we built in the last module and that's what we'll tackle

01:01.190 --> 01:02.140
in this module.
