00:02.350 --> 00:07.110
So now that we added a lot of functionality to successfully pick a location,

00:07.130 --> 00:10.270
let's now pick an image. For this,

00:10.270 --> 00:17.230
we're going to use another external library, react native image picker. We can click on that to visit to

00:17.230 --> 00:18.610
github repository,

00:18.610 --> 00:24.460
as always a good place to learn more about this library and how to configure and how to use it and for

00:24.460 --> 00:26.620
troubleshooting and so on.

00:26.620 --> 00:32.380
Now what this will do is it will give us this convenient action menu from the bottom where we can then

00:32.420 --> 00:38.670
either access our local photo library or take a new photo.

00:38.730 --> 00:40.650
First of all, we need to install it

00:40.710 --> 00:48.800
so that's from npm install --save react-native-image-picker,

00:48.810 --> 00:51.140
this will download it and add it to the project

00:51.300 --> 00:59.130
but since this will also connect to native device features, we as always also need to add it to Xcode and

00:59.160 --> 01:05.030
to Android. Detailed installation instructions can always be found here on the github page,

01:05.040 --> 01:14.850
there we see first of all, we add our library, this new library so we click on libraries, add files and

01:14.850 --> 01:22.890
then we go into the node modules folder of course project, search for react native image picker there,

01:23.190 --> 01:25.980
go to iOS and pick the Xcode project we find there,

01:25.980 --> 01:33.310
click add then we click onto our project name, build phases, link binary with libraries,

01:33.390 --> 01:40.110
click on the plus, filter for image and you should find the librn image picker package,

01:40.110 --> 01:46.760
click on add and then we already finished the first three steps.

01:46.820 --> 01:53.900
Now we also need to make our application aware of certain permissions we will need and provide certain

01:53.900 --> 01:59.050
descriptions, so texts that will be displayed to the user when this permission is needed.

01:59.090 --> 02:04.520
Now I'm not interested in getting access to the microphone but I want to get access to the photo library and

02:04.520 --> 02:05.420
the camera,

02:05.420 --> 02:09.210
so these two permissions need to be grabbbed.

02:09.250 --> 02:15.700
For this, let's go to the info plist file and then you can just grab these keys you see here in the

02:15.700 --> 02:19.300
documentation, ns photo library usage description,

02:19.630 --> 02:25.740
add a new row in the plist, enter this and it will be auto-completed to privacy

02:25.740 --> 02:35.450
photo library usage description and then let's simply add some description that makes sense, like who wants

02:35.450 --> 02:38.930
to share an image right,

02:38.990 --> 02:42.180
well not the best description maybe,

02:42.360 --> 02:45.320
pick one that makes sense for your application.

02:45.690 --> 02:51.930
So let's also add the second description here, that is where we don't want to get access to the photo

02:51.930 --> 02:53.240
library which we just added

02:53.250 --> 03:00.640
but to the camera, let's take a photo, so this is just text that gets displayed to the user and should convince

03:00.640 --> 03:02.770
him to give you access.

03:02.770 --> 03:06.040
That's actually it for iOS, now for Android,

03:06.050 --> 03:09.550
the steps also are pretty similar to the ones you already know.

03:09.550 --> 03:16.030
First we go to Android settings gradle, so in the Android folder, it's not in the app folder but in the

03:16.030 --> 03:22.300
main Android folder, settings gradle and at the end you add the two lines you just copied from the github repository

03:22.300 --> 03:26.730
for including and then adding this here, react native image picker,

03:27.160 --> 03:35.500
then we need to add it to dependencies in Android build gradle, so here we're talking about this file,

03:35.500 --> 03:40.050
not the one in the app subfolder but the one in the Android folder itself.

03:40.300 --> 03:45.490
There should be a build script part where you add this to dependencies,

03:45.670 --> 03:47.240
so let's have a look,

03:47.470 --> 03:54.910
build script dependencies here, below this, maybe let's add classpath and then this one, though here we

03:54.910 --> 04:01.180
already have one so let's comment out this version and use this instead which should use the latest one

04:01.690 --> 04:10.330
and then we need to update the gradle version to 2.14.1 in Android gradle wrapper gradle wrapper properties,

04:10.390 --> 04:11.880
so that's a long thing.

04:12.100 --> 04:21.490
Let's go to Android gradle wrapper and there it's the gradle wrapper properties file,

04:21.660 --> 04:28.980
this one, the distribution url which we have here should be services gradle and so on, just copy that

04:29.250 --> 04:31.440
and replace the existing one with it,

04:31.470 --> 04:34.710
though here I believe it was the same one, just to be so sure,

04:34.710 --> 04:41.150
let's use this one. Then let's add this line to dependencies in Android app build gradle,

04:41.280 --> 04:48.480
so in the other build gradle file we have in the app folder and there, we get this build gradle file,

04:48.870 --> 04:49.840
at the bottom

04:49.890 --> 04:53.730
let's add the compilation step for react native image picker here

04:54.510 --> 05:01.350
and then as a next step, let's add permissions to Android too to be able to save the image to get access

05:01.350 --> 05:02.910
to the camera and so on.

05:03.090 --> 05:09.390
For that I'll go to the Android manifest file and I'll add them here below my other permissions

05:13.680 --> 05:18.150
and finally we need to add an import to main application Java so

05:18.150 --> 05:20.240
let's copy that import path,

05:20.610 --> 05:29.310
go to main application Java and add it at the top and then you just need to add the new image picker

05:29.340 --> 05:31.280
package here,

05:31.420 --> 05:35.800
you can also use this one if you plan on customizing the dialog style, we are not doing this here though,

05:35.910 --> 05:39.650
more instructions can be found on this github page though if you want to do that.

05:39.690 --> 05:46.030
So here I am using the new image picker image import in the main application java

05:46.050 --> 05:48.540
file still, here after maps package,

05:48.540 --> 05:51.090
let's add a comma and then insert this.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.980
Make sure to save all the files you now edited,

05:54.030 --> 05:55.130
that's important

05:56.090 --> 05:58.310
and thereafter, you know the game,

05:58.370 --> 06:02.420
we probably need to uninstall our apps and completely relaunch them,

06:02.420 --> 06:09.080
so rerun the build process because we added a new native library, so I'll quickly do that on the simulators.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.980
We'll uninstall both,

06:11.300 --> 06:20.690
also make sure to close the existing process and then rebuild both the android and the ios apps from scratch

06:21.840 --> 06:29.430
and thereafter, I will rerun npm run Android to rebuild that and thereafter npm run ios to have that

06:29.460 --> 06:30.150
too.

06:30.220 --> 06:35.460
And once this is done, we install the library and we can then start using it in the next lecture.
