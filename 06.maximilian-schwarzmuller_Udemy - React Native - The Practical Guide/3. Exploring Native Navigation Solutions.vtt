00:02.330 --> 00:10.310
If you wisit the official Riak native documentation under guides you will find the point navigating

00:10.310 --> 00:11.330
between screens.

00:11.330 --> 00:14.410
That's exactly what we're talking about in this module.

00:14.540 --> 00:18.990
Now if you have a look at this you can read more about what they have to say about it.

00:19.010 --> 00:24.670
There is some built in component which only works on ios so we won't use that.

00:24.680 --> 00:29.790
You want a cross-platform solution and then they link to some solutions.

00:29.840 --> 00:37.760
Native navigation re-act native navigation and also re-act navigation which is their preferred solution.

00:38.090 --> 00:43.330
Re-activation is a third party package you can install and they then describe how it work.

00:43.490 --> 00:46.240
And in theory does package works nice.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.630
It's great the features they want to have are great.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.980
The problem chest is the features they want to have.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.880
They're not there yet and actually this re-act navigation package is very buggy.

00:57.890 --> 01:01.950
Feel free to visit that page and have a look at that project and dive into it.

01:02.150 --> 01:04.140
Right now it's far from being finished.

01:04.370 --> 01:09.530
What is a really good solution though is re-act native navigation.

01:09.660 --> 01:14.140
We open that were taken to the get up page of the project.

01:14.150 --> 01:16.860
Now this project is created and maintained by a Wix.

01:16.870 --> 01:21.400
You might know them from their annoying youtube advertisements I guess.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.430
But this package is really great.

01:23.450 --> 01:29.410
They bolted for day or re-act native app which is the app which allows their users to manage their pages

01:29.420 --> 01:30.590
they have on weeks.

01:30.770 --> 01:32.900
But we of use it totally independent of weeks.

01:32.900 --> 01:39.920
It's just a nice library we can drop into re-act native which allows us to implement navigation in a

01:39.920 --> 01:41.270
re-act native app.

01:41.540 --> 01:46.110
Now on their get up page you'll find a link to their documentation.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.020
And now here's one important note.

01:48.020 --> 01:51.950
There is a version of one and version 2 of this project.

01:52.220 --> 01:56.930
I recorded this video here after I recorded the entire course.

01:56.960 --> 02:02.510
In the meantime where you became more stable for the rest of the course we are using version 1 of this

02:02.510 --> 02:03.430
package.

02:03.740 --> 02:07.310
If you're feeling fancy you can certainly try using version 2 on your own.

02:07.400 --> 02:13.220
But if you just want to follow along without issues you should use worship one as I do in this course.

02:13.220 --> 02:17.180
It's not as if you're not on stable there's no reason to not use it.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.700
Let me be really clear about that.

02:19.700 --> 02:26.340
Now to use version 1 or 2 see dead docs off dead you should go up to these branches to this branch drop

02:26.340 --> 02:31.330
down here and there or simply choose the the one brand which you'll find.

02:31.340 --> 02:36.830
Click on it and now you basically load it to get a repository for the version of one parent and the

02:36.830 --> 02:40.720
docs are now simply to be found in the Docs folder.

02:40.730 --> 02:45.970
It's a bit inconvenient to go through that but in the end their docs are now here.

02:46.010 --> 02:50.180
These are all the articles you previously could found on a separate web page.

02:50.180 --> 02:57.440
Now it's your and important docs for us will be the installation Android and installation docs because

02:57.470 --> 03:03.130
there you'll get detailed instructions on how to install the package on iOS and Android.

03:03.230 --> 03:05.790
And that's exactly what we will do in the next lectures.

03:05.900 --> 03:12.230
Now just one important note when you see me browsing their nice web site well that doesn't exist anymore

03:12.290 --> 03:16.590
for everyone you use these articles here in the get other paws story.

03:16.610 --> 03:20.920
They contain the same content but first things first.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.910
Let's start with the installation.

03:22.910 --> 03:27.380
Let's start with installing it for iOS as in the next lecture.
