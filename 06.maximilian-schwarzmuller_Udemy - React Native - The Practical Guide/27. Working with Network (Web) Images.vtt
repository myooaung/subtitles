00:02.310 --> 00:05.400
Let's say we want to use the image from the Web.

00:05.400 --> 00:12.950
And for Dad you can simply pick one here I'll do it with Google image search let's say this one and

00:12.950 --> 00:16.640
we want to use that image on our game over a screen.

00:16.670 --> 00:20.870
Now before we use this requires some text to load a local image.

00:20.870 --> 00:23.650
Now this syntax will no longer be the right one.

00:23.650 --> 00:26.900
So I'll duplicate this line and comment it out for a web image.

00:26.900 --> 00:35.900
Instead you pass the object to source and on that object you pass a you are I prop and did you are I

00:35.900 --> 00:39.080
prop holds a string which is your link to the image.

00:39.080 --> 00:45.080
So your link to the image is passed to the you are a prop in this object which you passed the source.

00:45.080 --> 00:50.480
Now if you do that this loads the image from the web but there is one important thing you have to know

00:51.170 --> 00:52.430
for the image.

00:52.430 --> 00:54.230
Dad was loaded locally.

00:54.260 --> 01:00.250
I mentioned dad react native is able to determine its width and height and uses that as a default.

01:00.410 --> 01:06.320
Therefore for a locally loaded image you don't have to set a width and height on the image.

01:06.350 --> 01:10.120
We're doing it here because we want to override the default width and height.

01:10.250 --> 01:15.380
But if you had an image that is already perfectly sized you wouldn't have to set width and height for

01:15.380 --> 01:16.790
images from the web.

01:16.790 --> 01:22.130
React Native is not able to determine the width and the height of the image before it's loaded because

01:22.130 --> 01:24.290
it's not part of the app it's coming from a web.

01:24.320 --> 01:30.110
React Native downloads it and it's kind of a surprise regarding what the width and the height is they

01:30.110 --> 01:32.140
are for four network images.

01:32.150 --> 01:38.810
So for image as you are fetching with a link you always have to set a width and a height on the image

01:38.840 --> 01:43.840
object on the image component here for a local image is added with require.

01:43.880 --> 01:48.040
You can do that as we're doing it to overwrite it but you don't have to.

01:48.110 --> 01:51.020
That's important differentiation.

01:51.060 --> 01:58.230
Now you might have also seen that for web images downloaded image actually faded in when it was loaded

01:58.230 --> 02:03.100
for the first time and that's an ice factory OK native ads automatically for network images.

02:03.310 --> 02:09.330
It downloads that image and whilst you're waiting for the download to complete that basically shows

02:09.330 --> 02:14.880
nothing it can show the image yet but when the image is loaded it doesn't just pop it in there but instead

02:14.910 --> 02:18.940
it slowly fades it in which is a nicer transition for that loaded image.

02:18.990 --> 02:24.340
That's a nice effect and you can also control this with fade duration.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.390
You can set this to a number and the default is hundred.

02:27.390 --> 02:33.360
That would be 300 milliseconds but you can set this to a different millisecond value like 1000 milliseconds

02:33.360 --> 02:39.450
which would be one second for the image to fade and so on after the first load the image is cached and

02:39.450 --> 02:44.610
therefore subsequent usages of the same image happened pretty much instantly because it already was

02:44.610 --> 02:45.760
downloaded.

02:45.780 --> 02:49.320
So that's how to use network images and what to be aware of regarding those.
