Welcome to another course module. In this course module, we'll have a look at how we may debug our react

00:08.380 --> 00:14.920
native apps because it has been something we haven't really had a look at yet and you're obviously going

00:14.920 --> 00:20.980
to run into some errors and issues and therefore it's super important for you to know how you can fix

00:20.980 --> 00:24.250
them, how you can find the issues in the first place.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.510
So we'll have a look at all this in this module, to be precise,

00:27.520 --> 00:33.130
we'll have a look at how we can use console log even though we're not running this in a browser, how

00:33.130 --> 00:40.820
we can add even better debugging capabilities and also how we can debug redux, how we can connect

00:40.840 --> 00:45.000
the redux dev tools essentially. So super useful,

00:45.010 --> 00:50.210
let's just dive into it and let's see how we can debug our react native apps.
