In the last lecture you learned how to delete places and how to pop the current page, so to pop it off

00:08.730 --> 00:09.340
the stack,

00:09.390 --> 00:13.080
remove it from there and therefore also navigate back.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.220
We also have pop to root,  

00:15.270 --> 00:22.020
now pop to root as the name suggests pops all pages except for the root page, this is useful if you

00:22.020 --> 00:28.740
are having a lot of pages on your stack because you have a lot of nested pages and you want to go back

00:28.770 --> 00:33.960
because maybe now someone clicked delete and you want to delete the entire stack, call pop to root

00:34.170 --> 00:39.900
and you're back to the root page. And there are a lot of other methods, you can even use react native navigation

00:39.900 --> 00:43.090
to show modals if you want and so on.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.880
Now I won't dive into all of these methods,

00:45.900 --> 00:52.500
what I want to do though is I want to cover how you can add a side drawer, so a side menu you can slide

00:52.500 --> 00:54.070
out and back in.

00:54.380 --> 00:56.070
Let me show you how this works

00:56.070 --> 00:57.300
over the next lectures.
