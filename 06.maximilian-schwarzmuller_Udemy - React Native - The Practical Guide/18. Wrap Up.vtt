00:02.250 --> 00:03.090
So that was it,

00:03.090 --> 00:04.730
we added a lot of logic again

00:04.740 --> 00:06.710
but now something huge happened.

00:06.930 --> 00:14.190
Our react native application is finally connected to a server and all the places we share are shared

00:14.190 --> 00:17.350
across the whole universe of our app users,

00:17.520 --> 00:21.110
any device can see them because we stored them on a server.

00:21.120 --> 00:26.730
You learned how to upload images, how to upload the rest of the data, how to view that and fetch the places

00:27.000 --> 00:29.740
and also how to delete the places then,

00:29.820 --> 00:37.410
everything we need here. Now the one thing our application still does though is that it doesn't enforce

00:37.410 --> 00:38.680
authentication,

00:38.790 --> 00:40.300
anyone can do this.

00:40.410 --> 00:44.880
We have this nice authentication screen but we can enter whatever we want.

00:44.880 --> 00:51.360
The next step will be to add a real authentication to make sure users have to sign up and to then have an

00:51.360 --> 00:56.860
application where we clearly only grant access to authenticated users.
