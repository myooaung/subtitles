WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:06.390
Obviously this screen right now isn't dead useful and they offer.

00:06.390 --> 00:13.500
I'll now go to that text which I used as a dummy and replace it with let's say start a new game something

00:13.500 --> 00:21.480
like dead and below this I want to have an input area with a slight drop shadow so this typical card

00:21.540 --> 00:27.420
look you might know from some apps and websites where you have a box with a slight drop shadow behind

00:27.420 --> 00:29.220
it maybe some rounded corners.

00:29.400 --> 00:36.570
I want to recreate that here so I'll add a view here a view because again that is a very flexible element

00:36.600 --> 00:42.120
we can apply a lot of styles there we can add our shadow and our rounded corners there and then hold

00:42.150 --> 00:43.460
our content in that view.

00:43.470 --> 00:49.080
So that's great for having the general styling of the container and now inside of that view I want to

00:49.080 --> 00:56.910
have a text where we say select a number for example and where we then also want to have a text field

00:57.150 --> 00:58.580
where users can enter something.

00:58.590 --> 00:59.310
So there.

00:59.430 --> 01:06.300
I'll add a text input component which is that built in component where users can use the keyboard to

01:06.300 --> 01:11.970
to enter a value and here they should enter a number well configured is installed as in a second for

01:11.970 --> 01:17.820
now I'll just drop it in like that and below that I want to have two buttons sit next to each other.

01:17.850 --> 01:18.810
And that's important.

01:18.810 --> 01:25.190
Next to Java not below each other which allow us to reset the input and choose a new one or convert

01:25.190 --> 01:32.510
and the chosen one so we need a view here because that allows us to position items next to each other

01:32.660 --> 01:37.520
whereas these items are positioned above each other then because if I would just add two buttons here

01:37.560 --> 01:42.650
then I would have to change this views flex direction to have them next to each other but then the text

01:42.680 --> 01:45.420
and text input would all be sitting next to each other.

01:45.500 --> 01:51.950
So now I'll add a view here so that in this view the surrounding view this this and this view component

01:52.250 --> 01:54.010
are sitting above each other.

01:54.020 --> 02:00.590
So on the vertical axis but instead of this view I can now also make sure that the items in there then

02:00.590 --> 02:05.270
sit next to each other so in the horizontal axis and that's what I want here.

02:05.450 --> 02:11.480
So I'll import the built in button which is one of the view components that automatically adjusts itself

02:11.510 --> 02:17.540
to the underlying platform later in the separate module you will learn how you manually can find out

02:17.630 --> 02:21.990
on which platform you're running to adjust the look and feel of your app to that.

02:22.220 --> 02:29.450
Here will go with the built in button and give the first one a title of reset and the second one.

02:29.510 --> 02:32.450
The second button here a title of confirm.

02:32.450 --> 02:39.740
And then here on Press will at the moment do nothing so that's just an empty function just adding it

02:39.740 --> 02:42.000
so that we have the prop already there.

02:42.050 --> 02:43.710
Will add logic later.

02:43.850 --> 02:46.140
For now we'll just have to buttons here.

02:46.250 --> 02:51.330
Now the styling will be missing though as I said the buttons should be sitting next to each other.

02:51.410 --> 02:57.170
Hence I'll give this view here which holds the buttons a style pointing at the styles object and their

02:57.170 --> 02:59.060
let's say a button container.

02:59.060 --> 03:02.370
This name as always is totally up to you.

03:02.520 --> 03:10.930
And I also want to give this view which holds my inputs a style here referring to the styles object

03:10.960 --> 03:14.930
and I'll use to let's say input container this name of course is all up to you.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.850
And this year I want you styled as like a special title maybe with a bigger font size.

03:20.950 --> 03:27.090
So you're all assigned a style of title let's say.

03:27.300 --> 03:36.900
Now we can go down there in our styles you can add the title add the input container and also add the

03:37.080 --> 03:43.330
button container and now we can start adding some styles stair now for the title.

03:43.330 --> 03:47.330
Again I want to set the font size it's all set font size like this.

03:47.410 --> 03:58.750
Set it to let's say 20 and maybe all add some spacing on the vertical axis with margin vertical of let's

03:58.750 --> 04:09.750
say 10 10 like this and always keep in mind margin vertical basically replaces margin bottom end margin

04:09.990 --> 04:17.050
top and now on to the button container and I'll come back to the input container in a second.

04:17.060 --> 04:19.780
The button container will get a flex direction.

04:19.790 --> 04:23.790
All wrote the DFL this column but now I want to have item sit next to each other.

04:23.790 --> 04:25.870
So we need to use Roe here.

04:25.870 --> 04:31.420
I want to set a width here because if we don't set a width on the button container it would just be

04:31.450 --> 04:34.960
as wide as the two buttons are together.

04:34.960 --> 04:41.050
Instead I want to use the width of the parent solve this view here and then position the buttons inside

04:41.050 --> 04:41.880
of this view.

04:41.890 --> 04:47.140
So I want to do the opposite not style the view according to the buttons but position do buttons according

04:47.140 --> 04:47.970
to The View.

04:48.160 --> 04:55.150
So I'll give the button container this view and explicit with here and now to position the buttons in

04:55.150 --> 04:55.590
there.

04:55.690 --> 05:01.630
We can use justified content to position them along the main axis which for Flex directory row is left

05:01.630 --> 05:07.930
to right and there I'll choose space between some of the buttons sit on the left and right edge of this

05:07.930 --> 05:15.000
row and distribute all the available free space between them all the add a little bit of padding horizontal

05:15.000 --> 05:21.660
here though so that we have some spacing to the left and right instead of our view maybe 15 so that

05:21.660 --> 05:24.920
the buttons don't actually sit directly on the edges on the left and right.

05:25.020 --> 05:29.420
But there is some spacing out on the left and right OK.

05:29.560 --> 05:35.240
So with that if we save this we see that.

05:35.660 --> 05:39.860
Which I don't know about you but which doesn't look that great does it.

05:39.860 --> 05:45.650
No the problem is that the input container has no styles yet they input container holds all the inputs

05:45.650 --> 05:48.340
though which is why the stylings dare look a bit off.

05:49.040 --> 05:56.000
So we should give the input container some styling and there I want to add a width and you can now use

05:56.090 --> 06:02.690
a hardcoded width of let's say 300 pixels or use a width and percentage.

06:02.990 --> 06:11.570
Now all add with your all three hundred but also add a max width of 80 percent so that we have 300 pixels

06:11.570 --> 06:11.860
width.

06:11.870 --> 06:17.120
But if the device would be too small so that's a little bit of responsiveness which I add here already.

06:17.120 --> 06:23.300
If the device would be too small we make sure that our width doesn't exceed 80 percent and then I want

06:23.300 --> 06:25.840
to align the items in the center.

06:25.850 --> 06:29.600
Keep in mind the input container is a view therefore it uses flex box.

06:29.600 --> 06:35.420
It uses the default of flex direction column and therefore with a line item center we position items

06:35.630 --> 06:39.240
in the center on the cross axis which is left to right.

06:39.260 --> 06:44.500
So we center items horizontally now with that.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.140
Now it is looks way better.

06:46.180 --> 06:48.780
Konrad you see the input but that's the old thing right.

06:48.970 --> 06:53.710
We'll have to style it so that we can really see it we see the buttons though and we can see that our

06:53.710 --> 06:57.710
general layout and styling is taking some shape.

06:58.090 --> 07:01.440
Still I'm not 100 percent happy about the look of this yet.
