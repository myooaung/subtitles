00:02.270 --> 00:03.700
For clearing the cart.

00:03.760 --> 00:04.430
Simple.

00:04.490 --> 00:06.860
We are dispatching does add order.

00:06.860 --> 00:08.210
Action in the end.

00:08.240 --> 00:14.540
Now of course this action is currently handled in our orders reducer but we're not limited to handing

00:14.540 --> 00:15.020
it there.

00:15.020 --> 00:21.500
It's important to understand that every redux actually dispatch reaches every reducer because how would

00:21.500 --> 00:23.960
the action know to which reduce rid belongs.

00:23.960 --> 00:29.510
As I explained earlier it's the reducer that simply tells which actions it cares about and which access

00:29.510 --> 00:30.830
should not be handled.

00:31.160 --> 00:35.990
So the ad order action can also be handled in the card reducer.

00:35.990 --> 00:42.120
Alternatively you could dispatch a separate Clear card action if you wanted to but if you don't need

00:42.120 --> 00:47.400
it anywhere else there's not really a strong reason to create a separate action so we'll just handle

00:47.420 --> 00:54.260
the already existing add order action here in my card reducer There are after handling the remove case

00:54.970 --> 01:01.820
all handled the add order action verdad you just need to make sure you import does add order action

01:01.940 --> 01:08.810
from the actions folder and there from the orders file and now in that case down there we need to clear

01:08.810 --> 01:10.540
the card and that's super simple.

01:10.550 --> 01:17.090
We just need to return our initial state again because initial state and here is of course this object

01:17.480 --> 01:20.630
with an empty card and a total amount of zero.

01:20.690 --> 01:22.210
So I just want to reset this.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.320
Hence this is what I return here.

01:24.380 --> 01:30.200
The result of this is that if I add items to a card here let's say two red shirts and one blue carpet

01:30.200 --> 01:30.920
and I click order.

01:30.920 --> 01:35.990
Now the cards cleared and now we see that order here still.

01:35.990 --> 01:37.310
That's our order.

01:37.550 --> 01:38.900
So that's all we can clear the card.

01:39.050 --> 01:41.060
Let's now make sure the order looks nicer.
