Besides having a fitting client, what we also need is a fitting server.

00:07.690 --> 00:13.000
And now here's one important thing, you can use any server of your choice,

00:13.070 --> 00:18.670
you can build your own server, write your own server side code, use any server side language you want,

00:18.680 --> 00:21.520
it just has to be a restful service,

00:21.530 --> 00:25.880
so Google for PHP restful service if you want to learn how to do that

00:25.880 --> 00:32.270
for example. In this course, I don't want to dive into writing server side code here because I don't know

00:32.270 --> 00:35.280
which code you want to use and I don't want to focus on that,

00:35.300 --> 00:39.140
I want to focus on react native so I will use firebase,

00:39.170 --> 00:45.400
It's a service by Google which is basically an already configured server

00:45.410 --> 00:50.990
we can use where we then can configure it to our needs but we don't have to write or we don't have to

00:50.990 --> 00:54.860
write much server side code for it to work as it should.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.440
So what you should do is just visit

00:57.650 --> 01:01.970
firebase.google.com and then click to the console on top right,

01:01.970 --> 01:04.860
you need a Google account for that

01:04.950 --> 01:07.300
and there you see a couple of projects.

01:07.460 --> 01:13.010
Now I don't want to use one of the existing projects, I'll instead import a new one and pick awesome

01:13.030 --> 01:13.900
places,

01:14.060 --> 01:19.320
do you remember, that's the one we created for getting this Google Maps API key.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.710
There you can then pick your location,

01:21.770 --> 01:28.340
so where you're located and you can add firebase, if you are having trouble with this, you can always

01:28.340 --> 01:33.030
just create a new project by clicking on this add project button you saw before.

01:33.140 --> 01:40.430
Now in the firebase project, you got a couple of tools here on the left and we need almost none of them,

01:40.430 --> 01:44.430
the most interesting part to us right now is the database part.

01:44.440 --> 01:49.870
There, choose the real time database and what the real time database is,

01:50.010 --> 01:59.540
it's a NoSQL based or like database where you can store basically javascript objects you can say, the

01:59.540 --> 02:03.920
structure here resembles the structure of a javascript object.

02:03.920 --> 02:12.260
Now it might look like you directly write into a database here, in the end firebase just gives us some

02:12.260 --> 02:15.000
url so we can send requests to

02:15.200 --> 02:21.350
and it automatically provides the right endpoint and server side code to write into some database behind

02:21.350 --> 02:22.700
the scenes.

02:22.700 --> 02:29.390
All we have to do is target this url or some nested url if we have a nested object here in the end

02:30.020 --> 02:31.790
and write data to it,

02:31.790 --> 02:33.550
this is what we're going to do.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.710
And with that, we got all the basic set up we need for now,

02:36.710 --> 02:42.740
so this is the url we will send a request to or part of the url to be precise. In the next

02:42.740 --> 02:43.100
lecture,

02:43.100 --> 02:48.460
let's now have a look at the client we use in our react native app to really get a request to that

02:48.470 --> 02:48.950
server.
