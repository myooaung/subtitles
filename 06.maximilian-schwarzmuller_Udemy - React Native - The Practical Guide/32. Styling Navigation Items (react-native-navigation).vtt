00:02.890 --> 00:07.310
So a lot of responsiveness was covered but it was well worth it,

00:07.360 --> 00:09.820
we now got a really responsive application,

00:09.820 --> 00:12.040
we've got platform specific styles,

00:12.220 --> 00:14.410
so a lot was achieved.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.680
Now let's turn our heads towards

00:16.750 --> 00:19.790
the navigation styles, we get different icons

00:19.810 --> 00:21.620
but what about these colors?

00:21.850 --> 00:27.610
What if we wanted to actually use our own brand colors and not the default operating system colors which

00:27.670 --> 00:29.380
are picked here?

00:29.380 --> 00:33.340
It's a good thing that we get these default colors because if you don't want to change anything, you got

00:33.340 --> 00:35.140
a nice look out of the box

00:35.440 --> 00:38.500
but what if we want to enforce our own colors?

00:38.830 --> 00:41.470
We can obviously do that, you can always

00:41.470 --> 00:48.450
check out the documentation of the react native navigation API to find out how to set different styles,

00:48.490 --> 00:54.440
for example on start tab based app for our tabs.

00:54.520 --> 01:03.970
Now there, we got our navigator style, that is responsive for the navigation bar but we also got our

01:04.090 --> 01:12.520
tabs style and something like the tab bar selected button color which if we scroll to the right will

01:12.550 --> 01:14.940
need to be handled differently on Android

01:15.100 --> 01:18.510
but here for iOS, we set it on tabs style so

01:18.520 --> 01:19.810
let's do that.

01:19.810 --> 01:24.660
Let's go to start main tabs and there, we set up all the tabs,

01:24.670 --> 01:28.630
now below that, maybe before the drawer, position doesn't matter,

01:28.870 --> 01:32.510
we can set up our tabs style property here,

01:32.580 --> 01:33.240
so let's do that,

01:33.250 --> 01:35.810
let's set tabs style,

01:36.060 --> 01:40.330
it's a javascript object and there we can now define all these things.

01:40.420 --> 01:47.310
You can define a default tab bar button color but I want to define the color if we select it

01:47.520 --> 01:54.590
and if we did select it, I actually want to color it orange, let's say.

01:54.790 --> 02:04.010
So let's save this and let's reload our iOS application and submit this and we get an orange color here.

02:05.190 --> 02:10.970
Now I also want to have an orange color for this menu button here, we can style that too,

02:11.890 --> 02:16.580
we do that directly in the components where we also control that button,

02:16.630 --> 02:25.260
so in share place and find place, styling the button is as easy as simply adding a static property,

02:25.330 --> 02:31.490
you do this with the static keyword and that means it can be accessed without this having to be instantiated,

02:31.550 --> 02:35.750
this class and the name should be navigator style,

02:35.750 --> 02:38.630
you have to get this name right,

02:38.630 --> 02:47.240
then you can set the nav bar button color here to maybe also orange, like this.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.590
Now copy that also into your find place

02:51.450 --> 02:54.950
component and save that file too and

02:55.220 --> 02:55.980
thereafter

02:55.980 --> 03:03.380
once you reload your iOS application, if you login, you should have an orange button here too.

03:03.750 --> 03:04.840
On Android,

03:05.010 --> 03:12.310
we also got this button after reloading the page but tabs need to be styled differently there though

03:12.360 --> 03:20.480
and you can see this in the react navigation documentation, there for the tab bar selected color,

03:20.490 --> 03:24.560
you see that on Android you should add this to app style,

03:24.660 --> 03:25.870
so let's simply do that.

03:25.920 --> 03:34.230
Let's go back to start main tabs and let's not just add tabs style but maybe below the drawer, let's

03:34.230 --> 03:42.010
add app style, the name that is the same, it's just a different place due to internal reasons.

03:42.220 --> 03:49.770
And with that set up, if you now reload Android and submit this, you got orange buttons here too.

03:49.870 --> 03:54.260
This is how easy you can style your navigation related items

03:54.490 --> 04:00.730
and for more information on how to style what and how to adjust this, always check out the official documentation

04:00.730 --> 04:02.470
of react native navigation,

04:02.470 --> 04:04.080
it's really good when it comes to that.
