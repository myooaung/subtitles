We get a responsive layout here on the auth screen

00:05.500 --> 00:09.620
but we got one thing which may bugs you for quite some time already,

00:09.720 --> 00:11.020
it's not perfectly centered,

00:11.040 --> 00:13.560
our inputs are not perfectly centered.

00:13.560 --> 00:19.440
That happens because we use a margin on them and also a margin to left and right which doesn't work

00:19.470 --> 00:23.260
well together with centering in flex box.

00:23.280 --> 00:31.590
Now we can easily fix this by going into our default input component, UI folder, default input where

00:31.590 --> 00:38.340
we set up this margin and we simply switch this to set a margin to the top and then a margin to the

00:38.340 --> 00:43.760
bottom so that margin to left and right aren't set, margin bottom also eight.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.520
That's a quick and easy fix

00:45.720 --> 00:52.170
and with that once this reloads, you will see that now it is perfectly centered again

00:52.220 --> 00:54.420
and now the auth screen is really finished.
