00:02.310 --> 00:07.380
In this course we obviously covered a lot of the important things you need for building native apps

00:07.380 --> 00:12.990
with React Native navigation state management how React Native works in general how to work with components

00:12.990 --> 00:14.060
and so on.

00:14.070 --> 00:21.360
Now one thing we haven't used that much though and that's tapping into native device features obviously

00:21.360 --> 00:24.120
for many apps you're about to build.

00:24.120 --> 00:30.060
You want to use features like the device camera or at Google Maps or get the user location or maybe

00:30.060 --> 00:35.940
store some data some more complex data on the device and therefore you need to on device database like

00:35.940 --> 00:37.260
sequel Lite.

00:37.290 --> 00:41.660
So these are things which we haven't really had a look at in this course yet.

00:41.880 --> 00:47.400
And we'll have a look in this module therefore in this module in detail we'll dive into how you can

00:47.490 --> 00:53.500
easily enables such native functionalities in your react native app built with Expo.

00:53.610 --> 00:59.070
And by the way just in case you are working in a separate module later I will always show how that would

00:59.070 --> 01:01.150
work in non Expo apps.

01:01.170 --> 01:05.820
So the jury know how to build any app with any toolset that you want.

01:05.820 --> 01:10.640
So with that let's see what we're about to build in this module before we then dive right in.
