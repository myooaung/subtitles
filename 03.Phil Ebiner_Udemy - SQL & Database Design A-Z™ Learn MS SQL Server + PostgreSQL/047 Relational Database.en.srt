Hello and welcome back then we're going to be talking about what is a relational database so a relational

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,480
database is a digital database whose organization is based on the relational model of data.

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,650
So this doesn't give us that much information because we not know what relational model of data is and

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,270
we need to understand that occurs.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,650
So relational database is a set of tables to satisfy following data integrity.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,720
First of all it has to fight entity integrity meaning that there are no duplicate rows in Table different

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,490
roles can have some information shared but they can be exactly the same.

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,130
This is why we need primary key.

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:45,690
This is why we need candidate keys to be in the table for it to be a relation also relational database

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,960
has to satisfy the main integrity meaning that it enforces valid entries for a given column by restricting

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,200
the type to form a word to a range of values.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,660
This basically means that we have to put some restriction on data in order for it to be classified as

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,070
a relation rather than just a table.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,560
Next it has to satisfy racial integrity which means that drolls cannot be deleted which were used by

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,700
other records.

16
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:18,010
If you try and lead a row in Eskew or disconnected to another table it will not let you do that.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,070
It will simply give you a mistake saying that you are doing something that should not be done and you

18
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,650
can force to override it and delete it anyway.

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,960
But that will leave you were damaged and possibly corrupted database.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,860
And finally a relational database has to satisfy user defined integrity meaning that it enforces successful

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,540
business rules that do not fall into entity domain or referential integrity.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,070
So if we want to specify that some value just for us just for our company has to be not now.

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,480
So we always have to know that customer name even though it is not required for a database to operate.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,120
It is called the user defined Negroni and our database has to be able to comply with our request.

25
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,680
As you can see relational database makes a big emphasis on usability and accessibility.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,830
This is done primarily for enforcing different rules and constraint vendor database relational database.

27
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,560
Our most popular judiciary consistency and availability although they do have some limitation as any

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,260
change you have to make will require extensive work in order to satisfy all existing conditions and

29
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,930
possibly creating more.

30
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,580
Also you have to understand your database usage limits even while still designing it to ensure your

31
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,180
users will have easy access to it basically as well structured query language works who have structured

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,790
data and structure data is very good very powerful.

33
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,750
When you have specific amount of data before even designing the database so you can put it in there.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,660
You can force all the rules you can recorded and then oxyd that's done all you need to do is just work

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,580
with this data.

36
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,540
Or maybe sometimes insert new values at school is optimized.

37
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,660
Or working with structured data.

38
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,170
Use it to your advantage.

39
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:09,150
Make sure you always plan your database before designing it and input all the correct data satisfying

40
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,590
logic and your own rules.

41
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,390
I hope you enjoyed today's lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
