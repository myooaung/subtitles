00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,440
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,440
Today we'll be learning about inserting that up into our tables.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,650
So let's go ahead.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:16,360
Open up our own database our own table and create a new query that says Select all from mits movies

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,920
free it's whatever you've decided to name your table.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,500
So if we're run it we will see that they return it to us.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,340
Deidre Rose absolutely no information and this is totally fine.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,500
This is due to the fact that we haven't actually inserted or put any data inside our table is just an

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,590
empty skeleton so say today will be learning how to do that how to put in some information into a new

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,070
table.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,650
Let's go ahead.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,690
Quickly make sure that we have the columns all set up and ready to go and the keys.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,850
ErÃ¶ffnung is right.

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,150
So now all I need to do is type in insert into.

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,550
So insert into has two possible variants.

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:58,260
One you already encountered where we say insert into table name from table.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,490
This is very useful when you have the wrong table or you have previous table that you don't want to

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,210
work with anymore and you just need to create a new table and you want to save all the data.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:16,210
But today let's try to make try to insert data manually through the query by writing it with our own

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:16,780
hands.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,880
So what I want to do is insert into and of course another way is using the import data window that we

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,700
have learned when you have this pop up menu in which you select flat files or Excel file and so forth.

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,900
They will be working with manually so insert into then your table name.

24
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:40,000
In my case movies and then you want to save values so you save these open brackets and in those brackets

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,660
separated by a comma is the values that you want to insert into every column so every column is separated

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,720
by a column.

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,420
In my case let's go ahead and start filling in my favorite movies.

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,820
My first movie that comes to my mind is seven.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,650
So all right.

30
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,460
Capital S lower.

31
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,810
He has 7 pm.

32
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,000
Then I put a comma.

33
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:11,980
The year that it came out is 1995 the country came out from is USA and the genres are mystic about that

34
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:20,780
mystic and crime solvers go ahead exit could this as you can see one ROIs effect that you've run the

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,810
query which will again select all from movies.

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,880
We should see one row of data and that's exactly what we see so done perfect.

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,580
We already inserted one roll of data so far.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,050
Let's go ahead and try some more now instead of writing this query a thousand billion times what you

39
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,480
can do is you can just put a comma after the values and type in your second column.

40
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,330
So information for your second row.

41
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:57,650
In my case it's going to be a movie called interstellar that I need to put in apostrophes because it's

42
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,630
text that I need to put come up the year that it came out and is 2014 country where it originated is

43
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:15,400
USA and Joyner's of it is science fiction only has one shot or as far as I'm concerned.

44
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,800
So science fiction.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,200
Now if we run this interesting fact will happen it will not run because as you can see it gives us abolition

46
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,650
of primary key.

47
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:36,430
Basically it tells us because we already have a movie in that table called 7 in the year of 1995.

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,720
You cannot run the same movie twice.

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,320
You cannot record it twice in there because then the primary key will not be able to do its job.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,090
So basically it saved us from duplicating the data we already had.

51
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:55,700
So let's go ahead delete this and just put a comma and right and a new fresh piece of data for this

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,180
tape.

53
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,700
So you open up your brackets and for me the next movie will be called the Green movie 3.

54
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:12,470
The Green Mile so the Green Mile the year this movie came out is 1999 the country of origin is again

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,400
you say and then genre of the mystic and drama.

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,830
So now who run this what will get is actually two rows of data.

57
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,970
So now we have three rows of data in-general all the look very nice.

58
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,900
They look very neatly organized.

59
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,560
So let's go ahead fill in one more roll of data.

60
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,550
I can eat all of this.

61
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,840
Put it in here.

62
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:49,160
Idlest movie will be the flutter year of its release is 1972 the country of origin is again USA and

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,160
the janitor is right now.

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,970
Let's say we forget to put the school complete.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,660
We just forget that it exists and try trying to squirty what will happen is it gives us this mistake

66
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:11,070
that says that we did not put enough columns to satisfy the need of the table.

67
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,650
So basically we've put less columns that there actually are in the table then let's say we're going

68
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,500
to put in just nothing.

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,190
We're just going to put Not even the space just we're going to specify that it's of a day type work.

70
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,680
So it fits with our table needs but we're just going to put nothing in it.

71
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,830
So now if we execute it it will let us execute it.

72
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,360
But if we select all we can see that it left it empty and then put a null value in it just let it empty.

73
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,390
So how do we fix this how do we fix it.

74
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,430
Well there is a couple of ways.

75
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,870
First we can go for the right click menu of the table itself or we can write another piece of code in

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:06:06,240
which we'll say just spaces out of it and say update movies and set country to be equal to USA where.

77
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:16,360
And here we can just go ahead and say movie name equals the honor.

78
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,640
So now we would run this piece of code nothing would change because as you can see I made a typo here.

79
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,740
So I just have to change this and now it will run perfectly fine.

80
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,150
So as you can see any typos you make any mistakes you make in the put of data will cost you a lot.

81
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,550
Later on it will basically make your life miserable.

82
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,200
Going through all the data you have and imagine the database we worked with the first table 16 Pazner

83
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,080
rows of data.

84
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,940
Imagine you made one or two typos in there and you have to scroll through all of the data there trying

85
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,900
to find a table and then trying to understand what you forgot to input there.

86
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:00,260
So make sure every time you input data into a database that it's correct its integrity is preserved

87
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:05,910
and nothing is wrong with it because that way is the most efficient way to work with databases so as

88
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:12,630
soon as the data is already inside that address then it's all about your skills your logic the way you

89
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:20,280
operate and your efficiency but inputting the data into a secure well that can be really really hard

90
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,330
and painful.

91
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,800
So another way you can.

92
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,620
You could have done this if you could have Right-Click on the movies you want to script table as and

93
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,940
when to insert two new Querrey at a window.

94
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,460
And here you can see the general syntax that we followed so you could have just used this.

95
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,750
I just prefer the manual way because it teaches you a lot and most importantly teach you do appreciate

96
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,480
your time.

97
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,570
I hope you enjoy this lecture and I'll see you in the next hour.
