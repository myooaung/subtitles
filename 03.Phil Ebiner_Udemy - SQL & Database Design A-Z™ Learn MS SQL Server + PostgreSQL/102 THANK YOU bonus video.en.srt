00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,330
Welcome back to this course.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,490
Super excited super pumped to have you back on board.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,810
Today we're into mania.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,590
This is a Cradle Mountain.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,100
That over there my friends is Crater Lake.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,850
And what is this tutorial like.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:22,600
Well this trial is all about you because I wanted to say a huge congratulations on completing this course.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,080
I know it wasn't easy.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,500
It was possibly a very difficult journey.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,750
But you've got us through these complex tutorials you made the complex simple you've got to the end.

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,940
And you learned all these things from this course and I'm sure you learned a lot.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,410
And I really truly hope that you enjoyed the journey along the way.

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,570
So what we're going to do in this tutorial is we're going to throw in quite a few compilations from

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,500
Tasmania.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,720
So if you've never been to this part of Australia's island at the bottom of Australia then you'll get

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,870
a feel for what it's like here because it's beautiful so just sit back relax and enjoy Tasmania.

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,020
And one final thing I did want to ask you before you leave this tutorial and this course is that if

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:10,360
you did enjoy this course and you think that this is a faster horse please read it appropriately we

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,350
would love to see your reading and review and hear your feedback.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,210
But most importantly it will help other people from around the world understand what the quality of

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,220
this horse is like and so that they can come and learn all these things from here as well.

22
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,770
And I really hope that you can help us out of that.

23
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,250
And on that note let's get started and happy idolizing.
