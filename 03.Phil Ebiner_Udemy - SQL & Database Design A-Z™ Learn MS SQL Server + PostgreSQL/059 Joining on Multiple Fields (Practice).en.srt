00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases now that we've looked at several different types of

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,880
Joines it's time to move on to more complex things.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,890
And today we're going to talk about joining on multiple fields and let's get started.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:29,710
I'm going to create a new part and here we're going to say joining joining on multiple fields and what

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:36,850
we want to do is we want to take our procedure history table and join into the procedure Details table

6
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:46,930
so I'll explain why we want to do that so that selects our for all procedure history whoops history

7
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,390
history.

8
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,460
There you go.

9
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,620
Go get your colon and run that.

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:00,070
And so here we've got the procedure history we've got the parody with the procedure date with the procedure

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,710
type and the procedure subacute.

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,530
Right.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,690
And this table does carry information tells you which pad on which date had a procedure what type of

14
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,540
procedure in the sub code but it is still very very secretive right.

15
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,310
So it doesn't tell you while on the Pet side it doesn't tell you the pet name the owner name the owner

16
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,120
or address and so on and that's fair enough right.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,270
So because not everybody needs to know that information that information doesn't have to be disclosed

18
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,180
all the time.

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:38,550
And moreover these tables are local and so and so that's kind of a privacy protection purposes probably

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,640
And also the correct way of setting up a database.

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,110
On the other hand you've got the procedure type.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,670
So even if you don't want to know the name of the pet but you want to know what procedure they had you

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,910
can't really get to a genome that say this pet had a vaccination on the 16th January of 2016.

24
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:05,710
But you don't really know what kind of vaccination it was was in a rabies vaccination was it a different

25
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,490
type vaccination.

26
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:13,270
Pets have lots of different types of vaccination so there was an earth though paid sick procedure for

27
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,820
this pet.

28
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,020
And you AGAIN don't know exactly the code.

29
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:24,880
And again this could be due to privacy reasons or some other reasons but or more so that it's it's more

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,780
efficient way to structure a database.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,920
But regardless of what the reason behind it is how do we solve this problem.

32
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:39,200
How do we get to the actual description of the procedure that happened for each pet.

33
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,500
Well for that we have another table we have the table which is called procedure history procedure details.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:54,270
So if I just take this and up here and say procedure details and I run this you'll see that in this

35
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,860
table we've got 41 rows.

36
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,280
So it's a small table but this table is like a glossary.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,340
So here we've got the actual history of what happened.

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,370
But then if you want to find out more it's like a dictionary right.

39
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:12,600
Then you you look up that specific procedure in this procedure Details table and for instance vaccination

40
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,800
type 5 is rabies indeed.

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,940
But as you can see there's all these other different types of vaccinations that pets can have an orthopedic

42
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:30,120
type fire which we saw was a elex patella repair so you know something else and that's these that veterinarians

43
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,330
do for pets.

44
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,450
And here you actually even have the price of the procedure so you can look up not only that description

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,540
but the price as well.

46
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:45,930
And so our challenge for today or in fact this is going to be your challenge so I I propose to you that

47
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,620
we are we are venturing into new territory we're venturing into joining in multiple fields but we've

48
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,340
already spoken about that in theory tutorials and we know quite a lot about Joines.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:05,370
So my suggestion to you is pose this video and try to join these two tables together and see what you

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:05,850
come up with.

51
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,060
And your hint is that you will require multiple fields right so you can join them in one field but probably

52
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,270
the results are going to be correct since we're going into this topic of multiple fields so if you want

53
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:23,040
to get some additional hands on experience and I highly encourage you to pause the video right now and

54
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,920
give this a go see see how you go how you can join these two tables and then just play the video again

55
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,660
and see how your result compares to what I'm going to demonstrate in this tutorial.

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,370
So now I'm going to proceed.

57
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,560
So three to one.

58
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,820
Let's put this together.

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,840
So how would I go about joining these two tables.

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,530
So let's figure of sort of where we're going we forget that we're doing multiple fields.

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,490
We're just going to look at or know some some obvious way that we would join these and we would say

62
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,180
All right so we've got our parody procedure day procedure type and procedure sub code right.

63
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,160
So how about we join on the procedure sub code.

64
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:14,420
So it take select everything from procedure history and we will say what type of joint Do we want here.

65
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:24,800
Well in this case we want a left join and we want to join the procedure details and we want to join

66
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,720
on.

67
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:37,070
So this is going to be as a as b a dot procedure sub code equals B dog.

68
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,420
So what is this field called in the second table that we're joining on we want to join in this field.

69
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:49,020
You'll see that it is that description this one is probably called the same thing prestigious upcard

70
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,430
is always good to check.

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:58,210
So the procedure subgoals So now I'm going to put the call on here and if we were on this.

72
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,930
So let's quickly have a look at the procedure history.

73
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,410
We've got 2284 Rose Right.

74
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,020
So all we're doing is to each role we want to add information about this specific procedure that they

75
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,600
had.

76
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,310
And if we do that if we if we just stop for a second to think about if we do that correctly then the

77
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,590
result how many rows should the resulting table have exactly the resulting tables should have 2284 rows.

78
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,740
Because what we're doing is we're adding information.

79
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,850
There can be no duplication of rows right.

80
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,560
If we just find the information about this specific procedure there they can they can it has to be a

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,100
one to one match so our There has to be a many to one match so many of the roles from here will only

82
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:50,440
have always a one role in the procedure Details table so you cannot have a situation where this this

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,130
row would have two matching rows and the procedure Details table simply because this procedure should

84
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,600
only be described once.

85
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:58,940
Right.

86
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,480
You cannot have do a procedure on a pad and then not know what exactly you did.

87
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,910
Maybe you did this maybe you did that.

88
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,170
No.

89
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,850
There it is.

90
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,480
It's a it's an exact match so every one of these rows has to match exactly to one role.

91
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,630
So it's a many to one relationship.

92
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,800
And so if we are now run this we should have 2284 Rose run it.

93
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,480
Going to take a few seconds here we see that we have 8000 179 rows.

94
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,290
So why is that what happened here.

95
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,220
What why did we get way more rules.

96
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,210
Well if you look at the rows here you'll see right away something is going on incorrectly three from

97
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,920
the from the very start you can see that this row looks like Simmons's.

98
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,280
And the same as Rousseau's So these rows got duplicated.

99
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:53,850
Right so we've got Pead ID procedure date procedure type and and what is this procedure sub code right.

100
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,380
And then they all got matched to the.

101
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,820
So this row got much too much too.

102
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,670
What is this.

103
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,190
If you look at this God must turn in a crop and he got too much.

104
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,170
Elex patellar repair and got matched to rabies vaccination.

105
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,780
Well why is that.

106
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,700
Well because we matched on the procedure subgoal.

107
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,030
And as you can see it did indeed match up the procedure sub code.

108
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,580
So five equals five because five because five and five equals five.

109
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:21,930
Right.

110
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,350
But what we didn't take into account that we actually should have matched on two fields or should've

111
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:35,380
matched on procedure type and procedure code because procedure sub code is not a unique identifier of

112
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,010
the procedure.

113
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,310
Right.

114
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,420
So if we look at this procedure details table.

115
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:45,710
So if you have a look here subgoal one is actually an office call sub code one is actually a bad subkey

116
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,000
one is a vaccination and so on.

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,330
So there's lots of procedures that have some code one and that is because some code is not a unique

118
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,530
identifier.

119
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:07,540
It has to come in conjunction with the type so procedure type has office has three subclause procedure

120
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,240
type grooming has three subclause procedure type vaccination has five or six up because one two three

121
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,990
four five six and only together do they act as a unique identifier.

122
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,350
So that's why here we need to add procedure right.

123
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,180
Oh the Brisas your type.

124
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,820
So I'm actually going to add it at the start because I like to think keep things clean.

125
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,620
I like to it doesn't matter.

126
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:38,760
You can say here and a dot prissy your type equals VIDOT procedure.

127
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,520
Type but in my view procedure type in high in the hierarchy of things comes before procedure code.

128
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,770
So I just like to put that at the start just to you know remember that OK first when I look up the procedure

129
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,480
type like you would you know in a library you'd first find the right shelf and then you'd find the right

130
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,670
book right or the file right there right.

131
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,420
You find the right shelf and then you'd find the right position on that shelf.

132
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,850
So kind of that type of thing.

133
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,860
But again it doesn't matter you can change these around because this is an and take but the point is

134
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,010
this is how we join on two fields.

135
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,480
We look at procedure type and procedure type equals and then procedure code up code subclause so far

136
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,810
on this.

137
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,460
We have two thousand two hundred eighty four rows exactly so as you can see now everything is matched

138
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,640
up very very well.

139
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,120
All right so that is how we join the multiple fields so if you perform that exercise I hope you've got

140
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,080
the same result.

141
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,510
Don't worry it's ok we're just learning.

142
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:45,670
And even if you got a different result that's OK.

143
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,870
Now you can see that how we actually do this multiple joint field and you know have a play around with

144
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,450
that maybe add a filter or see how that works.

145
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,840
Just make sure you get comfortable with this concept of joining on multiple fields because it'll definitely

146
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,260
come in handy in your data science career.

147
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,090
And I look forward to seeing you next time.

148
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,800
Until then happy analyzing.
