Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.220
And today we're going to be talking about comments in poetry ask you all the comments are very quick

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.840
and straightforward topic so we will not spend much time on it.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.190
I just want to explain to the basics and maybe some ways you can use comments to your advantage.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.840
So the first thing we have to look at is how common to work.

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.510
So basically you have to identify to the admin that it's going to be a comment and not a piece of code.

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.900
And in project and it's done by two dashes following one another and then you can write whatever you

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.540
want.

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:42.560
And either way is just the common see since syntax is where you put a dash star and then you put another

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240
star dash and then.

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.020
So everything in between them will be considered the comment.

12
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.970
So it's a multi-line comment.

13
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.330
And anything above it or below it is still a piece of code.

14
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.500
So as you can see the double dash only works on one line so it comments everything after you put the

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.040
flash not before at all.

16
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:14.530
So we can have the double dash come in here for example and we can say work on this later.

17
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.430
Whereas a month multi-line comment works on a lot of lines and you can you know have hungered thousand

18
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.010
lines if you want it here.

19
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.670
Most common use of comments in programming at least for me so far has been that if I have a big piece

20
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.710
of goat and I'm not sure where the mistake was I can comment out different parts of the code one by

21
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.430
one.

22
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:50.010
And what will that do for me is it will show me the exact moment where my code starts working and that

23
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.890
means the dominant function had the problem and then they can take a closer look at it and start working

24
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.430
with it.

25
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.590
Another thing is that if you are quickly testing some code and you don't want to make another query

26
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.110
to you don't want to rewrite all your information.

27
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.550
You can just comment out the section that will take a lot of time to complete and quickly run your test.

28
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.860
Another thing I used sometimes is if you have you know a query and then you have multiple queries that

29
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.110
just follow one another and they just do different stuff and you have a pretty big piece of coding on

30
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.410
your hands and you just can't finish working on it now.

31
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.070
Or you know you're going on holidays at the weekend and you just can't afford to forget what you were

32
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.770
working out or you had that one idea that you just don't have the time to do.

33
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:48.630
Now you can always say here that you know you want to come and make sure to look into using having by

34
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.060
which will actually burn soon enough.

35
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.050
So we'll actually do this.

36
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.700
But basically you want to leave yourself a note or maybe a member of your team that you will send this

37
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.110
code to or who will come in to work after you.

38
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.400
And then you just go ahead.

39
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.740
You save the worry or what you want.

40
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.350
And that way when you load it up next time you will have it on your screen so you're like all right.

41
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.600
I have to use to having my statement now it all makes perfect sense.

42
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.230
So as you can see comments are a very straightforward topic.

43
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.090
You have double dash and then you have a forward slash star star forward slash for multi line comments

44
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.320
and yeah I hope you find honored that use of comments if you have any ideas just please let me know

45
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.360
because I'm very curious how to use them.

46
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.890
Apart from what I've mentioned.

47
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.870
But yeah I hope you liked Tauriel.

48
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.870
This concludes our section about queries about the basic stuff we can do with queries about the foundation

49
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.340
of it.

50
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.860
So I hope you enjoyed it.

51
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.730
I hope you learned a lot about Pazz Gray about PGE admin about coding bellhops as well and you're excited

52
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.180
about it.

53
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.110
Interested about it.

54
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.010
Happy that you already can do so much you can already work with any database that comes your way and

55
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.450
find information that you are interested in further in the course will actually teach you to create

56
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.080
your own databases work with them delete them alter them we will teach you a lot more ways to narrow

57
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.280
down the day that you want to be displayed or altered.

58
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.750
Even so there is a lot to look forward to but there is also a lot to be proud of that you've already

59
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.300
accomplished.

60
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.200
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial section.

61
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.400
The score so far and I hope to see you in the next one.
