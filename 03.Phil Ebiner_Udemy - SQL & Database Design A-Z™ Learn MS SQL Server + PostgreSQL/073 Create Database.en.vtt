00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.950
Hello and welcome to create database lecture this lecture and this whole section is based around creating

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.950
databases working with these databases and tables inside of them.

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.680
Generally speaking as you well can be divided into two parts.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.320
One is working with data itself and the second one is working with databases tables schemas and all

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200
the surrounding servers.

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.120
So it's very important to go for this section carefully because it teaches you that second part of school

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.430
usage and it's a very valuable skill in the workplace.

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.900
So in this section it's a very short section because creating databases is extremely easy.

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.530
In grad school all you need to do is first of all let's go ahead and check how many databases we see

10
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.060
right now.

11
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.420
We see free databases.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.030
Nothing too scary here.

13
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.050
So let's go ahead click on any of them.

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.740
Select Nick where he told this opens our favorite window up and knowledge it's a great database and

15
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.040
then any name you want.

16
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.120
This is the database only for you purely for your information and for your usage.

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.750
So because this is going to be my database I'm just going to name it my knowledge base.

18
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.820
You can name it whatever you want.

19
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
Just make sure that name is already taking and you will remember it.

20
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.950
So as you can see how credible might out of ACE Radie up loaded up to go and the only thing we need

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.840
do is click refresh here and there we go.

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.470
This cross represents that right now the Bush grade school server is not connected to the database so

23
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.200
we cannot get any information from this database.

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.390
All we need to do is left click on it and now it says that database is connected and it's all ready

25
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.950
to go.

26
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.660
Let's quickly go ahead check schemas check tables.

27
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.470
We have none and that's absolutely correct.

28
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.200
So congratulations you've created your first very own database.

29
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.950
It wasn't that hard was it.

30
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.640
Now there is a couple things we can add to this create database Stephen For example we can say who the

31
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.760
owner is what's the encoding like.

32
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.770
What's the privileges and some other parameters.

33
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.140
But as for now it's not important because we're creating a very simple database and we'll deal with

34
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.480
those rules later on.

35
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.460
So because we're working with graphical user interface BGR and for what we can do is we can right click

36
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.550
on the databases or any of the database and select Create and select new database.

37
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.150
Here you can put in a new name so I can just say create database my database and on I want to say to

38
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.200
the owner will remain the same Pozza gray then the definition you see in coding templates tablespace.

39
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.820
Right now we don't need any of that security sweep through as well.

40
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.770
Parameters don't need any.

41
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.840
And if you click on the Eskil window you will actually see what this does.

42
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.670
So all you do by right clicking here and selecting Crais database is you making the PGE admin for write

43
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.090
the code for you as you can see is the same code.

44
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.390
Only this one has this additional information that owner encoding connection at.

45
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.530
But because we haven't change any of them it remains the default and is executed in this query that

46
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.470
we've created ourselves regardless.

47
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.350
So right now they're exactly in the same databases.

48
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.860
The only difference being the name.

49
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.230
So let's go ahead save it and now if go ahead and refresh this.

50
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.320
We can see that there is a new database created my database too.

51
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.350
It will have again no tables and nothing in it because we only need to work with one database for now.

52
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.580
Let's quickly go ahead and press this delete drop what it does it just deletes and drops all of your

53
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.350
database.

54
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.130
Easy as that.

55
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.260
It's all gone.

56
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.980
So that was easy wasn't it.

57
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.140
The one line statement creates a whole database for you to fill in with data and tables but that's where

58
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.840
it gets tricky because when you're filling the database with tables then you have to identify all the

59
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.260
different constraints both logical and relational.

60
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.820
And we're going to be taking a look at that further down the section and then next lectures.

61
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.820
So be sure to check all of them up and I hope you enjoyed this today's lecture and I'll see you in the

62
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.570
next one.
