Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.730
Today we're talking about the full outer join.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.710
So what is the full outer join and what does it do to our tables.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.170
That's a question for today.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.690
And the first thing that I'd like to mention is a full a full outer join is a very very rare species.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.520
You won't see it's used very often and just because of it's the way it's structured and the way exactly

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.850
what it does with the tables.

8
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.230
So let's have a look on an example so we're going to take this inner join it to copy it.

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.590
But this one is a fool outer join hands now instead of just believe everything as is and here we'll

10
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.140
just say full hour and let's go ahead and run this and see what we get.

11
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.560
So there we go we've got a full outer join and let's have a look at what it does where we talked about

12
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.700
the theory behind it.

13
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.840
But here we see it in practice so as you can see full outer join takes these two tables the pets table

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.850
and the procedures history table and put them side by side and word can match it does match where it

15
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.150
can't match.

16
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240
It keeps the rows blank it keeps those cells blank so you can see here.

17
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.550
Here you got all of the.

18
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.490
So here you basically what it did it took if you look above this line above this row you'll see that

19
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.180
it took the table or the procedures history table and then where it could it matched it to the Petz

20
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.090
table and then whatever didn't get matched in that part.

21
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.570
All of the pets got place here.

22
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.590
It doesn't really matter as we discussed and scaled up in the order of the rows doesn't mean that it

23
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.030
could be completely jumbled up but that's the point.

24
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.890
The bottom line is that it basically took these two tables.

25
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.960
Tried to match them up as best as it could where it couldn't match them up.

26
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.490
It just left the unmatched columns blank or rows that didn't get matched the columns that are empty.

27
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.620
They were left blank.

28
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.410
So basically it's kind of like it's a bit it's different to a left and right and so I left.

29
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.280
So we discussed left join is the one that you'll be using most commonly.

30
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.430
And it keeps this table the one on the left completely and then it only takes the rows that match up

31
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.890
from this table right join does the opposite it keeps this table completely and then only keeps the

32
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.760
matching rows from this table.

33
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.430
Then if you are in a inner join only keeps the matching rows from both tables so trims the fat is like

34
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.910
a live.

35
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.130
But trim the fat completely So there's anything that doesn't match gets removed whereas an outer join

36
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.690
is like is the opposite of an inner join in doesn't trim anything at all it's it takes whatever is on

37
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.510
the left when I was on the right and matches them up as best I can and doesn't trim.

38
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.830
And you think they're at all.

39
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.640
So there you go that's how a full hour join works most commonly in practice left join is used for my

40
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.910
experience then comes probably an inner join and a full outer join is much much more rare than those

41
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.570
two.

42
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.370
So hopefully you enjoyed this tutorial.

43
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.740
I look forward to seeing you next time.

44
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.360
And until then happy analyzing.
