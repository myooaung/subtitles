Hello and welcome to the theory lecture behind the select query so like worry is the most commonly used

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.690
Querrey in the school and this is due to the fact that if we ever want to retrieve any information from

3
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.300
a database the queries that we use must contain select and from clauses.

4
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.500
So basically anything you want to do with tables and then altering them or creating new ones has to

5
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.850
be dealt with select statements and even when you alter some data or change some columns arose or create

6
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.480
something absolutely new you would most certainly use a Select than from statement just to make sure

7
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.550
you input all the data correctly or that the table is displaying the correct results.

8
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.590
So the mandatory elements of select query are the select list specifies what columns or attributes should

9
00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.050
be in the result table and the FROM clause specifies table or tables to be used to determine the results.

10
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.560
So you can just leave this query blank statements like you always have to say what you select and where

11
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.570
you selected from.

12
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.900
Also just a reminder as you can also be pronounced the sequel.

13
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.800
That was the original name of the language.

14
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.230
The had to change it later due to trademarks.

15
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.280
So if you ever hear me or anybody else say Eskew well or a sequel don't worry it's the same thing we're

16
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.010
still talking about structured query language and also another thing as you can see here select and

17
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.320
from original capital letters.

18
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.600
And that's the way I like to keep it even though in most software today it's case insensitive.

19
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.680
So you can write functions in small or big letters.

20
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.610
It doesn't matter.

21
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.090
But I just like to keep it this way in case you ever get to work with common line.

22
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.920
Or it can cause some troubles if you write functions in low letters.

23
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.900
So that's just the thing I like to do.

24
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.800
But in most software today doesn't matter.

25
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.190
Now let's get to the syntax of select query.

26
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.380
So when using select statement we can't specify what exact elements we want to be selected separated

27
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.180
by a comma.

28
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.650
So if we want to display column want to call them to in Column 6 all we have to do is we have to write

29
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.240
select and then the names of these columns separated by a comma.

30
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.270
And then what table want to slag them from.

31
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.260
Now if we have a table that consists of a lot of different columns for example in this section we'll

32
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.160
be working with a table that consists more than 15 columns.

33
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.420
It's going to be very frustrating and time consuming to write every column name every single time we

34
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.970
want to display all of the data and you can also make a lot of mistakes in those column names which

35
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.330
will be very time consuming again.

36
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.760
So in order to display everything from a table what you can use is select all like Star Command.

37
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.980
So again this is behind us you just write select start from and then table.

38
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.440
So this pretty much it for the select query.

39
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.650
It's a very fundamental very basic worry.

40
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.550
It has some variations some added difficulty to it.

41
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:20.230
For example you can use Select Distinct or if you will specify exactly what data you want to use with

42
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.760
where clauses.

43
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.410
If like having in conditions you can really see the potential power of select statement.

44
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:37.900
For now we just want to focus on very simple very basic uses of select statements because it's very

45
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.070
important that in this section you learn the syntax of us.

46
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.010
Q Well get used to the interface and understand the logic behind different queries.

47
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.670
So I hope you enjoy this lecture and I'll see in the next one.
