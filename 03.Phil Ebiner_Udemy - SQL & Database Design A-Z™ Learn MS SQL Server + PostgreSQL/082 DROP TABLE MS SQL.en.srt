Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,660
Today we'll be learning to delete our newly created table and our newly created database.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,120
There's a few ways you can drop them using the query field by writing a simple drop command but we're

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,950
just going to be working with a much easier way because we're working through Microsoft Excel sort of

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,210
management studio.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,110
All we need to do is like the tables window right click on the table we want to drop go down and drop

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,820
down menu sit like delete.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,400
Click here and just make sure that the right table is like that.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,490
Show dependencies is going to be later on.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,370
If you have more tables connected to one another that might be an issue because you will need to delete

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:47,180
this table of all dependencies or not all the dependencies and then you have to change them for an not

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,860
just like this press.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,670
OK Bob there it's gone.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,670
It took us so much time and so much effort to create this table we grew to love it.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,700
But it's pretty much gone at this point with just two clicks and the same goes for a database.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,700
If you had any tables inside the database it doesn't matter you can still drop them or delete them unless

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,030
there is active queries open that will just not allow you to do that.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,610
Or this table is being used.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,970
All you need to do again is right click here go to delete menu and your window will pop up in which

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,930
you make sure you selected the right the correct database and heroic in nature to the backup.

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,490
Just in case you're sure you will not need this database anytime soon.

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,630
And also close the existing connections.

23
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,230
If you don't for an hour just leave it by default.

24
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,980
Go ahead.

25
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,690
OK there it goes.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,180
Done.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,440
So all of our work is deleted.

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,610
We've left no trace in the system but I hope you've learned a lot.

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,370
I hope you understood that it's nothing scary there's nothing scary or hard about creating tables about

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,970
editing them about working with them and it's all about logic and just being profound with your naming

31
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,720
conventions being fond of your data integrity and just doing everything correct.

32
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,310
If you Durfee incorrect and follow rules you will always succeed in as well.

33
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,520
I hope you enjoy this lecture and I'll see you in next one.
