00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:00.900
OK.

2
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.840
So how do we a pillow.

3
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.180
These are made up into the P.G. admin.

4
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.010
So how do we transfer CCV into BNN while already have some experience with that.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.970
But let's go ahead and do it all over again fairly and correctly just to make sure that we make no mistakes

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.910
and no data is corrupted.

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.100
So as you can see our job and for open up I have servers put rescue all loaded it up to that basis plus

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.160
grace and consumer complaints.

9
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.890
And then what the first thing we need to do is to create a new database.

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.880
So this one I'll call something like console games.

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.720
You can call it whatever you want and it does not matter whatsoever just for you to keep track of that

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.720
and then each one to be working directly with this database then you have to make sure that you put

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.010
this name the name of your database and not what you see on screen.

14
00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.950
So let's go ahead.

15
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.230
Open schemings public.

16
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.710
Check that we have any data.

17
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.500
We don't that's good.

18
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.730
So I'll go ahead and open a new portal now that the tool is loaded up and ready to go.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.690
Let's go ahead.

20
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.000
Open our dugs file.

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.880
First let's do the console games table.

22
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.760
So let's select that copy and put it in here.

23
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.130
Check that all information input is here.

24
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.010
So I'll go ahead and run it as you can see it was successful tray table in 775 milliseconds.

25
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.890
All good.

26
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.490
So now let's go ahead and return back here since we're working.

27
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.730
Mac let's go take this.

28
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.940
Let's go with the Cuppy statement inside of here and make sure that everything is correct.

29
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.660
Again your biggest concern is to make sure that this that this read text is the same as your location

30
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.260
file.

31
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.880
So in my case it is the same users of Menko desktop.

32
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.210
And then we have console games but CCV.

33
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.540
So now those go ahead run it it will take a bit of time to run as you can see it be almost 16 rows of

34
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.930
data.

35
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.180
And that's what we're looking for.

36
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.300
Now before we go ahead and check that this table has all the data in it let's quickly create a new table

37
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.560
and upload it all again once.

38
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.440
So again delete this.

39
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.440
Put in the new code from the docs file.

40
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.910
Make sure it's all correct.

41
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.630
There we go.

42
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.760
Trade and you table go to the Mac section here if you're in the Macintosh.

43
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.070
Or go to Windows.

44
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.450
If you're working for Windows operating system again make sure the file name is correct.

45
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.310
Cancel date on dates.

46
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.840
Everything else is correct.

47
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.760
Run it again and return it.

48
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.210
All good.

49
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.910
Perfect.

50
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.720
So now that we don't need these files anymore we can go ahead.

51
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.910
Close them make this fullscreen and let's go ahead refresh the tables.

52
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.780
Now we should get two tables.

53
00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.450
Cancel dates that consist of five columns and cancel games that consists of 10 columns.

54
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.560
So please go ahead.

55
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:13.420
Select all from console games or other console dates first and let it go ahead quickly run that and

56
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.090
as you can see it returns toss all the correct information legist just for the sake of it count.

57
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.500
And then this could plunge from the game in here just to make sure that we get the so as you can see

58
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.770
we do have 30 in here the same number of rows as we had in the SCV file.

59
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.730
So it's all good.

60
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.940
I'm working the console games data is working as well.

61
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.850
The query to run it will just take a bit of time so we have created a new database.

62
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.140
We've created two new tables fill them with data from a CV file and now we're ready to go.

63
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.270
So I hope you're excited to do some practice.
