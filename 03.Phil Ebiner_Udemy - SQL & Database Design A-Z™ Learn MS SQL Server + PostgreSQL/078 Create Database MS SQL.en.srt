Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,690
Today we'll be learning to create our own very first database.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,690
So let's go ahead.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,580
Right click on the databases here.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,420
Select new database input your database name in my case it's going to be my database.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,550
You can name it whatever you want.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,270
And let's go ahead through the menus.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,330
Just try to understand what's inside here.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,560
So the logical name of your database and database log is displayed here the file type file grub initial

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,330
size and growth is something that might come in handy because initial size you might want a bit higher.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,670
It's going to be a very large database and then you can limit the maximum size of the database so it

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,840
doesn't take too much space and then adjust the path and the file name just some windows stuff in here.

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,260
The owner is set to default by default.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,620
And that's good for us.

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,200
But in case you will ever have to work with securing data you might want to change this.

16
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,260
The only people who have to have access to it have access to it.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,580
And owner plays a very big part of that.

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,840
Then we have the options menu which basically consists of a huge amount of different properties that

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,530
you can set to be true or false or specific values.

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,340
And I will not go in depth in here because very few people will actually need to change this.

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,950
And when you need to change this you can either refer to the Help section here or just Google.

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,430
That way you ensure will make no mistake.

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,770
The only thing I want to mention here is to set the level to the Virgin those killed that this file

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,840
will be worthwhile from for example if you're working in a company not all people have a skilled server

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,600
2016 it might be a good idea to sell it to their current version of a school.

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,620
And after that follow groups again nothing crazy here.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,360
Just some more set up properties so not go ahead only click OK it's executed.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,450
Then there are good relations.

29
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,620
You have your own very first database.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,640
I know already created these two but this one is truly we went through a process in a little deaf as

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,230
you can see there's really nothing to change when creating your own database.

32
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,090
It's really a very easy process.

33
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,550
The other thing I will say is if you click here right now and just let's put it this test and you click

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:20,340
on the script and you scroll down to screen the action to new window you will see what this window what

35
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,620
Microsoft skills or management studio does for you because otherwise you would have to write all of

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,850
this down yourself basically would not have to write all of this down yourself because this is all the

37
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:38,730
different parameters and in that option that you might set but you basically have to write this one

38
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,690
yourself.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,260
Pretty much every time.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,990
So go ahead.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,230
Close.

42
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,090
Don't say that because the new database windows while we already have ours ready to work with Ellas

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,640
do exactly that.

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,770
I hope you enjoyed today's lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
