00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.740
Hello and welcome to Section 5 challenge overview.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.830
For this section you're an analytics consultant helping a console games company conduct market research.

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.550
You have been supplying a data set consisting of two files console games a historic list of all console

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.320
games released between 1980 and 2015 and console dates and historic list of old console platforms such

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.880
as Wii PlayStation X-Box and information about.

6
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.390
You have been tasked to upload the data set into a database and draw from the following analytics for

7
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.050
this section.

8
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.750
You need to calculate what percent of global sales were made in North America extractive of the console

9
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.060
game titles ordered by platform name in ascending order and year of release in descending order.

10
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.730
Where is game Title IX track the first four letters of the publisher's name display all console platforms

11
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.720
which were released either just before Black Friday or just before Christmas ordered the platforms by

12
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.520
their longevity in ascending order.

13
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.210
Demonstrate how to deal with Game year column.

14
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.700
If the client wants to convert it to a different data type and provide recommendations on how to deal

15
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.990
with missing data in a file so this section is already a bit more advanced we can already see that we

16
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.480
will have to be working with missing data.

17
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.760
The worst nightmare of any data scientist but will show you the ways to do it or at least reduce the

18
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.940
amount of problems it will present to you later on.

19
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.890
And also we will be taking on a lot more queries will be learning a lot more functions and data types.

20
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.330
So now I'll go ahead and unload the data set again.

21
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.060
We open up a browser.

22
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.550
We go to super data assigned dot com slash as well.

23
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.770
We load the page up and here we scroll down to Section 5.

24
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.300
Working with data.

25
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.910
So in section 5 we have the challenge which is a media format of what we just read through postgresql

26
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.970
all applaud code.

27
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.930
Go ahead and the loaded console game sales and cancel dates.

28
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.730
So in this section we will be working with two tables.

29
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.690
So let's go ahead show all of our downloads or put it in a new folder.

30
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.090
Go back to the screen.

31
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.150
So here we have canceled dates.

32
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.070
Here we have canceled games and here we have Section 5 post upload code so just go ahead drag them to

33
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.540
wherever you want to be working with them.

34
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.990
For me the most convenient place is the desktop and I'll go and take a quick look what's ahead of us

35
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.740
soulless.

36
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.240
Open up console games as silly as you can see console games consists of 10 columns including a lot of

37
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.970
numbers so very few actually names and letters are used here.

38
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.560
Mostly it's numbers and it seems like it's ordered by rank in ascending order.

39
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.110
When lets open cancel dates now.

40
00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.820
So if we open cancel dates as city we will see a much smaller much more compact dataset which only consists

41
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.820
of 30 platforms and it also consists only of 5 columns.

42
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.350
So this is a very small table.

43
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.200
A very neat one and very easy one to work with and I'll go ahead and make sure that our upload code

44
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.270
is all here and all ready to go.

45
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.670
Again it's all here all ready to go.

46
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.510
We have no mistakes so let's go straight to uploading the data into PGE admin.

47
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.560
I'll see you in the next lecture for that.
