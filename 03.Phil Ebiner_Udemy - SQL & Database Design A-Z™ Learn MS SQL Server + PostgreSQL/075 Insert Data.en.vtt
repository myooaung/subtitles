00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.040
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.620
And today's lecture is all about inserting data into your already existing tables.

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.760
So go ahead.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.000
Open up my database.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.810
The one we just graded open up our new table my says movies you can say whatever it wants and just make

6
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.130
sure we check and we have four columns defined here or any number of columns.

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.360
I'll always go ahead and like e-toll and this will open up a new window.

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.810
And here let's go ahead and just select all from our data from our table.

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.680
So from movies now if you run this Eiffel's this play TAWS that we have four columns.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.030
It will display that all of their data types.

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.360
So Country movie year in movie name and it will display all of their data types.

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.840
Well now that will show us that we have absolutely no data not even one single row and that is absolutely

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.250
fine.

14
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.660
Absolutely correct.

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
Because we haven't filled the data and today's like is going to be all about feeling that they need.

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.920
Generally speaking there are two ways of filling data.

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.240
One is manually by inserting values into the table yourself through as well.

18
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.620
And the second one is copying data from an excel file or perhaps from another relation.

19
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.490
Today we're going to be taking a closer look at inserting data ourselves.

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.390
But before that let's quickly go ahead and refresh our memory how to copy data.

21
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.540
I should remember this because we have done that for every challenge so far.

22
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.840
And the theory behind it is all we do is use a copy then we say the table name that we want to copy

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.990
into then we specify from where we want to copy it.

24
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.860
In our case it's going to be again from desktop.

25
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.950
And because I'm working on a Mac I put forward slash in and then it put in users deliverymen CO and

26
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.880
it put in desktop and then they put my file name.

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.610
So because we don't have any file to work with I'm just going to put the file name then and put a and

28
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.310
extension of this file.

29
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.750
Then they put in delimiter.

30
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.910
I put in the delimiter will be.

31
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.780
And what this does already it says that the values are separated by a comma and dodgier that basically

32
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.100
tells our rescue all how to fill in columns that every column is separated by a comma in this file.

33
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.430
If we don't put this in a skill might just put all of the data inside that table all 5000 rows or whatever

34
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.710
it is into one cell because it just doesn't then want to stop and move on.

35
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.090
And then we also have to put in as we had or we only put this in to make sure that as well doesn't copy

36
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.860
the first row our header were in the table we have all the column names.

37
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.490
Otherwise if we don't put this in we'll have to go to the Excel file and delete the first row manually.

38
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.180
And it just can be a bit frustrating.

39
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.250
So now that we remembered the copy statement let's go ahead and look into insert into this function

40
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.480
insert into something X is very simple.

41
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.270
Again you write insert into.

42
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.710
Then you want to write the name of the table you want to insert into.

43
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.490
In my case it's movies and then you want to say values.

44
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.080
So this is it.

45
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.860
After that you open up your brackets and from here on you can just go ahead and insert data you want.

46
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.230
The important part about inserting into is maintaining the correct syntax.

47
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.640
So if we have four column names for columns in our table we have to input four different datapoints

48
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.780
into this column separated by a comma.

49
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.110
So for example if I want to put movie name I'll go ahead and put 7 because it's where I have to specify

50
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.820
that it's text.

51
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.550
If I don't put these it will just not recognize that it's text inside.

52
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.650
It will just say it's a column name or something.

53
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.160
So I just make sure you put these both up.

54
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.220
Now after we put that in we need to say the year the movie came up 7 came in in 1995.

55
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.070
The country of its origin which is USA.

56
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.370
And then we also can put Jenner and genere for seven isn't going to be mystic and crime.

57
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.220
So let's go ahead and just as is with Kappes letter and maybe that crime of cap letter it's important

58
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.130
to find your date in the station's early on because if we're going to be inserting let's say a hundred

59
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:33.110
tons of data and you have to say that every gender will be written with uppercase letter and that way

60
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.420
if you do it when you have to be searching that data or working with it you you will remember that if

61
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.670
you want to find old movies that have Mr. JENNER.

62
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.360
You have to write mystic from uppercase.

63
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.430
Of course you can always use the lower or upper functions to avoid that but it just good to have the

64
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.090
language stations or date annotations defined and early on.

65
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.470
So now if we go had run this if we'll actually do it straight away.

66
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520
Very simple.

67
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.240
Before we go any further let's just check with it that refeeding wanted.

68
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.460
So was golf select all for movies and as you can see there it is movie name seven movie year 1995 country

69
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.760
USA and Jenner Misty.

70
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.900
So let's go ahead and put some more data.

71
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.680
We have insert into movies values and then we opened our brackets and put in something else.

72
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.130
My second favorite film that comes to mind is interstellar.

73
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.710
So let's put that in again.

74
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.610
Don't forget that it's next.

75
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.290
And just for that.

76
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.940
Now put comma to separate that this column has ended the new one begins the year of interstellar 2014.

77
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.200
Country was USA again.

78
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.640
And finally genere was science fiction.

79
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.740
So again we're putting we're defining that that's text.

80
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.590
And now if you run this it will run perfectly and smoothly and nothing bad will happen.

81
00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.440
But let's go ahead and try running several rows of data at the same time try to insert several rows

82
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.440
of data at the same time.

83
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.220
So all we need to do is put a comma here and open up a new bracket.

84
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.020
And here we're going to put in the new film.

85
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.090
In my case it's going to be the Green Mile.

86
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:24.100
The year that movie came out is 1999 the country of its origin is USA and the genre for it is mystic

87
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:34.530
and drummer so now let's go ahead and try this out so it looks all nice and pretty and if we run this

88
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.890
it will run too.

89
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.880
It will insert two values at the same time.

90
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.580
So now we go ahead and say select all from movies.

91
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.530
We will be able to see rerolls of data and that is exactly correct.

92
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.990
So if you need to input a lot of data at the same time just make sure you separate them by a comma.

93
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.270
So every data goes in this format.

94
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.150
Insert into table name then you say and values

95
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:13.540
and then you put in brackets commerce commerce commerce comma new brackets inside of it you specify

96
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.020
different columns by putting these commas in.

97
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.730
Now another thing that we can do lessons or just one more line of data.

98
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:32.500
And so again when turning into movies values and what will happen if we forget to put something in brackets

99
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.210
or we just forget about inputting one column.

100
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.910
So let's say we're put in movie name which will be the godfather.

101
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:47.780
And then we're going to put in the year it came out in 1972 and say they want to put in the country

102
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.670
of origin.

103
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.770
Or rather let's say we're going to forget that third column and we're going to put it straight into

104
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.530
Junger.

105
00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:02.160
So the genre of this movie will be crime again with big letter C.

106
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:14.670
And now if we run it here what will happen is luckily for us we did find that Jenner has to be not now.

107
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:15.970
And there it goes.

108
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.860
As you can see is Violet's not null constraint.

109
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.110
But basically you can see the logic behind it.

110
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:30.580
What it does it says that the Godfather goes in column one which is movie name 1972 because there was

111
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.820
one comma goes into movie year.

112
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:40.270
Crime goes into country and genre has to be not because we haven't put anything in genre will be defined

113
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:40.830
as not.

114
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:48.490
So let's go ahead and say that we've put we've defined that there is one more column but we didn't put

115
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.250
anything just like absolutely nothing.

116
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.190
We didn't even define it it's going to be later.

117
00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:04.110
And now if we run this like this it will give us a mistake because a country has to be text has to be.

118
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.350
So now if we run it like this it will create it.

119
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:16.960
But again if we go ahead and select all from movies what it does now you see we have no country.

120
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.640
So because this country has not been defined there will be nothing written in it.

121
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.620
Basically this is a null value and because we didn't specify that country cannot be.

122
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.320
Now we are saying that countries OK being no database has no problems as Google has no problems running

123
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.090
it for other.

124
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.260
Wasn't that hard was it.

125
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:42.250
We've created four rows of data already and that only took us about five minutes actually about a minute

126
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.780
what the explanation.

127
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:51.750
And now let's say we want to delete something we want to update something for example we want to input

128
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.180
that country here has to be your site.

129
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.550
How do we do this.

130
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.650
Well we ask you all in asking in general.

131
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.210
This is done for doing update statement.

132
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:06.640
So you say update then you write the column name that you and an or that they will name you on update

133
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:16.200
in our its movies and then you want to say that set country to be equal.

134
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.390
USA where and here we can say movie name

135
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.770
equals Godfather D.

136
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.680
And what it does is the cynics behind us is very logical.

137
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:40.490
I think Mahler doesn't says that we're going to update this type of movies after that we say which column

138
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.410
or columns we're going to be updating.

139
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.260
So we saying we're going to be working with column country.

140
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.870
Now I would say that the country has to be USA if we leave this out.

141
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:56.430
It will update all of the country names to your site regardless of movie name movie or younger.

142
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.810
And right now in this table it's all right.

143
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:04.020
But imagine you have hundred more movies and some of them came from Europe some of them came from Asia

144
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.930
that will mess up our whole data.

145
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.990
So we want to specify which exact movie has to be updated.

146
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.850
So this is one where statement comes to play.

147
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.220
Basically we specify that where movie name has to be godfather.

148
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.670
Now let's say that there will be several godfathers maybe a comedy or a rip off or something like that

149
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:29.450
because as you remember our primary key is movie name and movie year so we used movie name and movie

150
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.570
year to identify a unique row.

151
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:37.890
We can specify here that movie name has to be godfather and movie has to be 1972.

152
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:44.090
This will guarantee that we update only this and this line only so only the Godfather did came out in

153
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.060
1972.

154
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:53.300
Let's go ahead quickly run it as you can see and return to us that it's ablated and go select all from

155
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.500
movies.

156
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.220
Now for more on this we should see that the country was indeed changed to USA.

157
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:05.990
So again you can see that it was a bit hectic and you can imagine how much problems it is to update

158
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:14.150
several cells so let's say you forgot to put movie year for seven movies and genre for another 11 movies.

159
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.860
You will have to manually update 18 cells and that will take a lot of time because every single time

160
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:27.920
we have to write an update query where you say that we update data in this column and this data has

161
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.040
to specify this condition in order to find that particular cell it's very important as well to work

162
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.140
with correct data and it's very important to input correct data from the very beginning.

163
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.490
Otherwise you will have a very hard time fixing it on later.

164
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:48.770
That's why manually inputting data in is not done as much as importing it from another relation from

165
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:54.620
another table or from a CV file because there if you made any mistake or you just forgot to import a

166
00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.770
lot of data you just drop this table.

167
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:03.170
You right click your press drop it and then you just create a new table with all the correct data already

168
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.230
inside.

169
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.420
So there's really nothing more to be told about.

170
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.090
Insert into statement.

171
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:15.130
Just remember disinfects again as we create table you specify that we want to insert into.

172
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.820
Then you say where we want to insert it into and then we say Malleus.

173
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.890
So basically making sure that after values were put in brackets and the valleys willfully separated

174
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.710
by a comma.

175
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.560
I hope you enjoyed this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.
