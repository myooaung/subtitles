Hello and welcome to the installation Tauriel for Mac OS.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:10,520
So first thing you want to do in order to install those rescue well and yardman is to open a browser

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,420
of your choice.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,350
For me it's Google Chrome so you can see already how it opened up.

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,860
And then now all you want to do is to type in a great as well.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,280
Or they need to go to this website.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,190
Alternatively you can just search in Google for download but best Cuil.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,340
This is the same result you will get the top result.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,480
So on the landing page you need to press download.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,290
After that you need to select Mac OS X because we're working with Mac operating system here we need

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,560
to say like the interactive installer by enterprise DB click on the modem installer button.

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,850
This will load up a new Web site an external Web so of enterprise D.B no worry about that.

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,130
Just make sure that when you download the bus ride ask you all you Bresson Mac OS and that that version

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,480
does not have Bayda in front of it because then you might run into some bugs.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,210
So as we can see right now version 9 points 6.1 is the newest version and there is no beta.

16
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,710
So that is the most ideal scenario for us.

17
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,380
Just click.

18
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,210
Mac OS X did and will start now.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,750
This will take some time so I'll just beat you up through the process.

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,340
All right so not a Darkfall finished to boating.

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,890
All you need to do is to click on it or select your Downloads folder and just double click and this

22
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,120
will open this menu.

23
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:44,140
So just not all they can ask you will not click open until your passport and just give it a second set

24
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,140
of it is being run right now.

25
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,660
So you can see that it is inside of here.

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,520
Next remembered this address.

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,020
It might come in useful later on.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,850
Then you press yes.

29
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,050
Did you vote for this 5 for free too.

30
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,920
And.

31
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,560
All right.

32
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,250
So us yes.

33
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,170
Next now is Salling.

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,060
It does not thing that much time at all.

35
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,070
So you can see the installation is pretty quick.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,840
So in this word it's unloaded the rescue all and began when are installed automatically at the same

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,480
time so you don't have to go to that website and from there.

38
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,480
And that's the beauty of this install or so just like one click away from me getting straight into where

39
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,230
easily.

40
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,710
So now you can play on that later.

41
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:46,560
For now just click Finish close this and now we go for play search and enter Jasmine.

42
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,650
There it is.

43
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:56,170
It's all loading up so now that we open it we see that there are no mistakes no server errors nothing

44
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,900
bad we have the servers we have to play rescue well being connected to.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,130
And that's awesome.

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,600
Congratulations you just installed pgm and for and rescue all on your Mac operating system.
