00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.100
Hello and welcome back to the course on databases.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.650
Today we're finally going to perform our very first join in practice in postgresql.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.080
Very exciting story ahead.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.730
Let's get straight to it.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.830
So here we've got the tables already uploaded to our database and today we're going to work with the

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.390
two tables at the top.

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.070
We're going to work with the owners and the pets tables.

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.120
So let's quickly start to have a look at this table so we're going to create a query here and we're

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.780
going to just select all of the rows.

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.980
So I'll just press caps select star from our pets and then we'll do the same for select star from owners.

11
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.240
So let's run the top one first.

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.020
And here you can see 100 rows in total.

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.750
And here we've got pet I.D. which is the primary key for this table.

14
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.680
It's an identifier for each row for each pet.

15
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.440
Each pet has their own row in this table.

16
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.790
The name of the pet the type that whether it's a dog cat or a parrot the gender the age and the owner

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.910
ID the owner ID is a foreign key here.

18
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.240
This is the column basically what that means is that this is the column that we're going to use to connect

19
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.660
this information to the owners table because right now from here we cannot tell who is here got cuddles

20
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.950
a dog who's 13 years old but we don't know who this dog's owner is.

21
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:41.930
Who do we go to if we need to return the dog or if we need to call up about something some routine inspection

22
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.840
that the dog needs or some vaccination.

23
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.640
So who do we call.

24
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.150
Brioni have this owner ID field and that's the only way to find out who the owner is.

25
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:59.470
So for 3 7 8 and what we do is we go to the owners table here and we look for 4 3 7 8.

26
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.540
Have a look if we can find that manually of course much easier if we do a join.

27
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.210
Let me have a look.

28
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.680
There it is.

29
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.580
So for 3 7 8 George McDonald who lives in Marquette and Michigan is the owner of cuddles the dog.

30
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.790
So there we go.

31
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.670
That's how we use that foreign key to connect to this primary key nondisabled owner who is the primary

32
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.750
key because it identifies each Roseau each row here is an owner and every owner has a unique ID in this

33
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.040
database as if we run this table you'll notice that we only have 89 rows here which is interesting because

34
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.190
we have 100 pets.

35
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.910
So what does that mean.

36
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.600
Well that basically means that.

37
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.240
One of two things either some pets don't have owners which is highly unlikely because somebody has to

38
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.180
bring the pet to the veterinarian for them to get into the database.

39
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.090
So they had to be in on the first place.

40
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.800
So what the more likely scenario is that some owners have several pets and that's totally normal.

41
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.160
Sometimes people have several cats dogs or a dog and a cat or a parrot and we'll see that in action

42
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.730
soon.

43
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.790
So now we're going to proceed very fast.

44
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.210
And so what we want to do is want to connect these two tables so we want to see the information for

45
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.360
the pets like this and then we want to see their respective owners in the same rows in the same view.

46
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.650
Like as a continuation of the table so how do we create that.

47
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.480
Well it's pressure.

48
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.220
We're going to create a left join.

49
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.540
A left join because we want to see all of the pets.

50
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.370
We know that we definitely want everything in the Pets table.

51
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.630
Right.

52
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.460
And then we want to add things onto the right and that's why it's a left join basically we'll have pets

53
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.280
on the left will be our primary table and then we'll add rows in the right and the left join will guarantee

54
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.210
us that the table on the left will not lose any information.

55
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.210
You know even if there's no matching rows in that in the owner's table we'll still see all the pets.

56
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.450
All right.

57
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.560
So let's go ahead.

58
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.950
We're going to Silex star as always.

59
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.310
But the again say from pets I won't stop there will say a left join and then we say the name of the

60
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.460
second table owners and they need to specify how to join the tables because at this point Asgill knows

61
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.350
which tables are going to join but doesn't know what criteria you want to use for the join.

62
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.690
That's where we hear Wiegand say on.

63
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.380
And then you specify which field you want to join on and then you going say pets Daut.

64
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.490
Basically you'd say owner ID equals owner ID.

65
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.340
Right.

66
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.010
But if you try to run this line you will get an error because in this case even though we understand

67
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.620
this owner ID is from the pet stable this owner ID is from the owners table and still doesnt know that

68
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.790
it doesnt know what we are thinking.

69
00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.830
Conry don't mind so we have to say pets Daut on Friday and then owners Daut owner and that will specify

70
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.240
from which table which field comes from.

71
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.320
If you run that youll get your first joint.

72
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.230
Congratulations.

73
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.170
This is our very first joint and here we've got our pets table on the left up on radio here and then

74
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.340
we got the second table for owners on the right.

75
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:27.960
Here it was joined and you can see it has been joined to match up with the correct the own the correct

76
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.330
owner correct.

77
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.730
Pat and here you can see cuddles of dog George McDonald as we discovered earlier.

78
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.710
So there we go that's a very first join us how we write it out and which you'll notice if I are on this

79
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.460
is that there's a total of 100 rows here right.

80
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.240
And if you think about it what does that mean.

81
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.140
Well that means that of course there would be hundreds because we did a left join.

82
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.330
So it definitely keeps these tables this one is on the left and it keeps all of the rows of the pets.

83
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.840
And if you scroll down if let's see if there's any pets that don't have an owner you can see that all

84
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.840
of these fields in the right are full.

85
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.670
There's no empty cells there's no walls.

86
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.770
Meaning that every single pet has an owner.

87
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.930
And what that implies is that they are indeed some owners that have several pets.

88
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.050
And so let's see if we can find one.

89
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.100
I think there might be one somewhere here.

90
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.640
So there we go.

91
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.990
So we see Elvia Warren who lives in Southfield Michigan.

92
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.550
She's got two pets she's got Scott the dog and Lilly the dog.

93
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.440
Two female dogs two and three years old.

94
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.950
And this person has two pets and if you scroll around and have a bit of a closer look you'll see that

95
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.320
they are more people that have several pets.

96
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.300
So that's how our left join works.

97
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.070
That's our very first example let's have a look at another example let's say let's make this a bit more

98
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.780
interesting.

99
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.400
Right so let's upgrade this.

100
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.730
All right let's say we want to we all don't want to Slick's star we want to select only certain fields

101
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.320
from a join.

102
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.430
We want to select only the name of the pet and the name of the owner and see how owners name their pets.

103
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.940
So what do we do here.

104
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:19.750
We would normally would say name right as in we want to select a name column from here and say name

105
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.140
here.

106
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.570
But again what do we get.

107
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.590
We get a situation where we've got two columns with the same name or in fact even if we just selected

108
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:35.890
one of them just one name would get an error for this because it says here column reference name is

109
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:42.940
ambiguous meaning that it is insufficient information for a skill to decide which column you want the

110
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.650
name from the table or the name call from the owner's name.

111
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.180
So that's why we have to do the same thing.

112
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:58.390
Pets Daut name Colma owners dog name and that way it will know where to get each comb from and there

113
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.070
we go.

114
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:08.240
We've got the name of the pet and the name of the dog or the name of the pet and the name of the owner.

115
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.350
So we've got Blackey and owner Robert rhumba Charles Simba.

116
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.860
Ed Keller Paul cuddles George and so on.

117
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.040
So there we go.

118
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:25.740
That's how we create and joins as you can see after this polished part is as we are used to except it

119
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.370
has the names of the tables and the dots at the beginning.

120
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.200
Then this part is sort of just from it has from left join and then on.

121
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.540
So this bit and then the rest of the same so you can add where clauses and so on and so we'll go into

122
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.020
a bit more depth into that further throughout the section.

123
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:48.290
But for now play around with that just make sure you're comfortable with performing your own lift joins

124
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.240
and selecting the columns that you want to select from those tables and I'll see you next time.

125
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.930
Until then happy analyzing.
