00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.775
Congratulations on finishing this course.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:04.710
I hope you have learned a lot about HTML,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.810
CSS, and Web design in general.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.230
If you will learn to build a personal website for a hobby or a website for your business,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.370
you should now have the required skills to complete this.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.230
Or if you were looking for a new career,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.510
you should now have a good foundation to build on.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.010
If you do want to keep on learning,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.345
I'll now recommend moving onto JavaScript and jQuery.

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:27.175
Then possibly a server-side language such as PHP.

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:29.130
It's also useful to get familiar with

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.485
a content management system to use on your website such as WordPress or Drupal.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:37.965
Once again, thanks for taking this course, please leave a review.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:42.040
It would really help. I hope you join me on a course in the future.
