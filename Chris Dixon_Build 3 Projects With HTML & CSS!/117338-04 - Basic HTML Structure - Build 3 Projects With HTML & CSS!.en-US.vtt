00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.770
Look inside of our index.html page which we created in the last video,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.255
and I'm going to get to work by adding some structure to this HTML document.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:16.500
Now, all of the content which goes inside of HTML pages is

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.210
generally different and depending on

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.075
what type of website which you're going to be creating.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:24.240
However, though, there is some general basic structure which

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
you are going to be needing for any HTML page.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.500
To begin, we need to add a DOCTYPE declaration,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.250
and this tells the browser exactly what type of document it's going to be reading.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.740
We do this by adding our angle brackets just like this,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.990
a exclamation mark, and then we add in the DOCTYPE.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.620
This is a HTML document,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.570
so we're adding HTML.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.820
Then since this is HTML,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.460
we'll wrap all of the rest of the contents inside of the HTML element.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.040
Like many elements in HTML,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.125
this has a opening tag and also a closing tag which we can see with this forward slash.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.095
Now everything else which we add to this document

00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:09.515
needs to be placed inside of these HTML tags.

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:11.330
The next piece of structure which we'll add to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.835
this HTML document is by breaking this up into two sections.

00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:17.545
Just like a person,

00:01:17.545 --> 00:01:22.860
a HTML document has a head and also a body, so let's add these in.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.990
We have the head section,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.525
which has the opening and closing tags,

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:31.060
and then we also have the body section.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.920
The difference between these two sections is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.270
the head section is generally used to add information about our websites,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.760
which has the name, the page titles,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.715
their descriptions, content for search engines,

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:45.880
and also links to other pages.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.869
So this is more like information about our website,

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.705
and generally, nothing which we see on the screen.

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:57.235
The body section contains the actual content which will display inside the browser.

00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:01.160
So the head section is for information and links to other pages,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.205
and the body section is what you will actually see displayed inside the browser.

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:11.405
Another thing we can do with any of these elements is to add what is called an attribute.

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:17.065
Attributes is some additional information which should pass into the opening tag.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:19.560
For example, with a HTML document,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.690
we want to declare what type of language this document is routing.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.970
We do this with a lang attribute,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.515
which is short for language.

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:30.100
Mine is going to be in English.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.750
If you are writing yours in a different language,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.025
you can also do a search for HTML language codes,

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:39.490
and we can see a complete list with this link just here.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.270
If we scroll down, we see a language table where we can choose a particular language,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.370
and then choose the short code which we're going to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.480
place inside of this language attributes.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.960
Feel free to change this if you would like to,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.905
but I'm going to now move on to this head section.

00:02:54.905 --> 00:02:59.000
Remember, the head section contains information about our site,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.710
and the first thing I'm going to place inside of here is the title.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.725
This title is the page title for this particular page.

00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:08.720
So if we have a Contact Us page,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.010
this will be contact us.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.450
If we had an About Us page,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.310
this would be about, and so on.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.200
Since this is the homepage,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.545
I'm going to call this My Recipes.

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:22.130
Now if we save this and refresh our Index page,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.840
we now see the page title showing in the browser's top.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.770
Just below the title, we're going to add

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.330
some additional information about our site by using the meta tags.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.380
Unlike things such as our title and our head section and the body,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.505
this doesn't have a opening and a closing tag.

00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:42.230
We only have a opening and closing tag just like

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.910
this when we want to nest some content inside.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.750
So the title has this text inside,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.670
the head section has multiple pieces of content inside,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.140
but for our meta tags,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.390
we're just going to add some attributes just like we did just above.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.130
These attributes declare what type of additional information we want to add for our site.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.780
This first one is going to be

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.000
the particular set of characters which we want to use for our project.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.725
By characters, we mean what type of letters,

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:16.655
numbers, and symbols we want to use in our website.

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:20.100
The HTML5 standard is UTF-8,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.865
and this covers almost all characters and symbols available in the world.

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:30.280
We do this by adding the character set attribute and set this equal to UTF-8.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.845
Your next piece of information in a meta tag is going to be the viewport tag.

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:39.265
We'll create a new meta tag just like above,

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:42.950
and then give this the name of viewport.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.970
This is going to allow us to set up our page for different screen sizes.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.170
The reason we need this viewport tag is because people are viewing

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.325
our websites on multiple screen sizes,

00:04:54.325 --> 00:04:56.790
alongside monitors, but we also need to account for

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.585
tablet size and also mobile size devices too.

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:05.580
Where we do this as a second attribute is by setting the content,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.630
and then inside of the quotations,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.700
we set the width to be equal to the device width.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.730
What we are essentially doing here is we are setting

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.855
the page's width to be equal to the device which we are viewing it on,

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:22.430
and separate it by comma.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.320
The next one we're going to do is to set the initial scale to be equal to one.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.815
This is the initial scale or the initial zoom level when our page is first loaded,

00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:38.134
and this is really important for our site to look good on all screen devices.

00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:39.600
If we don't add this in,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.780
a user may try to visit our site on

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.260
a mobile-size device and this mobile device may try to

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.885
take our desktop-size site and then

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:51.620
zoom out to fit all of the content onto the smaller screen,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.015
which will then result in things such as our text looking really small.

00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:58.580
We don't want any of this zooming or scaling to take

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.845
effect since we're going to be handling

00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:06.365
the look and feel of our site on all screen sizes by adding some CSS.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:09.200
A lot of this may look confusing to begin with,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.340
but just remember all of this is essential for any HTML page,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.690
which we're going to be creating,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.675
so you will get a lot more familiar with adding this.

00:06:17.675 --> 00:06:21.230
Alongside all of this additional information about our site,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.645
we can also use the head section to link to other pages too.

00:06:25.645 --> 00:06:28.605
For example, we have the styles.css.

00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:31.935
This is going to contain all of the styling, all of the colors,

00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:34.540
all of the layout, the font sizes,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.855
and so much more for our HTML page.

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:41.070
For this to take effect, we need to link to this file,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.980
and we do this with the link element.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.080
Again, this just contains the attributes inside,

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.020
so we don't have a opening and closing tag.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.680
The relationship is a stylesheet,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.505
since this is the type of file we're linking to.

00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:56.870
Then we have this href,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.490
where we tell this particular page where we can find this stylesheet.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.395
In our case, this stylesheet is alongside our Index page,

00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:09.565
so all we need to do is to add the file name, which is styles.css.

00:07:09.565 --> 00:07:13.310
If this particular file was stored inside of a CSS folder,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.700
all we need to do is to add the file path just like this.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.045
This is all the information I'm going to add in the head section.

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:23.560
From now on, we're going to be working inside of the body section.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.935
This body section, as I mentioned before,

00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:29.540
is going to contain all of the content which we see on the screen.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.120
For example, if we want to add some text,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.310
we can add these in the p element,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.200
which is for paragraph.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.735
Now let's say hello, say this,

00:07:39.735 --> 00:07:43.020
refresh the browser, and all of this body content

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.050
will then be displayed inside the browser just like we see here.
