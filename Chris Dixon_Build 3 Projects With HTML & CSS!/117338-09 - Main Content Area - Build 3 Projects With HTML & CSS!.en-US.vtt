00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.685
Moving down from this header section which we've been working on,

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:08.670
we're now going to add the content just below.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.940
If we take a look at the final version just inside the other browser tab,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.330
this is going to be the two sections which we are going to be creating.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.205
The first section will have a background image,

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:20.825
and then will have a heading,

00:00:20.825 --> 00:00:24.910
and also a chance to enter an email and then submit this.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.935
Of course at the moment this will won't because this is just HTML,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.815
and you would need some back-end service for this to work.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.460
But at the moment, we just concentrating on the look and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.975
the feel of the site using HTML and CSS.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.195
Moving down, we have a second section just below,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:43.640
which has these three different sections.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.710
This will give us a chance to take a look at

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.050
some different ways how we can position elements.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.420
We'll overlay this text on top of the image.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.885
Take a look at some of these techniques.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:57.570
To begin, let's go back over to our index.html page.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.465
Then if we scroll down just below the header section and make some space,

00:01:02.465 --> 00:01:05.050
make sure this is still above the body.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.835
This we're going to use a new elements called section.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:15.410
The section will be the wrapper for all of our first section which you see just here.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.660
Now, we could add an image just like we used in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.655
the header appear for the logo using the image element.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:23.880
But for this background image,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.510
I'm going to show you a different way to insert an image.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.945
We'll take a look at this in the next video via CSS.

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:33.410
We'll start with our headings and this is going to be a Level 2 heading,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.845
then this one will be Level 3.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:39.255
The h2, and then hit Enter,

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:43.500
and then the text of weekly recipes to your inbox.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.300
I'm going to save this file and then open up the live server,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.820
just like we've looked at in previous videos.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.520
There's our textures here, and it looks like it's inside of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.370
the header section because of the background color.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.775
However, this is in its own section below the header.

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:07.650
If we take look our style.css and then scroll up to the body section,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.015
here we've set the background color for the full body.

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.625
This will apply to all of our content,

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:18.005
but this will be replaced with a background image in the upcoming video.

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:22.210
Next, the text, which is going to be Sign up now,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.720
into the index page.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.065
This one is going to be a Level 3 heading,

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:31.425
put the text of Sign up now.

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:33.590
Since we're using a live server,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.085
this will automatically update when we save.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.350
To enter the user's input,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.840
we're going to make use of a form.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.110
The form is a way for the user to interact with our website and enter some values.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.570
You may have used forms in the past where you sign up by email,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.785
you can add your name,

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:55.850
you can add all kinds of information such as messages, your date of birth.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.410
But this one is going to be simple,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.480
it's just going to be an email input and then a Submit button.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.170
To do this, we're going to wrap all of this section in a form.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.925
We can remove this action attribute since we won't be sending this during this course.

00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:14.260
But what we're going to do is place in an input.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.550
If we hit Enter, the default type which we are given is the text-based input.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.765
As it sounds, this is a way for the user to input a text value,

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:26.530
such as a username or full name.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.565
We're going to make use of an email input.

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:32.180
Now, this type of input which we enter,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.410
will give the browser a hint of what type of data we expect to be inputted.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.920
It can check this data and also provide some messages

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.625
to the user if the type of data is not valid.

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.920
For example, if we were to change this to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.175
a number type and then the user entered some text,

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:52.465
the browser would restrict this to only accepting numbers.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:55.120
Also, since this is a type of email,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.930
when the user clicks on this input,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.970
it may also pop up with some previously used emails too. Moving on.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.010
The next attribute which we're going to add is the aria-label.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.900
Once you set this, to be equal to email.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.015
This aria-label is used for accessibility devices such as screen readers.

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:19.100
If we take a look at our final version,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.450
just here, you see we don't have any labels next to our input.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.665
Often, with forms you would see a label just like this,

00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:30.065
and maybe some text just like this,

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.990
which will appear next to the form input.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.820
Now, like our final version,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.530
we don't want to display this text.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.985
We could remove this text from the browser using CSS.

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:44.185
However, there is a reason why we don't want to do this,

00:04:44.185 --> 00:04:49.430
and this is because if a user is visually impaired and cannot read this textures here,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.560
and may be using a device such as

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.720
a screen reader and let them know what type of input this is.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.630
If we were to remove this,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.680
his aria-label would label this element to provide a indication

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.565
to the screen reader or accessibility device to what type of input it is.

00:05:06.565 --> 00:05:10.240
After this, the next attribute is the placeholder,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.700
which is going to be the text which is placed inside

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.880
this box before the user adds a value.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.340
For this, we'll say Enter your email with little space just on the left.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.145
This space will also be reflected inside of the input.

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:28.930
Next, the second input,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.790
which has the type of submit.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.150
When we add a form just like this,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.265
we also need to add a Submit button,

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:39.560
which is going to send this form to the server.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.850
There's a whole just here.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.410
This is a pretty simple section and all of

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.874
the visuals will be created in the next video using CSS,

00:05:47.874 --> 00:05:50.120
including this background image.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.400
Next, we move down to do our section that just below.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.795
For this, we'll create a new section as a wrapper.

00:05:57.795 --> 00:06:00.510
The section is going to have three divs placed

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.400
inside with each one of these images with the text.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.465
The first div, and each one of these divs is going to contain two elements.

00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:14.409
The first one is the image which you want to use for the background,

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:18.555
and the source this is inside the Images folder.

00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:22.290
This image is a vegatarian.jpg.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.940
The alt text. Remember, this will be

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.150
displayed in the browser if the image could not be loaded.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.040
It'll say vegetarian section.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.340
Then after this, we can place in the text.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.995
Now, if we wanted to, we could use a p element or we could use a heading.

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:43.115
For this, wants to place in a Level 3 heading,

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:46.090
since these are reasonably important sections.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.185
The text is vegetarian.

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:52.745
Save this, and let's check this out over in the browser.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.560
Good. That's our first section.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.600
Don't worry about how this looks at the moment.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.605
We will improve this a lot in the next video.

00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:02.040
The second div, just below,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.125
this is for the middle section.

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:09.020
This is just like the section above with the image and also a Level 3 heading.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.120
If you wanted to, go ahead and pause

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.600
the video and give us a go on your own if you feel comfortable doing so.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.725
If not, I'm going to carry on with the images.

00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:21.135
The image this time is the quick.jpg.

00:07:21.135 --> 00:07:25.770
The alt text will say the five-minute meal section.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.130
The h3 is most five-minute meals.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.070
Check everything looks okay in the browser.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.700
At the moment, these will be stacked on top

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.085
of each other rather than going across the page.

00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:44.570
Because as we mentioned earlier,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.240
a div is a block level element,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.300
meaning that each div will start on its own new line.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.990
The third div, this one is for the healthy options.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.420
Place in the image.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.700
Again, in the Images folder,

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.325
this one is named healthy.jpg.

00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:06.670
The alt text, say healthy options section.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.480
Then the h3 at the bottom,

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:18.240
which is healthy options. Go down.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.825
There's our third section at the bottom.

00:08:20.825 --> 00:08:24.545
Notice how all of this content is still within the body section.

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:28.105
This gray background will apply to all of our content.

00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:30.320
It doesn't look too great at the moment,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.660
but we'll fix this in the next video,

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.630
where we will apply some style into our two new sections.
