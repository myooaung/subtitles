00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.120
I'll have all of the HTML content on this page.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.970
The last thing to do to finish off this project is to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.285
apply some CSS styling it down in the footer,

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.070
it's going to be pretty basic.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.600
All we need to do is to reduce down the size of this SVG will place

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.270
all of the content into the center and also play a slightly different background color.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.415
Then we going to use it for the rest of the body section.

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:29.430
So over to the styles.css.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.375
Remember that the wrapper for all of this section was the footer.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:36.215
We can now work with this over in our style sheet.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:39.205
First, let's grab this.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:45.280
Then inside of here we'll set the display type to make use of the flexbox.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.230
As previously mentioned, the flex-direction by

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.370
default is the row which will place these items across the page.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.790
We need to change this back to be the flex-direction of column.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.365
This also applies to the footer section, which is the wrapper.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:01.730
The flex-direction is now column,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.210
which will in place these back vertically.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.750
You may be currently thinking, "Well,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.335
this just leaves us exactly where we're at the start."

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.540
But now we're making use of the flexbox.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.840
We can now make use of a flex property called align items,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.220
where we can set this into the center.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.010
This will then now push our links down at the bottom,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.620
into the middle and also this SVG,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.400
when we reduce the size down too,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.340
we currently have the flex-direction column which is vertical,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.235
and this is referred to as the main axis.

00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:36.875
When using a line items just like got here,

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.420
this will work on the opposite,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.035
which is referred to as the cross axis.

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:46.810
This is why the center property will align these items across the page horizontally.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.255
The opposite would apply if we set the flex-direction to the row.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.960
This would then mean our main axis is across the page,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.960
meaning align items would be the opposite and this will set the vertical alignment.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.059
If you were to start now, this may look a little bit confusing,

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.645
but this just takes a little bit of getting used to.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:08.780
Next, we'll change the background color for this footer section.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.310
Face slightly dark shade,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.885
which is going to be E5.

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.405
Easy row, easy row, save.

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:19.895
We can see a slightly different shade from the rest of the body contents.

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:22.640
Some pollen, which is going to go inside of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.080
this footer section and provides some space in, around the inside.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.730
Let's go for 20 pixels.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.280
This will apply our space into all four sides.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.625
Finally, we need to reduce the size of this image.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:41.960
We can apply this to only the footer area and then any image which is meant to be inside.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.100
All we need to do is to set the maximum width of this image,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.960
the 80 pixels. There we have it.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.535
This is my recipes,

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:54.410
websites all now complete.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.585
Hope you've enjoyed this project and your first steps towards building websites.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:00.230
In the upcoming project,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.840
we're going to take things even further by creating

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.200
a new project and also introducing responsive design.
