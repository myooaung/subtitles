00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.910
On this final version of our project,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.180
if we hover over any one of these list items,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.750
we can also click on these and be taken to a different page.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.949
Now, each one of these pages which we'll link to doesn't have any particular content.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.385
But we can see this is a popular recipes page.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.515
We have the What's New,

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.750
we have the Submit Recipe page,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.450
and also the Meal Ideas too.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.195
But currently if we go to our version just here,

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:33.015
we can't click on any of these list items.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:37.505
To do this, we need to turn each one of our list items into a link.

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:41.645
A link or a hyperlink is created in HTML by wrapping

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:45.650
our section in the a element of on the Mozilla website,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.700
we can see in the example we have an unordered list.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.380
This has some list items just inside,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.590
just like we have in our project,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.885
but the difference is inside of this list item,

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:59.930
we also have nested inside an a element.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.800
This a element also has this href attribute.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.770
This is the key to creating a link because we

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.130
need to tell the browser exactly where we want to link to.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.845
Let's go over to our project and replicate this inside of our header.

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:18.740
First of all, we need to cut out the text from

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.775
inside of the list item and then create an a element.

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.700
It will automatically add the href attribute.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.725
Since this is required inside of the a elements opening and closing tag,

00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:35.915
we can add back inside the popular text and this will display inside the browser.

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:39.110
Now, for the href, we can add any link inside of here which we

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.560
want to switch as a link to a website,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.250
let's say Wikipedia, and by default,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.555
a link will appear underlined and with a different color.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:54.905
We can also hover over this and the cursor will change to be a pointer.

00:01:54.905 --> 00:02:00.675
When we click on this, it's now linked to our external site. Let's go back.

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:03.330
But of course, we don't want to link to Wikipedia.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.330
We want to link to some pages inside of our site.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.815
Currently, if we open up the sidebar,

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:12.395
we only currently have this one index page.

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:15.575
What we need to do alongside of our index.html

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:19.565
is to create some new HTML pages to link to.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:21.920
Let's click on the new "File" button.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.270
I'm going to create a link for each one of these four pages.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.360
The first one, we can give it any name of our choice.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.895
This is going to be for the popular page,

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:36.920
and this needs to have the dot HTML extension. We also need three more.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.360
The next one is for new.html.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.180
Number three is for the meal-ideas.html.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.795
The final one is to submit our recipe.

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:55.100
Let's give this a name of submit.html.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.920
Now we have some different pages link to.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.795
Just make sure that all of these pages are alongside the index page

00:03:02.795 --> 00:03:07.375
and not nested inside of the images folder or any other folders.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:12.050
You can go ahead and create as much content in any of these pages which you want to.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.190
But for now though,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.650
I'm just going to add some simple text so we

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.685
can see which page has been loaded inside the browser.

00:03:18.685 --> 00:03:21.955
For the Submit page, we're just going to add some simple text,

00:03:21.955 --> 00:03:25.135
but first we'll add the basic HTML structure.

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:27.140
You could go ahead and add all of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.515
the same structure which we used inside of this index page.

00:03:30.515 --> 00:03:32.150
You could type this all manually,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.700
or if you are using Visual Studio Code,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.750
again, we can make use of the Emmet shortcut.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.915
To do this, we type in html:5, hit "Enter".

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:45.075
This will be created for us.

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:48.400
All we need to do is to change the document title.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.150
This is Submit a recipe.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.545
Then inside the body add some text in the p element,

00:03:54.545 --> 00:03:57.275
just so we can see which page has been loaded.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:00.000
I'll say, Submit Recipe Page.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.670
Save this file with Command or Control S. Let's now go to Meal Ideas.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.620
Again, html:5, hit "Enter".

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.900
Change the title, add our text.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.510
Save this file and then the New button,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.895
which is for our What's New page,

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:26.230
add the basic structure,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.790
the title, and some text,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.000
so What's New page.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.170
Save this and then our last one,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.220
which is the popular.html.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.780
The document title of popular recipes, and then the text.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.270
Save this and now back over to our index.html.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.660
Now we have four different pages to link to.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.055
Down to our eight element and inside the href.

00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:04.460
Since these pages are alongside our Index Page,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.275
we can just simply type in the name,

00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:09.470
and in this case, it's the popular.html.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.975
Next, we have What's New,

00:05:11.975 --> 00:05:15.710
put this out at the a element.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.230
The page for this was the new.html.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.880
Then in between the opening and closing tag,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.110
paste in the text.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.720
Let's go down, and we're going to do this two more times.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.230
The next one was Submit Recipe, pull this out.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.890
Place in our link, which is going to point to submit.html, add in our text.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.750
Finally, we have the Meal Ideas.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:50.765
This one is meal-ideas.html, paste in the text and save this file. Over to the browser.

00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:53.495
We now have four links inside of here.

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:55.235
Let's try the popular one.

00:05:55.235 --> 00:05:58.595
This one now linked well, popular.html.

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:03.425
Next, What's New, we can see this is fine.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:08.485
Submit Recipe, and then finally the Meal Ideas.

00:06:08.485 --> 00:06:11.480
The final thing I'm going to do is to also link

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.015
this recipes title just here back to our Index Page.

00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:19.250
To do this, let's put out our level one head in with

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.445
Command or Control X, add in our link.

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:26.220
This is going to point back to the index.html,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.410
paste it in our level one head in, click on this.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.520
This will now link back to our Index Page.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.905
If we wanted to, we could grab our header section.

00:06:36.905 --> 00:06:41.675
Let's highlight all of this and copy with Command or Control C,

00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:43.745
go to the popular page,

00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:47.875
and we could also add this inside of each one of our other pages.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:51.405
If we paste this in, click on "Popular" link.

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:54.150
We now also see this header inside of here.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.055
Click on "My Recipes".

00:06:56.055 --> 00:06:59.210
This will then return us back to our Homepage.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.970
As previously mentioned, you can go through each one of

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.245
these additional pages and also add more content if you would like.

00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:09.080
But next, we're going to move on to making this header

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.960
look a lot nicer by adding some CSS.
