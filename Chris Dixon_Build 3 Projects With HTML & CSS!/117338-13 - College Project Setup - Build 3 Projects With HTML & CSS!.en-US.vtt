00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.210
Welcome back to this new project and this new section.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.620
During this upcoming section,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.175
we're going to build in this college theme website which you see here.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:15.060
Not only are we going to be replicating this and getting lots of

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.794
more practice building HTML and CSS websites,

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:21.480
we'll also going to learn some new tricks.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.300
In particular, one of the bigger ones which we're

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.525
going to learn in this section is responsive design.

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:31.005
Responsive design is a way to create our website,

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.725
and make it adapt to different screen sizes.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:38.355
For example, on a larger desktop size monitor,

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:41.880
just like this, this is how our website will look.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.340
But if we were to shrink this down to a smaller width,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.350
we see that this website will respond or adapt to the current size of the browser,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.020
and then it change the layout accordingly.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.930
This will also take effect when viewed on a smaller tablet or a mobile device.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.720
At the top, our header will be stacked vertically.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.060
We see the links just below the header,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.865
rather than alongside each of it like they are here.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:11.165
This is a general theme for a lot of the content.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.195
We can see here with this grid that rather than having

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:20.650
free items side this will now be stacked vertically and be the full width of the screen.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.580
For this particular project,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.290
we only have one layout change,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.030
we have the small screen view or the larger screen view,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.330
but we can add as many changes or as many breakpoints as we would like,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.790
even if we just wanted to fine-tune a particular section of the side.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.350
This is what we're going to learn in this section.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.670
We're going to get started,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.850
just as ever by creating a project folder.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.120
Over to the desktop, a new folder.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.880
This one, we want to call this the tech-college.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.225
You can give this any name which you want to.

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:59.540
Also provided with this project is the images folder,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.645
and you can make use of the same images which I'm going to use,

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:05.470
or you can download your own if you prefer.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.200
After this, if you want to,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.050
you can also place this inside the project folder,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.255
and then drag over the tech-college folder into Visual Studio Code.

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:20.450
At the moment, we just have our images folder inside here with the supplied images.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.810
What we need to do to begin is to create our new page,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.640
which is going to be the index.html.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.170
As ever, you can type out the HTML structure if you want to,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.260
or you can make use of the HTML5 built-in Emmet command,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.780
which comes with Visual Studio Code.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.255
Type in html:5, hit enter.

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:45.440
Now, we've got all of this structure which we need for our site.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.260
The title, place this inside of the head section,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.365
save this file and open this up inside the browser.

00:02:53.365 --> 00:02:57.760
We can either double-click the index.html inside of the project folder,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.990
or as a shortcut,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.090
we can right-click on the file name,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.185
copy the path, and then paste this into a new browser tab.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:09.160
Good. All I'm going to do now for the rest of

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.875
this video is to add a little bit of setup work,

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:14.650
and this is to provide a font which we're going to use for

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.400
this project and also provide something called the normalized CSS file.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.420
Let's begin with our Google Fonts.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.455
We do a search for Google Fonts,

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.460
and the first one which we need here is fonts.google.com.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.220
Add into here, and we can choose any font which we want to use for this project.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.415
The one which I'm going to use is called Vollkorn.

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:45.945
This is V-O-L-L-K-O-R-N. Let's go for the Regular,

00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:51.150
select this, and also close this down and we go for the medium one.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.170
Open this back up, and then we can copy all of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.200
this link and paste this into our head section.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.885
This also needs to be linked to our style sheet,

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:10.375
so let's create this new file inside of the main directory of styles.css,

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.860
and we'll come back to this in just a moment.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.600
But for now, let's just copy this over and paste this in,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.570
and if we Command or Control with forward slash,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.245
this will just comment this out for later use.

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:28.840
The next thing to do is to include what's called the normalized CSS file.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.340
If we had O2, the search engine and do a search for a normalize.css,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.930
it should be the first link which we need just here.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.080
We can see here that the normalized file is going to help us

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.790
render our website more consistently across different browsers.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.660
There is something called a CSS reset which is available,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.350
and this will reset all of the browser defaults back to zero.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.235
For example, if certain browsers had some padding or margins to our elements,

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:00.890
this will reset all of these back to zero.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.375
However, though often these default values are added in for a reason.

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.380
An alternative is to use this normalized file,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.810
and this won't completely remove all of the browser defaults.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.740
Instead, what it will do is to adjust certain values,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.390
giving our sites a much more consistent look across different types of browsers.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.180
It's really helpful to add to our project.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.345
We can also use this with MPM if you were using node.

00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:29.685
But since we're not, we're just going to download this file,

00:05:29.685 --> 00:05:32.405
select all with Command or Control A,

00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:34.960
copy with Command or Control C,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.860
and then inside of our project,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.025
now we have a second style sheet which we're going to add in.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:45.710
I'm going to keep this more organized by clicking on a new folder called CSS.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.960
Let's drag over our style sheets,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:58.005
and then open this up, create a new file called normalize.css and then paste this in.

00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:00.440
All this is essentially doing is providing

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.660
some sensible defaults which we're going to apply

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.600
to our elements to make them look better across different types of browsers.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.585
We need to now link both of these style sheets inside of our index.

00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:15.680
Next, let's link in our style sheet,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.880
which is the normalize.css.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.860
Remember, since we created a CSS folder,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.800
we need to also add this inside of our file path.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.080
Finding our custom style sheets,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.520
and our custom style sheet should always be

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.255
the last one so None of these values above will

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:38.785
override our custom styles into the CSS folder, styles.css.

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:42.065
Now we are pretty much good to go with our new project.

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:44.735
This is all of the setup work now complete,

00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:46.310
and in the upcoming video,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.275
we'll get to work with the header section and

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:52.530
also take a look at how we can add our responsive images.
