00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.290
Hey, welcome back to this next section.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.050
We're going to keep moving down with our project and create

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.240
the grid section just below this header image.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.635
This is the one, if you stretch this out,

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:18.790
it's going to be a grid-style layout with all of the popular course's sections.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.030
This will make use of the CSS grid layout and this is going to allow us to provide all of

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.780
the sections side-by-side with a gap in-between and also down to the small screen view.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.690
This will be transformed to be the full width of the screen with the smaller screen view.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.345
I'll also fix this typing mistake from earlier too.

00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:46.705
Into the HTML, this section is going to be wrapped in the section elements.

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.580
Then a level 3 heading,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.190
which is going to be the title of Popular Courses.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.280
The class for our CSS is going to be courses-title.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.840
Then below this, a new div section,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.950
which will be the container for all of our courses in the grid style format.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.215
So since we're currently working with the small screen view,

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:15.115
we're going to be making sure that all of our items are stacked vertically.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:18.565
Then later on we'll change the layout to be a grid style.

00:01:18.565 --> 00:01:22.390
This first div is going to be the wrapper for all of these courses.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.465
So let's give it a class of courses.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:28.400
Then a new div for each one of our sections

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.600
which will contain the image and also the text.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.615
This one is going to have a class of grid-item.

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:38.810
Now we need to do for each one of these grid-items is to select

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.215
the correct image and also place in the text.

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:46.470
Your first one, this is the law.jpg.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.835
You can add it all text.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:53.500
Then below this, the p element for our text of law.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.755
To save a bit of typing,

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:57.740
you can type these out if you want to,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.460
but I'm just going to duplicate this for each one of our items.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.370
The second one is the image of construction,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.340
all text, the text to display.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.990
Then the next one is going to be for our engineering.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.550
The fourth one is for science.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.960
This is one just here.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.690
Number 5 is the architect.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.930
Then last, we have the business.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.965
Let's save this and see where we're at inside the browser.

00:02:56.965 --> 00:03:00.130
Refresh. So we got law, construction,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.100
engineering, science, architect, and business,

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.720
and all of the images correctly linked.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.220
As you would expect, this doesn't look too great if we stretch the browser,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.205
but for now, we're just going to be focused on this mobile first approach.

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:15.345
Over to the final version.

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:18.640
We don't need to do a lot of styling for this small screen view,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.085
since the images are already stretched to be the full width of the screen.

00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:27.475
What we do need to do is to make the font size bigger and also add a hover effect too.

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:30.510
Let's begin by selecting our individual grid-item.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.970
Then we can align the text into the center and make the font size bigger.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.010
Now at the bottom, lower button,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.180
your rapper was the grid-item.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.535
Select the text.

00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:53.460
Then you can push this into the center and also set the font size to be 1.8rems.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.805
Good, this now looks better.

00:03:56.805 --> 00:03:58.905
Next, we'll apply the hover effect.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.090
When the mouse hovers over each one of these sections.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.430
For this, we could apply lots of different effects,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.320
but all I'm going to do is to set the brightness and also the scale.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.975
Once again, we apply this to the full grid,

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:14.695
which has the class of grid-item.

00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:17.055
I got the hover effect.

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:22.525
Then we can apply a CSS filter where we're going to adjust the brightness.

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:27.505
The brightness is a value between zero and one. So a zero.

00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:30.280
This is going to make the section really dark.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.480
If we set this to be one,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.415
this is just the original state.

00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:38.080
Just to give this a slight subtle change,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.075
we'll set this to be 0.9,

00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:44.360
making it a little bit darker each time we hover over these images.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.315
In addition to this,

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:51.760
also a transform where we will set the scale to be 1.01.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.130
Finally, the cursor of pointer by.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.170
Also, our transform is working too if we hover over any of these sections.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.060
Just to finish off this section,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.860
we need to work with the popular courses-title.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.470
If we scroll up,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.765
this was contained in a level 3 heading.

00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:14.655
Let's grab this, h3.

00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:16.300
As with other types of headings,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.610
we also have some default browser margin,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.500
which we can remove by setting this to be zero.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.890
If we refresh, this now removes the margin from the top and bottom.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.930
So we're now free to add our own spacing of

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.785
2rems on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:34.840
The text-align of center,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.955
and also the font size.

00:05:36.955 --> 00:05:40.790
That also increases to be 1.8rems.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.785
Good. We can see that the level 3 heading is bold by default.

00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:50.545
If we want to, we could also set the font-weight to be normal.

00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:53.070
This would remove the bold effect.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.515
Good. This is our section now completed for the mobile view.

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:59.870
Later on, we will come back to this and transform it

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.525
into a grid-style layout with a larger view.

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:04.585
But for now, this is all fine.

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:07.475
We'll continue on next with the remaining sections.

00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:10.110
So I'll see you in the next video.
