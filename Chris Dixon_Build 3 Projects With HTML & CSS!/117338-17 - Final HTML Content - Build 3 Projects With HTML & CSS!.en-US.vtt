00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.110
Moving down below this grid section which you created in the previous videos.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.320
We are going to add that the rest of the HTML content which we need

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.695
for this project on the final version, just like here.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.705
This is the sports section,

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:18.990
which is going to have the image on the left and the text on the right,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.315
and then the footer area at the bottom.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:22.890
As with the other sections,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.630
this will also be fully responsive.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.785
If we shrink this down to a mobile screen,

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:32.665
the content will be stacked vertically and also placed on top of the footer section.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.355
This video, we'll just be creating the HTML content and in the upcoming video,

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:40.295
we'll add the CSS style in to make this look good.

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:42.380
Then after that, we'll add some media queries to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.875
make this look good on the larger screen.

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:51.170
Let's go back over to our index.html and below the last section which we created,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.330
create one more section.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.830
This is going to have the class of sports.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.505
This is for the sports section.

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:00.920
This is going to be pretty simple.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.730
It'll just have a div at the top which is going to contain an image.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.600
Then a second one which will contain the text.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.330
Having these two sections below,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.110
I was to use the CSS flexbox to control the layout on different screen sizes.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.985
The first div and then the second div.

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:24.190
The first one is going to contain an image.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.010
An image which we need has been provided in the images folder.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.780
This one is the volleyball.jpg and also the alt text.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.100
This is all we need for this first section.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.570
This is pretty simple.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690
Onto the next section,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.830
this will be a Level 3 heading.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.900
With the text of discover our new sports facilities.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.130
If we take a look at the finished version,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.410
we see if we hover over the word here.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.205
This is going to be a link to a sports facilities page.

00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:05.570
We don't have this page, but you can create if you want to and make this a link.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.370
We can wrap this word inside of the "a" element.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.050
Place this in and it's still within our h3.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.105
The text off here.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:18.325
Now we'll just link this back to our homepage.

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:21.320
Over to the browser and scroll down and we can

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.230
now see our new content down at the bottom.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.350
By default, this kind of layout looks good on

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.945
a mobile device because the image is stacked on top of the text,

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:35.885
so you don't have too much work to do over in the CSS for this section.

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:38.270
But just like the grid section above,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.765
we also need to apply some different styles.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:43.175
But this when we get to a larger screen.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:47.520
Next, the footer area just below the sports section,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.000
the h3, and this is the text of looking for more.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.460
Then this footer area will just contain a series of links,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.100
which we can place just below this and also

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.595
we'll place these side-by-side on the larger view.

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:09.485
This can go inside of an unordered list and our first list item,

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:13.180
in fact, all of the list items will be placed in a link element.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.660
The first one is the text of, virtual tour.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.620
Just like with these sports facilities,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.870
you could also create all of these extra pages if you wanted to.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.080
I'll give you some more practice creating new pages.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.310
But I'm going to just copy this list item and paste in just below.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.300
The second link is for download our full guide.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.170
After this, this one was, hear student testimonials.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.070
The fourth and final is,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.750
book an information session.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.260
Good. Give this a save and also the browser, onto the bottom,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.660
and by default, all of these items are going to be in line

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.305
since we've already created some CSS in the previous videos.

00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:14.065
But we'll fix this in the upcoming video.

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:16.060
All we need to do for the last of

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.440
the HTML is to create this copyright section down at the bottom.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.155
We can do this in a simple p element.

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:26.970
We do need this text of, tech college.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.480
But if we look at the final version,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.020
we see this copyright symbol just here.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.920
This is what is called a HTML entity.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.220
An HTML entity is a shortcode which allows

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.255
us to place in a symbol inside of our HTML file.

00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:45.265
If you want to see more of these symbols which are available,

00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:48.960
there's a handy website called unicode-table.com,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.930
and we can search for lots of different types of symbols which you want, such as emojis,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.390
we can search for arrows and all kinds

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.935
of different characters which we need in our projects.

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:01.790
If we needed an arrow,

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.800
for example, we could search for this.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.880
Then we can select the one which you want to,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.635
and we'll see over on the right we have

00:05:09.635 --> 00:05:12.550
some different codes which we can add to our project.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.020
This is what we need for our HTML just here,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.575
which is the ampersand and it ends in a semicolon.

00:05:18.575 --> 00:05:23.150
The particular code which we need for the copyright symbol is also begins with

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.575
the ampersand is simply the word copy followed by a semicolon.

00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:36.535
Also our projects, and we can just about see this down at the bottom of the footer.

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:39.890
This is now all the content which we need for this project,

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.830
and in the rest of the videos for this section.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.705
We'll be focusing on the styling and also we've just seen all of the CSS rules,

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.220
the different sized devices.
