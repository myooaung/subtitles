00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.090
Hi everybody, and welcome back to Learn HTML and CSS by Building 3 Real Projects.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.030
Congratulations on getting to the third project.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.115
By now we've built a static website and also a fully responsive website.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:17.535
Next, we want to move on to a hotel project,

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:21.940
which is going to be built with the popular Twitter Bootstrap framework.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.810
This is a look at what we want to build in.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.449
It's again a full responsive website,

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.575
meaning we can shrink it down and it looks good on different devices.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:36.960
It's going to include a sliding carousel showing different images.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
There will be a search box and navigation at the top area.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:51.105
We'll also include the drop-down menus on the various section below.

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:54.230
I'm going to show how we can build a nice looking website like this

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.155
really quick and real easy using Bootstrap.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:02.790
The first thing we need to do is if we go to getbootstrap.com.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.060
We'll take a look through the website,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.230
but first we'll just click

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.570
the "Download Bootstrap" button and the Bootstrap link on the left there.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.405
Let's take a look across the website while it's downloading.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:22.880
In the getting started section there is various bits of information,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.495
templates you can use to get started quickly.

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:28.460
It shows you all the file and folder structures for

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.315
the different downloads you can use and also the basic template.

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:36.630
This is going to be the template we'll be using for our index page.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.080
Further down there's more examples and small templates which you can use to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.930
get started really quickly.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.395
Back at the top, there's also the CSS section.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:57.440
Now the CSS gives you a overview of all the different components available.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.170
We can look at tables, forms, buttons,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.340
for example, and if you just click on one of those,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.875
it shows you how to do a button in Bootstrap.

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:08.705
It's very simple and all the CSS is already pre-compiled.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:12.060
Instantly, you'll get a good looking website.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.650
In the component section,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.005
we can look at the glyphicons.

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:28.090
Bootstrap comes ready with all these available icons to use at no extra cost.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.440
There's also examples of navigation bars

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.830
and the different components such as labels and headers.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.220
We're going to look at the sample code.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.340
A lot of it is quite similar to what we've already learned.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.060
We just need to apply the Bootstrap classes to link it to the CSS.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.450
We'll take a look at the JavaScript included.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.910
Now the JavaScript provides all kinds of effects.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.380
There's things such as transitions,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.335
and what we are going to be looking at is the carousel.

00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:06.830
We'll be using the code below to add the carousel to our website.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.925
Bootstrap should have downloaded by now.

00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:15.140
If you go to the downloads, we unzip it.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.550
If we just copy the full folder,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.315
and if we go back into the project,

00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:28.230
and we paste that into the project and we'll rename that.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.320
We'll call this folder MyHotel,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.525
and if we open the folder,

00:03:36.525 --> 00:03:39.130
we'll need to drag our images into there.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.080
You should have already downloaded the images you need for this project.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.645
If not, go back and download them now.

00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:48.035
As most of the files and folders setup for the Bootstrap project,

00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:50.120
we just need to add the index page.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.170
If you go into your text editor and we'll need to file and open folder,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.315
and on our desktop,

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:02.700
we have the projects.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.410
I will go to MyHotel,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.790
and the first thing we need to do is go to File and New,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.360
and we'll save that as our index page, index.html.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.200
Let's go back into the Bootstrap website,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.470
and if we go back to the getting started section,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.540
if we scroll down to the basic template,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.150
and we're just going to copy that,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.530
and then we'll paste that into our index page.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.295
As you can see, if we just take a look up and down,

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:46.405
it includes all the same structure we've included in the first two websites,

00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:49.685
and there's a link to the Bootstrap style sheets.

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:52.960
There's also the viewport tag for responsiveness.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.640
The first thing we'll do is we'll change the page title and we'll call it MyHotel.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.520
The link to the Bootstrap CSS is already included,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.460
so we don't need to do anything with that yet.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.600
Also included by default is the HTML5 Shiv,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.655
which we've included in the first two projects,

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:15.515
so that's all in place.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:18.630
We'll just take a look at that on the preview.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.680
That's the Bootstrap framework all setup and ready to go.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.690
Next, we'll look at adding the navigation bar.
