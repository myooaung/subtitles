00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.310
To work for this course we don't need to buy

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.670
any software or make any additional purchases.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.950
All we need is a web browser which you're probably using at the moment for this course.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.870
I'm going to use Google Chrome,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.495
but you can use any modern browser.

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.410
In addition to this, we're going to need some software to write our code.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.460
I'm going to be using a program called Visual Studio Code.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.490
If you give this a search in a search engine,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.900
you will come across the homepage,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.635
which is available at code.visualstudio.com.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:38.520
If you head into here, you can find out some more information if you want to.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.670
Or you can download this for your operating system.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.440
It's a free download for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.850
Go ahead and download the appropriate installation for your machine.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.800
I already have this downloaded and opened up over on the left.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.595
Go ahead and download this,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:57.395
and I'll see you in the next video,

00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:59.570
where we're going to get started with creating

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.240
some files and folders for our first project.
