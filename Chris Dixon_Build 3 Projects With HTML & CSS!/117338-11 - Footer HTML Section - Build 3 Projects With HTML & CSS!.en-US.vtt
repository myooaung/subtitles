00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.570
Most of the main contents now on this page, and now,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.280
we're going to move down to the very bottom and create

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.830
the very last section of this project.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.560
This section is going to be a footer area.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.150
It's not going to be too difficult.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.220
It will just be a footer as a wrapper,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.335
which is a HTML 5 semantic element.

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:24.630
This wrapper will then contain a navigation with various links.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.730
You can make these links anything which you want,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.170
and you can also create additional pages if you want to link these two as well.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.880
Just like we see on the final version,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.665
there will also be a small image just above this,

00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:38.770
and this is contained inside of the images folder.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.455
If you feel confident doing so,

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:42.710
you can go ahead and create this yourself.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.795
If not, just follow along with me.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:47.225
We're going to create this now at the very bottom,

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:49.945
just above the closing body tag.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:52.220
Provided with HTML 5,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.310
was a new semantic or descriptive element,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.410
which is called a footer.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.960
Just like we did earlier when we created the header section with this element just here,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.620
all of the content for the footer goes in between at these tags,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.930
and we're going to create an image and also a new unordered list.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.235
First of all, the image elements and the source is all in the images folder.

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:21.420
We need the cutlery.svg and also some old text too.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.045
Let's save this and see this over in the browser.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.510
Refresh, and as our svg,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.110
which is a little big at the moment,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.405
but in the upcoming video,

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.500
we will style this with a section with CSS.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.640
Next, just like we did earlier,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.980
we're also going to create an unordered list,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.425
which will contain our navigation links.

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:44.960
Just before we do this, we're also going to take a look at

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.480
another semantic or descriptive elements called nav.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.890
Nav is a element which is intended to represent a possible page,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.110
which contains navigation links.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.230
This isn't a mandatory elements which we need to include

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.695
before the browsers and screen readers which are read in this HTML.

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:08.830
It does provide a better description of what content is nested inside.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.770
From here, we create an ordered list just like earlier.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.650
I will list items which can contain a element for a link.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.530
As mentioned before, you can also create a link to a different page.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.975
But I'm just going to leave this one empty in this video.

00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:29.450
The first one, let's say about this.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.020
The second that list item with a link,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.240
this one is for contractors.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.510
The third one, this one I'm going to suggest a recipe.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.820
The fourth one, this one is going to be privacy.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.225
This will follow links down at the bottom.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:57.380
The CSS is also applied when we hover over each

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.895
one of these elements from the earliest [inaudible] which we had it.

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:03.035
If we go up to the top,

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:06.260
we also have some navigation sections just up here.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.905
What we're going to do is to also move to the top of the page

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:14.635
and look for our unordered list inside of the header.

00:03:14.635 --> 00:03:17.070
Let's select all of this section,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.385
and then command or Control X.

00:03:19.385 --> 00:03:25.940
We can cut this out of place and also surround the section with the nav element.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.410
The same for the second set of links just below,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.455
cut the section out,

00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:33.830
place it in the nav element,

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.685
and then paste the contents back inside.

00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:39.605
We shouldn't see any difference inside the browser.

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:43.490
This is just to describe the contents which is inside of this element,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.505
just like we did with the header and footer sections.

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:49.670
Finally, to finish off the HTML for this page,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.760
the last thing we're going to do is to place these mid dot in between the footer links.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.845
We can do this by copying the span elements,

00:03:57.845 --> 00:04:00.590
which contains the HTML entity.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.750
Let's grab this, we Command or Control C. Go back

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.410
down to our footer links and we can paste this in between each one of these list items.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.270
Let's check this out. There we have it.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.220
Finally, the last thing to do for this project is going to be in the next video.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.430
We will apply our CSS styling for the footer section.
