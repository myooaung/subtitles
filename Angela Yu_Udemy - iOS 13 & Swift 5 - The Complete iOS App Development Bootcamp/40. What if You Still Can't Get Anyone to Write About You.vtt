00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.050
Now if you really can't manage to get anybody to write a story about your app or about your business then
1

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.610
another thing that you can consider is a service called HelpAReporter.com.
2

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.280
So this is shortened to HARO for most people, help reporter out. And what they do is they help journalists
3

4
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.360
find sources for their stories.
4

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.920
So very often you'll get some big name publications like Huffpo, Techcrunch with their journalist looking
5

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.910
for a particular expert or somebody who works in a particular field to comment on a story so that you
6

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.310
can act as a source.
7

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
And the way that HARO works is that you get sent I think two or three emails daily with a whole bunch
8

9
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
of journalist requests looking for people from all over the world who can help them with a particular
9

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.910
story.
10

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.530
Now the downside to that is if you want to be diligent about this, if you really want to pick up on that
11

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.410
golden nugget of a request, you're going to have to trawl through a pretty much 2000 word essay three
12

13
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.170
times a day which is not exactly a great use of your time if you're a startup founder when you're already
13

14
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.560
working 14 hours a day and sleeping for 2 hours.
14

15
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.330
This is probably not the best use of your time.
15

16
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.050
But here's a trick that you can use in order to save your sanity and still get the benefits of finding
16

17
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.040
those relevant journalist requests.
17

18
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.950
So first things first sign up with your Gmail account.
18

19
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
And if you don't have your own Gmail account get one right now. It is the one decision that you will never regret.
19

20
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.210
So in your Gmail account
20

21
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.100
head over to the settings icon, the little gear icon and go to settings. Next
21

22
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.430
this will bring up this settings pane with a bunch of tabs.
22

23
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.060
Head over to the filters and blocked Addresses tab.
23

24
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.290
And what you can do here is you can click on Create a new filter and that filters all the incoming messages.
24

25
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.110
And then you're going to add in the From field the email address where all the HARO requests get
25

26
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.350
sent through which is haro@helpareporter.com.
26

27
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.200
And then what you're going to do is you're going to put into this field where it says "Doesn't have" the
27

28
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.850
thing that you want to have.
28

29
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.450
Now that seems a little bit unintuitive but bear with me.
29

30
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.010
So say if you only want to see the requests from Techcrunch journalists or say if you only want to
30

31
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.150
see the requests which have the word coffee in it, then you put your key word in here and then you press
31

32
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.250
create a filter with the search. And what you can to do is you're going to click the box that deletes
32

33
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.820
all the emails that don't have your key word.
33

34
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.330
So that means the only emails that come through to your inbox requiring a manual review are the ones
34

35
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.660
that contain the keyword that you want.
35

36
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.280
So maybe something to do with coffee or maybe something to do with babies and whatever it is and that makes
36

37
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.090
your life so much easier.
37

38
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.370
So you don't have to trawl through a million lines three times a day.
38

39
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.250
Now besides help a reporter, there's two other services that I quite like.
39

40
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.970
One is called JournoRequest.com and the other one's called Response Source.
40

41
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.130
Now for those you guys who are based in the UK
41

42
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.340
Response source is pretty much only UK based and they have a seven day trial which you can check out.
42

43
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.970
But the pricing model after the seven day trial can be a bit steep. but they do have a nice way of filtering
43

44
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.020
out requests and getting requests immediately when they're made.
44

45
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.050
So have a look at all three of these resources and start monitoring for journalists requests in the niche
45

46
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.960
of your app.
46

47
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.720
Now if you still can't manage to get any journalist to cover you, the next best thing to do is to run
47

48
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.800
an app give away.
48

49
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.360
So this means giving away a hundred or five hundred copies of your paid for app free to a particular
49

50
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.220
tech blog.
50

51
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.710
So this is usually really easy to do. From the journalist side it requires maybe you know a paragraph
51

52
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.050
of writing which they can do in 10 or 15 minutes and it gives their readership something of value.
52

53
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.020
So this is pretty much a last ditch resort that you can try.
53

54
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.770
But in the past I've seen quite a lot of people have success with this and getting into some big name
54

55
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.390
tech blogs.
55

56
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.900
So well worth giving it a go.
