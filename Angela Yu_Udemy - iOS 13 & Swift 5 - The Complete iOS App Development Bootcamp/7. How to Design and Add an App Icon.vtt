1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.360
Now we're really close to the homestretch.
1

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.740
All that's left are the last two things.
2

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.570
And in this lesson, we're going to learn how to design and create a custom app icon which will display
3

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.190
when we run our app.
4

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.430
Now coming back to Xcode, the place where you would add the app icons is inside the folder Assets.xcassets.
5

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.650
And we really saw earlier that we have this blank template full of slots for all of our different
6

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.120
app icons.
7

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.330
Now why are there so many different slots, you might ask?
8

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.540
Well, they are used for different purposes.
9

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.390
For example, you might have a certain size for the icon that gets shown when you get a notification.
10

11
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
You might have one that's in the spotlight area.
11

12
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.220
You might have one that's displayed on the iOS App Store.
12

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.880
And if we're creating both iPad and iPhone apps, then there's also different dimensions.
13

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.370
And the reason why we're providing lots of different dimensions, rather than just a single large one
14

15
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.750
and get the iPhone or the iPad to scale it down, is because of speed. If while our app is running, it has
15

16
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.880
to run and scale down to all of these different sizes, then it's going to make our app seem a lot
16

17
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.980
slower than it could be.
17

18
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.890
So that's why Apple wants us to create all of the assets and all the sizes that it needs so that it doesn't
18

19
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.990
have to do any scaling to keep our app as fast as possible.
19

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.980
Now if you head back to that folder of images that you downloaded in the last lesson, you'll be able
20

21
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.330
to find a whole bunch of icon images.
21

22
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.500
And notice how we've actually named them with the 2x, 3x postfixes.
22

23
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:51.150
So if you want, you can simply click and drag to select all of these icons, and then drop them into the
23

24
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.010
app icon slots.
24

25
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.830
So it should automatically know where it needs to go because we provided all the size information in
25

26
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.710
the naming of the icons.
26

27
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.220
Now sometimes though it doesn't know where to place something. For example, this 1020 sized icon should
27

28
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.050
actually be in the slot which needs a 1020 image.
28

29
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.890
So you might have to manually adjust things occasionally.
29

30
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.760
Now notice how out iPad slots are missing.
30

31
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.420
Now here's a question. If you were creating your own app with your own app icons, how would you go about
31

32
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.120
making all of these different size assets?
32

33
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.450
Well, one of the easiest ways is using that website that we saw earlier on App Icon Generator and we
33

34
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.260
previously saw that we could use their image set generator to create the 1x, 2x, 3x images and to
34

35
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.660
scale it down automatically.
35

36
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.000
But they also have an app icon feature which is, again, free to use.
36

37
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.520
So the way that this works is that you should start out with a large image size and it should ideally
37

38
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.880
be 1024 pixels x 1024.
38

39
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.240
And then you can select all of the places that you want to use it including iPhone watch or Android.
39

40
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.690
So how do we generate the initial icon image?
40

41
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.600
Well, if you already have a picture or something that can be scaled down to this size using a piece of
41

42
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.070
design software,
42

43
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.880
well, if you're familiar with design software, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, or anything that you
43

44
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.240
want to create an app icon with, then you could use that to create your app icon.
44

45
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.700
But the way that I'm going to show you today is probably one of the easiest to learn and it's completely
45

46
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.370
free to use and there's nothing to download.
46

47
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.200
Head over to canva.com and go ahead and sign up.
47

48
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.200
And once you've signed up, you should see a screen that looks like this.
48

49
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.250
Now they have a whole bunch of presized templates.
49

50
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.810
Say, for example, if you wanted to create a presentation or a Facebook cover or an Instagram post.
50

51
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.310
But in our case, we're going to choose custom dimensions and we're going to put in that dimension that
51

52
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.430
we saw earlier on from the App Icon Generator which is 1024 x 1024.
52

53
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.560
And now that creates a blank square for us, ready to add in our design.
53

54
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:23.430
Now the cool thing about Canva is that they have a whole bunch of professionally designed templates
54

55
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.380
where you can just simply switch out the picture or change the text.
55

56
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.960
So for example, if I just dropped that in, then I can simply change these things and create my own design.
56

57
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.440
But in our case, we actually want to create a app icon.
57

58
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.580
So it's going to be completely different from what they've imagined.
58

59
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.990
So these are pretty much just kind of like Instagram posts or some sort of blog titles or images.
59

60
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.510
Instead I'm going to go over to the elements and I'm just going to start with some really simple shapes.
60

61
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:03.960
So let's say that I had a circle, maybe, that I'm going to try and place in the center just by dragging
61

62
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.070
it around.
62

63
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.070
I'm going to change it to a nice, let's say, a teal color.
63

64
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.570
So we've now got a circle as our app icon. And you can choose from other things such as charts or different
64

65
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.780
shapes, different gradients, lines, and a whole bunch of vector illustrations that you can pick from as
65

66
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.480
well.
66

67
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.730
But in my case, I'm going to keep it really simple.
67

68
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:35.610
So I'm going to just add another shape, probably just a  triangle, and I'm going to put this
68

69
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.230
right over here, and then make it cover just about half of the screen. And then I'm going to change this
69

70
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.860
to a white color. And then I'm going to change the background to maybe something that's got an
70

71
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.390
interesting gradient. And finally, for our diamond app, I'm just going to search for the word "diamond" and
71

72
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.090
see if they have some nice free assets I can use.
72

73
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.470
So this one looks pretty good.
73

74
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.650
So I'm gonna put that in the middle and then I'm gonna scale it down a little bit, and then center it.
74

75
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.310
Now all I have to do is give my file a name.
75

76
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.940
I'm gonna call it Diamond App Icon. And then go ahead and click download to download it
76

77
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.220
as a PNG. Click download and it should only take just a little while for it to save.
77

78
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:33.510
And now I can go back to my App Icon Generator, click and drop it here, and only check the ones that I
78

79
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.860
want which is the iPhone and iPad, and then click Generates.
79

80
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.210
And now I've got all of my app icons created.
80

81
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.900
And once you've unzipped that file, you should end up with a folder called Assets.xcassets.
81

82
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.840
Now let me just switch over to this view,
82

83
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.910
so you can see all the levels that the folder contains. Inside that folder,
83

84
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.640
there's something called AppIcon.appiconset.
84

85
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.130
And inside that folder, there's all of the different sizes that our app icon needs to be.
85

86
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.470
So notice how this folder is exactly the same as the name of our assets folder.
86

87
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.040
Well, if we go ahead and right-click on AppIcon and click on Show in Finder, you can see that it
87

88
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.830
mimics exactly the same naming convention as what we have in Xcode. So in Xcode, our app icon set is
88

89
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.660
saved inside a folder called AppIcon.appiconsets.
89

90
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.440
Inside there, there's a whole bunch of icons and a file called Contents.json.
90

91
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:42.010
Now, this file is the one that arranges each of these icons in their correct place holders.
91

92
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:48.400
And if you look at the folder that we downloaded from our App Icon Generator, it also got
92

93
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.640
Contents.json.
93

94
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:57.060
So this means that if we replace this AppIcon folder with the one that we currently have, then we can
94

95
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:04.520
have all of our images already placed in the right place holders without any extra work on our part.
95

96
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:11.250
So what I want you to do is to take the folder called AppIcon.appiconset from the assets folder
96

97
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:19.080
that you downloaded, and then just click and drag into the same area where you've got
97

98
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.420
the AppIcon.appiconset from Xcode.
98

99
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.450
Now once you let it go, it will ask you if you want to replace the existing AppIcon folder and you're going
99

100
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.650
to say, yes, replace.
100

101
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:37.080
And now notice how we have all of our app icons all ready placed where they need to be.
101

102
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:43.340
Now there's just usually one extra one that's unassigned which is what's creating the warning here.
102

103
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.230
So if you hit backspace, it will delete that and it will get rid of that warning.
103

104
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:53.830
We're finally done with our app and we're ready to run it and check it out. In the next lesson,
104

105
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.250
I'll show you how to run the app on a simulator
105

106
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.590
if you don't have a physical iPhone device. And then, later on, I'll show you how to actually run it onto
106

107
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.600
an iPhone or an iPad if you indeed have one.
107

108
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.050
So all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
