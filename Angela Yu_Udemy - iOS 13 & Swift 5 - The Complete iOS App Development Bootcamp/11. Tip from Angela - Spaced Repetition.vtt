Hey.
1

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.590
Well done on achieving yet another module.
2

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.210
You're doing really really good and I'm here cheering for you all the time
3

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.580
even--
4

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.280
even though you can't see it, I'm actually here just cheering for you.
5

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.270
Now I want to talk about the idea of space repetition.
6

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:32.340
Now there's a lot of research that's gone into how humans learn and one of the most well tested techniques
7

8
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.010
is space repetition.
8

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.440
It's the idea that if you learn something just once, you're probably going to forget it.
9

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:47.850
But if you learn something and then you come back to it in a week to review it and then a month to review
10

11
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.720
it and then a year to review it then that knowledge is yours.
11

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.400
You own it.
12

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.410
So it's the same with programming.
13

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.360
If you've learned a new concept let's say if else statements and you never use it again.
14

15
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.280
You've just heard how it works
15

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.020
you've seen what it does and then you never actually use it?
16

17
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.320
You're not going to remember it.
17

18
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.400
You're not going to remember how to use it the next time you come across it.
18

19
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.880
You're not going to remember to use it when you actually need to
19

20
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.120
in a program of your own.
20

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.660
So as a part of the course I try really hard to add in more repetition and I know sometimes it feels
21

22
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.700
like it's repetitive
22

23
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.080
right?
23

24
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.220
But you know if that is the case you can always listen at 2X speed.
24

25
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.250
You can change the toggle of the player so that I speak much faster and you can get through more of the
25

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.840
content
26

27
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.080
if you're just reviewing it. But it's there for a reason. It's to try and remind you of the concept, to try
27

28
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.880
and enact this kind of space repetition.
28

29
00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.590
But you can also do it yourself like if you keep a list of the things that you've done and at regular
29

30
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.460
intervals increasing intervals, say a day, a week, a month, you just come back to those concepts just review
30

31
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.800
it once more.
31

32
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:16.760
You will be able to keep that knowledge in your long term memory and turn it into a skill rather than
32

33
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.090
kind of like you know when you cram for exams and you just learn everything once and then like a week
33

34
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.750
down the line, you forgotten everything like this is true for me.
34

35
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:34.250
I've crammed-- firstly I've had so time where it feels like it's impossible to study everything in that amount
35

36
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.010
of time.
36

37
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.750
I remember when I was doing my end of med school exams I had four days of full time exams.
37

38
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.900
It was like 9 to 5 with an hour lunch break of just exams on everything from like biochemistry to clinical
38

39
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.380
medicine to like just everything under the sun.
39

40
00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.270
And I had to cram. I crammed so much knowledge and you know not like you know let alone now like many
40

41
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.900
years on, but even like a week down the line it was all gone.
41

42
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.490
It was like as if like there was no point doing it, doing that like cramming. So review the crux of
42

43
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.400
the topics that you learn on a regular basis. Try to use it in some sort of format like make a small
43

44
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.230
program or make a small quiz for yourself or feel something really really simple that you've already
44

45
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.400
built in the course but just do it by yourself.
45

46
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:42.170
Those are the moments when you're going to level up your skill and those are way more important than
46

47
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.360
listening to me like I'm just going to say like if you do the work and you actually write the programs,
47

48
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.910
that's really where it's most important.
48

49
00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.000
So have a go at doing that and I'm going to be here continuing to cheer on you in the background.
