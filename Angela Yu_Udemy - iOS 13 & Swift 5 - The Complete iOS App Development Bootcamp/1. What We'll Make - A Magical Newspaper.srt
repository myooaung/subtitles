All right, guys, in this module, we're going to recreate something magical, literally. For those of you guys, who
1

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,370
are Harry Potter fans,
2

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,020
you'll know that in the movie and also in the book series,
3

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,970
they have these interactive newspapers, an interactive images. So all the newspapers contain live images
4

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,140
that add extra detail and extra color to liven it up.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,950
So inspired by this, I've created a tutorial where we're going to be using the latest features of ARKit 2
6

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:40,830
to turn our box down newspapers into magical newspapers that play the content that's relevant to
7

8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,870
the image that gets detected, turning a boring old newspaper into something really, really interesting,
8

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,830
and it really livens up the experience of reading a newspaper.
9

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,950
So I hope you're going to enjoy this tutorial as much as I did making it.
10

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,280
And once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and we can get started.
