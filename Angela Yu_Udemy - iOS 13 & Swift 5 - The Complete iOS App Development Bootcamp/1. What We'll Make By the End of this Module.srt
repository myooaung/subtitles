Hi, guys.

00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,670
This is Angela from the App Brewery.

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,660
And in this lesson, we're going to be doing something really, really exciting.
3

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,070
We're going to be building a measuring device using a ARKit.
4

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,950
So by the end of this tutorial, you will have an app that allows you to measure anything in the real
5

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,190
world by simply pointing to the beginning and the end point of where you want to measure.
6

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,920
And we're going to render some 3D text into the scene.
7

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,290
It's gonna be really, really awesome and I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,020
So let's get started.
