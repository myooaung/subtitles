00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.950
All right. So in the previous two scenarios we spoke about how you build up an audience of your own.
1

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.450
So whether that's through building an email list or through building a following by doing content marketing
2

3
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.420
or starting a blog, that's all well and good. But what if you need to boost your numbers or what if you
3

4
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.940
don't have enough of those numbers?
4

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.220
Well, this is where the third scenario comes in.
5

6
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.380
And this is about piggybacking off somebody else's audience.
6

7
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.180
Now there's three search services I really want to talk about. First and foremost and probably the most
7

8
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.360
important if you're working in tech is Product Hunt. Producthunt.com is a web site where essentially
8

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.490
you get to hunt cool things or new things that have launched.
9

10
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.430
So very often you'll see things being hunted here being featured on Techcrunch like maybe two or three
10

11
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.240
days later.
11

12
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.940
It's essentially a site where a lot of discovery happens and it's cool because if you're an early adopter
12

13
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.830
or if you're somebody who wants to be on the bleeding edge of tech, then this is where you discover all the
13

14
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.960
cool stuff.
14

15
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:14.450
So the way that it works is that when a product is hunted, it is live on the front page for 24 hours.
15

16
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.470
And within these 24 hours, you have the opportunity of being upvoted or being discussed.
16

17
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.200
Now the higher your upvotes, the more likely it is that you're going to gain visibility.
17

18
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.580
And it's the visibility that's really crucial because not only does this website get tens of thousands
18

19
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.110
of hits per day, but additionally you get hits from really relevant people within tech. So these are your
19

20
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.640
journalists, these are your tech bloggers, these are your VCs and your angels.
20

21
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.400
So depending on what you're going for, being hunted and discovered on Product Hunt can significantly
21

22
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.230
boost your product launch.
22

23
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.260
Personally this is one of my favorite websites and I've been a member very early on.
23

24
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.400
In fact, it's probably the first thing I do when I crack over my laptop in the morning and drink my coffee.
24

25
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.440
It's Product Hunt
25

26
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.980
I go to to discover what cool new things are being built and really tap the pulse of our tech community.
26

27
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.890
So I'm going to talk about a couple of things to note
27

28
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.140
when you are going to go for launch on Product Hunt because it has some quirks that you need to be aware
28

29
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.510
of in order to have a successful launch. As you can imagine, if there's tens of thousands of hits to this
29

30
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.040
website there's also hundreds of product submissions every day.
30

31
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.980
So in order for yours to appear within the crucial front page as you can see it gets cut off about here,
31

32
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.960
there's you know maybe 22 more.
32

33
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.890
And these are the featured products.
33

34
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.090
So that means it's either been hunted by somebody influential or it's been noticed by the Product Hunt
34

35
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.800
team or it's just gain a massive amount of traction.
35

36
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.690
Now if you sign up to the website either through referral or by yourself and you try to hunt a product
36

37
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.670
where it will end up is this tab which is the newest hunts.
37

38
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.890
And as you can see by looking at the upvotes or the comments, this is not as readily discovered compared
38

39
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.040
to the featured page.
39

40
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.430
So here we've got about maybe 70 products and this is not what you see when you first go onto Product
40

41
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.680
Hunt. And the way that most people use this website is that they'll scroll through typically just you
41

42
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.820
know the first featured page.
42

43
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.350
And in order to end up here there's a few things that you need to know.
43

44
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.720
Firstly, the 24 hour cycle starts at 8:00 a.m. GMT.
44

45
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.430
So that means if you want a full 24 hours of exposure on the front page, you're going to have to you're
45

46
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.150
going to have to get your product hunted at 8:01am. And the person who hunts your product matters a great
46

47
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.950
deal.
47

48
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.570
There are super influences within Product Hunt who have the ability to boost you straight to the featured
48

49
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.290
page and that's where you need to be because there's a whole bunch of APIs a whole bunch of newsletters
49

50
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.410
etc. that scrape from the top post on Product Hunt.
50

51
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.320
And also if you end up in the top five, you get distribution out to their email list in a daily sort of
51

52
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.130
summary.
52

53
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.070
So get in touch with people who are influential hunters and the best way is usually through Twitter.
53

54
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.160
And you need to provide them with a number of details that they'll need.
54

55
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.410
Now this includes the name of the product, the URL, the tagline.
55

56
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.880
These are basically things that they're going to have to input into Product Hunt in order to hunt you.
56

57
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.310
Now if they're a pro Hunter then they might have other things that they want from you.
57

58
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.370
But essentially the point is just to make their lives as easy as pain free as possible
58

59
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.070
and on top of that that you have an interesting product for them to want to hunt.
59

60
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.090
Then you have maximum chance of success.
60

61
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.960
So how do you know who are the super influencers?
61

62
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.680
Well there's a website that I've linked down here which is a Product Hunt leaderboard and you can see here
62

63
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.350
the top 200 products of all time but you can also see the top 200 hunters
63

64
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.670
and this is updated every day or so. And that depends on the number of votes and the number things they've hunted,
64

65
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.790
the number of followers.
65

66
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.370
And these are people who have a lot of influence on this platform.
66

67
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.800
Essentially the way to do it is one by one, figure out who these guys are on Product Hunt.
67

68
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.200
Check out what they've hunted previously and try to figure out what are they interested in, what kind
68

69
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.900
of products do they tend to hunt.
69

70
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.880
And out of that list find maybe 20 or 30 people who you think could be interested in what you're doing
70

71
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.920
and hit them up over Twitter.
71

72
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.810
So Product Hunt is linked with Twitter.
72

73
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.990
So in most cases if you just search Twitter for their handle, it will be the same person and just tweet at 
73

74
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.580
them and see if they will be kind enough to hunt your product.
74

75
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.880
Now the other thing about Product Hunt is that when you do get hunted and you obviously want to be upvoted
75

76
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.610
because the more up votes the higher you go.
76

77
00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.610
Now that's not always the case because if you look for example here, these people Avocode have a
77

78
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.180
168 upvotes.
78

79
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.890
But these people have 169 upvotes.
79

80
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.100
Why are they below this one?
80

81
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.270
Well because Product Hunt actually has a sophisticated algorithm and it's getting more and more sophisticated
81

82
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.290
day by day.
82

83
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:23.680
So the thing that-- so one of the things to note is that if you go to the page for your product and you
83

84
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:32.050
share this link with people, the resulting upvotes that you get won't be as strongly weighted as if
84

85
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.180
they discovered it from the home page.
85

86
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.550
So if from the home page I upvote Avocode here,
86

87
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:44.910
this is a much stronger indicator of interest than if I came to Product Hunt through the shared link.
87

88
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:51.340
The other thing that you really have to try not to do is never share the direct link on Facebook, on
88

89
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.090
Twitter anywhere asking for votes.
89

90
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.220
It's a part of Product Hunt community guidelines.
90

91
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.430
They don't want people to solicit upvotes.
91

92
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.280
Now that can be okay if you're you know already near the top and you just share the home page and tell
92

93
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.910
people you know go upvote us,
93

94
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.560
We are Pitchbot on the front page.
94

95
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.160
But what if you're not there?
95

96
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.450
What if you're on the newest list which is really hard to discover?
96

97
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.640
Or what if you are actually below the show 22 more? what if you're somewhere down here?
97

98
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.000
Then it can be really hard to direct your community to help you out and upvote you.
98

99
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.840
So one of the things that you can do is so say if you are something you say Bookup right? You can actually
99

100
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:39.190
search for Bookup and hit enter and share this link instead.
100

101
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.630
Now this doesn't always work especially if your name sounds really similar to a whole bunch of other
101

102
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.240
startups or products.
102

103
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.950
But it can often mean the difference but it can often mean the difference of being penalized for your
103

104
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.460
upvotes or actually having it count.
104

105
00:07:53.590 --> 00:08:01.680
So the big no no is sharing the link, pasting it everywhere that's public and trying to solicit votes.
105

106
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:08.140
You often see products that start climbing the charts on Product Hunt home page and then suddenly crash
106

107
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.680
because they trigger the algorithm.
107

108
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.990
So I could probably talk about so I could probably talk about Product Hunt for days and days if not
108

109
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.170
a week.
109

110
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:23.050
And there's a lot of intricacies that you have to abide by if you want a successful launch on Product
110

111
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:23.540
Hunt.
111

112
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:31.080
But the important thing is that once your product gets hunted, then nobody can hunt the same link again.
112

113
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:38.530
So make sure that you're properly prepared if you are going to go for a Product Hunt launch and make sure
113

114
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.590
that you try and get an influencer on Product Hunt to help you out.
114

115
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.270
Now what are the advantages of actually ending up on here?
115

116
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:52.440
Very often through either personal experience or friends of mine who have done product launches,
116

117
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:57.260
if you end up on the front page especially within the top five you can expect tens of thousands of hits
117

118
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.940
just within 24 hours.
118

119
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:05.020
And that usually translates to a couple of thousands of either downloads or buys or whatever it takes
119

120
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.270
to acquire your product.
120

121
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.880
So it is a huge thing.
121

122
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.200
And also you get noticed by the right people.
122

123
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:16.150
So if you're going to launch a digital product or even a physical product, as long as it fits one of
123

124
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:22.010
these categories it's well worth just investigating and planning your launch on Product Hunt.
