00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,180
One of the first ways of the idea of validation I'm going to talk about is doing it in person and in
1

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,970
real life.
2

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,320
Are you I'm not online? And this is the absolute easiest way of validating your idea or your product and it's
3

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,900
basically just talking to somebody about it.
4

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,600
Now the important thing is that you have to get good feedback and you have to listen to that feedback.
5

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,270
You have to find somebody in your life who is not afraid of telling you that your idea is absolutely
6

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:27,780
crap.
7

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,370
Of course they can be wrong.
8

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,150
You have those people who just tell you that you're no good at anything.
9

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:39,390
But there are also people who will give you balanced critical opinions and those are the most valuable
10

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,740
people you can find.
11

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,080
Now the thing about now the thing about humans is that we don't take criticism very well.
12

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,110
One of the things that a lot of founders can get stuck in is this sort of idea chasm when they are so
13

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,950
vested in this brilliant idea that's going to be the next unicorn or the next Facebook,
14

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,700
they cannot accept any sort of criticism.
15

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,040
And I've seen this so often when people come to me for advice on their idea or the company that they're
16

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,970
starting. Now I often try to give a balanced feedback
17

18
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,060
you know if there's something that's really glaringly obvious that makes their idea completely unfeasible
18

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,230
I will tell them about it. And you see the way that different people react to that kind of feedback. Some
19

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,940
people--
20

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,080
Now some people will argue back and say yeah but there's this and that which is good that means they're thinking
21

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,460
about it.
22

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,020
But then there's other people who will just completely not accept any sort of criticism of their idea.
23

24
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,950
And this is what you must guard against.
24

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:46,110
Look to see if you are doing this in the business or app idea that you're pursuing because it could
25

26
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,430
potentially cost you years in time and lots of money.
26

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,500
So listen to critical feedback, evaluate it to see if it's valid.
27

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,730
Now this is not to say that if you have a brilliant idea and everybody shoots you down that you should
28

29
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,580
give up on it because there's a lot of ideas that are open markets that we never really thought about. Because
29

30
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,230
UBER started initially targeting the luxury car market, It was absolutely tiny. And nobody, VCs or angels
30

31
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,150
investors could actually see it going anywhere and definitely you know a lot of people missed out on
31

32
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,920
a great opportunity to invest because they couldn't see it getting this much traction and ending up
32

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,390
where they are now.
33

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,830
And similarly with AirBnB there were a lot of people who were like, "why would you want strangers
34

35
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,490
in your house?
35

36
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,080
Surely they're just going to rape and murder you.
36

37
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,290
This is totally never going to turn out well."
37

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:43,220
And yet you know right now AirBnB has a huge percentage of the private short term rental market cap.
38

39
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,310
So it's not to say that you should let the opinions of others determine how you're going to go forward
39

40
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,940
but it's important to absorb some of the criticisms so that it can guide your decision making or that
40

41
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,990
you can address it
41

42
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,220
when you do launch. So don't be stuck in your own idea
42

43
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,620
chasm. Listen to people's feedback and opinions.
43

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,710
So this is essentially a boiled down approach of how you can go about doing this from today
44

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,670
essentially if you already have an idea. So it's called the Starbucks approach and it's basically where
45

46
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,800
you just walk into Starbucks and chat to a strangers. So find somebody who's sitting alone at the table
46

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,520
and either offer to buy them a muffin or offer to buy them a coffee. And you ask them about your brother's
47

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,780
app idea or your brother's startup idea. And this is very important because if you tell a stranger or
48

49
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,420
even you know somebody know that you have this great idea,
49

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,260
people don't tend to want to disappoint other people. They will refrain from giving
50

51
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:50,850
you know the harshest of criticisms because they care about how you feel. And as humans we are all kind
51

52
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,430
of empathetic in that way.
52

53
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,870
So by saying that it's your friend or your brother's idea and you're just doing a little bit of you
53

54
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:05,070
know market validation, then it removes them having to be nice about it. And you don't want them to just
54

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,610
tell you "Yeah it's great.
55

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,220
Well done."
56

57
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,630
You know that's not what you want at all.
57

58
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,870
You want them to identify
58

59
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,330
all of the things that could go wrong with your idea and to bring your attention to things that you
59

60
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,940
haven't really thought about.
60

61
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,560
And step 3 is of course asking them what do they think about this idea,
61

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,220
do they think it's going to work?
62

63
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,490
If not why if yes why etc.
63

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,840
Now this approach is going to cost you maximum Â£10 or $15. So for the price of two coffees and maybe
64

65
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,380
30 minutes of your time
65

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,100
you could potentially be saving yourself months of hard work of toil and a lot of investment of your
66

67
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,300
resources that will go down the drain because of something that you know you haven't thought about or
67

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,200
because it was actually a terrible idea to begin with.
68

69
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,180
So whenever I tell people this, there's always somebody who asked me you know "should I ask them for an
69

70
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,990
NDA which is a non-disclosure agreement?" It's essentially sort of loosely legal binding document that prohibits
70

71
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,280
the person from sharing details of your idea with anybody else.
71

72
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,650
And my answer is always in phatic clean no.
72

73
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,180
And the reason for that is because if you've ever built a company if you've ever built anything worthwhile,
73

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,770
you know that it takes so much more than just the idea. You know a lot of people can have ideas but the
74

75
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,450
ones who become found and the ones who become successful are always the people who take action.
75

76
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,410
And I can tell you that there's not a lot of people who take action in this world.
76

77
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,510
And also if it is a good idea that you've got, you can bet that right now across the world five other
77

78
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,730
people at least five other people will have had the same idea.
78

79
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,530
There is nothing unique about our brain.
79

80
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,660
There is only something unique about what we choose to take action on and whether if we do so.
80

81
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,110
So don't worry about NDAs, don't worry about people stealing your idea.
81

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,530
It is so much more valuable getting that feedback getting information from people maybe with domain
82

83
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,040
knowledge or getting criticisms about your idea that you can address.
83

84
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,960
So this is the approach that is probably the cheapest and the least time consuming and it allows you
84

85
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,360
to gauge firsthand at people's reactions and people's feedback.
85

86
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,550
And I can honestly say that this is probably one of the best ways of validating your idea.
86

87
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:34,660
Now I know that not everybody is comfortable with the idea of going up to a stranger and you know exposing
87

88
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,090
your your deepest darkest secrets in the form of your app idea or your startup idea.
88

89
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,020
But just try it once or twice because starting a startup is all about the hustle,
89

90
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,520
it's all about you know getting out there and getting people to know about what it is that you do or
90

91
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,240
how it is that you're helping people.
91

92
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,930
So if you can't bring yourself to discuss your idea with a stranger for 30 minutes in Starbucks you
92

93
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,190
know there's really minimal risks here.
93

94
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,320
The worst thing that can happen is that they'll say no.
94

95
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,990
And then you move onto the next person and nobody's going to die.
95

96
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,330
Nothing's going to happen.
96

97
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,420
So just as a challenge for those you guys who are listening right now and you have an app idea or
97

98
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,870
you have a startup idea, go out there grab a coffee buy somebody else a coffee see what they think about
98

99
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,520
it and practice this way of idea of validation.
