00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,650
So this is pretty much something that applies to the Apple app store more than anything else.
1

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,730
And it's this key line "Only on the App Store".
2

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:16,940
Now if you have a look at the home screen on the featured page, at the top you'll see an app being featured
3

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,510
on a wide banner. And very frequently if you look at the bottom of the banner there is this line "Only
4

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,970
on the App Store".
5

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,320
And this is where the app is only available on the Apple platform.
6

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,100
The editors at the app stores actively look for apps that are doing really well but are as of yet not
7

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,940
available anywhere else. And this effect contributes to why all of those Android users out there are
8

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,960
getting their apps
9

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,910
you know maybe a year later or two years later.
10

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,790
And it's because when you are being considered for feature on the App Store, you'll get a call from the
11

12
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:59,510
App Store manager and one of the questions that they will ask you is "Are you exclusive to the Apple
12

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,230
App Store?"
13

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,420
And at this point you want to be able to say yes, hell yes, we are.
14

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,070
We love Apple so much.
15

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,570
Please feature us.
16

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,810
Maybe you want to play it a little bit cooler than that. But it is something that's really important to
17

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,360
them for whatever reason
18

19
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,730
I'm going to add to the conjecture.
19

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,840
This is why a lot of app developers especially game developers, even if they have the resources will
20

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,640
first develop and launch on the iOS App Store, and then work on the Android version.
21

22
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:31,670
So a lot of people have questions as to should I develop the iOS or Android? or which one should I
22

23
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,320
do first?
23

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,520
And this is one of the things that will determine your answer to that question.
