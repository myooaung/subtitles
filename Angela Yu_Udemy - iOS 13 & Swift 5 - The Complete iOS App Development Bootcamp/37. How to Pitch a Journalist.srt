00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,050
Now the next thing that we're going to dress is what is the right modality for contacting journalists.
1

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,510
And a lot of journalists have expressed their preferences and basically the summary is that email is
2

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,140
king.
3

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,820
Don't pitch a journalist over Twitter.
4

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,010
You can't do it in 140 characters.
5

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,140
Don't try and spam journalists to DM them.
6

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,580
It doesn't really work.
7

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,740
And don't be creepy and stalk them over Facebook.
8

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,390
It's just not the right thing to do.
9

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,670
Instead simply just write an email that the body shouldn't be more than 200 words long and the subject
10

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,290
line should be you know 40 to 60 characters.
11

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,480
So basically short, punchy, to the point, don't waste anybody's time.
12

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,740
And at the same time give them a couple of links or attachments to allow them to find out more if they
13

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,400
wish to.
14

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,800
Now this is a template from a friend of mine and it basically encapsulates all of that advice.
15

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,200
It's short, it's punchy,
16

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,120
it's the point. It gets across everything that you need to get across
17

18
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,140
and at the same time it doesn't waste anybody's time.
18

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,990
So have a look at it and see if you can adapt it for your own use.
19

20
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,560
The next question people tend to have is what is the best time for reaching a journalist.
20

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:09,890
And this is surprisingly important because you want to be the guy or girl who gets your email into
21

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:16,250
the journalist inbox first thing in their work day because we all know how it feels at 4:00 p.m. on
22

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:16,950
a Friday.
23

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,920
That's the time when most people have given up on life. In order for your email to have the best chance
24

25
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,680
of being received, being read and being considered,
25

26
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,360
you want to get to them when they're fresh when they're starting a work day.
26

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,440
And that translates to around 6:30 to 7:30 a.m..
27

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,190
Now you can do something really creepy which I heard from a press expert and the tip is to look at the
28

29
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,770
Twitter feed of the journalists and every single tech journalist worth their salt will have a Twitter
29

30
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:52,910
account. And look at when they first start either replying to tweets or liking tweets or basically any
30

31
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,170
sort of activity.
31

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,040
And that probably is the time when they wake up.
32

33
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:03,650
So this is maximum creepy but probably quite effective and just something to consider when you are going
33

34
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,540
down this route.
34

35
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,760
Now the next tool is really really useful not just for pitching journalists but for life in general.
35

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,230
And this is something called BoomerangGmail.com. And it's basically a plug in for Gmail that is
36

37
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,150
really powerful.
37

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,690
It allows you to schedule your emails at any point in the future.
38

39
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,880
So this means that if you're pitching a tech journalist who lives in the opposite time zone to you, you
39

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,810
don't have to be awake at 4:30 am sending that email.
40

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,050
You can schedule this to be sent later at any time point. You can schedule your email to be sent out at
41

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,710
any time point in the future.
42

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,180
And this also happens to be how my mother gets a happy birthday note from me without fail every single
43

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,710
year on her birthday.
44

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,750
So use it for life use it for business.
45

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,390
Either way, it's a really really useful free plugin.
46

47
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,050
Check it out.
47

48
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,090
Now we're really giving away a lot of secret sauce.
48

49
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,820
These tools are some of my favorite in the world.
49

50
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,580
This is another one called GetSideKick.com and it's made by HubSpot.
50

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,250
This is one of the most powerful email tools out there.
51

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,500
What allows you to do is to track your email.
52

53
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:12,810
So what the service does is that it embeds a invisible pixel into your HTML email
53

54
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:20,780
and once that invisible pixel gets loaded on the recipient's email client you get a notification telling
54

55
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,050
you that your email was opened by
55

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,800
so and so.
56

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,840
So this is really useful for pitching journalists because sometimes your email will just get lost in
57

58
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,530
a sea of emails.
58

59
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:38,210
And if you know that your email hasn't even been opened then it's probably not a bad idea to try and
59

60
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:44,390
resend the email or reword the email a week later and see if you have a better chance.
60

61
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,970
Now the next thing to remember is that before you pitch any journalist make sure that you have a press
61

62
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,380
kit that's ready.
62

63
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,680
So this includes founder headshots,
63

64
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,150
this includes your logos,
64

65
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,590
this includes your website home page or your app screenshots
65

66
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,900
if you're an app company or product photos if you're a hardware company etc.
66

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,180
Basically these are high quality images or videos in various sizes and 
67

68
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,570
resolutions that if a journalist decides to pick up on your story they can simply write you know a paragraph
68

69
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,850
and drop these images in without having to contact you ever again.
69

70
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,380
And the rule for pitching journalists as well as for life is if you can make somebody else's life easier
70

71
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,230
then you'll usually have a better chance of getting what you want.
71

72
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,760
So make sure that you include this as a link to an attachment rather than just an attachment itself
72

73
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,420
because most spam filters will filter out emails which has a zip file in it.
