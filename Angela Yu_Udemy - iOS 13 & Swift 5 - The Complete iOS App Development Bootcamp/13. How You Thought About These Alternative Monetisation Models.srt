00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,490
Okay. This is just a few more monetization strategies for you to consider.
1

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,410
And one of those is in-app purchases.
2

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,060
Now in-app purchases can be either real or virtual.
3

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,450
So you're probably already familiar with virtual in-app purchases.
4

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:23,910
These are the gems, the money, the time, the energy, whatever it is. And it's really frequently used in mobile
5

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,620
apps that make your gaming experience slightly easier or faster or whatever it is.
6

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:35,610
And the thing with in-app purchases is that both Apple and Google take a 30%  cut of whatever
7

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,260
it is that you make as long as it's a virtual good.
8

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,150
So this is something to be aware of because if you're going to implement because if you're going to
9

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:54,510
implement real world purchases like hailing an Uber cab or selling T-shirts through an app then you
10

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,550
should think about using alternative methods for in-app purchases
11

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,940
because according to the T and Cs of both app stores, you're allowed to bypass the App Store for purchases
12

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,120
only when you're selling something that is non-virtual.
13

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,540
So this is something to think about.
14

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,020
But of course if you're selling something that doesn't cost you anything and it's just bits and bytes
15

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,310
moving around of course then you have to implement payment through the app stores.
16

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,470
The other term that you'll hear quite frequently mentioned is the freemium model.
17

18
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,360
So this is basically where you download an app for free and you have certain features that are locks
18

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,980
behind a paywall.
19

20
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,070
Now this can be either on a subscription basis such as you know your your services like Dropbox or Spotify
20

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,770
or it could just be a one time upgrade to an existing app so that you get some extra features or that
21

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,260
you get rid of the ads.
22

23
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,340
Now the freemium model is something that I would highly urge you to consider in this day and time.
23

24
00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:00,840
It's hard to attract a users attention for a paying app currently and it's much easier to give users
24

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,230
I would say 80% of the features for your app as a free app and only for those who really use
25

26
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,810
it heavily or really want the premium features then charge those people X amount in order for them to
26

27
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,060
get those other features.
27

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:21,090
That tends to work out a lot better than the apps which give you like 5% functionality free and
28

29
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,520
then the rest you know 95% is locked behind a paywall. That tends to generate bad reviews, bad
29

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,700
ratings and reduces your number of downloads.
30

31
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,320
But again of course this varies from app to app and it really depends on what it is that you're
31

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,160
building.
32

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,660
So have a look at some of the other apps within your own niche that you're building and see how they
33

34
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,680
are monetizing.
34

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,320
That's always a good guide.
35

36
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,700
Now finally just three more that I want to mention. One is white labeling and this is something that
36

37
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,600
we do quite frequently at the London App Brewery.
37

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,130
So to explain this let me give you an example.
38

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:59,320
Say you're gym and you want to create an app for your members to be able to look at the class timetable
39

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,110
to be able to book certain classes update their membership etc.
40

41
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,570
Now your needs won't really be different from another gyms name.
41

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,560
So what you do as an app developer is you create something that doesn't have anyone's branding or logo
42

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,380
on it and then you approach a gym and you say, "hey would you like an app for your gym?"
43

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,570
If they agree if you sign a deal then you reskin it with all of their logo their branding their custom
44

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,930
text etc.
45

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,980
And this means that you can create one app and sell it again and again and again to the same niche. And
46

47
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,370
it can be a relatively lucrative way of monetizing an
47

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,080
app. Next is the partnership model and this is something that's still relatively new and relatively unexplored.
48

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,400
One of the first apps that utilized this was Runkeeper and what they did was that they implemented these
49

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:58,130
challenges whereby if you completed say 5,000 meters you would get the reward in the form of a discount.
50

51
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,800
So you could have maybe 20% off Nike shoes. And the nice thing about this is that all three parties
51

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,330
involved,
52

53
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:13,590
so the user, the app developer and the advertiser all benefit from this model. Nobody really loses out.
53

54
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:21,840
The user gets real life benefits from using the app, the app developer gets more in app usage because
54

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,200
people are spurred on by these incentives and the advertiser gets exposure for something that's relatively
55

56
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,240
cheap to implement.
56

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,630
So if you're building an app that has real world attachments so say if it's something related to retail
57

58
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,910
or something that's related to the food industry, then you can think about approaching you know brick
58

59
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,850
and mortar shops or companies and asking if they would like to have a sponsorship deal where you get
59

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,980
X amount upfront and then depending on exposure you would figure out some sort of deal between the two
60

61
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,450
of you.
61

62
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,250
This is something I really recommend people to think about because it's a relatively unexplored strategy
62

63
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,230
and I've seen it work quite well in a number of cases.
63

64
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,880
The last one that nobody really wants to talk about which I've mentioned already briefly is selling your
64

65
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,100
user data for money.
65

66
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,540
Now the problem with this is one of ethics I guess and conscience. If you look within the privacy policy
66

67
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,910
of a lot of the health and fitness apps that you've got on your phone hidden in there beneath layers
67

68
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,780
and layers of legal jargon is the right to sell your health data.
68

69
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,100
And the problem that I have with this is probably just a personal one.
69

70
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,300
I don't really like the idea that my health and fitness data will be sold to life insurance companies
70

71
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,920
or health insurance companies. I don't really want people to know that you know the last time that went
71

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,280
for a run was probably 2009 or that I can eat 12 donuts in a sitting.
72

73
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,260
These are private details
73

74
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,560
and I think that both of the app stores will in the coming years crack down on this practice.
74

75
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,680
I mean at the moment it's still pretty gray whether if it's legal or illegal.
75

76
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,150
But I think this is not a reliable way of monetizing your app
76

77
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,810
and we strongly recommend against it.
77

78
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,340
So those are some of the most common ways of monetizing your app
78

79
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,190
and with every year you see new strategies popping up.
79

80
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,770
And it's something that you have to think really hard about because if you get your monetization strategy
80

81
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:31,140
right then it's much easier to succeed commercially than if you were you know just go for the default
81

82
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,310
paid app route because everybody is defaulting to that.
82

83
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,720
So have a think about what it is that your app offers,
83

84
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,290
look at some of your competitors within your niche and see what it is that they're doing and think about
84

85
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,340
which of these methods might fit your app best.
