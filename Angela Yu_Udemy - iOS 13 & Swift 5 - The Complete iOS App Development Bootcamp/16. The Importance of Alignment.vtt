Now next, we're again going to talk about a really fundamental aspect of user interface design or indeed
1

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.010
any sort of graphic design.
2

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.190
And this is something that is relatively low effort but makes a huge amount of difference.
3

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.030
And in fact it's a very easy way to turn something that looks undesigned to something that has purpose
4

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.620
and has been designed.
5

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.850
So if we take a look at the comparison below if you compare this blogging website with this blogging
6

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.050
website, there's one minute difference. But that single difference changes how the entire website looks.
7

8
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.280
And that is of course alignment. Alignment is key in any sort of graphical design but also incredibly
8

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.980
important in digital design.
9

10
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.960
So when you have a look over here, you can see that if you follow along the left side of all of these
10

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.860
elements and text you can see a single line that pretty much touches all the edges whereas when you
11

12
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.890
look over here you've got a line that touches that edge and then another line that touches this edge.
12

13
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.270
And this is a fundamental principle of graphical design is that you want to try and minimize the number
13

14
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.550
of alignment lines.
14

15
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.150
So let me show you. There's two fundamental types of alignment.
15

16
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.440
One is called Edge alignment where you have all the elements having one side lining up with a single
16

17
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.480
line just as over here.
17

18
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.790
And there's another thing called center line which is where you line up all the elements by their midpoint
18

19
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.520
and depending on use case you will choose to use one or the other.
19

20
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.660
But in terms of user interface design, edge alignment is what we want. But this isn't strictly limited
20

21
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.180
to digital design. Say if you're creating a business card for somebody as a design
21

22
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.200
if you have a look at the one on the left if we line up the left edge of these two bits of text, graphic
22

23
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.070
designer and their address, they line up with a single line.
23

24
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.160
Now if we go through this document and add all the lines next to these different edge alignment points
24

25
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.350
you can see there is a whole lot of lines and that to the human brain looks messy and uncoordinated.
25

26
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.710
Whereas if you look at the example on the right you have far fewer edge alignment point and that results
26

27
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.180
in a cleaner design that looks more pleasing to the eye.
27

28
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.100
So this is actually quite easy to do when you're creating things say in Photoshop.
28

29
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.450
You can simply drag along a guide from the ruler on the left on the top and then you can line up all
29

30
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.130
of your elements with that guide and they snap into place.
30

31
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.870
So when you're designing your user interfaces for mobile in Photoshop or in sketch or in Illustrator,
31

32
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.150
make sure that you pay attention to edge alignment and try to reduce the number of guides that you find
32

33
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.200
yourself using.
