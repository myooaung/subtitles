00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.350
All right.
1

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.730
So in this lecture, we're going to be covering some of the tools that you'll need in terms of software
2

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.250
and hardware to start developing for iOS first and foremost.
3

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.900
You will need a Mac of some sort.
4

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.900
Now it doesn't have to be the latest or the greatest but it just has to be able to run OS 10.
5

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.430
So it's now called macOS.
6

7
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.250
And the reason why we need macOS is because we need to install a piece of software called Xcode that
7

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.760
will allow us to develop our iOS app.
8

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.590
So this means that iPads - even iPad Pros - are out of the question.
9

10
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.160
But if you had an iMac or if you have a MacBook or even a Mac Mini it will work just fine.
10

11
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.540
So if you don't already have a Mac and you don't want to invest a lot in you know a brand spanking new
11

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.610
top of the range mac book then one of the cheapest ways is probably just going onto eBay and getting
12

13
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.960
a second hand Mac Mini for around $500.
13

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.820
And it's a pretty great deal and it will do just fine.
14

15
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.880
But what do you do if you only have a PC?
15

16
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.730
Well the other option is that you can go for something called macincloud.com
16

17
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.470
So if you head over to macincloud.com, they have a service where essentially they offer you a Mac
17

18
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.030
in the cloud. So you can be using your PC and you have a remote connection to a Mac that is just for
18

19
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.610
you and it's ready got Xcode pre-downloaded, so you can just get up and go.
19

20
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.350
Now, there's a lot of people who ask about Hackintosh or how can you run a Mac, sort of dual boot, a mac
20

21
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.720
on your P.C. without having to pay for service like macincloud.com.
21

22
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.960
Well there's a number of ways that you can do this.
22

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.200
But one of the major downsides that Apple is very strict about controlling their software and the environment
23

24
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.740
in which their software runs.
24

25
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.350
So even if you're using macincloud.com or even if you're using a Hackintosh solution, you won't be able
25

26
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.820
to run your app on a physical iPhone device you own.
26

27
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.390
The only way that you can do that is by having an actual Mac, but you will be able to run it on a simulator
27

28
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.670
inside Xcode.
28

29
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.640
So this is a simulated version of an iPhone.
29

30
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.880
And for all intents and purposes it will work just as well.
30

31
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.850
It's just, say, if you're really excited about having your app on your iPhone, then you really need to
31

32
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.890
find a way of either borrowing somebody's Mac or, you know, getting one cheaply.
32

33
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.520
The best resource, according to past students, is a website called Hackintosh.com. It talks in detail
33

34
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.000
about how to run a macOS on a PC. But I would still recommend to try out some of the earliest solutions
34

35
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.730
rather than going towards building a Hackintosh.
35

36
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.790
It's just that we've had a lot of students on the in-person program bootcamp who've tried to do this
36

37
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.630
and it's always given them a lot of headaches.
37

38
00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.720
So if you can really try and avoid this. This is almost the last-ditch solution.
38

39
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.300
Now the software that you'll be using is Xcode and this is a piece of software that's written by Apple
39

40
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.860
and allows you to write code, allows you to design your app, as well as run your app within the simulator
40

41
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.330
that it comes with.
41

42
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.220
And this is completely free and in the next lecture we'll be showing you how to download it and how
42

43
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.510
to get it set up. But in order to be able to download the latest version of Xcode which is Xcode 11,
43

44
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.340
you're going to need to update your Mac operating system to macOS Catalina which is also known as
44

45
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.780
10.15
45

46
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.400
Now while you might be able to download Xcode 11 on the last version so the most up to date version
46

47
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.600
of macOS Mojave or 10.14
47

48
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.270
A lot of the features towards the end of the course especially when we start talking about Swift UI
48

49
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.140
and using some of the features around that, you will need to update to Catalin. To check which version
49

50
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.240
of macOS you're running is super simple. Simply just head to the left upper corner where you've got
50

51
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.230
the Apple symbol. And then go to "About This Mac" and you should be able to see the versioning right there.
51

52
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.080
Now in addition to being able to download and use the latest version of Xcode, Catalina also offers
52

53
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.160
some cool features including a better photos app, notes, reminders, as well as something that I was really
53

54
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.360
excited by which is called Sidecar, which allows you to use your iPad as a dual-screen with your Mac.
54

55
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.690
In order to update the latest version of macOS, all you have to do is head over to the Apple symbol again
55

56
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.020
go to System Preferences and then go to Software Update. Here,
56

57
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.000
you should be able to see the update for macOS Catalina and you can simply click through the wizard to
57

58
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.530
update your macOS.
58

59
00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.730
Now another thing to note when you're updating your macOS is to check the age of your laptop or your
59

60
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.910
desktop, because there are certain hardware requirements in order for us to be able to install the latest
60

61
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.650
version of macOS.
61

62
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.010
So here included a list that Apple has given to show which Macs can actually run the latest version of
62

63
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.850
macOS.
63

64
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.600
So check your computer against this one to see if you meet the requirements.
64

65
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.590
But if you do have any difficulties updating your macOS, then this might be one of the reasons.
65

66
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.740
And if this happens to you, it might be that you have to go down the macincloud.com route or you might
66

67
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.370
just have to pick up a cheap version of a Mac Mini off eBay.
67

68
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.450
But that's a tip that tripped up some people when they're updating their OS.
68

69
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.480
So when you're testing your app, you've got the choice of either testing it on a physical device if you
69

70
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.990
own an iPhone or an iPad.
70

71
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.950
So because the course is aimed at teaching you how to make apps for iPhone a lot of the designs that
71

72
00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.310
you'll be making a lot of the project stubs will have the design and layouts optimized for iPhone. So
72

73
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.230
you can still follow along with everything we do in the course with an iPad but just be aware that some
73

74
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.970
of the designs might look a little bit stretched and they might not look exactly the same as you see
74

75
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.670
on the iPhone, but it will work just fine. If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have to run out right
75

76
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.890
away and get one.
76

77
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.870
This is something that I would recommend you know once you realize that you're really into this or if
77

78
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.100
you're at the point where you're about to release on the App Store then you have to test your app on
78

79
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.020
a physical device.
79

80
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.630
It's at this point when you would actually get an iPhone. So, as I mentioned Xcode comes bundled with an iOS
80

81
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.940
simulator and it's sort of like a virtual phone that runs on your computer and you can essentially, you
81

82
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:51.320
know, use the rotate gestures, the shake gestures... You can zoom in and out. You can tap etc. So it's just
82

83
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.920
a simulated iPhone and that works just as well.
83

84
00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.200
The only times when it doesn't really work so well is when you are using notifications or if you're
84

85
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:06.250
using Apple Health or Apple Home or some of those things it can get a little bit tricky.
85

86
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.720
Another thing that you should always ask yourself before you make any app is: "Do you actually need an app?"
86

87
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.580
or can you actually make do with a mobile responsive website?
87

88
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.510
Now because we have a mobile app development agency as well at the London App Brewery, one of the things
88

89
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.570
that we tend to recommend - we have a lot of clients who come to us and say, you know, "I want you to make
89

90
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.670
this app" and we actually spend a lot of time turning people away and telling them "Look, you can get this
90

91
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:42.610
made much quicker and much cheaper by just getting a web designer to make a website for you."
91

92
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:49.700
that's mobile responsive; that scales nicely on the phone because unless you're tapping into some of
92

93
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:56.300
the sensors within the phone, say, if you need the location or if you need to be able to send people notifications -
93

94
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.090
something that is inherent about the phone that you need.
94

95
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:08.630
Otherwise, if you just need to display information then making an app is a very time- and money costly
95

96
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.800
way of going about that.
96

97
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.810
So always think about whether you actually need to make an app before you make any app.
97

98
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.540
And finally, we're just gonna mention that prior to Xcode 7, ... 
98

99
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:29.600
so Xcode 6. In order to actually download the app that you coded up, that you developed, within Xcode
99

100
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.640
onto your physical iPhone device that you own,
100

101
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.960
you actually had to pay Apple $99 a year in order to be on the Apple Developer Program.
101

102
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.920
So as of Xcode 7,
102

103
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:51.140
so I that was September 2015 when it launched, you are now able to do this on any free Apple account.
103

104
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.780
So all you need is just your normal iTunes account which you use to download apps and we'll be able
104

105
00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.650
to get your code and your app onto your physical iPhone device.
105

106
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.460
Now when would you consider signing up for Apple Developer Program?
106

107
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.870
This is when you're ready to launch your app onto the App Store and start generating revenue.
107

108
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.310
So I would recommend that try to delay signing up for the Apple Developer program as long as you can
108

109
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.110
because you're charged on a yearly basis - rolling essentially.
109

110
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.270
So if you're not yet ready to take advantage of the Apple Developer program, if you haven't got your
110

111
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.740
app together yet, if you're not ready to upload to the App Store, then there's actually no point paying
111

112
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.770
Apple for that privilege.
112

113
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:40.730
So, build your app, test it thoroughly. Once you're ready and about to launch it to the App Store then
113

114
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.720
start paying for your Apple Developer Program license.
114

115
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.510
And this gets you access to something called iTunes connect.
115

116
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:52.320
This is a portal where you can upload your apps. You can check your app analytics. How many times has it
116

117
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.540
been downloaded? How many people are using it? You can check your sales. You can see how much money you're
117

118
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.630
making everyday et cetera et cetera.
118

119
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:07.460
So this is something that we're going to cover in one of the last section and we guide you through how
119

120
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.600
to actually upload an app to the App Store.
120

121
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.080
So all of that is coming up.
121

122
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.380
All right.
122

123
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.530
So those were all the tools that you'll need in order to get started.
123

124
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:22.140
And in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how to install and setup Xcode so that you'll be able
124

125
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.220
to get up and running very quickly and we can get started making our first app!
