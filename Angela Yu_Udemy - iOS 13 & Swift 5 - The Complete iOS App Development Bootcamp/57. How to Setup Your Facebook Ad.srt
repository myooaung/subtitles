So if you've never seen what the insides of Facebook ad manager looks like then just simply have a
1

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,110
look at it. You don't have to pay anything to set up a new campaign.
2

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,770
You can go to ad manager from your Facebook account. And once you arrive there if you've never done any
3

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,990
sort of social media marketing, you'll be scared by how much information you have access to.
4

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,740
So for example, not only can you determine where you want to show your ad to so only in the UK or the age
5

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,720
range of the people you want to show it to or the gender or the language, but you have really detailed
6

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,250
targeting abilities. For example like, what is their residential profile,
7

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,500
are they a homeowner,
8

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,830
are they likely mortgaged,
9

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,220
are they likely to be a second time buyer, are they a private home renter and this is the data that Facebook
10

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,650
and Twitter get from either the users posting it themselves and putting that data into Facebook or from
11

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,770
census data.
12

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,890
So it's actually pretty scary and you should realize that any sort of data that you're putting into
13

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,920
Facebook or you're telling your friends via Facebook will get used against you in advertising.
14

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,780
So for example, you can quite easily target all the women who have changed their relationship status
15

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,580
from single to engaged within the last two weeks.
16

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,640
And if you're a wedding photographer or if you're a wedding band, then that means that every single one
17

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,100
of your ads is being shown to a potential customer rather than just anybody.
18

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,500
So part of is the audience targeting
19

20
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,140
is really really useful.
20

21
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,880
But the thing that you have to be aware of is to not make your target niche so small that that pointer
21

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,630
is in the red area.
22

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,510
So you want to keep that point roughly in the center and that usually equates to half a million to a
23

24
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,660
million people.
24

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,500
And the reason for that is because not everybody is simultaneously on Facebook.
25

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:51,000
If you don't have a lot of time, you want your ads to show up to as many relevant people as soon as possible.
26

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,460
So we usually say try to aim for the needle roughly in the middle and don't make it too broad or make
27

28
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,390
it too specific.
28

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,270
It's roughly in this area that you get the best chance of your ads performing well.
29

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,510
So even though you can see that the potential reach is 20 million people the estimated daily reaches
30

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,130
only about 500 to 1300 people.
31

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,490
Now if you up your daily budget to say 20 pounds, then that number will go up.
32

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,760
But we're really looking for the low hanging fruit.
33

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,540
So if your potential reach was only 10,000 people, then your daily reach at a reasonable budget will only
34

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,240
be like 10 people which means that you're not really advertising at scale.
