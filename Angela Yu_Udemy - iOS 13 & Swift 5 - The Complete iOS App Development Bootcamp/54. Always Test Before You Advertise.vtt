00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.780
Now first things first. Before you do any sort of paid advertising please please test your app just to
1

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.960
make sure that there's no bugs, there's no issues, there's no broken features.
2

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.940
Because otherwise this is what you're paying for. You're paying for bad reviews and bad ratings.
3

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.450
And even though everyone's star rating hurts and every bad review hurts, it will hurt even more when
4

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.050
you realize that you paid for those users in order to hate on you.
5

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.120
So don't let this happen.
6

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.020
Instead, make sure that you test your app thoroughly.
7

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.050
Now that includes giving it to your friends and family
8

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.880
but then what do you do once you run out of family and friends?
9

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.060
Well there's a lot of services that you can use. If you are developing an Android app there's a really good
10

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.250
service I would recommend
11

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
and they have a free tier as well and it's called Monkop. And it basically allows you to upload your
12

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.260
Android apk into- onto their servers and it will automatically test your app on various devices,
13

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.020
various screen sizes and checks for any bugs or crashes.
14

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.720
And it gives you a nice little report telling you what you need to fix and what are some of the issues
15

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.480
with your app.
16

17
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.180
Now they are yet to support iOS and currently in terms of testing on iOS
17

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.000
there are a few tools but they all require a little bit of coding knowledge.
18

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.070
So an alternative and probably better way of getting your app tested is by using real people.
19

20
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.080
So there's a company called User Testing that hires professional quality assurance or QA testers to look through
20

21
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.610
your app and give you a recording of their impressions, of their thoughts, of any bug,s any issues, any
21

22
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.970
feature requests etc.
22

23
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.070
So you'll get a lot more insight than purely just bug crash reporting.
23

24
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.800
So that's another website to explore. But just make sure essentially that you have tested your app to
24

25
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.970
death and you know that it will perform as you expect it to on most of the common iOS versions or Android
25

26
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.480
versions or the different phones.
26

27
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.230
Now another way of getting feedback on your app is using a website called PreApps.
27

28
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.330
So here, you can sign up for free and you can put up the app icon screenshots and description for your
28

29
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.720
app and the user base of this website will try and be helpful and give you feedback.
29

30
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.820
So essentially this is a platform where beta apps go in order to test their copywriting or test their icons
30

31
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.130
on real users.
31

32
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.140
And this is also a great platform where you can recruit beta testers for your app.
32

33
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.380
So instead of paying people through user testing, the idea is that you can gather users who are early
33

34
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.410
adopters to get your app for free and test it out for you.
34

35
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.490
Now another way that you can be to test for free is a bit of a hack.
35

36
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.090
So the idea is that when you launch your app onto the Apple App Store or onto the Google app store, you
36

37
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.760
have a choice between launching your app simultaneously to across the world,
37

38
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.330
so all app stores in the world, or you can tick to only launch to certain countries.
38

39
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.970
And one of the things that we tend to do is that for the first three months of our app launches, we tend
39

40
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.150
to only release it to New Zealand and Canada.
40

41
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.200
And the reason for that is because even though those countries have smaller numbers of users than our
41

42
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.910
main target audience which is the UK and US, but at the same time the users in New Zealand and Canada will
42

43
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.780
share a lot of the same demographics as our target audience and also we'll share similar culture, similar
43

44
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.050
sense of humor, similar appreciation of design.
44

45
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.870
And that means that we can iron out any issues before we launch to our target audience because if you
45

46
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.990
can be sure that the audience in New Zealand or Canada love your app and that you've resolved any issues
46

47
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.710
for those users, once you've made those users happy then if you launched to the rest of the world or
47

48
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.350
if you launched to your target audience, you have a much higher chance of getting it right the first
48

49
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.860
time.
49

50
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.100
So this is just a cool way of essentially beta testing for free.
