1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:07,700
So one of the most obvious ways that everybody thinks of immediately is paying for apps up front. Now
1

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,160
paid apps are really easy to implement.
2

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,800
And essentially it's when you list your app onto either the Google Play store or the Apple App Store,
3

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,150
you essentially just set a price tier.
4

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,240
And those tiers are determined by the app stores themselves.
5

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:29,560
So as a new developer it's very easy to assume that this is you know the way that you should go.
6

7
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,280
And the reason for that is mostly guided by results on the apps that you see. For example this is an
7

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,480
app called Fit Men cook that was developed by some friends of ours and essentially features a whole
8

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,640
bunch of healthy recipes by a blogger called Kevin curry.
9

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,970
So they basically launched on the App Store and within the first day they hit the number 2 spot in
10

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,650
the top paid iPhone apps with a pricing model of $2.99.
11

12
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,720
They were wedged between Monument Valley and Minecraft.
12

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:07,690
So you can see that these people did really really well off this app essentially.
13

14
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,510
And you can mistakenly think like, "Oh so you know that's how I should monetize.
14

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:22,130
I should just price it at $2.99 and put my app onto the App Store and it will perform equally well."
15

16
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,500
But the thing that you don't realize is that there's a number of behind the scenes factors that determined
16

17
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,400
the success. Not only the fact that it was a great app but also a number of factors that related to how
17

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,010
they went about promoting it.
18

19
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,650
So the biggest factor in that is the the guy Kevin Curry who I think got 50 percent of the revenue of
19

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,380
the app without really contribution to the development of it other than his recipes.
20

21
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:56,750
But he has a huge following. He has a blog with tens of thousands of subscribers, a Twitter page with
21

22
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:04,310
you know 20K followers and a Facebook page with again you know hundreds of thousands of people who
22

23
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,240
like it.
23

24
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:12,200
So what that means is that this guy is a serious influencer in this field and on the day of launch or
24

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:20,090
even prior to launch, he can gear up his subscribers his followers his fans to download this app within
25

26
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,030
the first 24 hours.
26

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,290
The thing you have to realize is that on both the Google app store as well as the Apple App Store, the
27

28
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:37,190
first 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days of your apps performance is crucial to getting it featured or
28

29
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,480
getting it highlighted in some sort of ranking.
29

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,970
So if you are able to achieve a massive amount of downloads on day 1 within the first 24 hours that
30

31
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,470
sends a huge spike and a signal to the app stores.
31

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,380
Potentially furthering your exposure by featuring it somewhere or getting it listed in the top paid
32

33
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,840
apps.
33

34
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,480
So that sort of stops a snowball effect that gets you more and more downloads and sustains you within
34

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,000
the rankings.
35

36
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,970
So this is one way in which paid apps can work really well.
36

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,570
If you find that you can partner with a influencer in a particular niche that applies to your app and
37

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,620
even if they don't do anything at all for the development of your app if they can bring the people from
38

39
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,640
day 1, then it's well worth going down that route.
39

40
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,130
Now another way in which paid apps can work is if you're developing something that the world has never
40

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,230
seen before.
41

42
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,080
So this is an app developed by a guy called Peter Bentley who's a friend of mine and he created an app called 
42

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,960
iStethoscope Pro.
43

44
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:52,380
Now what he realized was that the iPhone had superior acoustic hardware than it needed to for a telephone.
44

45
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:59,690
And this was because it inherited a lot of that hardware that audio hardware from the iPod which as
45

46
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:08,600
we all know the iPhone is built upon. So upon realizing that, he decided to tap into the microphone
46

47
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:17,120
of the iPhone and he built an app that allows you to point the phone at your heart or at your lungs
47

48
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,590
and put on some headphones to listen to your heartbeat or your lung sounds.
48

49
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,410
And he didn't actually do very much advertising at all but he got a massive amount of media attention
49

50
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,170
just because of how innovative this was.
50

51
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:38,930
This was a way of turning your phone into potentially a medical device.
51

52
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:49,010
And in fact having used it for a while I can say that using iStethoscope Pro app with the iPhone is almost
52

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,660
as good as some of the £300 £400 pound electronic stethoscopes that are out there on the market.
53

54
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:04,280
And in addition to that you can also record your heart sounds or your lung sounds and send it to your doctor by email
54

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,310
for example, which is a huge boon.
55

56
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,980
And I think they are currently building some sort of research project where they are collecting a lot
56

57
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:16,960
of people's heart and lung sounds for research purposes which is really cool as well.
57

58
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,850
But essentially when this app came out, it was priced at I think 99 cents which at the time was the lowest
58

59
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,740
priced tier.
59

60
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,140
He got a massive amount of traction and a massive amount of revenue from this.
60

61
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:35,810
And I think just from the revenue from this one app alone he bought a five bedroom house somewhere in
61

62
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,400
London which is incredible.
62

63
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,760
So if you're building something that's really unique and I mean it really unique it's not just you know
63

64
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,730
some variation of something that already exists that has a huge amount of value for people something
64

65
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,890
like this,
65

66
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:58,590
then you are well within your rights to make it a paid app and you will see revenue from it.
66

67
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,500
Now a third example is where you have the rights to some sort of intellectual property.
67

68
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:13,010
So for example, if you own a question bank for a Bar prep course or medical exams, then you are certainly
68

69
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,420
expected to charge for that information.
69

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,320
And a lot of people do and they actually charge quite a lot.
70

71
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,830
So a lot of these Bar prep courses or question banks or quizzes actually average something like around
71

72
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,270
£20  to £30.
72

73
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:37,430
So if you have domain knowledge in something such as law or medicine and you create a question bank
73

74
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:46,460
then this is a really easy way of creating a niche and relatively lucrative app that can be paid upfront.
74

75
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,130
Now one of the things that we always get asked about were relating to paid apps is how you should price
75

76
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:58,910
it. And what we've noticed through the years is that pricing apps on the App Store is a very delicate
76

77
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,590
matter.
77

78
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,410
People's psychology is very funny about pricing. What you find is that if you have an app that is you
78

79
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:14,570
know maybe a single use app or maybe entertains people for 30 minutes, then you can charge anywhere less
79

80
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,480
than $1.99 and people will be fine with that.
80

81
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:27,080
People are okay with the idea of spending you know the equivalent of a cup of coffee on an app and even
81

82
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,700
if its not the most amazing app in the world, they're happy with paying that amount just for a bit of
82

83
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,680
novelty a bit of discovery.
83

84
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,740
But once you hit the $1.99 threshold and you go above it, people get really angry
84

85
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,940
in the review section if your app is not something spectacular. And there's actually a website that
85

86
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:53,780
collects a bunch of apps that are priced relatively ridiculously say for example the Professional Chef
86

87
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,930
app that's $50 or the Water Globe that's $220.
87

88
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:06,320
So what we tend to recommend is you know start off low and see how people are responding to your app
88

89
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,690
if they're liking it.
89

90
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:14,630
And then as you add more features and as you have more positive reviews if you feel like the app is
90

91
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,790
under valued then you can raise it by a dollar at a time and see how people respond to it. And you eventually
91

92
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,490
reach an equilibrium where people feel like they're getting enough value for what they're paying and
92

93
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,450
you feel like your app is being bought at the right price.
93

94
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,910
So play around with pricing is what we're trying to sing.
