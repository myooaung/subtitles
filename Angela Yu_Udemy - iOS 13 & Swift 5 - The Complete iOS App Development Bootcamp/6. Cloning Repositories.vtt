00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.230
So in the last lesson, we looked at how we can push our local repository to a remote repository
1

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.910
on GitHub.
2

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:17.190
Now, in this lesson, I want to talk about cloning a remote repository to pull it into your local machine.
3

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:26.410
So this is called cloning or the command would be git clone, and that is a way for you to pull down all
4

5
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.910
of the commits and all of the versions of a particular remote repository, and to store the files inside
5

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.740
your working directory.
6

7
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.490
So let's give it a go and see how it works in practice.
7

8
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.410
So inside GitHub, if you search for open-source iOS apps, you can actually see a collaborative list
8

9
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.130
of really awesome open-source iOS apps.
9

10
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.790
So this is the place where you can browse by category and you can look at all the projects that people
10

11
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.370
have made
11

12
00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:03.220
open source on GitHub, and you can maybe learn from how they format their code or how they write things.
12

13
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.120
And it's a really, really good resource that I would recommend you to bookmark.
13

14
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.430
So let's take a look at one of these projects so we can see that commit history so that we can clone
14

15
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.950
it to our local machine.
15

16
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.210
So this is a really cool repository.
16

17
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.400
This is the game 2048 that this guy Austin Xieng has created.
17

18
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:35.530
And we can put it onto our own system and we can have a look at the code, or simply run it and give
18

19
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.400
it a go.
19

20
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.770
So let's try and do that.
20

21
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.820
So the first thing we're going to go to is this button where it says Clone or download.
21

22
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.750
Now, previously, when we've been asking you to download our skeleton project because we haven't yet covered
22

23
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.290
Git or GitHub, we've always asked you to simply download the zip and unzip it.
23

24
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.290
Now, this is not as great an option as using git clone.
24

25
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.580
So that's what we're going to do.
25

26
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:09.730
So if we copy the URL of this particular repository, then we can go back into our Terminal and clone
26

27
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.690
it to our Desktop.
27

28
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.030
So at the moment, I am in my Desktop and all I'm going to do is I'm going to use the command "git clone,"
28

29
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.530
and then I'm going to paste that URL that I copied earlier on.
29

30
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:33.580
So, now if I hit enter, then it's going to clone into my very own local working directory: swift 2048. 
30

31
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.730
And it didn't even take that long because it's actually quite small.
31

32
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.260
So, now if I have a look at my Desktop, I can see this folder.
32

33
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.220
So this is the project that I've just cloned down from GitHub. So if you double click on it, then you can
33

34
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.770
see all of the project files inside swift-2048 as well as the Swift Xcode project.
34

35
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.350
So let's go ahead and double click it to launch it and let's see if it works.
35

36
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.540
So I'm actually going to try and run it locally on my simulator. So I'm not going to change any of these
36

37
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.970
things.
37

38
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.550
Now, if you wanted to run this or anything that you clone from GitHub, then you, obviously, have
38

39
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.620
to change your bundle identifier and also change your team.
39

40
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.970
But right now, I'm not going to mess with it because I'm just going to run it in my simulator,
40

41
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.410
so these things don't matter so much.
41

42
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.160
All right. So here's the app and I can already hit start game. So you can click and pull down to swipe
42

43
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.620
down, and click to right to swipe right, and you can see that this is a beautiful implementation of the
43

44
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.120
2048 game.
44

45
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.600
So it works absolutely perfectly.
45

46
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.380
And if you decide to go ahead and change the bundle identifier and also add your team, then you can actually
46

47
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.530
run it on your phone and play with it.
47

48
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.150
But more importantly, you can have a look inside the code files and see how exactly did they achieve
48

49
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.730
this,
49

50
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.820
you know, what is their coding style, what are some of the things that they used to create this game.
50

51
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.930
So that was a quick demonstration of git clone.
51

52
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:21.100
And the other thing that you should realize is that once you've cloned a project and you cd into it,
52

53
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.200
so let's go inside that project,
53

54
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.230
and you can also use git log to check out some of their previous commits, and you can see they've got all
54

55
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.740
these commit messages that tell you what each commit was all about.
55

56
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.180
All right.
56

57
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.180
So that was a little bit on git cloning.
57

58
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.780
So in the future, when you need to grab any of the skeleton project from our GitHub repository,
58

59
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.060
then you'll know what to do,
59

60
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.820
then you'll be able to use git clone to grab it and download it onto your local system.
60

61
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.690
So in the next lesson, I'm going to be talking about something slightly more advanced. I'm gonna be talking
61

62
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.850
about forking, making pull requests, and merging repositories.
62

63
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.110
So all of that is yet to come.
63

64
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.680
So I'll see you on the next lesson.
