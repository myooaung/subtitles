10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,220
On the other hand if you're somebody who wants to build your own apps for your app business then in
10

11
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:03,300
addition to all of the programming lessons I've also included full modules on app design and app marketing
11

12
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,930
so that by the end of the course you'll know how to build design and publish your app onto the app store.
12

13
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,130
Now this course assumes absolutely no programming experience.
13

14
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,270
So if you're a complete beginner then I'll be there for you every step of the way.

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,860
As I take you through fundamental programming concepts all the way through to intermediate and more advanced
15

16
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,600
programming techniques.
16

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,390
Now if you're an experienced developer on the other hand there's plenty of advance swift programming
17

18
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,260
concepts as well as design patterns to sink your teeth into.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,220

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,510
You're also going to learn about ARKit and core ML which you'll use to build this Pokemon Go style

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,170
app.
33

34

This course has exactly the same curriculum as our in-person programming bootcamp.
38

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,290
So instead of spending thousands of dollars and taking time off work you get access to the same curriculum
39

40
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,800
that has taken years to develop to ensure that you don't just know what you're doing but also why you're
40

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,470
writing the code and what it does.
41

42
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,200
Now don't just take my word for it.
