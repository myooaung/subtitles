1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,980
All right. So I hope you gave that ago.
1

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,380
And now I'm going to show you the solution.
2

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:04,680
All right.
3

4
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:10,710
So I'm going to pull up Terminal and I'm going to navigate to where our WhatFlower is located.
4

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,190
So it's this directory that contains the WhatFlower Xcode project, and I'm just going to drag it into my
5

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,320
Terminal.
6

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,450
So here I'm going to do part in it to create a new pod file,
7

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,390
as you can see up here, and then I'm going to say open Podfile using the application Xcode-beta.
8

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,800
So for you, it should actually be Xcode. If you're working with the beta,
9

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,660
then it will be like this.
10

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,960
So next I'm going to comment out the platform and the pods
11

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:51,090
I'm going to use are pod 'Alamofire' and, of course, we're going to specify the version which was
12

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,250
4.4.
13

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,700
And then the other part that we needed was SwiftyJSON.
14

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,380
All right, cool.
15

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,590
So that's what we need. You can hit Save, Close, and then we're going to go back to our Terminal and say pod
16

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,090
install.
17

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,650
All right.
18

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,470
And it's done.
19

20
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,720
So, now we've got our What Xcode project workspace created and that's what we're going to launch.
20

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,820
So this is the one that's going to contain our pods
21

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,830
if you remember.
22

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,520
All right, cool.
23

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,630
And let's just check to make sure that we can actually import Alamofire.
24

25
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,420
There it is.
25

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,890
And import SwiftyJSON.
26

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,800
There it is as well.
27

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,060
OK.
28

29
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,540
So they're both included.
29

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,610
I'm happy with that. That's done.
30

31
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,380
So if you're confused at all about CocoaPods, then have a look back at the modules where we explored
31

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,910
them in detail. On the next lesson,
32

33
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,830
I'm going to show you the structure for the API call from Wikipedia and we're going to start getting
33

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,770
some information back.
34

35
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,410
I'll see you there.
