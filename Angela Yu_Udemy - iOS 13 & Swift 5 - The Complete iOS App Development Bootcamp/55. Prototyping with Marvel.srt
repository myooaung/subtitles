00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,430
So another way of prototyping which is probably even easier than using Keynote is using a web app called
1

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,650
Marvel app.
2

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,720
Now it's at www.marvelapp.com and it's free to sign up and you can build a three app prototypes on a
3

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,710
free account.
4

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:15,980
All right.
5

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,570
So once you've signed up in your free account you can just go ahead and click Create project. And I'm
6

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:27,530
going to call mine Workout app and I'm going to select a cam the size of iPhone 6 and then I'm going
7

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,740
to create project.
8

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,370
Now they give you some beginning designs that you can simply drag on so I'll show you what that looks
9

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,070
like.
10

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,140
It's basically a whole load of screens that they've designed for you and you can go ahead and just use
11

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,190
them to link up.
12

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,440
And the way that Marvel app works is very similar to Pop.
13

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,300
And it basically allows you to draw up areas that are able to be interacted with and you can link them
14

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,490
to the next screen.
15

16
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:03,170
And you hook them onto the next one and you continue adding these interactive areas until basically
16

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,850
when you're done.
17

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:10,460
And if I go from the beginning and I show you right now it looks like is Marvel is able to put all of
18

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,470
your designs into a really nice little prototype and you go ahead and just click through it essentially.
19

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,550
So it's pretty neat
20

21
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,430
and I'm going to show you how we can design our workout app in Marvel. Right.
21

22
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,970
So after you created the mockups in Sketch there's a really neat way of importing them into Marvel. Now
22

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,430
if you go to marvelapp.coms/prototype-with-sketch. The link is in the text box below.
23

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,250
You can actually download a Sketch plugin.
24

25
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:44,750
Now what that Sketch plugin allows you to do is that you can incorporate your Sketch images and designs
25

26
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,850
into your Marvel prototypes.
26

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,200
So I've already downloaded and installed the Sketch plugin.
27

28
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,610
Now if I run the Marvel app I can go to Marvel and I can send it over to my workout app.
28

29
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,130
OK.
29

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,980
So now that's uploaded, let's go and check out our design and Marvel.
30

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,250
OK.
31

32
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:08,330
So these were some of the ones from previously and we can actually select all of them to get rid of
32

33
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,130
them because we have our own mockups now
33

34
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:12,710
right?
34

35
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,500
Let's get rid of all of those images. Now that all we're left with is our app mockup.
35

36
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,880
So let's add some links to them.
36

37
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,660
All right.
37

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,180
So that didn't take too long
38

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,580
and now I've created some of the basic links in order for my app to work as a prototype.
39

40
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,290
So let's go ahead and click done and let's play our prototype.
40

41
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,520
Okay. So first thing we see is our welcome screen. So I'm going to login, takes me to the home screen.
41

42
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,410
I'm going to hit start and that takes me to the workout session.
42

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,570
Okay. So I forgot to add this part to the workout session so let's just go back and edit that.
43

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,160
Get to refresh this sort to take into account any changes. hit end sessions go back to home screen
44

45
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,550
and then I can go to the workout screen.
45

46
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,540
I'm going to select my workouts, hit done, go to the workouts and then we can go back home screen again
46

47
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,250
have a look at the calendar view have a look at the graph you toggle between the two.
47

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,920
And that's how simple it is to create a prototype using your designs from Sketch.
48

49
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,200
Now if you didn't create your mockups in Sketch, if you did it within Canva or within Photoshop or within
49

50
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,180
any other program, you can also add the images to Marvel and link them up.
50

51
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,340
Another thing that Marvel actually lets you do is to design the screens from scratch.
51

52
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,940
So if you just hit the design button you actually go into their static image design screen. On here you
52

53
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,270
can for example search their database of images, you can drag these onto the screen and arrange them as
53

54
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,560
you see fit.
54

55
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:30,960
And then we can add some buttons for example as this as a button and then add text or something like
55

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:41,030
login and then we can move that text onto the button and then you can change its color.
56

57
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,750
So let's make that white. And we can make it a little bit bigger and arrange all of that and then just
57

58
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,080
copy and make another one of these.
58

59
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,800
And you've just created another welcome screen and then you can click to add this to project and you
59

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,670
can link it up with the rest of your prototype over here.
60

61
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,360
Now this is another easy way to design your mockup
61

62
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,010
if you don't want to use Sketch or some of the other design softwares that we spoke about.
62

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,700
So this is super simple.
63

64
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,950
You have access to a bunch of shapes, text, images as well as your own custom images.
64

65
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,720
And basically you can do some simple layouts and you can link each of the screens together to produce
65

66
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,590
a prototype.
