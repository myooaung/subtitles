00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.510
Currently there's actually quite a few services that allow you to create these landing pages really
1

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.310
really quickly.
2

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.730
An example is a company like kickofflabs which is the company that Great little Place used to create their
3

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.860
landing page.
4

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.620
And another popular one is unbounce that has a 30 day free trial.
5

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.830
And finally there's another one called Leadpages.
6

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.060
Now depending on your need and your budget, some of these may be more appropriate than others.
7

8
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.400
For example I think Leadpages is actually slightly cheaper than unbounce even though they have a 30
8

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.330
day trial period.
9

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.660
But afterwards, it gets a little bit more pricey.
10

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.290
Now all of these services have a pretty much drag and drop interface which allows you to drag in sections
11

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.290
drag in  text, images and essentially design in a what you see is what you get kind of way.
12

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.630
So it's super simple and they have all of these templates that are already set up for you. So if you don't
13

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.940
want to design or change anything you can just put new images, put in new text and you know within
14

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.020
less than an hour, you've got a landing page that's ready set up.
15

16
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.180
So have a look at those services and I would say that this is pretty much the quickest way to build
16

17
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.280
a landing page.
17

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.780
But if you are somebody who likes to tinker a little bit more or you have a bit more experience with
18

19
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.530
the more technical side of things, then there's also other options.
19

20
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.250
I would say in increasing difficulty from left to right you've got Squarespace which is again a drag
20

21
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.240
and drop interface that allows you to create websites and host them with Squarespace.
21

22
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.220
I would say that probably the easiest to do.
22

23
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.880
They also have a bunch of templates and a bunch of widgets that you can use. The next step is Wordpress
23

24
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.650
and WordPress has been pretty much king of self-publishing or self web design for the longest time.
24

25
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.120
And there's a reason because they have a whole host of plugins that allow you to extend the capabilities
25

26
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.930
of your website to include you know email collection boxes and there's so many people creating beautiful
26

27
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.160
templates for wordpress.
27

28
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.590
You really won't go amiss with using something like that and it gives you just a little bit more flexibility
28

29
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.620
just a little bit more control than Squarespace
29

30
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.990
I would say. And it's probably a bit cheaper as well but it does take a little bit more time investment
30

31
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.020
in terms of getting it up and running.
31

32
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.490
And finally if you really like to play with code and you get things set up, then what we tend to do is
32

33
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.250
use something like a Bootstrap framework which I'll probably go into a little bit more detail in the
33

34
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.230
module where we teach you how to create your product page and it is again super simple.
34

35
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.630
It really is just taking a design template that somebody else made and editing the appropriate parts
35

36
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.980
and changing the images and not even editing all that much code.
36

37
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.800
So in terms of difficulty obviously using something like Leadpages or Unbounce is probably the easiest.
37

38
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.600
And then if you want to invest a little bit more time into it or if you want to reduce costs then you
38

39
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.360
can explore some of these other options I've explain.
39

40
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.180
But I would say that none of these really require a lot of investment of time to learn.
40

41
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.220
They're not so difficult.
41

42
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.080
They're all visual editors and you don't need to be a coder to do any of this but it just depends on your
42

43
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.530
level of interest in interacting with technology.
43

44
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.730
If you really don't want to then go with one of these people and pay them for convenience.
44

45
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.380
But if you want to do it yourself, DIY it, then goes something like Wordpress.
45

46
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.710
It's probably that one of the cheapest ways of doing something like this.
