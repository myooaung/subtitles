00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:00.900
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.740
So that was pretty simple, right.
2

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.100
And that's all thanks to ARKit.
3

4
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.610
So let's use it to create something else. Instead of using a cube,
4

5
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.800
let's create a sphere this time. So we'll call it sphere. And instead of using SCNBox, there's something
5

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.210
called SCNSphere.
6

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.260
And all we have to do is give it a radius and let's say maybe 20 centimeters in radius.
7

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.730
So that's about 40 centimeters in diameter.
8

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.920
I think my room can handle that. And instead of adding the material to the cube, we'll add it to the sphere
9

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.530
this time. And also change the geometry that's associated with the node to our new sphere.
10

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.880
But this time, I want to make it a little bit fancier. Instead of just having the UIColor red which is
11

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.750
nice enough if we're making a dice,
12

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.210
but let's go crazy,
13

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.950
let's put the moon into our living room.
14

15
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.120
So even though it sounds pretty crazy, it's actually really easy to do.
15

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.430
All we need is just a Texture map. And there's a website called solarsystemscope.com.
16

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.690
And if you go into Textures, you'll see that they have loads of high-resolution images of a whole bunch
17

18
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.380
of planets, Earth, or sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, and fictional. And you can download them for free.
18

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.020
So in our case, we wanted the moon. And why go for high resolution, if you can go for extreme resolution?
19

20
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.440
Well, obviously, if you're deploying the app into the App Store, you might want to make some considerations.
20

21
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.490
But right now, I just want an extreme resolution moon in my living room.
21

22
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
So I'm going to download this 8K file.
22

23
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.890
All right.
23

24
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.300
So once you've got it downloaded, you can actually see that this is just a flat map.
24

25
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.240
It almost looks a bit like, you know, a world map
25

26
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.770
if you had a picture of the earth. It's just the representation of a sphere laid down flat.
26

27
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.970
And this is what we're going to use to essentially wrap around our sphere and make it look like as if
27

28
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.580
we have a moon in our 3D space.
28

29
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.840
So find that moon image that you downloaded.
29

30
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.230
So I think it's called moon.jpg. And you're going to drag it into your art.scnassets folder.
30

31
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.700
So just click and drag and there we go.
31

32
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.700
It's incorporated.
32

33
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.480
And then, instead of using UIColor, I'm going to show you how easy it is to add a Texture map to are
33

34
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.530
3D object.
34

35
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.740
So in this case, instead of having on diffuse property being a UIColor, I'm going to just use UIImage
35

36
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.030
named. And remember that because it's resting inside the art.scnassets folder,
36

37
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.730
it's actually not at the same hierarchy as our ViewController.
37

38
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.780
So we're going to have to navigate into it, just like the way that they did here with the ship.
38

39
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.600
So, in fact, I'm just going to copy that and paste that in. And instead of ship.scn, I'm going to
39

40
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.090
change it to moon.jpg.
40

41
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.400
So, now we are draping this moon.jpg Texture map onto our sphere, and we're going to place it at
41

42
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.860
the same position as before with our box, and then we're going to make it appear on our sceneView.
42

43
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.150
So let's give it a go.
43

44
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.080
And there you have it,
44

45
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.060
the moon in your living room.
45

46
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.880
So I hope you enjoyed that, creating boxes, creating spheres, giving them Texture maps, giving them colors.
46

47
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.000
Now in the next lesson, we're going to be getting on with our real task which is creating our 3D dice.
47

48
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.460
And I'm going to show you how you can import other people's 3D models, so that you can easily use them in
48

49
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.390
your project.
49

50
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.110
So I'll see you there.
