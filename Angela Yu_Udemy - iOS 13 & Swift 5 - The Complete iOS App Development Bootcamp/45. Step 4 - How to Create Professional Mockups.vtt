00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.140
So now that we've created our wireframes and we've had a look at what it might look like on our phone
1

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.930
using Pop, the next stage is creating what are called mockups.
2

3
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.910
Now depending on which designer you talk to, a mockup might mean different things to them. But I'm going
3

4
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.270
to use the word mockup in the design sense. And it's essentially a high fidelity representation of your
4

5
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.230
design.
5

6
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.410
It's almost like as if you went into this app of the future and you took some screenshots from it.
6

7
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.150
It should look photo realistic and pretty much just like the real thing.
7

8
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.840
Some mock up show the screens next to each other and others show the mockup placed inside a phone and
8

9
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.160
in some sort of use situation.
9

10
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.320
So then the question is how do you go about creating mockups and what are the tools that you should
10

11
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.180
use?
11

12
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.450
So my tools of choice are Photoshop and Illustrator combined.
12

13
00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.110
For me, they represent the most comprehensive set of tools. You can literally do any kind of design work
13

14
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.460
once you've got these two tools in your tool belt.
14

15
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.570
Now the problem with these tools is that they have a really steep learning curve.
15

16
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.490
They have a lot of buttons and they have a lot of complex features.
16

17
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.660
Layers, marks, pen tool.
17

18
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.350
They all take quite a long time to learn and get used to.
18

19
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.630
Now I started out with Photoshop over probably 10 years ago and I picked up Illustrator soon after.
19

20
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.990
So it's taken me you know over 10 years to hone the skills.
20

21
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.750
And I think for somebody who is starting out in digital design today I really think that there are better
21

22
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.380
tools that you can learn much faster that will be able to do 95% of what you can do with Photoshop
22

23
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.440
and Illustrator.
23

24
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.610
The other problem with these two softwares is that they're from Adobe and they are currently sold as a package
24

25
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.900
through the Adobe Creative Cloud.
25

26
00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.180
Now anybody who's signed up to the Adobe Creative Cloud will know what a pain it is to try and get yourself
26

27
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.810
out of it.
27

28
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.720
So when you have a company license that's all well and good.
28

29
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.700
But if you need it for personal use it's still something like £60 a month if you pay monthly
29

30
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.120
and I think £40 a month if you pay for a one year subscription.
30

31
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.980
So it's horrendously expensive basically.
31

32
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.220
Now the tool that I'm going to recommend to you and I'm going to teach you a bit more about is actually
32

33
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.920
something else.
33

34
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.250
It could Sketch. And sketch is a really great Mac app that only costs $99 on the App Store and it can
34

35
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.760
pretty much do most of what Illustrator and Photoshop can do.
35

36
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.530
And especially when you're talking about user interface design, it can actually do something slightly
36

37
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.080
better than Photoshop and Illustrator. And a really nice thing about Sketch is that it allows you to
37

38
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.460
create a vector object.
38

39
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.600
So essentially the images that scale to any size because they're vector rather than raster.
39

40
00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.190
So in Photoshop, you're only working with raster objects or smart objects and it's only an illustrator
40

41
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:08.500
can you create these vectors for say your icon design, your app icon or your tablet icons etc. and
41

42
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.650
Sketch can do all of that and it has really good integration with other tools for prototyping that we're
42

43
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.660
going to talk about in the next module.
43

44
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.930
So Sketch is great. You can get a free trial of it for 30 days I think for free.
44

45
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.300
So give it a whirl and if you like it you know the $99 upfront cost is you know nothing compared to
45

46
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.830
Photoshop and Illustrator.
46

47
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.920
So I'll show you a bit more about that a little bit later on.
47

48
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.980
Now the final thing I'm going to mention is something called Marvel. And Marvel is a browser based app
48

49
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.800
that you can use to create mockups and prototypes as well.
49

50
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.550
Now it has a pretty simple interface and you can drag on various shapes or images or text and it's basically
50

51
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.890
and it's basically even easier
51

52
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.860
I would say in terms of the learning curve to use it. And in most cases you don't really need the complex
52

53
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.040
tools that you have in Photoshop and Illustrator. And in most cases if you're just making mockups or
53

54
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.310
websites or for apps, then Marvel can actually do just as well and we'll show you how to use that as
54

55
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.800
well.
55

56
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.290
And a final tool that I wanted to mention is something called UXPin.
56

57
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.120
Now I used to recommend them because I liked the way that you can drag on various UI components. So they
57

58
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.610
have these libraries of UI components like buttons or calendars and you basically just drag and drop
58

59
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.610
them onto the canvas as a quick and pretty pain free way of making mockups.
59

60
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:40.240
But lately, I think their monetization model is a bit off and they don't really have a very generous tier
60

61
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.350
for beginners. So you can't really try it out properly before you have to pay for their pay tier.
61

62
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.130
And their pay tier is on a monthly basis and you'll find that overall it will probably work out cheaper to
62

63
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.280
just get sketch and learn how to use it and you'll be able to do a lot more with it than you can with
63

64
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.380
some of these web tools.
64

65
00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.700
All right.
65

66
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.730
So we've spent enough time talking about the wonders of Sketch, it's time to introduce you to Sketch
66

67
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.250
3.
