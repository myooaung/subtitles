00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:07.230
So, I just wanted to point you guys towards a few resources that I find really helpful when I'm doing
1

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.880
quick app releases.
2

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.770
And one of these things is called MockuPhone or MockuPhone.
3

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.010
I'm not quite sure how to pronounce it. But either way, it's a really cool website where you can insert
4

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.790
your screenshots into device mockups, so that you can put a frame of a device around your screenshots,
5

6
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.300
and you can upload that to make it look a little bit nicer, a little bit more pro.
6

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.470
So they have device frames for pretty much all the iOS devices
7

8
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.390
and it's a really useful tool when you're building a screenshots.
8

9
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.510
Now, the thing that you might think about at this stage, although, you should probably thought about this
9

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
slightly earlier is your app icons. In all the projects that we've been building,
10

11
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.690
you've been using app icons that we provided.
11

12
00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.170
Now, in order to release your own apps, you'll need your own app icons. And one of the easiest ways to resize
12

13
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.930
those app icons for all the required sizes is using something called makeappicon.com.
13

14
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.340
So don't worry, all the links to the URLs are in the text box below this video.
14

15
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.830
But essentially, all you need to do is just throw an image in here.
15

16
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.880
And it goes in like toast.
16

17
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.450
So you just chuck it in and it goes in like so, and it starts baking
17

18
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.250
your app icon templates, and it creates all the different sizes that you need,
18

19
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.180
and you can just drag and drop them into your Xcode project.
19

20
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.270
So remember, your Xcode project in order for it to successfully be analyzed,
20

21
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.900
you need to provide app icons for all the required sizes.
21

22
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.400
And this bundle includes all of that.
22

23
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.470
So it's really, really useful and it's free,
23

24
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.750
so check it out.
24

25
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.220
And the last thing that I want to show you is something called Appsite and it's a really easy way of
25

26
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.970
creating a showcase page for your app.
26

27
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.160
And it's pretty self-explanatory and it makes it so much easier to build that showcase page.
27

28
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.770
All right.
28

29
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.300
So I hope that's given you a little bit more of an insight in how you can upload your apps and how
29

30
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.010
you can start getting your apps onto the app store and start making some money.
30

31
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.500
So if you guys have any other questions or want to ask about anything on this topic, you know what to
31

32
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.130
do.
32

33
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.970
Hit the comment section below this video and ask away.
33

34
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.870
So in the next module and our last module together, we are going to talk about where to go from here.
34

35
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.310
So we've built so many apps together,
35

36
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.500
what is the next step you in your journey of becoming a pro iOS developer.
36

37
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.480
So I'll see you there.
