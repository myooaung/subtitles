Now why is any of this interesting?
1

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,040
Why do we care about these families and subfamilies?
2

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,480
Well some of it is to do with styling and making it look good.
3

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,180
You know, for example, if you're creating something that is meant to be conservative, you don't want to
4

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,050
use something like a modern typeface.
5

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,860
So having that knowledge is important but more importantly it's about readability.
6

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,950
So there was a study conducted by MIT a few years back where they looked at the difference between a
7

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:38,050
car dashboard that was created in a Grotesque typeface versus a car dashboard that had a Humanist typeface.
8

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,530
And then they looked at how long the drivers needed to look at that dashboard at any given time. And
9

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,650
they found an 11% reduction in the amount of time that the drive is needed to look down at that
10

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,050
dashboard in order to gauge the information they needed
11

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,060
when they used a Humanist instead of a Grotesque.
12

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:04,350
And when those times are converted into distance say on a standard motorway or highway and it was actually
13

14
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,380
equivalent to about 40 feet in difference.
14

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,480
So if you think about the driver who needs to look down at that dashboard while they were traveling
15

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,780
40 feet longer than the driver who had a Humanist dashboard, then that could actually be the difference
16

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,960
between life and death of a pedestrian.
17

18
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,310
So even though we think that you know design is very much about form, at heart, it's actually all about
18

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,160
function and designs with only form and no function will never ever work well.
19

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,760
So always keep that in mind.
20

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,770
Now in this study, they tested the difference between a Grotesque typeface which you can see up here
21

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,710
versus a Humanist typeface down here. And we're going to talk about some of the things that make a particular
22

23
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,030
typeface more readable than the other.
23

24
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:52,170
So first you can see that the Humanist typeface has more open shapes. So if you look at the 'C' the size
24

25
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,370
of the opening is slightly larger than the 'C' in the Grotesque typeface.
25

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,250
Also if you look at the inter-character spacing in the Grotesque typeface there's less distance between
26

27
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,560
each of the letters than the Humanist typeface
27

28
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,070
also making it slightly harder to read. And then we look at how ambiguous the letters are from each other.
28

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,120
So the 'g' and the nine in the Grotesque look pretty similar.
29

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,600
They're all very square.
30

31
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,410
Whereas in the Humanist font you can clearly differentiate the 'g' and the nine
31

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,830
so there's less confusion in the brain and hence leading to increased readability.
32

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,590
And finally when you're selecting a readable typeface, you want to look for varying proportions, so certain
33

34
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,360
letters having large width, certain letters having a narrow width. These are a few things that determine
34

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,720
readability and determine when we should pick each typeface.
