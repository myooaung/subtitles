00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,850
Okay. So let's talk about the black hat techniques.
1

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,670
So as with anything be an algorithm or search engine, if it has rules then it can be gamed.
2

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,990
And this is what's happening on both the Google Play store as well as the iOS App Store.
3

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,120
There are a whole bunch of companies in China that does something called 刷榜 (shuabang). And what they do is
4

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,490
that they have 150 to 200 employees each manning a rack that looks like this with maybe 100 iPhones
5

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,320
that each have an iTunes account.
6

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,380
So, in China in order to sign up for iTunes account you don't need a credit card.
7

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,760
So these companies have generated loads and loads of iTunes accounts. And what they do is that once you
8

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,780
pay for a boosted ranking of your app they go and download your app on every single one of these iTunes
9

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,380
accounts.
10

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,720
Then they uninstall it.
11

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,930
So effectively what you get is maybe 10,000 or 20,000 downloads of your app in a day propelling it up
12

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,520
the category rankings.
13

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,440
Now what they can also do is to leave five star reviews. So if you have come across a five star review
14

15
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,910
that looks like it was jibberish, then it was probably done by one of these companies. And the tactics
15

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,560
for Android is even crazier.
16

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,950
So they can install widgets like you thought that you were downloading a widget for the weather app.
17

18
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,040
Well actually what it does is that while you're asleep at night your phone is installing and uninstalling
18

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,830
loads and loads of apps in order to boost those apps in the app rankings.
19

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,370
And it's well-known that there's a lot of phones that have and it's well-known that you can get a lot
20

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,050
of security vulnerabilities on Android phones.
21

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,520
So you can have rats installed,
22

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,580
you can have things that basically take over your device and do things that help the guy who made it
23

24
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,500
make money by propelling people's apps to the top of the app stores.
24

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,910
Now this can suck if you are that guy who a) gets your phone hijacked by some company that's downloading
25

26
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,210
all of these random apps which then gets uninstalled before you notice anything.
26

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,420
But also it sucks for those people who are genuinely trying to put a good app onto the app store when
27

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,420
you're trying to compete with these types of practices.
28

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,510
So I mean one of the things is that this is actually not cheap.
29

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,700
So for example this is a screen cap that somebody took from a company that offered this type of service.
30

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,960
So to translate if you want to get a top 10 in the games category then you're going to have to pay about
31

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,370
seven grand upfront for getting into the charts.
32

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,540
And then every week you're going to have to pay about 30 grand in order to stay in the top 10.
33

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,320
But once you get there in the charts then you're guaranteed to get tens of thousands of downloads
34

35
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,240
per day. And if you can monetize those users well then you will make more profits than how much you paid
35

36
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,110
to the guys who did this.
36

37
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,130
But the thing about this is that a lot of the practices are illegal especially for the Android platform.
37

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,680
And in order to sustain in the top 10 if you don't actually have a good product, you will have to keep
38

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,190
paying that money in order to get these artificial downloads.
39

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,720
And remember those artificial downloads don't generate you any revenue.
40

41
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,650
These guys who are working on getting your app download and getting it reviewed are not going to pay
41

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,520
you for your in-app purchases.
42

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,190
And in fact if they have to pay to install that app you're going to have to foot the bill for that.
43

44
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,550
So if your operative needs to pay $1.99 for your app, then you're going to have to subsidize that one
44

45
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,500
nine nine.
45

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,920
But remember that Apple and Google both take a 30 percent cut of whatever it is that you earn on the
46

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,600
app stores.
47

48
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,830
Both app stores are kind of turning a blind eye onto this practice because they're actually earning
48

49
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,450
a whole load of money out of it.
49

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,270
Now one of the things that's really rampant outside of China is review gaming.
50

51
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:36,330
So basically anybody with a Google account can review your Android app and anybody with an iTunes account
51

52
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,360
can review your iOS app.
52

53
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,390
And if you search on a jobs board like fiverr.com you'll see a lot of people who will give you X
53

54
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,440
number of views for $5.
54

55
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,550
And my advice is to stay well away from it because while I say that Apple and Google are turning a blind
55

56
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,730
eye to this I have seen cases where apps get pulled because the app developers trying to manipulate
56

57
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,660
the app stores by review gaming or by downloads gaming.
57

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,650
And if you do get picked up by either of these platform it can end up in a lifetime ban.
58

59
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,770
So my advice is just stick with the white hat techniques.
59

60
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,380
There's plenty to choose from
60

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,230
and they really do work.
61

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,210
And if you want long term sustainable organic downloads then white hat is the way to go.
