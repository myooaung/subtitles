Hey, guys. It's Angela here and I've got a brilliant module coming up for you.
1

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,380
So in this module, we're gonna be building an app called FlashChat which is going to be a messaging
2

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,890
app. And in the process of building this app, we're going to learn about a lot of really awesome and advanced
3

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,640
features of iOS Swift,
4

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,320
as well as something called Firebase.
5

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,240
So this is what we're going to be making.
6

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,390
It's a chat application that has authentication built-in.
7

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,680
So you're able to register and log in users.
8

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,600
So let me go ahead and log in with this account over here.
9

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,540
And on this phone, I'm gonna log in with a different account.
10

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:49,710
So, now I've got two accounts running the same app and I'm able to write a message, for example, over here,
11

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,050
"Hello,
12

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,490
IPhone 8."
13

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,740
And hit send.
14

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,320
And you'll see it pop up over here from you.
15

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,390
So if I go over here and I type a message, say, 
16

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,260
"Hello, IPhone 11," and click send, then that will populate over on this app.
17

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,920
So this is a pretty fully fledged messaging app with animations, with custom UI, with a whole bunch of
18

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,120
things built-in.
19

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,600
And even though it looks simple, we're gonna be learning so much stuff to be able to make this.
20

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,870
For example, we're gonna be learning about the iOS navigation controller, so how to go back and forth between
21

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,730
different screens.
22

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,190
We're gonna be learning to use Swift loops to create that animation that you saw in the beginning of
23

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,230
the app.
24

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,320
We're also gonna be learning about package managers and using something called CocoaPods and the Swift
25

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,870
Package Manager to be able to incorporate third-party libraries into our app.
26

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,460
And one of those third party libraries is something called Firebase which is a service provided by Google
27

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,840
that we're gonna be using for free
28

29
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,600
to be able to authenticate all users as well as store the message data on a cloud-based database.
29

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,730
In addition, we're going to be learning how to use iOS table views which is pretty much the bread and
30

31
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,340
butter of a lot of iOS development.
31

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,460
And we're also going to be creating custom UI, such as those cells that you saw earlier on using something
32

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,910
called a ZIP file.
33

34
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,590
So we've got a lot of stuff coming up for you.
34

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,090
And once you're ready, go ahead and head over to the next lesson. Clone the starting project and let's
35

36
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,810
get started.
