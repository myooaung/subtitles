All right. So welcome to a brand-new module and I'm going to show you what you'll be making by
1

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,030
the end of this module.
2

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,470
The app that we're going to be building and improving upon throughout this module is a To-Do list app.
3

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,100
And it's inspired by one of my favorite to-do list apps which is the clear app. And what it allows you
4

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,560
to do is to create new to-do lists,
5

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:33,290
for example, your travel to-do list, and it shows up as individual color to-do list. And you can select
6

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,690
one of them to go into that particular list and add new items to it.
7

8
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,770
For example, "Buy Apples," "Buy Pears."
8

9
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:55,040
And you'll see that as you add new items, your to-do list start staking on this beautiful gradient going
9

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,510
from lighter to darker as you add new items.
10

11
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:07,040
Now, you will be able to check these items off, but you'll also be able to swipe to delete them.
11

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
Now, you'll be able to search your to-do list.
12

13
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:18,590
For example, let's search for something like "Apple," hit search, and you see all the to-do list items that
13

14
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,820
contain that word.
14

15
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:29,800
And the best part of all is that all of this data is saved and persisted locally on the simulator or
15

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,780
on your physical iPhone device.
16

17
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:39,890
So that means that if you go ahead and terminate your app, say, if your app got updated or if your iOS
17

18
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:48,860
version got updated, or if you bought a new phone, then all of your user's data is persisted on the device
18

19
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,730
with no internet connection required.
19

20
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,170
And if we have a look inside Shopping List, we still have all of our items.
20

21
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:03,650
So that is what we're going to learn all about in this module. And in the process, you're going to learn
21

22
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:10,610
about all the different ways that you can persist data locally, including user defaults for small bits
22

23
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,630
of data, or things like quotable where if you want to tap into the documents folder inside your iPhone,
23

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,500
and be able to save items there, and you'll also gonna  learn about using Core Data with a sequel like back in
24

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,170
database, and you're going to be creating a relational database of your own to power your to-do list
25

26
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,960
app.
26

27
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,650
And finally, I'm going to show you how you can do everything that you can do with Core Data by using one
27

28
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,350
of my favorite services which is called Realm.
28

29
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,980
And by the end of this, you will have created a relational database as a backend and you're going to
29

30
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,810
learn about how you can code up the front end to make it look as beautiful as we have here.
30

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,010
So I hope you're excited because I'm really excited.
31

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,700
So once you're ready, get started over on the next lesson.
