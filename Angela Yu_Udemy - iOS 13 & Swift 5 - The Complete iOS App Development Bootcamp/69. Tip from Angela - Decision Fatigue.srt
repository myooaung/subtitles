Do you ever find that you reach the end of the day
1

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,720
and it feels like my god
2

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,820
you know I have no more energy or brainpower to do anything else let alone try to study something difficult
3

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,570
like programming.
4

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,070
Now one of the ways that you can really help yourself is either by shifting your study block to the beginning
5

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:32,760
of the day, so maybe wake up an hour earlier. Or the alternative is to try to reduce the amount of decision
6

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,710
making you make in a day.
7

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,810
So for example if you have the same breakfast every day,
8

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,370
if you have many sets of the same piece of clothing then you can reduce the amount of decisions that
9

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,180
you have to make like what should I eat or what should I wear.
10

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,820
And all of these decisions they take a toll on us.
11

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,000
The more that we have to make of these decisions the more that we struggle to do important things like
12

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,470
learning and studying and especially when it comes to learning difficult skills like programming.
13

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,530
So try to have more routine in your day, try to establish habits so you don't always have to keep asking
14

15
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,910
yourself what should I do now,
15

16
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,550
what should I...
16

17
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,450
And make these decisions. That way you'll end up with more energy and more drive to pursue the things
17

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,470
that you really want to.
18

19
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,610
So keep going and you're doing great.
