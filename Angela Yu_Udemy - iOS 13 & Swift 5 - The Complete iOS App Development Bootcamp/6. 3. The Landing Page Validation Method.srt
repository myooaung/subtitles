00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,240
One of the most important ways of validating your idea is by using a landing page.
1

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,060
So nowadays if you see any digital product or even real products being launched you'll see you know
2

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,510
six months in advance or three months in advance
3

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,960
people will create a landing page like so.
4

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,670
So this is the one for a London based app called Great little Place.
5

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,920
This is one for Robinhood which is a zero commission stock brokerage.
6

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,090
And the thing that you notice that's common to all of these is that they have this box that allows you
7

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,050
to put in your email address
8

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,510
and it says "Be notified when we go live."
9

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,180
And the reason why this is really important is that you can demonstrate that there are people who are
10

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,820
actually interested in your product.
11

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,410
This is way before you put down a line of code, way before you even you know put in any investment.
12

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,150
And in fact this is our Aaron Patzer who is the founder of Mint talking about how he validated the idea
13

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:03,630
of mint.com before writing a single line of code or before putting in any work by just seeing how many
14

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,890
people will actually sign up to this page.
15

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,520
And it's so true what he says.
16

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,470
A lot of people are obsessed with this idea of getting the product out there just make a prototype really
17

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,410
really fast and try and you know be first to market.
18

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,890
But actually there's no point doing it until you know that there's people who are interested in your
19

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,850
product.
20

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,890
Additionally you'll have a bunch of people who are ready to download your product, who can receive an
21

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,560
email telling them that your product is ready and they will be the most likely people to download your
22

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,330
app or buy your product.
23

24
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,100
Now there's a number of ways of doing this type of idea of validation.
24

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,440
And there's companies out there which specialize in this
25

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,710
for example QuickMVP which allows you to essentially set up your landing page and start driving
26

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,320
traffic to it
27

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,020
and looking at conversions etc. But I'm going to tell you about a cheaper way of doing it and a lot
28

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,110
more flexible.
29

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,100
So the idea is that you have a landing page that you've set up that's super simple basically just you
30

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,650
know a heading with a little bit of branding telling people what it is that your product does how it's
31

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,760
going to help them.
32

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,040
And the most important thing is this box here, just a place where they can put down their email address
33

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,940
to be notified once it is ready so that you can collect a large list of interested people and you can
34

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,970
hit them up on the day of launch.
35

36
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,400
Now in order to drive traffic towards this landing page you're going to use either Facebook ads or Google
36

37
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,100
adwords.
37

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,230
So people would see your ads in their feed
38

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,850
and again it would be you know something catchy that drives them towards this page makes them want to
39

40
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,370
click on a button like check it out now or by now or sign up now etc..
40

41
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,740
So in Facebook ads you can set up what that button reads and depending on what it reads it will change
41

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,670
your conversion rate.
42

43
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,430
For example buying now will have a lower conversion rate i.e. less people clicking on it than
43

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,090
something like
44

45
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,990
Find out more.
45

46
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,350
But it does also mean that the people who click on buy now are telling you an intention that they will
46

47
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,800
buy it right?
47

48
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,810
So these are a lot of things to experiment about and to implement it iteratively so that you can see
48

49
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,440
what works what doesn't and improve on it day by day.
49

50
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,150
So with Facebook ads you get a whole load of metrics.
50

51
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,020
You get to see how many engagements there are i.e. how many people clicked on it and how many people
51

52
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,510
interact with it and sometimes in Facebook I mean post engagement can mean just that when people were
52

53
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,740
swapping on the phone they paused for a little while on your ad that counts as an engagement.
53

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,800
So if you ever wonder you know why it is that you see more of certain friends post on Facebook it's
54

55
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,950
because Facebook has algorithms that detect what you're interested in.
55

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,400
So you know for these wedding photos, for baby photos, they get a lot of likes
56

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,550
immediately as soon as the person posts it and that's flagging to Facebook that this is really interesting
57

58
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,270
content.
58

59
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,490
And also you know when you're scrolling through Facebook and you see a post from your ex or you know
59

60
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,010
from your crush and you pause on it, that pause also signifies to Facebook that you're interested in
60

61
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,570
this person's content.
61

62
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,820
So that's what post engagement can mean. People who paused on your ad or people who clicked on it or
62

63
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,400
people who liked it or commented etc. And depending on how you set up your Facebook ad you can gear
63

64
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,920
it towards different things.
64

65
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,780
So what we tend to say is that for the sole purpose of idea validation what you want to do is set up
65

66
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:36,000
automatic bidding so that Facebook automatically calculates how much you should bid for this ad placement
66

67
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,130
because there's loads of people who are looking to take up that ad space and they look at the bids of
67

68
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,560
the various adverts and the one that's highest gets the spot essentially.
68

69
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,630
Now the other thing that Facebook tells you about is reach which is you know when you're scrolling through
69

70
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,270
the desktop version you'll see the ads popping up in the right
70

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,750
and when you're scrolling on mobile they'll just flash through in the main timeline. So reach is how
71

72
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,120
many people potentially saw your ads.
72

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,910
So now you have a metric between reach and post engagements or click through.
73

74
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,540
So if you calculate that as a percentage,
74

75
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,920
so for example 3000 divided by 80000 that's about three or four percent engagement out of all the people
75

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,790
who saw your ad for in a hundred people actually interacted with it.
76

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,270
So by looking at some of these metrics you can already start to interpret how much interest is there
77

78
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,050
in what it is that you're trying to sell or create.
78

79
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:39,460
So for example, if you create your ad in a really simple way with an engaging image and with a few sentences
79

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,860
that describes what it does or what problems it solves for the user
80

81
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,880
and you see just how interested like if a thousand people saw this ad how many people would actually
81

82
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,470
click on it.
82

83
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,320
As with any sort of ads you do have to iterate through it.
83

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,330
So don't just create one ad like this, but create you know 10 or 20 and see which one performs better
84

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,430
because depending on the images that you use depending on your wording, people will have different rates
85

86
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,030
of engagement.
86

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,460
So try and optimize that
87

88
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,590
and then look at your best performing ad how many people are clicking on it after they've seen it.
88

89
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,160
And that's a good indicator generally of interest in your product.
89

90
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,380
Now you don't have to just stick with Facebook.
90

91
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,280
The other option is using Google Adwords and this is basically the part that appears in the sponsors
91

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,060
sections which is usually at the top currently in Google. And you can target particular search terms.
92

93
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,880
So for example this person's search for Bangkok hotel reservation and you can make sure that your particular
93

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,370
website shows up first for those search terms.
94

95
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,870
Now it works in a similar way to Facebook ads. You create your landing page that has the all important
95

96
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,450
email collection box and then you drive traffic towards it through these Google sponsored link.
96

97
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,760
So target those search terms like you think your user might be looking to solve.
97

98
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,080
Really think about those search terms.
98

99
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,470
For example if you're creating an exercise app or an exercise regime, people might not necessarily search
99

100
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,120
exercise regime or exercise routine.
100

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,690
They're probably more likely to search for the outcome which is weight loss or body building.
101

102
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,970
So essentially you know gear your key words towards the positive benefits that people get rather than what
102

103
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:22,030
it actually does. With a really minimal budget like a $100 you can get some really interesting data.
103

104
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,180
Essentially what you want to look at is this kind of funnel.
104

105
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,160
So you look at the number of impressions, so say 100 people saw your ad
105

106
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,070
how many people actually clicked on that ad and then you got maybe one sign up out of it and that's
106

107
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,770
about a 1 percent conversion which is okay.
107

108
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,700
But on the other hand if you had data that looked more like this where out of 100 people who saw your
108

109
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,850
ads maybe 10 people clicked on it and then you have 9 sign ups, that becomes really interesting because
109

110
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:56,810
that means that there's a lot of people who are incensed to take action.
110

111
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,300
And this is a more favorable funnel than the previous one.
111

112
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:06,940
So I would say that between the tier 1 impressions converting into clicks is interest in your ads.
112

113
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:13,570
So a lot of this depends on how well you word your ads, how-- what kind of images you're using et cetera
113

114
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,550
so that you grab attention. And it's really this step where you turn those clicks onto your website
114

115
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,650
into sign ups that really demonstrates how much interest people actually has in your product.
115

116
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,650
So if you're looking at this step, you know this is a 10% conversion from 10 clicks into 1 sign
116

117
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,780
up which means you know if there were 100 clicks and there would be 10 lineups compared to something
117

118
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,150
like this where there was 90% conversion from the people who visited your landing page into sign
118

119
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:49,120
ups which demonstrate just a higher level of interest in your product rather than in your advert.
119

120
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,420
So essentially what we would recommend is put on Adwords campaign or put on a Facebook ad depending
120

121
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,300
on your niche.
121

122
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,990
So with Facebook ads you have a real ability to really target your users.
122

123
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:09,490
So depending on what your product is say if you are targeting single women or single men or people who
123

124
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,890
were recently engaged. So say if you're a wedding photographer and you're selling your services on Facebook,
124

125
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,080
you can actually target the people who've recently changed their relationship status from single to
125

126
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,840
engaged. And by showing the ads only to those people you can guarantee a much higher conversion rate.
126

127
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,340
So whereas on Google it's more about their search terms,
127

128
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,290
what are people looking for that you can help them with.
128

129
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,280
So it's a slightly different set up and depending on what it is that you do one will probably be a better
129

130
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,760
use case than the other.
130

131
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:48,610
So usually what we say is set a max budget of say $20 a day and use automatic bidding, maximizing click
131

132
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,090
through.
132

133
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:55,060
So this is what you want. You want to channel people from Facebook or from Google onto your landing page
133

134
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,590
so that they can read what your product is about and then demonstrate whether they're interested or
134

135
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:06,890
not. So usually you know if you start with a maximum bid per click of about 50 cents and then you can
135

136
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:14,360
raise that bid by 25 cents every two hours or so if you're not seeing much activity until the point
136

137
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,690
where you start seeing click through.
137

138
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:23,000
And then at that point to stop and observe to see whether if those clicks are turning into conversions
138

139
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,840
i.e. whether people are giving you their email.
139

140
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:32,150
So this is actually a really cheap way of testing and validating your concept. In the next module we're
140

141
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,590
going to talk about how you can create these landing pages very very quickly pretty much under
141

142
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,640
an hour and then you spend another hour setting up your ads.
142

143
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,080
And that's two hours plus maybe $100 and you would have saved yourself hundreds hundred thousands of
143

144
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,390
pounds of investment in something that may or may not work.
144

145
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,900
I mean obviously if you validate your idea it doesn't mean that you're going to be the next unicorn or
145

146
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,670
you're not you're going to be the next Facebook.
146

147
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,490
But it does mean that you have a significantly higher chance of success if the data shows that there's
147

148
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,980
a lot of people who are interested.
148

149
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:09,950
So in order to reduce risk in your startup or in your business, always go with data rather than go with
149

150
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,610
hunches.
150

151
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,910
So another variation on this type of idea of validation is slightly more aggressive and it essentially
151

152
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:22,340
relies on this fact that you know even if people put down their email, that doesn't mean that necessarily
152

153
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,560
you know come launch day that they will actually buy it or that they will actually download it.
153

154
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,510
And in order to have a higher percentage accuracy in your in the validation of your idea you need to
154

155
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,850
somehow see if people are willing to pay for it.
155

156
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,280
There's no point building a product and then later on finding out that people are interested in using
156

157
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,890
it but they're not interested in buying anything from you
157

158
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,170
because in order to sustain yourself you need patrons.
158

159
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,800
So essentially this takes that email box where people demonstrate interest just one step further and
159

160
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,350
see if they're willing to say you know shut up and take my money.
160

161
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,810
So the key difference is in your landing page. Essentially you still have the same cell where you say
161

162
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,230
"My product is so awesome,
162

163
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,920
It does this. It helps you with that." Whatever it is that you believe that your product can solve or can
163

164
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,940
help people.
164

165
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,610
And then importantly at the end instead of having an email sign up box you actually have a "Buy now!" asking
165

166
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,760
people to commit straight away.
166

167
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,830
Now you know and I know that your product doesn't exist and that's fine.
167

168
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,260
It's just about getting a confirmation from the user that they actually would pay money for this.
168

169
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,960
You know, you're not worried about pricing right now you're not putting you know putting down something
169

170
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,360
like buy now for $5 or buy now for $10.
170

171
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,160
It doesn't matter.
171

172
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,780
It's just about asking the user whether if they would pay for this product.
172

173
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,860
Now the problem that you'll see is that what happens when they click buy now when you don't have anything.
173

174
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,930
Well usually what people do is say that you know it's out-of-stock if it's a physical product or that
174

175
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:58,000
if it's a digital product you have like a limited release or a rolling release of beaters
175

176
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,830
and they can sign up when the next batch is available essentially.
176

177
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,400
So yeah. It's a little bit disappointing for that user who would want to buy it but at the same time
177

178
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,380
it means that you can demonstrate that there are people who are willing to pay for this product then
178

179
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,870
you will actually go and create it for them and then this is the part where you put in that email box
179

180
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,150
so that they can be notified when it's available.
180

181
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,110
And the funny thing about humans is that we really like to be consistent, internally consistent.
181

182
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,450
Now this is probably not going to be the first time that I'm going to mention that. Knowing a little
182

183
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,910
bit of human psychology knowing a little bit about you know the cognitive side of how we work, is really
183

184
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,490
useful for understanding human behavior.
184

185
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,640
So one of the things that you'll notice is that humans really like to be consistent. And that means that
185

186
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,240
if they clicked on a button that said "Buy now" their brain is saying "Oh I really wanted this thing because
186

187
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,860
I was willing to pay money for it." And that means that when you next confront them with an email sign
187

188
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,950
up box because it's not yet available
188

189
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,130
you have a much higher chance that they'll actually put down the email and want to be notified when
189

190
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,980
it is available.
190

191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,520
And indeed sometimes you can get people who are really upset and angry that it's not immediately available
191

192
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,300
right there.
192

193
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:18,410
So this as I said is a little bit more pushy of a tactic in terms of idea of validation.
193

194
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,750
But the reason why I'm telling you about it is because it does give you better data.
194

195
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,960
The people who are willing to click the buy now button are markedly different from the people who are
195

196
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,440
willing to put down their email.
196

197
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,310
So essentially that would be a sales conversion rather than just a sign up conversion and it will give
197

198
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:40,970
you a better indication and more accuracy in terms of how in demand or how much people would actually
198

199
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,170
want your product.
199

200
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:47,820
So I would highly urge anybody you know if you're launching anything just you know it doesn't matter
200

201
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,810
like it could be a bricks and mortar shop,
201

202
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,730
just try and maximize your chance of success by figuring out if there is actually demand if people actually
202

203
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:02,000
want your product. And it doesn't matter if it's an app or if it you know a shop or if it's a product.
203

204
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:08,690
Demonstrate that demand first before you sink in all your time and all your money. It will be infinitely
204

205
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,710
worth while.
205

206
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,600
Don't go down the route that everybody does where it's like "I need to create this right now because
206

207
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,920
XYZ is going to come in and they're going to make a much better version of it.
207

208
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,860
Or like you know somebody else is going to catch on to this idea."
208

209
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,300
In my experience and barring the experience of a lot of people around me, it has always always been worthwhile
209

210
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,320
taking the time.
210

211
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,940
It can be anywhere between one and six months of idea of validation just to ensure your chance of success.
211

212
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,170
I think you know a lot of times starting a startup is like playing the lottery and you probably have
212

213
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,820
lower chances of winning at startup than winning the lottery. But doing idea of validation doing that
213

214
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,590
bit of research is the equivalent of say buying a thousand lottery tickets compared to just one.
214

215
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,950
Even if you don't take away anything from this whole course just remember that
215

216
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,100
always always always validate your idea before you commit all your time and resources to it.
