All right, let's talk a bit about typography.
1

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,460
Now whenever I mentioned typography, students always say "Oh my God. There's so many fonts.
2

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,180
How the hell do I pick and choose between them?
3

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,630
And does it really even matter at the end of the day.
4

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,320
I just choose one that I think is pretty. Isn't that good enough?"
5

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,360
Well typography is really important for a number of reasons.
6

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,320
I mean first they consider this.
7

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,970
You know if you write a love letter to your beloved and you know you write something like "you'll always
8

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,720
be mine."
9

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,310
Using one particular font will achieve something very different from using a different font.
10

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,670
So even if you're never going to design anything for print or for digital it's important to know how
11

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,850
to use and how to combine different fonts
12

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,730
so at least you won't come across as a creepy serial killer.
