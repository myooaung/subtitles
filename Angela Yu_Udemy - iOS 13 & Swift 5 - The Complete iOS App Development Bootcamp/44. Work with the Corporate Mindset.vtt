The next thing I want to talk about is that in order to get featured or in order to win favor from both
1

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.550
Apple and Google, you have to understand how these companies work. Essentially with any of these large
2

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.070
corporates
3

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.560
the company comes first.
4

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.940
Anything that makes the company look good is worth promoting.
5

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.890
So how can you capitalize on that?
6

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.990
If Apple is pushing some new product say the Apple watch and you made an app that makes the Apple Watch
7

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.350
seem like its an essential buy and allows it to do something really cool,
8

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.310
then Apple's probably going to get behind you and help you promote your product in order to make it
9

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.180
look good.
10

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.300
So keep an eye out for the new features that both Apple and Google are bringing out.
11

12
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.430
So maybe 3D touch on iOS or maybe instant apps on Google.
12

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.010
These are the things that they will want to promote
13

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.710
and if you are in the right place at the right time then you can potentially benefit from the huge marketing
14

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.700
power of these two companies.
15

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.720
So keep a pulse on what they're developing what they're pushing and see if your product fits one of those
16

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.540
angles.
