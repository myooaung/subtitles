00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.450
Now by default if you upload an app to the Google Play store or to the iOS App Store, you will get a
1

2
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.830
certain amount of app analytics that comes pre-built into those two platforms.
2

3
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.740
So this gives you some really basic data on for example how much you get in sales, how many sessions
3

4
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.690
there were, how many active devices have been using your app, how many crashes there are.
4

5
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.400
Which is always interesting and also where is your app mostly being used. And the idea is that you are
5

6
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.210
using the data that you acquire from your users to determine how best to update or modify your app so
6

7
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.350
that you can endear your app to more users or get more downloads.
7

8
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.390
So for example, you can see here that there's actually a lot of Swedes who are using this particular
8

9
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.650
app so maybe the next language to localize your app to will be Swedish.
9

10
00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.490
But at the end of the day a lot of the data that you get from these native platforms are still very limited and
10

11
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.110
you want to have more data than this.
11

12
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.610
So then this is where app analytic tools come in.
12

13
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.140
And and one of my all time favorite tools is something called Flurry that was developed by Yahoo
13

14
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.070
surprisingly.
14

15
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.310
But the nice thing about Flurry is a) its free to use
15

16
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.900
and the second thing is that you can completely customize it, so you can track whatever it is that you
16

17
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.670
want.
17

18
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.800
So say if you want to see how many users actually progress through each of the levels i.e. how many
18

19
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.880
users do you drop 
19

20
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.050
at each level of your game, then you can do that in Flurry.
20

21
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.020
r you can see how many users give up on inputting that data in your form, what is the percentage drop
21

22
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.860
off and you can do that again on Flurry.
22

23
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.860
You just have to use a little bit of code.
23

24
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.390
Now if you want something slightly simpler than that then there's another tool that does pretty much
24

25
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.550
the same thing called Mixpanel.
25

26
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.090
And again a lot of the basic features are free to use but Mixpanel makes a lot of things more intuitive
26

27
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.180
I would say them Flurry. But essentially the point is the same.
27

28
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.000
You're trying to track and see how users are interacting with your app so that you can infer if there are
28

29
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.450
problems within the user flow. For example maybe level 3 in your game is too hard and you see that
29

30
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.030
95% of people can't get past level 3 and that will tell you that you probably have to make level
30

31
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.310
3 slightly easier.
31

32
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.250
So essentially--
32

33
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.700
So essentially let the data guide your next versions and identify any problems that might be holding
33

34
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.250
you back on the app stores.
34

35
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.000
And that brings us to another point.
35

36
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.600
Both app stores will penalize apps that don't get updated regularly. So you can just upload an app and then
36

37
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.660
forget about it and hope that you'll keep getting revenue.
37

38
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.450
In fact on the Apple App Store, they're starting to delete some of the apps that haven't been updated
38

39
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.450
for a few years or no longer work on the new iOS versions.
39

40
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.210
So it's well worth a) monitoring how your users are interacting with your app.
40

41
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.640
Looking at the data as to whether if they're enjoying their experience, how long they're staying in the
41

42
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.340
app, how frequently are they coming back to the app and using this data to guide your development for
42

43
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.420
your next versions
43

44
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.890
in order to make it better and better and better.
