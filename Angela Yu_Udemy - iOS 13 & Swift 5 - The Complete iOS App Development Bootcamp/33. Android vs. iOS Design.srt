00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,330
All right.
1

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:07,830
So let's address one of the most commonly neglected design issues and that is one of the differences
2

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:13,060
when you're designing for iOS versus when you're designing for Android.
3

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,820
So here's a test. If you're long term Android user or if you're a devoted Apple fan,
4

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,190
have a look on the screen and see if you can identify which one is Android and which one is iOS.
5

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,360
For most people who've been faithful to one or the other environment, you'll find this incredibly easy.
6

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,100
The one on the left is Android design and the one on the right is iOS.
7

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,040
Now why is this differentiation important?
8

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,770
Well, one of the most common questions that we tend to get is "can I use a service such as phonegap
9

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:52,630
accelerator or ionic to develop a non-native app and then deploy it on both the Android platform and
10

11
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,440
the iOS platform without having to rebuild two of the same thing?"
11

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,970
And a lot of people see this as a huge convenience
12

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,560
not having to rewrite all the code in two different languages Java and Swift.
13

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,760
But the problem is that to somebody who is used to one or the other environment, iOS or Android. it looks
14

15
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,690
incredibly jarring.
15

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:25,120
So this is an example of a company who decided to port their iOS app directly into the Google Play store
16

17
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:32,440
and one of the biggest problems that arises immediately is that in the iOS environment it is common
17

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:40,660
to use a tab bar to separate the different screens and to use for navigation as you can see on the bottom
18

19
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,210
over here. And on Android
19

20
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,220
this is a strict no no.
20

21
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:51,550
And the reason is because on Android phones there are usually these three buttons at the bottom of the
21

22
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:57,430
screen which are hardware buttons so they're always going to be present.
22

23
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,030
That means if you put a tap bar right on top of those three buttons you have this classic bad design
23

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,090
of two rows of buttons.
24

25
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,460
And in most people our thumbs are not delicate or sophisticated enough to actually figure out which
25

26
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,250
button did I press, the photo button or did I accidentally press on the return button. And that can cause
26

27
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,170
a really really bad user experience and make the app really frustrating to use.
27

28
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:31,870
So, if I was a android user and I happened to download this app, I would pretty much be immediately
28

29
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,990
put off by it.
29

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,570
Given the stats currently are that out of every hundred apps that people download 50 of those apps will
30

31
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,880
get deleted after the first time they get opened.
31

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,310
So thinking about those stats, we have to work incredibly hard to make sure that the design is good, that
32

33
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,130
it fits with the environment
33

34
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,450
whether if its iOS or Android and also we provide a good user experience.
34

35
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:04,210
So this is certainly not the way to do it but let's have a look at some of those differentiations between
35

36
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:11,570
iOS and Android design and learn about how we can make our designs look better on the individual platforms.
