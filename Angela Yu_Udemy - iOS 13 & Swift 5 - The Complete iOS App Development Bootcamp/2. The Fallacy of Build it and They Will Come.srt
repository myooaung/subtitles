1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,420
So one of the first things I'm going to address is a pervasive attitude that a lot of people have towards
1

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,760
not just building apps, but building any sort of startup with any sort of digital business currently
2

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,690
is this idea of building it and they will come.
3

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,810
It is a complete fallacy.
4

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,140
There's too many people who have this idea that you can just you know make a great product,
5

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:30,330
you know I spent a lot of time on refining it making it perfect making it what you think to be ideal
6

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,940
and then launch it to huge success.
7

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,680
But unfortunately it just doesn't work like that.
8

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,220
More and more so we're seeing that ideas that haven't been validated ideas that are just based on a
9

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:48,780
founder's perception of the market, doesn't work. And you'll find yourself wasting a lot of time in the
10

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,180
development stages of your product.
11

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,530
And once you launch it you actually see a complete empty audience.
12

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,260
Nobody's interested in it.
13

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,210
So a really great book that I recommend on this topic is Lean Startup by Eric Ries and the whole lean
14

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,230
startup methodology is really really great for building digital products
15

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,150
in this current day and time. And one of the most important concepts within the lean startup methodology
16

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:26,580
is this idea of starting with a minimal viable product, an MVP, and allowing the end user to help
17

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,440
iterate on it and eventually arrive at a product which people will buy. No matter how great you think
18

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
your product is
19

20
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,180
if there is zero interest in it it will be non-sustainable.
20

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,900
So forget about this whole idea of building it and they will come
21

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,640
and every step of the way you need to validate your idea and you need to think about the end user.
22

23
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,250
So one of the first thing that we're going to talk about with relation to apps is a concept called app
23

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:02,360
zombies and this is basically a term that we use to refer to apps which are below the 25th listing on
24

25
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,200
the App Store.
25

26
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,070
So if you go into the app store you search for something like Ninja games right?
26

27
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,990
And first you see Clumsy Ninja
27

28
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,830
and if you keep scrolling you'll come across
28

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,560
first second third app etc. in this whole list.
29

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:24,440
And the point where you scroll past the 25th app, any apps below that is known as a app zombie because they're
30

31
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,830
virtually undead, they virtually undiscoverable because nobody has the patience to keep scrolling that
31

32
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,360
far.
32

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:38,390
It's just the same as the fact that nobody looks past Google page 2. If your app is listed so far
33

34
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,840
down for a particular keyword, then you're not going to see the downloads.
34

35
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:49,640
So this company could Adjust which publishes data on the zombie rates across the app stores in the world.
35

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,930
And this is the data from 2015.
36

37
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,820
I think the 2016 data is coming out soon.
37

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,240
But essentially it's a very alarming trend.
38

39
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:06,080
You see that at the beginning of 2013 zombie rates were around 50 57 58 percent and now they're close
39

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,530
to 90-91 percent.
40

41
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,050
So it's a sign that the app stores are massively saturated and in order for you to get noticed to be
41

42
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,070
the 10 percent that's not a zombie you have to know about app marketing.
42

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,670
The thing that you don't see from this graph is the fact that there's been a huge influx of independent
43

44
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:33,380
developers pushing their apps onto the app stores and 95 percent of those independent developers do zero app
44

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,740
marketing. Absolutely nothing.
45

46
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,270
And this whole idea of build it and they will come.
46

47
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:44,120
They launch it onto the App Store cross their fingers and hope for the best but they won't see the downloads.
47

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,080
They won't see the revenue coming in because it's no longer the same world as we were in in 2013. The
48

49
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,330
app industry has changed and you have to change with it.
49

50
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,390
So in the coming modules, we're going to be talking about various ways in which you can ensure that you
50

51
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,240
are within this top 10 percent rather than the 90 percent of people who essentially are what we call
51

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,380
below the AppStore poverty line.
52

53
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,840
The people who don't make enough revenue on the App Store in order to sustain themselves or their business.
53

54
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,120
So the other thing about zombie rates is that it varies between genres.
54

55
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:24,020
So if you're looking at something like the weather category because it's such a specific niche or niche
55

56
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,640
has you guys in the US say it, they can't really be all that much competition in there.
56

57
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,970
But when you look at something highly competitive like entertainment and games especially the arcade
57

58
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,340
game category, the zombie rate shoot straight up and it's currently close to 90 percent.
58

59
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:46,550
So depending on which category you're targeting or your app targets, you have to think even harder about
59

60
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,680
how you can be noticed and how you can get people to download it.
60

61
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:57,210
So all of this is just to stress how important it is to do just a little bit of marketing.
61

62
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,380
Even if you do a little bit it's better than nothing. And you will find that the App Store has changed
62

63
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,660
from this place where you can just you know put your goods and people will come along and buy it to
63

64
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,460
a place where you actually have to actively hawk your goods.
64

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,930
You have to shout about it, you have to tell everybody about how amazing your app is so that they can
65

66
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,830
discover it so they can download it.
66

67
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,930
So in the coming modules that's exactly what we're going to teach you.
67

68
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,770
So without further ado let's start the first module.
