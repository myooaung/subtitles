00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.110
The next important thing to remember is that light always comes from above. Wherever light comes from
1

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.850
below it looks freaky.
2

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.320
So don't do it in your user interface designs.
3

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.900
Don't try to go for the Japanese horror style user interface.
4

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.190
So what do I mean by this?
5

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.680
So when you're creating buttons or other user interface elements, you should always design them so that
6

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.670
they give the user a hint as to how they can be interacted with.
7

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.880
So we've actually encountered a number of clients who've had issues with click through.
8

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.000
So this is usually a buy now button or download here etc.
9

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.460
Namely that they don't see anybody clicking on those buttons and a large part of the reason for that
10

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.320
is poor user interface design.
11

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.530
So let's think about this. When you're looking at a button from the front you should be able to see a
12

13
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100
slight hint of a shadow over here.
13

14
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.610
And that's because when you have a look at a slice through or a side view of that button, light will
14

15
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.820
come from above
15

16
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.860
shining on it like this which means that this part will cast the shadow down here and it will be darker
16

17
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.940
than the surrounds.
17

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.020
But then once that button is pushed in it should be flushed with the surroundings and that shadow no longer
18

19
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
occurs and the whole image becomes more uniform in terms of its color.
19

20
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.010
Now the reason why this is really important is because you have to remember that none of us were born
20

21
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.390
with the ability to interact with digital interfaces.
21

22
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.410
Most users will have gone through life interacting with real things i.e. buttons that actually can be
22

23
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.680
pressed and similarly when you translate into the digital world, in order for the user to feel that they
23

24
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.090
can interact with those elements,
24

25
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.220
you have to give them an indication that reminds them of the real world and that comes from user interface
25

26
00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.530
design giving them a reminder of how a button on a glass screen is similar to a button in real life.
26

27
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.020
So a lot of times you see apps on the app stores that have buttons that look like this which does not
27

28
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.960
look like a button. That just looks like text.
28

29
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.250
Now say what you will.
29

30
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.990
You know some people might say, "Well you know it's design like this is meant to be minimalist or is meant
30

31
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.090
to look flat.
31

32
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.590
You know I'm trying to be like Jony Ive." But always remember that in design the golden rule is that
32

33
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.220
function comes before form
33

34
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.410
in all cases and whenever you find yourself sacrificing function for form you should always give it
34

35
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.520
a second thought.
35

36
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.980
So instead of having a button that's just text, what can we do to that image to make it appear more clickable?
36

37
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.480
Well the first step is maybe putting a round border around it because round things tend to be buttons
37

38
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.910
and they tend to be clicked on.
38

39
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.910
So very often you'll see iOS designers compromising with this flat design that's currently popular by
39

40
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.310
surrounding the text with a rounded border.
40

41
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.700
But even then, it still doesn't look all that clickable. It doesn't make you want to just go and tap on
41

42
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.310
it.
42

43
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.250
So how else can you improve this?
43

44
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.820
Well you can add gradients and you can add shadows. That makes the button look a little bit more rounded,
44

45
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.090
a little bit more 3D like it's protruding out of the screen making it more enticing and more likely
45

46
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.150
to be clicked on.
46

47
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.280
And the last design I'm going to show you is where you've got a drop shadow,
47

48
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.020
you've got a gradient, you've even got a little image that indicates to you what will happen once you
48

49
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.380
click on the button and that button is far more inviting and hence far more likely to get clicked on.
49

50
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.870
This might not be important if you're designing the button for people to look at your privacy policy
50

51
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.020
for example but it does matter if this is your buy button or this is your download button.
51

52
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.430
If this is linked to your revenue and people can't identify that it's clickable, then you won't get those
52

53
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.590
results you're looking for.
53

54
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.000
So think about the designs in your app,
54

55
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.110
so are your designs representative of the real world?
55

56
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:08.790
And this relates to one of my biggest gripes with the flat design that was popularized since iOS 7.
56

57
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.780
Now before if you remember iOS 6 and previous, the iPhone home screen used to have buttons that were fully
57

58
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.650
3D.
58

59
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.860
They were these glossy glassy little globules that look really really clickable and they looked like
59

60
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.870
real things and they gave you great subconscious cues as to how they can be interacted with.
60

61
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.340
And then came iOS 7
61

62
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.910
and there was a huge design overhaul to go for this flat appearance.
62

63
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.060
Now what does flat mean?
63

64
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.840
It means that when you're looking at it from the side it's virtually like a piece of glass.
64

65
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.460
It's exactly like what you're holding your iPhone.
65

66
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.130
It's just a piece of glass.
66

67
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.000
There is no gradient,
67

68
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.700
there is no shadow to indicate to the user what is a button and what is not a button.
68

69
00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.360
And so if you have a look at this screen for example the passcode screen, what is the difference between
69

70
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:08.180
this and passcode which we know is a label and does not do anything, and the emergency and cancel button?
70

71
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.310
There is literally no difference.
71

72
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.860
So for somebody who has never used an iPhone before, or for somebody who is a little
72

73
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.760
bit older
73

74
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:24.410
or for somebody who is a little bit older-- the only indication is that they can read that cancel is
74

75
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.150
a verb.
75

76
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.250
They can only hope to guess what these things do.
76

77
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.930
And that's not what design is about.
77

78
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.440
Design is meant to give the user conscious and subconscious clues as to how you should be able to interact
78

79
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.820
with the digital world.
79

80
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.480
So despite all the hype around flat design, I'm not a big fan.
80

81
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.050
And in my opinion what will happen in the future is subtle gradients, subtle shadowing, subtle contrast.
81

82
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:57.350
So if you look at the folders and the files in your Mac OS-- in your Mac OS, you can see that it's not
82

83
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.920
completely flat.
83

84
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:06.860
This folder looks like it's a little bit 3D like it contains something and that indicates to me that
84

85
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.260
if I click on it I should be able to open it up and there should be something inside.
85

86
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.350
That just shows me that it's not just text or not just an image, that it can be interacted with. And I
86

87
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.960
know that there's a lot of designers who think that flat design is so hip so trendy but actually you
87

88
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.150
know if you think about it it's not.
88

89
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.760
We've been using flat design for ever.
89

90
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.200
In the days of 8 bit graphics, we couldn't afford to put contrast and gradient and shadow onto the screen.
90

91
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.220
This is a videogame called the trill of Oregon
91

92
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.530
for those you guys you remember and it is flat design.
92

93
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.460
So there is nothing trendy about this design concept and I firmly believe that we'll move away, we'll steadily
93

94
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:54.110
move away from flat design and go towards a version that's more akin to what Google does which is material
94

95
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.570
design.
95

96
00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.370
So if you remember the old Android OS it was pretty much designed to be completely flat.
96

97
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:07.370
And then Google decided to go-- and then Google decided to change their design concept to make everything
97

98
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.080
slightly more material like.
98

99
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.820
And what does that mean?
99

100
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.800
That means that you know things should look like pieces of paper and card on screen.
100

101
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.090
And so when you look at Instagram where your photos show up, it should look like it's appearing on a
101

102
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.050
piece of card and not completely flush with the screen.
102

103
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.960
Your buttons have a subtle hint of shadow.
103

104
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:37.610
Your app action bar also has a little bit of contrast below just a hint of interactability.
104

105
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.840
And I reckon that digital design will steadily move towards this model.
105

106
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.420
Now my predictions might not come true but at the end of the day you're designing to achieve certain goals.
106

107
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.640
You're not just designing to make it look pretty.
107

108
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.210
You want to achieve--
108

109
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:57.140
you want to architect certain behavior in your users such as clicking on certain buttons or knowing
109

110
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.100
how to interact with your app without you having to explicitly tell them.
110

111
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:07.190
And I always urge students to have a look at how they design their user interface and see if it is intuitive
111

112
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.230
to their grandmother or their grandfather. Would they know that this is a button that should be clicked
112

113
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.170
on etcetera.?
113

114
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.860
So look back at your designs,
114

115
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.620
think about this.
115

116
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:23.150
How well do you mimic the real world in your designs and how well are you able to convey the interactability
116

117
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.840
of your app to the user?
