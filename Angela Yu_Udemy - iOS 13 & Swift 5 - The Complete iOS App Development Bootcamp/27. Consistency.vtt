00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.000
Question 3 is am I being consistent?
1

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.630
Now what do I mean by this?
2

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.730
It means that when you're designing for a website or when you're designing for an app, think about am I 
3

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:18.240
being consistent with my product in terms of my design? Is my design consistent with my brand? Are my web
4

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.190
site and my apps consistent with each other?
5

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.140
So this is a classic example of a inconsistent design.
6

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.410
And I don't want to name and shame but this was a previous version of their website.
7

8
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.870
Now this is a hairdressing company and styling company and their website happens to be tiled images
8

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.260
happens to have a background of tiled images of what seems to be something from their previous holiday.
9

10
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.300
Now the background makes me feel like maybe this is a travel agency,
10

11
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.400
maybe they are based in an exotic location.
11

12
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.210
I don't know.
12

13
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.690
But the thing that really seals the deal is these tiny little airplanes. When you hover over them or when you
13

14
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.900
roll over them,
14

15
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.120
the airplanes actually fly off into the distance.
15

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.930
Now what any of this has to do with hairstyling?
16

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.000
I have no idea. And this is an example of an anti-pattern where the designer didn't think about consistency.
17

18
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.160
You know this design has nothing to do with hairstyling.
18

19
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.600
Now I'm glad to say that this company has actually gotten a web designer and have changed their web
19

20
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.590
site so it no longer looks like this.
20

21
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.980
But it's so important to
21

22
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.070
ask yourself "Am I being consistent?" so that you at least avoid having your product or website named and
22

23
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.020
shamed in design classes.
23

24
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.360
Now another example of an anti-pattern is the error reporting tool that we had at a previous workplace.
24

25
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.270
When you had an IT problem at this workplace and they had a website that looks like it was inherited
25

26
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.320
from e-commerce website because you had to pick your IT problem and then you have to add it to cart
26

27
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.300
and then you would have to check out your problem and then it would say something like congratulations
27

28
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.950
your order has been made.
28

29
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.730
So it was absolutely insane and it was so inconsistent with what you're trying to achieve that it just
29

30
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.850
felt so confusing to use and a confused user is an unhappy user.
30

31
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.050
So think about consistency not just in terms of appearance but also in terms of functionality.
31

32
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.410
So if you're making a website for people to submit their IT problems don't make it like it's an e-commerce
32

33
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.230
platform.
33

34
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.270
It's very confusing and very jarring.
34

35
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.360
So understand what your product does. Understand
35

36
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.380
what is your branding, what is it that your company is all about and try to make your designs on your
36

37
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.830
app or on your website consistent with that.
