All right let's chat about something that a lot of people are really really interested in.
1

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.710
And this is how exactly do you get featured on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store?
2

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.510
Now it's currently estimated that a feature on the homepage of either app stores is equivalent to about
3

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.990
300 grand in app marketing budget.
4

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.100
So basically this is a huge leg up and it is well worth chasing.
5

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.000
So as we discussed before, one of the most important factors in getting that feature is your apps performance,
6

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.400
especially your apps performance within the first 24 hours, within the first 7 days and within the
7

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.790
first 30 days that it gets listed onto the app stores.
8

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.380
So have a look back at some of the talks where we spoke about how to have a landing page, how to drive
9

10
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.430
traffic to the landing page, how to use blogging to increase your fan base.
10

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.300
All of these tactics that basically get you users downloading the app straight away as soon as it gets listed
11

12
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.440
onto the App Store.
12

13
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.160
So we've spoken about some of those things.
13

14
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.940
But in this module we can talk a little bit more about what are some of the other ways where you can
14

15
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.280
get a higher chance of getting featured.
