00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,010
Let's first tackle how to create
and set up a new iOS project from scratch.
1

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,780
So when you first open up Xcode,
it should show you a "Welcome" screen,
and we can get started straight away
2

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,300
by clicking on the link here that says, 
"Create a new Xcode project." 
3

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,260
Now, if you don't see this welcome screen,
it might be because this checkbox is disabled, 
4

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,090
so you can also go over to File, New,
new Project to do exactly the same thing.
5

6
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,940
So let's go ahead and create this new Xcode project.
6

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,350
Next, we get to choose the kind of template
we want for our new project.
7

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:49,960
And firstly, up here, we've got different tabs for creating watch apps, tvOS apps macOS apps, et cetera.
8

9
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:58,540
But what we want is an iOS app. 
And by default, the Single View Application is selected.
9

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,910
And this is the most customizable type of template.
10

11
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,400
It basically doesn't assume anything about your app
and you're free to modify it as you need to.
11

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,090
Now for some of these other templates, for example,
the Master-Detail App which looks like this
12

13
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,750
where you've got the master and detail. So it's a bit like
the male app on iPad and usually it is used for large
13

14
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,870
screen size where you can actually have
this kind of multitasking 
14

15
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,460
or another popular one is the tabbed app.
15

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,230
So this is where you have the tab bar at the very bottom and you can click between these different tabs
16

17
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,740
to see different pages on the app.
17

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,690
Now it's important to remember that even if you choose a Single View App at any point later on if you
18

19
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:47,020
decided that you needed a tab bar or you needed to make it have Augmented Reality or if you needed a
19

20
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,200
Master-Detail type of format, you can always add it.
20

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:57,310
So I always tell students to just start off with a Single View App, and then, later on, depending on what
21

22
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,170
it is you need,
22

23
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,940
you can always add it at that point.
23

24
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,160
So now that we know what our template is all about,
let's go ahead and click next.
24

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,920
On this screen, it's really, really important
that you don't skip ahead because you have
to change this user interface
25

26
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,350
from SwiftUI to Storyboard in order
for the rest of the lessons to actually make sense.
26

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,830
And after you've done that and checked to make sure that your user interface says Storyboard, 
27

28
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,230
then we can continue with the rest of the lesson
and add a product name.
28

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,440
So this is going to be the name of your app.
And we're going to call ours I Am Rich.
29

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,910
and noticed how down here it's already starting
to build out a bundle identifier.
Now a Bundle Identifier is kind of like
30

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,060
a web address.
31

32
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,730
It's meant to be something that's unique and it will identify your app uniquely on the App Store and
32

33
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,760
you can see that it's created by what's called a reverse domain name. So whereas normally, would be something
33

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,830
like your company.com when they put the com at the beginning, and then it's the name of your company.
34

35
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,810
And that comes from your Organization Identifier.
35

36
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:13,270
So the organization name, you can leave blank, and the Team, you can leave as none for now. We'll revisit
36

37
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,930
this a little bit later on when we actually need to launch our app on a physical device.
37

38
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,690
But we should add an Organization Identifier.
38

39
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,220
So for example, our company's web address
would be www.appbrewery.co.
39

40
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,900
So all Organization Identifier because we're taking a reverse domain name would be co.appbrewery.
40

41
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,470
So it would look something like this.
41

42
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:50,260
And the final Bundle Identifier is this, plus this,
and we get a unique URL because most companies
42

43
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,700
have a web address and because web addresses are unique.
43

44
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,230
This is a really simple way of ensuring that a company's app is uniquely identified on the App Store.
44

45
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,010
Now what if you don't have an organization identifier?
45

46
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,790
What if you don't have a website?
46

47
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,450
Then I recommend just running com.
47

48
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,830
and then adding your name,
48

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,020
so it could be Angelayu for example.
49

50
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,840
This doesn't actually matter as long as there's nobody else who has used this Bundle Identifier using
50

51
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,450
your name to try and publish an I Am Rich app on the App Store,
51

52
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,110
then you'll be completely fine.
52

53
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,210
Now the very last thing to check is to make sure that the Language that you've chosen to program with
53

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,160
is Swift and the User Interface is chosen as Storyboard.
In later modules, we're going to be diving
54

55
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,560
into SwiftUI.
55

56
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,780
But we'll need to learn a lot more about Storyboarding and Swift before we can get there. And for the
56

57
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,510
rest of the checkboxes, you can leave them unchecked, like I have here. And then go ahead and click next.
57

58
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,220
Now it's going to ask you, "Where do you want to save your app?"
58

59
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,850
And if you have a specific folder that you want to save it to,  then this is the point to go ahead and
59

60
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,600
navigate to that.
60

61
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,470
Alternatively, you can simply save it on your desktop
if it's not too cluttered, or simply just create
61

62
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,100
a new folder called Development
and you can start saving all your projects in there.
62

63
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:23,680
Now we're going to go ahead and click Create
and it will generate all Xcode project for us.
63

64
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,270
So that's it.
64

65
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,640
That's our brand new Xcode project created.
65

66
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,200
And remember that Xcode automatically
saves all of your changes.
66

67
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,920
And if you ever want to locate where this project is,
then simply go to the very top over here, right-click,
67

68
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,180
and click on Show in Folder.
68

69
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,960
At which point, it's going to show you where it is on your computer. And if you go on to this view, you'll
69

70
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,250
be able to navigate all the way up to see where it's actually located.
70

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,390
In my case, it's simply on my desktop in a folder called Development. Once that's created,
71

72
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,450
if at any point you want to pause the course and you want to close down Xcode, then you can always go
72

73
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:12,980
back to where you saved it, open up the project folder, and then your project is located inside the file
73

74
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,910
called I Am Rich.Xcodeproject.
74

75
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,880
And if you double click on it, it will open it right back up where you left off.
75

76
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:27,140
So now that we've seen how to create a brand new project, the next step is to take a look around Xcode
76

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,400
and familiarize ourselves with our working environment.
