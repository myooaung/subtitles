00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,990
Now one thing to remember about key words is that you want to keep in mind where you are in your app development
1

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,460
cycle.
2

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,240
So when you are early stage i.e. you've just launched your app onto the App Store,
3

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,390
then you don't have any metrics to show off.
4

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,800
You don't have any reviews, you don't have any ratings, you barely have any downloads and that is going
5

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,940
to make it hard for you to rank highly for difficult keywords.
6

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,150
So when you're picking keywords, you want to go for something that might not be searched so frequently
7

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,380
but has low difficulty rating. So there's not a lot of apps which are targeting it.
8

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,280
So when we're thinking about ninja game which is one of the most popular keywords that a lot of games
9

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,220
are targeting, maybe consider ninja games you could target something like Warrior Games or samurai games
10

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,770
which don't have as many apps that
11

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,350
are trying to compete for that word in which case you have a higher chance of coming out on top.
12

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,370
Now as you go from your early to your mid and late game when you're racking up those reviews those downloads
13

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,970
those in-app usage time, then you can start thinking about targeting those words that are slightly more
14

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,750
difficult.
15

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,650
But bear in mind which stage you are and try to maximize the chance that you'll show up by selecting
16

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,230
keywords of the right difficulty.
