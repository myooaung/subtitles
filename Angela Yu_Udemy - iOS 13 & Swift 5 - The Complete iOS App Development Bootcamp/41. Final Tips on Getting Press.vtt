00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.720
Now I've summarize some of the things here that have been voiced by journalists
1

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.710
and if you want to have a look in more detail about the way that a journalist thinks, have a look at
2

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.410
this blog piece which I've linked in the text below from Mike Butcher who is the editor at large at
3

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.820
Techcrunch. And he's a really great guy
4

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.260
who writes some really interesting pieces and he certainly get swamped by startups or founders trying
5

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.300
to pitch their company or their app or whatever.
6

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.130
And he created this blog post that acts as a guideline to how you should approach pitching journalists.
7

8
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
And he also has this little checklist at the end which is really useful full of things that you should
8

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.680
answer in your pitch or at least think about before you start pitching a journalist.
9

10
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.850
So take a look at that and start following some of what I would say best practice for pitching journalists.
10

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.700
Now the final thing I'm going to say is that if you're interested in the way that journalism works currently
11

12
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.980
and how the game of getting press actually works, then this is a great book that I would highly recommend.
12

13
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.600
It's called Trust me I'm lying by Ryan Holiday who is a really accomplished young guy actually.
13

14
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.790
He was the head of marketing at American Apparel when he was only 20 and did some great stuff for them.
14

15
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.450
But essentially in this book what they talk about is the way that modern journalism works.
15

16
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.880
The klick chasing journalism.
16

17
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.980
And he talks about some pretty underground ways or hacky ways that he went about getting some major
17

18
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.880
coverage in on national TV or national newspapers simply by creating a sort of sensationalist piece
18

19
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.780
which he leaks to some small the blogs which gets syndicated by larger blogs which then gets read by
19

20
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.760
journalists at The Washington Post or The New York Times and then before you know the news piece is on
20

21
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.080
NBC. So have a read of that.
21

22
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.340
It goes into a lot more detail than what I can do in this course but it's both insightful as well as
22

23
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.010
practical on how you can leverage the press in the modern day.
