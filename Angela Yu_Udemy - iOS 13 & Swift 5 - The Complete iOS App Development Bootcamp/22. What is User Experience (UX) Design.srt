00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.
1

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,180
So we've talked a little bit about user interface design and now we're going to move on to the next
2

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,990
topic which is user experience or UX design.
3

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,230
Now user experience is something that's all pervasive.
4

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,460
It's not just about designing websites or designing for apps.
5

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,340
It's actually all around us.
6

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,580
So the classic user experience story that gets told is about a college that was newly built and they
7

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,420
were asking the architect you know where should we put down the footpaths?
8

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,730
So people had different ideas.
9

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,090
One guy said you should have the footpath so that they link up all of their college buildings.
10

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,830
Another person said no you should have the footpaths skirt around the building so that people can walk
11

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,850
around it and navigate their way.
12

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,730
But the architect had the final word
13

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,910
and he said "No. Instead we will just lay down a load of lawn and there would be no footpath."
14

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,500
So everybody else thought that this guy's probably crazy but we'll go along with it because he's the
15

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,270
architect.
16

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,260
And a year later the architect came back and had a look at the paths that were worn down by footfall
17

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,250
from the students.
18

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,740
And then based on that he created the footpaths.
19

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,810
So this is a story to illustrate that you can try and predict people's behavior as much as you can but
20

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,070
very often you have to be flexible and you have to tailor your designs.
21

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,810
So a design that's created just for form and not for function is a bit like this path on the right.
22

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,270
You know it looks very nice,
23

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,680
it's very organized,
24

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,470
it fits a certain aesthetic but none of that matters if it obstructs people's user experience.
25

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,180
So user experience is all around us.
26

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,690
It's not just an app or web design.
27

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,230
Whether if it's-- whether if it's a path whether it's a parking meter or anything else for that matter.
28

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,500
How can you make their experience as pain free and even as enjoyable as possible?
29

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,500
So this is what we're going to talk about in this module.
30

31
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,660
Well let's think about a drawing app.
31

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,420
This is a drawing app.
32

33
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,570
This is also a drawing app.
33

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,910
This is paper and one of my favorite apps to use just because of how delightful the user experience is.
34

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,570
So compare these two apps.
35

36
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,760
Which one do you think I'm going to use and
36

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,080
which one do you think I'm going to keep on my phone given that I don't need a billion different sketching
37

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,490
apps?
38

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,240
So this is why it's important to get the user experience right.
39

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,600
Because there's such an abundance of choice on the app stores that unless users really enjoy using your
40

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,180
app they really love the experience,
41

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,480
very often you'll find that your app will get deleted on the first time that it gets installed
42

43
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,970
and that is a pain that we don't want you to go through.
43

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:47,340
So we're going to consider some really basic user experience concepts that are fundamental to making
44

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,050
a good quality app.
45

46
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,660
Now I'm just going to show you another example to highlight my point.
46

47
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,480
This is the Apple reminder app and this is notoriously bad in terms of UX.
47

48
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,440
And the point I'm trying to make is that even if you are Apple, even if you can get your app installed
48

49
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,800
by default onto every single iPhone it doesn't mean that people will use it.
49

50
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,790
And the proof is the fact that there are so many to-do list and reminder apps out there that have taken
50

51
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,040
the place of the reminders app.
51

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,240
The fact that they have a market is because Apple didn't maximize the user experience of their own app.
52

53
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,520
So always keep that in mind when you're thinking "Oh do I really have time to think about user experience?"
53

54
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,120
This is so important
54

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,510
and getting it right and wrong can be the difference between success and failure for you app.
55

56
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,140
So I highly urge you to think about this deeply when you're making your own app.
56

57
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,920
So in this module, we're going to be presenting seven questions for you to answer when ever you designing
57

58
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,260
any sort of digital project whether it's a mobile app or whether it's a website.
58

59
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:00,990
So in the coming lessons I'm going to show you examples of when user experience was thought about and
59

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,260
my questions were answered
60

61
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,790
and when it was not thought about and you'll see the difference is dramatic.
61

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,470
So, without further ado let's get started.
