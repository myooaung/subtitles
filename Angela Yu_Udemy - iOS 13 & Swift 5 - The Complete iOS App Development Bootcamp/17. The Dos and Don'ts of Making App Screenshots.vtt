All right.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.620
So the next part of your AppStore listing is of course your screenshots and just notice how much real
2

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
estate those two screenshots take up on the App Store listing.
3

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.320
It is huge.
4

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.700
It's pretty much two thirds of all the space.
5

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.580
So it's really important to make use of it because as we all know people scroll through the app stores
6

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.770
just at a glance and you have to make sure that you catch their eye when they do that.
7

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.860
So how do you go about implementing screenshots?
8

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.870
Well there's three predominant strategies that we've seen people do.
9

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.410
One is just very simple
10

11
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.800
screenshot taken while the app is in use and your hope is that the user will be able to gather what
11

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.250
the feature is or what your app is about just by looking at the screenshots.
12

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.390
A slightly better way is just by adding a brief sentence or two above the screenshot to tell people
13

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.480
what that amazing feature is
14

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.610
and essentially sell them on downloading it.
15

16
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.370
And the third way is a fully designed version where you really show off all of your features and how
16

17
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.580
your app is differentiated from other similar apps by using full blown designs that incorporate this
17

18
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.100
screenshot as well as explainer text.
18

19
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.410
So depending on how much budget depending on how much time, you can choose to go with one of these three
19

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.690
types of screenshots.
20

21
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.230
Now what a good screenshot should look like will be unique to your app.
21

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.480
And again as with app icons it requires quite a bit of split testing just showing users different screenshots
22

23
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.200
and seeing which ones really draw them in or which ones really persuade them to download the app. And
23

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.990
it will be something that you need to experiment and think about.
24

25
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.670
But here's a few rules to follow on what not to do
25

26
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.530
for screenshots.
26

27
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.940
Firstly, if you're using images that look like stock photography, just don't do it because it inevitably
27

28
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.600
looks cheesy and makes your app look really cheap.
28

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.360
Secondly, if you have so much explainer text that you can no longer see the screenshot below it,
29

30
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.150
don't do this because I don't know what this app is showing me anymore and I don't want to read through
30

31
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.190
reams and reams of text explaining to me how great this app is.
31

32
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.700
This is a total fail in terms of the screenshot.
32

33
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.420
It's still about the visual imagery.
33

34
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.870
So use people's faces, use things that draw people in instead of adding in loads of text.
34

35
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.720
Keep it to at maximum two sentences and ideally just a phrase.
35

36
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.840
Thirdly, if you're going to use images in your screenshot make sure that they are not pixelate.
36

37
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.730
Make sure that they are the right size and also if you are gonna cut out images and you know do some photoshopping,
37

38
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.500
make sure that you've got somebody who can actually use Photoshop and cut things out properly.
38

39
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.170
Believe it or not, this is the screenshot from Craigslist and from the looks of it, it looks like they
39

40
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.480
put up a Craigslist ad looking for just any random freelance designer who will design their screenshots. For
40

41
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.250
a big company like that you would expect a little bit better. So be better than Craigslist.
41

42
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.600
Make sure that your designs actually look good.
