00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.230
All right it's time to do some hands on design work.
1

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.390
So we're going to introduce you step by step through how digital designs come to be.
2

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.080
And we're going to use the example project of building a workout app to illustrate the whole process
3

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.220
how we go from beginning to end to designing a beautiful app.
4

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.030
So the first thing we have to figure out is what we want to be able to do,
5

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.220
what are the features.
6

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.660
Well there's only three main features that we want for our workout app and that's to be able to choose
7

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.750
which workouts we want to do, to be able to track our workout and look at some stats of how well we're
8

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.370
doing,
9

10
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.830
and thirdly to have a screen that guides you through a workout.
10

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.300
So that's all that our app needs to achieve.
11

12
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.110
So let's get started.
12

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.160
What's the first step?
13

14
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.740
Well the first step is to have a look at some of our patterns and be inspired by some of the best designer's
14

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.280
work.
15

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.970
So there's two websites that I would highly recommend.
16

17
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.190
One is www.mobile-patterns.com and the other one is www.pttrns.com and the links to both are
17

18
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.000
in the text box below.
18

19
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.670
And essentially what these websites do is they curate whole sections of app designs based on a particular
19

20
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.490
theme and you can see for example how Foursquare has designed this nice little faded out map, where you
20

21
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.300
can see how Instagram has shown a location based version of their photos on a map. And basically the
21

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.930
problem is that you know as humans we can all see versions A Version B and C and see that "Oh. B looks better
22

23
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.550
than A."
23

24
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.540
But how do you come up with A and B in the first place?
24

25
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.260
Well this is one place to start looking and start getting inspiration for all of your design needs.
25

26
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.880
So in my case, I quite liked the look and feel of the sunrise calendar.
26

27
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.410
I like the idea of having a navigation bar at the top for our workout app, having action buttons over
27

28
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:56.030
here such as starting work out or going back or whatever or navigation and having my calendar display
28

29
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.200
very simply and maybe having colored circles to represent days which I've worked out,
29

30
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.400
and then at the bottom you can see a detailed view of my workouts on particular days. How many minutes
30

31
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.880
I've been training etc.
31

32
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.830
Something like that.
32

33
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.040
So now that we've got ideas, the next step is to pick a color palette. So you can go about this in many
33

34
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.110
different ways. You can come up with your own color palette, you can design colors that fit well with
34

35
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.960
each other especially if you are a graphic designer.
35

36
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.430
This will be very natural to you.
36

37
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.190
But for the rest of us, it can be difficult to come out with colors that fit a certain mood or colors
37

38
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.060
that harmonize with each other or colors that stand out etc.
38

39
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.280
This is why I like to use a free tool called www.colorhunt.com.
39

40
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.050
And what colorhunt lets you do is it lets you browse through a whole bunch of color palettes that professional
40

41
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.720
designers have come up with.
41

42
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.770
And once you found something that you quite like the look of say we're going to pick this one,
42

43
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.430
then you can simply just copy and paste the hex codes of the colors into your design projects. So you
43

44
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.380
can also search this by popular, or by hot.
44

45
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.030
I'm still not sure what is the difference between hot and popular on this website. Let me know if you
45

46
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.780
figure it out.
46

47
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.220
So let's pick a color palette for our work out.
47

48
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.720
So it's something that's got to be fun and kind of vibrant.
48

49
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.870
Let's pick this one.
49

50
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.000
That seems pretty good.
50

51
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.740
So I would typically--
51

52
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.980
So I would typically note down all of these hex codes in a note taking app and I'll be able to refer
52

53
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.220
to it when I need it.
