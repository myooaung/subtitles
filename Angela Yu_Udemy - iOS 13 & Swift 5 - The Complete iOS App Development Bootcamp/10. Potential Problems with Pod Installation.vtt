00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.010
This lesson is all about understanding and fixing potential problems with pod installation. At some point,
1

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.340
you'll be installing your own pods for your own projects.
2

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.950
So it's really important to understand how this process works, so you'll be able to fix them if they
3

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.470
arise in the future.
4

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.590
In the process, you're going to get an understanding of how pods are updated and how to specify a particular
5

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.860
version of the pod using the pod file.
6

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.120
The first thing you should do after installing your pods and opening your xcworkspace is to build your
7

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.080
project.
8

9
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.330
So hold on command on your keyboard and hit B in order to build. And in certain cases, you might get errors
9

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.920
that are because of certain lines of code in the newly added pod files. Because we know before we added
10

11
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.890
the pod files, we had no problems.
11

12
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.100
But now we've got 4 errors.
12

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.090
So let's click on it and see what it's telling us to do.
13

14
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.540
It's telling us that there's a number of things that have updated in Swift. So there's some changes that
14

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.250
it's suggesting us to make.
15

16
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.560
For example, here, it's telling us that the character's property is no longer used.
16

17
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.650
Instead, we should be using that string directly. So it wants us to change some code that comes from this
17

18
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.010
pod CLTypingLabel.
18

19
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.600
Now, what's going on here?
19

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.620
Well, if we head back over to our CLTypingLabel page on CocoaPods, and then navigate to the GitHub
20

21
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:43.650
page through this link, if you take a look at the Pull requests and look at the Closed ones, you can see
21

22
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:51.840
that people have been updating this repository to fix some of these problems, right, the characters method
22

23
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.910
which we saw just now.
23

24
00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.020
So in this case, it's getting the error: "The method characters is deprecated," so instead, they're updating
24

25
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.690
the code to use the string method instead.
25

26
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.520
And you can take a look at the files that they've changed.
26

27
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.310
So for example, instead of characters.count > 0, they've changed it to this line here.
27

28
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.530
So let's go ahead and copy this line which was added and remove this line 139
28

29
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.180
that was deleted, and then click Unlock to unlock the file, and then replace it with this new line
29

30
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690
that we got from the GitHub.
30

31
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.520
So, now if I hit command B, you can see that I no longer have any errors associated with this line.
31

32
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.670
So clearly, we're getting some fixes that have been added to the repository.
32

33
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:51.390
Now, when you head back over to the code tab and you click on releases, you can see that the latest version
33

34
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.150
of this pod or this repository that was released is 0.4.0.
34

35
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.540
And this is the release that supports Swift 4 and 5.
35

36
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.640
So notice how a lot of these errors are because the code is using a lower version of Swift.
36

37
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.490
In fact, a lot of these errors have actually been addressed already by the makers of this particular pod.
37

38
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.730
But if we take a look inside our Flash-Chat-iOS13 folder, you can see that there's a file called
38

39
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.710
PodFile.lock.
39

40
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.050
So if you go ahead and right click on it, then select Open With, and we're going to, again, select Xcode
40

41
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:39.310
to open it, and then click Open. You can see that it tells us which pods we have added to our project.
41

42
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.270
And the only one is this one called CLTtypingLabel. And the version, though,
42

43
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.070
is 0.3.0.
43

44
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.490
So it's lower than the latest release. In fact, our one
44

45
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.460
is this one that was released in October, 2017.
45

46
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.330
So why is it that we're not able to get this latest version? Now, if we go back to the CocoaPod guides
46

47
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.170
and we look at the pod file Reference, you can see that we can actually specify a specific version of
47

48
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.140
the pod that we want to use.
48

49
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.710
So in this case, they're using AFNetworking 1.0 version.
49

50
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.370
So if we go back to our pod file, so not the Podfile.lock, but the actual pod file which you'll
50

51
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.970
be able to find inside your Xcode project as well right here,
51

52
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.020
notice how it's on RB or Ruby file and it has all of the changes that we made before.
52

53
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.590
Well, instead of just telling it to use any old pod file, we're going to add the same syntax as we see
53

54
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.860
here.
54

55
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.870
So a comma followed by a single quote, and inside a single quote,
55

56
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.720
we've got a tilde symbol, and then a right angle bracket, and then the version of that pod that we
56

57
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.730
want to use.
57

58
00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:00.510
So back over here, I'm going to add, first, a comma, then a single quote, and then a tilde symbol, a right
58

59
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:09.030
angle bracket, space, and then 0.4.0, and then closing it off with a single quote.
59

60
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.670
So just check to see that what you've typed is exactly the same as what you see on the screen right
60

61
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.590
now.
61

62
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.040
And then we're going to hit save.
62

63
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.630
So, now let's close down our project, go back to Terminal, and we're going to run a pod install again.
63

64
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.490
And instead typing it out, I'm just going to hit the up arrow which you'll see cycles through all of the
64

65
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.000
previous commands I've issued. And the one immediately before was pod install which I wrote here.
65

66
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.290
So, now I've got that selected, I'm gonna hit enter to execute it. And notice how we're getting an error
66

67
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.940
here.
67

68
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.160
It says, "CocoaPods could not find compatible versions with 'CLTypingLabel.'"
68

69
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.000
This particular version, the specification satisfying naught .4.0 were found, but they
69

70
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.910
required a higher minimum deployment target.
70

71
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.060
So what is all of this mean in English anyways?
71

72
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:12.700
Well, it means that, yes, they found this 0.4.0 version of CLTypingLabel, but that
72

73
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.730
version requires you to have a higher minimum deployment target.
73

74
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.400
So let's go ahead and open up our pod file again. And remember how back when we started out creating
74

75
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.410
our pod file, we specified a minimum deployment target of 9.0. 
75

76
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:38.740
Well, this 0.4.0 version actually requires a higher minimum than 9.0.
76

77
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.050
How would we know this?
77

78
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:50.380
Well, if I go back to our GitHub page for CLTypingLabel and we go into the pod spec file, you'll see
78

79
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:58.290
that the specification requires platform minimum iOS version 10.0 or above.
79

80
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.060
So that's why we're not able to get the latest version of this pod is because we're saying that our
80

81
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.420
project has to support everything from 9 and above,
81

82
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.680
but this pod is only available for projects which are 10 or above.
82

83
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.590
So let's go ahead and fix this.
83

84
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:21.670
Let's change this to, in fact, to go all the way to 13 because we're only going to support iPhones running
84

85
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.520
iOS 13 or above.
85

86
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.480
Now, we're going to hit save on our pod file and we're going to leave this line as it is, and then we're
86

87
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.500
going to go back to our Terminal and we're going to run pod install again.
87

88
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.090
And notice how this time we installed 0.4.0,
88

89
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.830
whereas it used to be 0.3.0.
89

90
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:50.130
We've made all of those updates. And now if we open up are white xcworkspace project for our FlashChat again,
90

91
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:57.690
you'll notice that when we hit command B to build that we don't have any of those errors
91

92
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.530
that we saw earlier on.
92

93
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:07.380
And in fact, it's completely compatible with the latest version of iOS and Swift, and we're no longer
93

94
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.600
getting any errors that are coming from that latest pod.
94

95
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:20.540
Now, I've chosen this pod, in particular, to show you firstly because it is able to replace all of the
95

96
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.370
code that we have to write here in order to animate our label.
96

97
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:32.030
But it also allowed me to show you the issues with the pod spec, as well as the minimum versioning in
97

98
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:38.810
our pod file, because these are things that you might encounter in future when you're using different
98

99
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:45.980
third party libraries that you might need. But normally, incorporating a CocoaPod is not that difficult.
99

100
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:52.880
All you have to do is create the profile, add the pods that you want to incorporate, run pod install, and
100

101
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.040
you should be ready to go without all of these errors that you have to fix.
101

102
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:04.410
But now that we've finally added our CLTypingLabel, let's check out how we're supposed to use it.
102

103
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.160
And that's exactly what we'll do in the next lesson.
103

104
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.890
So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
