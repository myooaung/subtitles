00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.900
Now,  first thing's first, we're going to need a newspaper to project AR content onto.
1

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.750
Now, if you have a copy of newspaper that's lying around,
2

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.070
then, of course, you can use that. But you will need to find a main image in the newspaper and you need
3

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.300
to be able to source the actual image online somewhere, and you'll also need to find a video that's relevant
4

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.550
to that content to make it work.
5

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.750
So it might be a little bit roundabout.
6

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.790
So for those of you guys who are following along with the tutorials, I've included a link in the course
7

8
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.590
resources list that downloads a copy of the front page of the Daily Prophet,
8

9
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.330
so the Harry Potter newspaper, and we're going to be working with this in the tutorial and I'll show
9

10
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.180
you how to source all of the content and materials.
10

11
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.450
So I recommend that if you're working along with the tutorial, just to simply head over here and download
11

12
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.550
this newspaper, and then print it out.
12

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.450
So we're going to be holding this newspaper in one hand and the app and the other in order to launch
13

14
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.210
our newspaper into AR. Once you've gotten hold of this newspaper,
14

15
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.670
we need a saved copy of the actual image.
15

16
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.740
So go ahead and open it up in preview and expand the image to as large as possible on your screen, and
16

17
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.610
then hold down command + control + shift, and 4, and that opens up our screenshot tool which we're going to
17

18
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.200
use to take a screenshot of this main image.
18

19
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.970
Now, once we let go, a copy of that screenshot is saved on our clipboard.
19

20
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.660
And if you're inside the preview application, if you hold down control + N, then it will create a new
20

21
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.110
file from that screenshot which we can now save,
21

22
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.530
and I'm going to call it just harrypotter, and I'm going to save it in the PNG format.
22

23
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.340
So, now make sure you can locate that Harry Potter image and make sure you've already printed out your
23

24
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.680
newspaper image.
24

25
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.290
The next step is sourcing our video.
25

26
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.780
Now, ideally, you would have some video that's lying around that you own,
26

27
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.520
that's also in the MP4 format.
27

28
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.700
It's really important that you try to find a video that's in the MP4 format.
28

29
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.530
It works best from a lot of experimentation with ARKit and with SceneKit.
29

30
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:33.950
Now, if you can't find anything that's suitable, then the easiest thing is just  to head on to YouTube and
30

31
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.260
try to find a Harry Potter clip,
31

32
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.360
and this should give you something that's relatively short,
32

33
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.760
sort of two or three minutes long.
33

34
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.370
And we're going to copy this YouTube URL and head over to a YouTube downloader.
34

35
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.740
Now, of course, if you're building your app for launch on the App Store, then you need to make sure that
35

36
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.750
you own all of the media and all of the content that you're going to put into your app.
36

37
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:09.120
But just for the purposes of learning and education, we're going to download this YouTube video in an
37

38
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.160
MP4 format.
38

39
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.830
So I'm going to select the MP4 360,
39

40
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.600
so make it a little bit smaller,
40

41
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.900
and then I'm going to download this video.
41

42
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.710
Now, once we've downloaded the video, it's important that you rename it to the exact same name that you
42

43
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.150
gave your main image.
43

44
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.830
So I called the other one Harry Potter,
44

45
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.630
so I'm going to call this one harrypotter as well.
45

46
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.260
And we now have an image that we've printed out which we're going to launch our ARKit on.
46

47
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.590
We have the image that needs to be recognized in the newspaper
47

48
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.510
and we've also got the video that needs to play in the place of the image
48

49
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.630
once the ARKit app recognizes it.
49

50
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.360
So we're now all ready with our resources to get started building our app.
50

51
00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.120
Once you've done all of that, then head over to the next lesson and let's get started building our magical
51

52
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.050
newspaper app.
