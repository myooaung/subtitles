00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,160
Now what's the next step after you've figured out your story or your angle,
1

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,350
you figured out how to succinctly pitch your app or your company.
2

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,520
Well the next step is figuring out who to pitch to.
3

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,500
And this is a workflow that helps you to do that. Different journalists have different areas of interest,
4

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,430
they have various things that they like to cover. And in order to find out what that beat is you have
5

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,320
to look at what they've written in the past.
6

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,110
So say if you're creating a coffee app,
7

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,330
the best bet to get press is by finding out which journalists have covered this topic in the past. Because
8

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,830
if they've written about coffee apps in the past you're far more likely to get their attention than
9

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,870
if you pitch somebody that covered financial tech or fin
10

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,350
tech for example. One of the ways of doing this is by going to Google and hitting the News tab
11

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,860
searching for either your competitors name or your niche. And then you can start making a list of who
12

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,180
those journalists are.
13

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,220
Now a slightly more sophisticated way of going about this is using a service like Buzz sumo.
14

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,860
And this allows you to see not only who the journalists are but how much interest they got from their
15

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,700
stories as well as a whole load of really useful details as well as a whole load of really useful details.
16

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,040
But the main point is not about getting some fancy service.
17

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,060
It's about figuring out who has written about your niche or about your competitors and then getting a name
18

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,010
of the journalist making a spreadsheet of who the journalist was,
19

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,000
what is the URL of the story that is in the same niche as yours. And then read up and do a little bit
20

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,170
of background research on the journalists. Figure out what do they tend to write about,
21

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,510
what do they care about,
22

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,870
what are they interested in.
23

24
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,510
So that will come from their previous posts, their Twitter feed or their Facebook feed and start getting
24

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,760
a sense of what each journalist is about because everybody's different and you have way better of a
25

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,500
chance targeting a journalist that actually cares about the topic that you're involved in rather than
26

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,140
just rather than just blasting every single journalist. Because at the end of the day when you are pitching
27

28
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,240
journalists you want to make it personalized.
28

29
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,820
You want to be able to show that a) you're not wasting their time because you know what they write about.
29

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,510
You know what their opinion or their stance on certain things are.
30

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,000
And either "Here is a novel idea" or "Hey here's a heads up on what's happening in that area" or in that niche
31

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,860
or something that basically is worth writing about because these journalists get pitched every single
32

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,540
day from morning to evening.
33

34
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,710
And you have to somehow stand out from the giant crowd of self-obsessed founders who all believe that
34

35
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,500
they are a special snowflake and that everything they do is worth an hour of somebodies life to write
35

36
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:40,980
about it.
36

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,770
So really do your homework and you'll have a much higher chance of success.
