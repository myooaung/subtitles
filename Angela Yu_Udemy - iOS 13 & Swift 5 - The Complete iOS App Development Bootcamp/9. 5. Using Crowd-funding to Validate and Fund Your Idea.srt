The next thing that I want to talk about is crowdfunding. And if you're not familiar with crowdfunding
1

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,600
such as with Kickstarter or with Indiegogo,
2

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,780
it's essentially a platform that allows you to showcase your idea or your project and gathering people
3

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,000
together who are interested in funding the end result.
4

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,350
So on these websites people can pledge a certain amount that you define so that they can get certain
5

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:33,160
perks and those perks or rewards can be anything from just a thank you note to a T-shirt with your brand
6

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,140
on it or the actual product at the end which is usually the most popular.
7

8
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,820
And anything to you know a personal a personal meeting with the founder et cetera.
8

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,450
So the nice thing about crowdfunding as a idea of validation methodology is that it really gets to the
9

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,980
crux of the problem.
10

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,300
I.e. will people pay for your idea? And as much as it helps to gather information through looking at
11

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,490
sign ups via landing pages or seeing if people will click on a buy button,
12

13
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:10,090
there's nothing that tells you more about your idea than if people actually pull out their credit card
13

14
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,890
and put it down to buy what it is that you're going to make.
14

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,930
There is no better validation than that.
15

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:23,170
So Crowdfunding is a huge topic and I think success in it takes a lot of preparation, probably a little
16

17
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,400
bit more than just having a good idea.
17

18
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:31,450
We're probably going to make a separate course just for this because as some of you guys know, we had
18

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:42,580
a pretty huge crowdfunding effort last year and it went surprisingly well. And we just wanted to tell
19

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,580
you guys about a few of things that we discovered along the way.
20

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,130
And more of a systematic approach to how you actually go about creating a successful crowdfunding project.
21

22
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:58,330
Everything from videos to drawing attention to how you list it to
22

23
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,420
what are the setting of the dates and time.
23

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,150
There's a whole load of factors around crowdfunding on Kickstarter and Indiegogo that we're probably going
24

25
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,100
to dive into. Another 8 module or 50 hour kind of project
25

26
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,130
I think it's going to be.
26

27
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,100
But yeah if you're interest in that just hit us up over email or over Slack and we'll let you guys know once
27

28
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,300
that's ready.
28

29
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,720
But anyways back to the idea of using crowdfunding as an idea validation tool. Essentially you're looking
29

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,960
at the big two which is Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Now
30

31
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,940
they have now they have slightly different rules and slightly different use cases but for the most part
31

32
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:44,200
Kickstarter is a slightly larger community so it has I would say more active users and more hits than
32

33
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,670
Indiegogo on a daily basis.
33

34
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,420
But Indiegogo has slightly more favorable rates especially after your crowdfunding event has ended. Now
34

35
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,630
with crowdfunding you have a limited amount of time in which your project is visible and you can set
35

36
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,220
that time.
36

37
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,980
So it could be as long as you know three months or it could be as short as a week or two.
37

38
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,350
And I think for Project validation something like about 30 days is probably ideal.
38

39
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,880
The longer that you run your crowdfunding the more sleepless nights and constant caffeination you will
39

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,210
have.
40

41
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,770
So think about the toll on your team as well.
41

42
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,600
But it's basically just a great place where you can make a video describing what your app does or what
42

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,840
your or what your product does and then you know tell people what are the features, what are they going
43

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,580
to get from it,
44

45
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,700
what is it going to do for them i.e. the benefits.
45

46
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,280
And then if people are interested in it, they can pledge and back for a number of rewards.
46

47
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,850
So this is a currently active Kickstarter called the Beelinguapp
47

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:54,190
I just found on the front page of Kickstarter and you can either pledge one euro for support or you
48

49
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:01,530
can have a ad free version for 10 euros or some of the other pledges that you can look through.
49

50
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,530
And they're doing relatively well. 8 days to go
50

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,360
and they've raised â‚¬10,000.
51

52
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,980
So I think looking at the percentage they're probably going to make it.
52

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,840
And that means that you've got users from day one.
53

54
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,660
And also you have the funds that enables you to take time out of work or work on this as a side project
54

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:29,200
or being able to get a professional designer etc And you can set that goal to whatever you feel is necessary.
55

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,430
Now we think that that goal shouldn't be too high.
56

57
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,880
Don't be overly optimistic.
57

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,300
Instead just put down whatever it is that you think you will need in order to get it done.
58

59
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,300
And it is a great community actually
59

60
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,630
Kickstarter there's a lot of really really awesome people on there who will cheer you on, who will be
60

61
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,310
there for you
61

62
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:58,810
you know even in the toughest of times. And we certainly had a lot of lows you know shipping shipping
62

63
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,110
a physical product as is incredibly difficult actually.
63

64
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:16,070
And there have been so many unexpected turmoils and I have to say you know our community of over 700
64

65
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,850
backers have actually been a huge boon
65

66
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:27,170
and you know every time we read a comment that is really supportive, it just cheers us up just a little
66

67
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,510
bit
67

68
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,740
and it really really is-- makes a world of difference for us.
68

69
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,960
So yeah building that community about people with people who actually care for your product is another
69

70
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,130
huge advantage.
70

71
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,550
So in my opinion, if you're building an app or if you're building a product, running a crowdfunding project
71

72
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:53,300
for 30 days is a really great way of testing the waters and seeing if people are actually willing to
72

73
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,930
pay for the end product.
73

74
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,910
So have a look at it,
74

75
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:03,800
have a think about it and it does take a little bit of time to set up especially creating the videos
75

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,160
and creating some of the assets.
76

77
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,280
But as we said, we're currently planning on making a full course on this just because we learned so much
77

78
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,100
during the four months that we did this that we want to share with you guys as well.
78

79
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:25,310
Anyways have a look at Kickstarter, have a look at Indiegogo and if you are about to launch and if you
79

80
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:32,060
are thinking about whether if your idea is going to work or if you want to validate the market then
80

81
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,870
this is a great way of going about it.
