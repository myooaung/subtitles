Okay. So another tactic I want to talk about is the so-called refer a friend or social referrals. And this
1

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.950
is based on a case study of an app called Robinhood.
2

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.900
So Robinhood is an app that theoretically allows you to have commission free trading.
3

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.410
So when they launched in Beta they had a sort of pre-release version where they told people you can have
4

5
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.720
early access to this app to give it a spin or try it out.
5

6
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.290
And the way that they built their email list was quite unique.
6

7
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.010
What they said was that once you've given your details you'll email e.t.c. saying that I'm interested
7

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.820
in getting early access to this app,
8

9
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.870
they show you this page where it gives you an idea of where in the queue you are
9

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.200
in order to get this app download. So there's 400,000 people ahead of you
10

11
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.550
and 28 people behind you.
11

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.400
And that makes it really easy for you to visualize this gigantic
12

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.890
queue. As far as I know these numbers are real.
13

14
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.080
And so firstly there's a massive amount of social proof. My god! Almost half a million people want
14

15
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.550
to download this app.
15

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.410
And I like way at the back of the queue. When am I ever going to be able to get there to get this amazing
16

17
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.660
fantastical app?
17

18
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.050
Well they tell you the idea is that if you're interested in priority access then you can refer your
18

19
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.520
friends. The more friends that join the queue the sooner you get access.
19

20
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.400
So essentially this is like that exclusive club where if you're able to bring a bunch of hot girls you
20

21
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.070
can skip the queue and get into the club ahead of all the people who are queuing.
21

22
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.750
So they give you a whole bunch of ways that you can share your unique link and they track how many people
22

23
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.090
have joined because of you
23

24
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.390
and then you will see yourself moving ahead of the queue.
24

25
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.760
Now this is a very intelligent way of going about email collection because first you demonstrate social
25

26
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.040
proof i.e. there's a massive amount people who want this thing that you want so they don't feel stupid
26

27
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.500
for just giving you that email.
27

28
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.950
And it will make them want access to your app even more.
28

29
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.520
The second thing is that you encourage people to take action in the moment because we are now also used
29

30
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.670
to fast food, fast cars,
30

31
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.450
we want everything immediately. And this whole idea capitalizes on that need for immediate gratification.
31

32
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.800
Because as soon as you tell somebody you can't have something, what are they going to want?
32

33
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.280
They're going to want it even more and they're going to want it right now.
33

34
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.060
And you can use that psychology in your advantage by getting them to do something, to perform an action.
34

35
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.000
In this case it's tweeting about it, sharing about it, essentially getting a network effect. And the number
35

36
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.930
of times when we've seen network effects in either you know downloads of our product or pledges to Kickstarter
36

37
00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.710
or whatever, it's always you know this massive J-curve. And it's like you know if one person shares it
37

38
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.390
to five people and five people share to another five people, you see this exponential growth
38

39
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.510
that you just can't get by targeting everybody individually.
39

40
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.100
Your social circle is only so big and
40

41
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.970
you only have so much budget to put on advertising.
41

42
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.280
So leveraging the social network effect is immensely powerful.
42

43
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.130
Now if you want to implement this for your own app there's actually a product called MaÃ®tre which helps
43

44
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.660
you implement this kind of social queuing.
44

45
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.140
And since Robinhood I've seen a number of products that have done this quite effectively.
45

46
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.400
So especially when you're in the build up phase, when you're not ready to release your app to release
46

47
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.710
your product, this can be a really really good way of getting those initial users.
