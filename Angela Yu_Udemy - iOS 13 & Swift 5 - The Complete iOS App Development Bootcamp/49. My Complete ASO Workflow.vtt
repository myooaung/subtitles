00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.000
Now how do you come up with these key words in the first place?
1

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.770
Well, an easy starting point is going into the app store and going into the search tab.
2

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.100
Now for example, if you search for Ninja, the App Store will automatically suggest to you some of the
3

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.810
variations that users have used when they're looking for things that are related to the word Ninja.
4

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.840
So some of these words might be good keywords for you to jump on.
5

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.760
So this is basically the easiest and the least effort intensive way of coming up with keywords.
6

7
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.800
Now I'm going to show you a slightly more refined workflow for coming up with app store keywords.
7

8
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.970
The first thing you have to do is go and find a reverse dictionary online.
8

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.400
So one of my favorite is a dictionary called OneLook and it's free to use and it's basically at one
9

10
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.430
look.com.
10

11
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.850
Now don't go into that dictionary search because this only gives you definitions and don't go into the
11

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.480
theasaurus.
12

13
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.420
Instead what you want is the reverse dictionary.
13

14
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.740
Now a reverse dictionary is different from a thesaurus.
14

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.240
So whereas a thesaurus gives you all the synonyms of a particular word, the reverse dictionary gives
15

16
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500
you words that are used in conjunction with your word.
16

17
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.120
So for example, if we type in coffee then we'll get a whole bunch of words that are used when people
17

18
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.170
use the word coffee.
18

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.250
So for example, Java or coffee bean or chocolate or coffee berry, espresso, latte, tea. And the words that
19

20
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.260
come out a reverse dictionary are pretty much perfect for use as keywords.
20

21
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.470
Now you do have to do a little bit of sifting through this because some of these are not ever going
21

22
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.220
to be searched like umber, burnt umber.
22

23
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.530
I have a feeling there's probably one search for that on the App Store per month.
23

24
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.680
So how so then the question is how do you figure out which of all of these words,
24

25
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.420
I mean there's pages and pages of this, are worth using as your keyword?
25

26
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.370
Well there's a very easy workflow for this.
26

27
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.590
Now this is where a service like Sensor Tower or App Annie comes into play.
27

28
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.840
So there's many of these such services out there and you can try and figure out which one you prefer
28

29
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.970
or which one has a better pricing model.
29

30
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.500
Personally, we use Sensor Tower. And what you can do with Sensor Tower is that if you go into the
30

31
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.490
products tab you can go to the App Store optimisation feature and what you can do is you can research
31

32
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.100
a whole bunch of keywords.
32

33
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.810
Now this is where those words from the reverse dictionary comes into use.
33

34
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.800
You can either go ahead and just copy these words one by one into your keyword space or if you're looking
34

35
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.960
for a little bit more efficiency than what I use is a free Chrome plugin code scraper.
35

36
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.900
Now once you've added that to Chrome, what you can do is you can highlight the type of data that you're
36

37
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.560
looking for.
37

38
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.380
So in this case is actually this piece of data and then you can right click and you can click on this
38

39
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.050
scrape similar button.
39

40
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.230
Now what that does is that it looks through the website and looks for data that's structured similarly
40

41
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.070
to that word Java.
41

42
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.030
Now then the next thing that you can do is you can hit copy to clipboard and copy all of that data and
42

43
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.710
paste it into here. So you will have the curate and add some commas between these word and maybe get
43

44
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.450
rid of some of these because they're not really going to help you.
44

45
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.070
Okay. So now we've added commas in between all the different words
45

46
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.680
and I've gotten rid of some of the words which I think probably are never going to be searched.
46

47
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.540
So now that we've got all our key words, all you have to do is hit track keyword and you'll get a number
47

48
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.120
of really important metrics.
48

49
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.030
Now the first thing that you want to look at is this column called traffic.
49

50
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.120
So as they say, this is an estimate of how many people are actively searching for this particular keyword.
50

51
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.370
So the higher the score, then the more traffic there is.
51

52
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.790
And the other important column is difficulty.
52

53
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.360
So this index lets you know how difficult it is to rank in the App Store for this particular keywords.
53

54
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.790
So that means the higher the score, the more apps are targeting that particular keyword.
54

55
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.940
So you're basically going to be in a large pool of a large number of apps.
55

56
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:13.330
So the sweet spot that I find is when the traffic score now the scores are different for different services.
56

57
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.900
But a sense of how what we found is that once the traffic score is above 3 and the difficulty is
57

58
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.580
below 3, then that is usually a pretty solid keyword.
58

59
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.610
And what you want to do is to create a Excel file or Google sheet to keep track of those keywords that
59

60
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.450
you have selected. And once you've made a full list of all the keywords, so this is usually 100 or 150,
60

61
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.510
then you can sort them and figure out what are your top keywords that you will cram into that 100 character
61

62
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.040
keyword field.
62

63
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.780
So this is pretty much our work flow
63

64
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.050
and in my opinion it's the best way of going about this. Instead of employing a ASO expert who is probably
64

65
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.030
going to do something very similar to this,
65

66
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.260
you can in fact just DIY and do it yourself. And you can optimize your keywords this way.
