00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,880
All right. So another day, another new challenge.
1

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,580
So the next thing that we want you to do is to use that Flower Classifier in order to classify the image
2

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,040
that we got back from the imagePicker.
3

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,710
So we want to create a method called detect that takes a single CIImage that's going to be called
4

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,250
Flower Image and we're going to pass in the image that we got back from the imagePickerController and
5

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,510
to change the title of navigation bar to the name of the flower that we detected.
6

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:26,850
All right.
7

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,980
So this is the end result that you're aiming for after you complete this coding challenge.
8

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,450
So we still have our blank user interface.
9

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,060
And if I tap on camera and I take a picture of these flowers that around me and I hit Use Photo, you'll
10

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,740
be able to see the classification of that flower at the top of the navigation bar.
11

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,690
So we're not doing anything that's different or new from previous modules when we used CoreML, so try
12

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,310
and see if you can code up this functionality, and I'm going to guide you through the steps that you'll
13

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,140
need to take.
