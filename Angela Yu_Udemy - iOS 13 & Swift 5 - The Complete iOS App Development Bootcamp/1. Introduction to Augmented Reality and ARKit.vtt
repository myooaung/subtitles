00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:00.910
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.780
So welcome to the ARKit Module.
2

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.070
So alongside the CoreML framework, ARKit is the other thing that really, really excited us at the
3

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.700
App Brewery
4

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.430
during this year's WWDC. And I'm going to talk a little bit about what it is and what you can do with it.
5

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.480
And then we're going to get started implementing it in a couple of apps and I'll show you how you can
6

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.770
use it in your own project.
7

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.970
So what exactly is AR or augmented reality? And I think the best example that people always tend to
8

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.310
use is Magic Leaps video
9

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.580
where this whale basically jumps out of the gym floor and wows all of the kids.
10

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.420
I'm not sure that kids are that easily impressed, but it's a great demo and it shows very basically what
11

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.080
AR is.
12

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.480
It's a way of putting virtual objects inside the real world and making it appear as if the real and
13

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.400
the virtual worlds are merged together, so magically is a huge endeavor and the company has raised about
14

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.250
$1.4 billion in investment so far, and yet we still haven't even seen a product yet.
15

16
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.940
So people are investing big in AR and there's good reasons for it.
16

17
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.210
Now, Magic Leap's tag is built to be really revolutionary.
17

18
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.020
It's going to change the world and it's going to be absolutely amazing,
18

19
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.700
but, you know, we're yet to see what exactly it is. We'll decide once we actually put on a headset and
19

20
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.640
see it for ourselves.
20

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.310
But augmented reality exists and it's really very, very prevalent in a lot of the apps that you use.
21

22
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.460
So a good example are the 3D stickers that you see in Instagram Stories, also PokÃ©mon GO, of course,
22

23
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.820
one of my favorite games.
23

24
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.910
And finally, of course, Snapchat masks.
24

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.920
So there's actually a lot of AR being used already in the apps that we're using and Apple is definitely
25

26
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.800
jumping on this in a big way.
26

27
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.740
And I'm really glad that they are because they are a company that really has the resources and the manpower
27

28
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.010
to be able to make this really, really mainstream,
28

29
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.470
and it really could change the way that we interact with digital technology in the future.
29

30
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.080
So if you have a look at developer.apple.com/arkit, then you see Apple's brand-new page
30

31
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.830
for AR and it explains a little bit about what ARKit is, and it's a great place to get started.
31

32
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.990
So have a read of how ARKit works here and you can look in detail at the documentation over here.
32

33
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.330
And I definitely recommend if you are going to start building your own apps in a ARKit, then this is
33

34
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.540
the first place to start
34

35
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.390
after creating the tutorial apps.
35

36
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.310
So what exactly is ARKit?
36

37
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.870
Well, it's basically just a way of implementing augmented reality in iOS in a simplified way.
37

38
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.580
And since the iOS 11 developer preview, a lot of the developers have already started making really, really
38

39
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.650
cool stuff with iOS 11 and ARKit.
39

40
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.950
So here are some really great examples.
40

41
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.660
So, for example, Tic-Tac-Toe on any sort of ground or surface that you've got or a way of measuring
41

42
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.850
real-world distances by simply using the camera or--this is the coolest one that I've seen so far.
42

43
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.600
There's basically a portal where you can look into another world and even step into another world.
43

44
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.430
And it's absolutely incredible.
44

45
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.620
And I think there's going to be loads more really, really awesome applications, especially once iOS 11
45

46
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.560
comes out of beta and everybody starts making a crazy amount of cool things for ARKit,
46

47
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.630
and maybe some of those really cool things that will be the things that you make.
47

48
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.880
So if you do, please do let me know about it and I would love to give it a spin and also shout about
48

49
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.510
it to the world.
49

50
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.760
So how exactly does ARKit work?
50

51
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.040
Well, it's basically a way of implementing augmented reality. And it's pretty similar to the other frameworks
51

52
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.750
that implement augmented reality.
52

53
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.730
So in one of the modules in this course, we actually teach you about euphoria which is currently one
53

54
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.470
of the most popular frameworks for implementing augmented reality, especially when you're working with
54

55
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.070
Unity.
55

56
00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.280
So Apple's ARKit works in a similar way, in the sense that allows you to create and track the correspondence
56

57
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.730
between the real-world space, 3D space, and the virtual space that you create where you can model visual
57

58
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.970
content. And when your app displays that virtual content together with a live camera image, then the user
58

59
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.380
basically experiences what's called augmented reality, right,
59

60
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.390
which is simply just an illusion that your virtual content is a part of the real world.
60

61
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.340
And this brings us to a really, really important point. For your ARKit apps to work with this world tracking,
61

62
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.630
you need to have certain hardware, and more specifically, that hardware is the A9 chip or above,
62

63
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.360
so A9 or A10 chips.
63

64
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.210
So in terms of devices, that basically means anything that was released after the iPhone 6, including
64

65
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.180
the iPhone SE, 6s, 6s Plus, et cetera, and you can read down the list. It doesn't mean that if you have
65

66
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.690
an iPhone 6 that the app won't run. It usually means that it won't have world tracking enabled.
66

67
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.440
What does that mean?
67

68
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.760
So,
68

69
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.410
well, tracking is where your virtual object is placed in 3D space.
69

70
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.350
So if you move towards it with your iPad, it will get bigger.
70

71
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.520
And if you move away, it will get smaller and you can also look all around it.
71

72
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.460
If you didn't have world tracking, then it would still be floating in mid-air, but it just won't correspond
72

73
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.660
to a real 3D space.
73

74
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.100
So if you move around, it will move with you. And I'll demo some of that once we start creating our app.
74

75
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.910
But, basically, to fully take advantage of ARKit and to actually have fun with it, Apple is, obviously,
75

76
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.050
pushing for their latest models.
76

77
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.960
And even when you do have the A9 and A10, you should be aware that running an app where the arcade
77

78
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.440
is pretty battery intensive, especially as I'm creating a lot of these tutorials in iOS11 beta, it
78

79
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.750
sucks up the battery like there's no tomorrow. But I'm sure, in future betas of iOS 11
79

80
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.120
and also wheniOS 11 is officially released,
80

81
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.880
then you won't have as many problems. But I expect that any app running ARKit is going to use up quite
81

82
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.630
a bit of battery.
82

83
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.370
Those are just some things to be aware of. If you don't have one of these devices, then I would recommend
83

84
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.690
just to watch the videos and see if this is something that you're interested in developing.
84

85
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.660
You can still code along and learn the programming and the theory behind it.
85

86
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.090
So at the App Brewery, we're investing pretty heavily in creating teaching resources for ARKit.
86

87
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.820
And the reason is because we think it's going to be huge.
87

88
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:24.360
A good analogy for this is when the Oculus Rift came out for virtual reality, everybody was really excited,
88

89
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.600
it was really, really impressive the first time that you put on a virtual reality headset,
89

90
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.160
but the hardware was pretty expensive.
90

91
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.640
I really thought that this was going to be a piece of tech that was going to be really, really out of
91

92
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.280
reach.
92

93
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.050
And then, Google came along with their Google Cardboard,
93

94
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.830
I mean, they could have made it with plastic.
94

95
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.870
They could have made it with something relatively cheap, but they decide to go for cardboard, basically,
95

96
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.000
just to stress the fact that, you know, virtual reality isn't anything fancy, and you can use a piece of
96

97
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.040
cardboard and leverage the existing tech in the smartphone that's in your pocket to create a virtual
97

98
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.840
reality experience.
98

99
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.560
And I think for augmented reality, Apple's ARKit is going to do something really similar.
99

100
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.030
So Magic Leap's tech is completely hush-hush.
100

101
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.230
Nobody knows what it'll look like,
101

102
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.110
in fact, it might look something out of a sci-fi movie like helmet or something, or might look more refined.
102

103
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.490
This is actually one of their patent drawings. But who the hell knows?
103

104
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.230
We'll just have to wait and see.
104

105
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.490
But a better comparison is probably with the Microsoft HoloLens.
105

106
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.620
So this is Microsoft's hardware offering for augmented reality.
106

107
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.950
And I mean, it's not horrendously expensive, but it's still extra tech that you're buying at which parts
107

108
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.680
of already exist in your smartphone.
108

109
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.480
So why stuff your house with loads of hardware when you can reuse some of the technology that you already
109

110
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.810
own.
110

111
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:44.290
So compared with going out there and buying a whole suite of tech in order to experience augmented reality
111

112
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.990
by having it on your phone inside 2- or 3-dollar apps on the App Store is going to make augmented
112

113
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.360
reality, so much more approachable for the masses.
113

114
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.120
And I think will lead to much greater adoption and interest from the public.
114

115
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.610
So I think ARKit is going to be huge.
115

116
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.820
So without further ado, let's start making our own augmented reality apps using ARKit.
