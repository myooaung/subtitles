Hey.
1

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,750
Well done for completing yet another module.
2

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,260
You're really putting a lot of these belts on,
3

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:14,310
you know, like at the very beginning you were like a white belt when you first completed your first module,
4

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,520
when you built the first things, when you built your first app, and now you're kind of getting on like
5

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,460
towards the blue purplish sort of belts now.
6

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,130
So I wanted to talk about.
7

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,850
So I want to talk about another sort of thing that helps with habit building.
8

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,890
And it's this idea of creating a cue for your habit.
9

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,750
So if your habit it is say, that you wanted to create.
10

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,700
So if the habit that you wanted to create was say, I don't know, do 50 press ups every day, or go to the gym
11

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:59,970
every day, or in our case learning to code every day, then it really helps when you have a cue that you
12

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,260
tag your habit onto.
13

14
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,690
So what do I mean by that?
14

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,740
Let's say that you already have a habit, right?
15

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,390
You probably have loads of them.
16

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,090
For me it could be, like, brushing my teeth in the mornings.
17

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:21,840
So when I've tagged on this new habit I'm trying to form, like at the end of my existing habit,
18

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,290
it makes it that much easier to do that thing that I want to do.
19

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,140
So for example I had a habit that I was trying to form which is to meditate for 20 minutes every morning
20

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,340
and I never really managed to get around to doing it.
21

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,680
There was always something in the way, until I started saying, you know what,
22

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,760
every single time, every morning after I brush my teeth, I am just going to go and sit down and meditate
23

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,440
for 20 minutes.
24

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,390
Nothing else.
25

26
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,080
And once I started doing that it was like as if brushing my teeth was now this trigger or this cue for
26

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,930
this other habit and because already I brush my teeth every day,
27

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:13,860
I hope you do too, then that habit kind of like just allows the next habit to build a little bit easier.
28

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,220
So try this out.
29

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,460
See if you already have a habit and then try to do just half an hour of coding or an hour of coding
30

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,820
afterwards and see if that helps you get into the groove a little bit easier.
31

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,860
And let me know your results.
32

33
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,450
But most importantly you've heard me say it.
33

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,720
You can hear me say it again.
34

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,700
Keep going, keep going.
35

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,860
I'm here for you cheering you on and I think you're great.
36

37
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,240
I think you're doing fantastic.
37

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,650
So keep going.
