So
1

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.570
one final tip regarding Facebook paid adverts is that when you create your app, you can put the Facebook
2

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.110
SDK which is a library from Facebook into your app. And you can set it up such that every single time
3

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.580
somebody downloads your app, Facebook will register which of their users have downloaded your app.
4

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.730
And then when you go into the Facebook Advertising Manager, It gives you the option of serving your ads
5

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.730
up to a lookalike audience to the ones who have already downloaded your app.
6

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.070
So there'll be people who are similar in terms of demographics, so gender or age or whatever are the
7

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.230
features that Facebook has identified.
8

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.200
And it basically finds a lookalike audience who have a much higher rate downloading and installing your
9

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.410
app because it's modeled on people who have already downloaded your app.

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.080
So check out Facebook lookalike audiences once you decide to go down the Facebook ad route.
