00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.560
Now it's very rare to see a design that only contains one color in its color palette.
1

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.220
Now of course there's predominant colors and subsidiary colors. But very often when you're designing
2

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.990
anything either for print or for digital, you're going to need to combine different colors. And there's
3

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.690
different ways that you can go about doing this to make your designs convey different messages.
4

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.000
So let's look at some of the ways in which we can use the science of color theory to combine different
5

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.370
colors for your designs.
6

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.360
So here we've got a color wheel.
7

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.060
Most of you will have seen it from-- most of us have seen it from art classes.
8

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.860
And essentially the rainbow wrapped around itself. And the color wheel is an incredibly useful tool not
9

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.110
just for artists but also for designers.
10

11
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.520
So let's look at one of the ways in which you would combine different colors.
11

12
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.800
So for example if I wanted to pick an orange color to have in my design, how would I combine it with
12

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.350
a different color to complete my design?
13

14
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.050
Well one of the simplest color palettes is going for what's called an analogous color or an adjacent
14

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.530
color.
15

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.360
This is where when you take one color on the color wheel and combine it with the color that's immediately
16

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.410
next to it or adjacent to it and you get an analogous color palette.
17

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.210
Now analogous color palettes create designs that are incredibly harmonious and easy to look at.
18

19
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.130
So this is something to think about when you're designing app background screens or the main interface
19

20
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.270
of your app.
20

21
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.210
Because unlike that color yellow that we stared at earlier on, it's not so demanding on your attention
21

22
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.430
and it's pleasant to look at for a long time which is what you're hoping for when you make an app because
22

23
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.960
you want them to stay within the app as long as possible.
23

24
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.350
So the opposite of analogous colors is when you take one color on the color wheel and match it with
24

25
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.320
it with the color that's directly opposite to it.
25

26
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.660
And this is called complementary colors.
26

27
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.430
Now complementary color palettes produce extremely clashy designs that stand out, that grab your attention
27

28
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.080
and can be good for logo design or attention grabbing screen shots but they don't make very good color
28

29
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.100
palettes for your main interface.
29

30
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.440
You don't want to be staring at clashing colors all the time.
30

31
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.770
So how can you tone down the flashiness of complementary colors?
31

32
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.220
Well you can take one color on the color wheel for example red,
32

33
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.950
and instead of going for its direct opposite in which case it would be green here,
33

34
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.020
you can split that color into its analogous colors namely a sort of limy yellow and a light blue.
34

35
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.970
Now by having a three color palette like this, you end up with designs that are still attention grabbing
35

36
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.990
but are less classy and easier to look at.
36

37
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.210
And I'm a huge fan of using split colors for app icon design because you're going to keep it very simple
37

38
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.690
and it's going to be mostly shapes and colors and split colors allow that app icon to stand out in the
38

39
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.600
app store without being incredibly clashy.
39

40
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.750
Now what if you want to take that concept even further?
40

41
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.500
Well you can pick one color on the color wheel and draw an equilateral triangle that links up to other
41

42
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.060
colors.
42

43
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.640
And what you end up creating is a triadic color palette. Now triadic colors tend to be quite well balanced
43

44
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.670
and yet still attention grabbing.
44

45
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.030
But the important thing about triadic colors is that they were pretty much over used during the 90s
45

46
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.110
in traditional print design and advertising design.
46

47
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.280
So a lot of the color palettes look very 90s
47

48
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.110
and when you look at these two designs here they look very much like fast food chains from the 90s.
48

49
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.890
So it's a color palette that feels a little bit dated.
49

50
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.360
Now what's very modern at the moment and very in vogue is the idea of monochromatic colors.
50

51
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.850
So taking the same color and combining it with either various amounts of white or various amounts of
51

52
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.800
black to create different tones and shades that stand out from each other.
52

53
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.620
Now of course you can mix in as much white or as much black as you like in order to provide as much contrast
53

54
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.760
as you need.
54

55
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.740
And these color palettes tend to be incredibly contemporary and work really well for modern digital
55

56
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.260
design.
