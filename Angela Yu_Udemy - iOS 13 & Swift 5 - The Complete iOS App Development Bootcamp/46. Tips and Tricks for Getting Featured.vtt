00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.470
Now another thing that applies to both app stores is localization. And this basically means having the core
1

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.910
text of your app or any of the screenshots basically any sort of text that appears in your app translated
2

3
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.250
to some of the native languages of the biggest app stores.
3

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.180
And these 12 languages represent the top 12 app stores.
4

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.330
Now I understand how this can seem really intimidating you know thinking about getting your app translated
5

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.310
into so many languages and you might worry about the potential costs.
6

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.800
So if you're at a stretch I would say the bare minimum that app stores look for is Chinese, Japanese
7

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.090
German, French, Spanish and Italian.
8

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.890
And these represent some of their biggest performing stores.
9

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.990
Basically if they can push a product across the world then you increase your chance of getting featured.
10

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.970
The next thing that is really important both on Android and iOS is design.
11

12
00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.600
If you think that your app is worthy of getting featured if you think it is a really serious contender,
12

13
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.530
then I would say consider bringing on a UX designer bringing on a UI designer, somebody that can make your
13

14
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.520
app look and feel amazing especially on the Apple App Store.
14

15
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.890
Design is so important to that company that something that looks terrible even if it works like a dream,
15

16
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.410
if it looks terrible they don't want to destroy the beautiful AppStore that they've created.
16

17
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.650
The next point to remember is that if you are an app that has generated so much buzz around your launch
17

18
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.530
that you can't be ignored by these big app stores, then you will be featured.
18

19
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.290
So think about apps like Fitmen cook where none of the where none of the team approached either Apple
19

20
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.860
or Google for a feature.
20

21
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.450
But just because of how much buzz there was generated around it on social media or in real life, these
21

22
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.810
app stores can't shy away from featuring something that's popular. So generating buzz or generating downloads
22

23
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.180
comes before any of these techniques.
23

24
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.250
The last thing I want to talk about is while a lot of these techniques work, it doesn't replace that
24

25
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.420
human contact.
25

26
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.790
So if you think that you've made something great something beautiful something really worthy of the
26

27
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.180
App Store, then don't be afraid of just pitching
27

28
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.390
one of the App Store managers directly.
28

29
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.490
Now I'm not going to give away anyone's email or contact details, but they're surprisingly easy to get.
29

30
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.680
And one of the easiest ways is just by turning up to Google IO or going to WWDC.
30

31
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.030
There's a lot of App Store managers that float around there.
31

32
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.330
And if you meet the right people and interest the right people then it's well worth pitching one of
32

33
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.640
these contacts.
33

34
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.370
So a funny story from a friend of mine Rich Pleece who founded an app called Suppe is that he was casually
34

35
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.460
tindering, looking for a date and and happened to end up having drinks with a lady who worked at Apple.
35

36
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.080
And even though I think romantically it never worked out,
36

37
00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.510
but since then he's managed to get about three features on the Apple App Store just by hitting up his
37

38
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.800
Apple buddy.
38

39
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.900
So real life connections do matter.
39

40
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.160
It's going to be more effective than anything else.
