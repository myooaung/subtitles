00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,580
So let's first start by talking about the difference between the two biggest families in typography
1

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,100
which is the serif and the san serif.
2

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,210
So the serif typeface are differentiated from the san serif by these tiny little feet that you can see
3

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,710
highlighted in red and they are said to be slightly older than the san serifs.
4

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,710
But the reason why they have these little feet is actually because of stone carving.
5

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,510
So back in the days when people needed to carve out letters, Latin letters, in stone,
6

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,800
usually the designer would use a paint brush and paint the letters that they want
7

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,170
but the stonemasons would have to carve it out from that painting.
8

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,320
And I don't know how many of you guys have carved into stone before but not only is a difficult art
9

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,480
to master but it's also incredibly difficult to carve out Latin letters, Latin typefaces, on stone without
10

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,090
creating these tiny little feet.
11

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:59,910
It's just very difficult to carve out a 90 degree angle without having these reliefs. So hence a lot
12

13
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,620
of the serif typefaces that you'll see will look a lot more traditional a lot more conservative than
13

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,180
the more contemporary modern san serifs.
14

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,070
And when you're using different typefaces, usually people tend to use the serif typefaces for something
15

16
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,840
quite serious
16

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,960
for example a law office's letterhead and the san serifs are reserved for slightly more modern contemporary
17

18
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,620
design.
18

19
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,100
So once we've classified our typeface into serifs and the san serifs, the serifs are further subdivided
19

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,120
into four major families.
20

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,380
The first of which is old style.
21

22
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,650
So this is very much the oldest serif typeface family.
22

23
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,670
So this family includes fun such as Adobe Jenson such as Centaurs such as Goudy old style. And their
23

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,780
typeface is modeled on what text used to look like in The 1400s,
24

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,190
so very conservative very old looking.
25

26
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,540
And if you come further into the future you've got the transitional serif family which is slightly
26

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,730
more modern looking.
27

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,880
And a lot of these fonts you'll be familiar with this is your Times New Roman,
28

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,240
this is your Baskerville,
29

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,380
this is your Georgia for example.
30

31
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:14,000
And then if we come even further into modern times, you've got the modern serif typeface family.
31

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,190
So one such example is Didot which is the typeface that you see on the title of Vogue magazine and
32

33
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,880
it's an incredibly modern yet classy looking typeface.
33

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,050
And finally in the serif family you've got the slab serif
34

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,450
and we'll talk about slab serifs in just a second.
35

36
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,350
But first we're going to talk about how do you differentiate from these four major classes in the serif
36

37
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,190
family?
37

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,070
And it's actually quite easy to do.
38

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,990
Now when you compare these three styles side by side, old style versus transitional versus modern, if
39

40
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,990
you have a look at the thinnest versus the thickest part of the letters, you'll see that as you progress
40

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,830
from the older to the more modern type faces you'll see an increased difference in what we call the
41

42
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,260
modulation of the typeface.
42

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,050
So if you concentrate on the os for example comparing the old style to the modern, that thickness here
43

44
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,160
versus this is much larger than for example this versus this part. And a lot of this modulation comes
44

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,340
from the people who used to write with flat nibbed pens.
45

46
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,810
So for example imagine you know somebody in the Shakespearean era with their feathered pen, the way that
46

47
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,040
they turn that feather into a pen is by chopping the tip.
47

48
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:28,620
So you create a flat nib and then it holds the ink and allows you to write. Now that flat nib is
48

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,860
what gives you this modulation,
49

50
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,510
this difference between the thickest and thinnest parts of the font. Equally if you take a highlighter and
50

51
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,580
you try to write versus if you take a sharpie, you'll notice that the typeface that you create will look
51

52
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,390
different.
52

53
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,640
So what about the slab serif? As you can see, there's pretty much zero difference between the thickest
53

54
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,510
and the thinnest parts of the font.
54

55
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:56,040
And it was designed intentionally like so. Even though it's one of the modern members in the serif family,
55

56
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,960
it doesn't follow the rule of the more into the future you go the higher the greater the difference
56

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,770
between the thickest and the thinnest part of the font.
57

58
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,890
So why is that?
58

59
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,180
Well slab serif was actually created for a particular reason and it was created for Newspaper printing.
59

60
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,520
Now think about the times when Newspaper used to be printed on really poor quality paper.
60

61
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,820
What happens when you put ink on poor quality paper?
61

62
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,840
Well the ink will spread out and you will lose a lot of detail.
62

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,210
So if you think back to those comic books to be hand-lettered, the typeface that's used is a type of
63

64
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,330
comic book typeface but it looks very similar to this kind of slab serif.
64

65
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,780
And the reason why we style it like this is so that it would look good despite the poor quality of the
65

66
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,380
paper.
