So when Instagram was first built by its founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger by the way they were
1

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,290
both learning how to code in their free time when they built Instagram.
2

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,840
So for those of you guys who are learning iOS or Android app development with us keep that in mind you
3

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,040
might be making the next Instagram.
4

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:24,570
So anyways, so the first product that they came up with was called Bourbon and the idea was for users
5

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,750
to be able to share their location information.
6

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,190
Now when they launched they had a few users and there were people who were interested in using it.
7

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,980
This is maybe in the thousands.
8

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,620
But after a while the growth wasn't massive.
9

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,950
So at one point they had to look at what exactly were people using this Bourbon app for and they found,
10

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,880
by talking to some of the users, that a lot of people were actually using it as a photo sharing app. Just
11

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,950
to share the image that they took at a particular location.
12

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,850
And all of that location data sharing very much non-important.
13

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,580
People wanted to be able to show off their photographs.
14

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,320
So the thing that you think that your app might be about might not be the thing that uses value.
15

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,660
So you have to know who your users are and what they want to achieve using your app. And the best way
16

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,470
to do this is by profiling your users.
17

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,480
So the easiest way to go about this is a thinking exercise.
18

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,590
So keep your app in mind and then think about out of all of your friends,
19

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:35,340
who is this app perfect for. For David who's really geeky still painting Warhammer on the weekends.
20

21
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,120
Or is it for Jane who's you know really into her photography and she's like really artsy always takes
21

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,440
pictures of latte's.
22

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,970
So think about this person and build a personality into your app by tailoring around your user profiles.
23

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,790
So you can go as crazy imaginative as you want
24

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,700
but the important thing is to be granular.
25

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:04,030
Don't just say you know "I'm building an app for men between the age of 20 and 40." That's too broad.
26

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,920
That's like everybody. Think about making one particular person fall in love with your app and you'll
27

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,850
get pretty far.
28

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,210
All right.
29

30
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:19,170
So the main point is think about what is the core functionality of your app and profile your users to
30

31
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,960
continually re-evaluate that question.
31

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:29,280
Am I making it as easy as possible for my users to achieve a core task within my app?
