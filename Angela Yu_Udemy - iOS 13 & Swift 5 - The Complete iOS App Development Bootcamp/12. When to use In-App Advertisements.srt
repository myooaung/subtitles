00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,020
Now the other big monetization strategy is of course through in-app advertisement.
1

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:15,150
And this is becoming more and more predominant in the monetization strategies of apps. As more and more
2

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,630
big companies are producing free apps which have great content and great usability
3

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,370
users are expecting free apps.
4

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,880
You can't really just make a great app and give it away.
5

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,660
So instead you have ads. And this is an app that was believe it or not made by Apple in the early days
6

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:44,680
of iAds which is their ad distribution system. And it's hilarious because all it does is it allows you to
7

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,220
scroll through all the ads that they're serving across the App Store.
8

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:56,580
And you can even like some of these ads and save them or search for them and look at the new ads.
9

10
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,970
Now of course this app was pulled very quickly because of how ridiculous it was and all those people
10

11
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,850
who say that Apple always makes great apps then this is a glaring counter-example.
11

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,630
But essentially this illustrates one of the type of ads that we're all very familiar with which is banner
12

13
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,420
ads and you'll see them at the bottom of the screen or at the top of the screen.
13

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,430
And the problem with banner ads is that we are virtually blind to them.
14

15
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,570
I can't remember the last time that I clicked on a banner ad,
15

16
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,670
not by accident.
16

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,680
And that's a great point actually. A lot of developers are being very cheeky and placing very very small
17

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,900
buttons right next to their banner ads in order to force users to accidentally click on them.
18

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,590
Now of course this tends to lead to a lot of user animosity which is reflected in the ratings or reviews
19

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,370
which means that you'll probably reduce the number of users you'll have.
20

21
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,190
So it's a bit of a balance and you have to think about how willing you are to annoy your users versus
21

22
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,640
how much revenue you want to get from advertisement.
22

23
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,980
Now with these kind of in app advertisements they usually managed by a distribution companies such as AdMob
23

24
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,050
or previously iAd which has been discontinued by Apple and they're the ones who are responsible for
24

25
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,300
serving up these ads in your app.
25

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,450
Now you can tell them the specifics of your app.
26

27
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,820
So for example if you have a cooking app that's aimed at people who are middle aged or if you have a
27

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,760
children's app and they will respect the age restrictions to advertisements.
28

29
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,970
So say if you have a children's app, they won't show adult content in the adverts but anything beyond
29

30
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,980
that it really is their prerogative
30

31
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,740
as to how related to your niche as to the kind of ads that they serve.
31

32
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,540
So just because you have a cooking app it doesn't mean that they won't show some advert about sports.
32

33
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,420
I think a lot of the advertising companies are getting a little bit better at tailoring the ads for
33

34
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,460
the audience.
34

35
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,390
But we're still seeing quite a lot of variability and most the time you're just going to get the big
35

36
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,750
budget advertisers like Clash of Clans.
36

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,250
So this is another reason why I don't like ads and traditionally I've not been a big fan of putting
37

38
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,000
in app ads into my iOS apps. And that's because if you've been on the design course if you've heard us talk
38

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,240
about you know how much thought goes into designing the apps and making the user experience delightful
39

40
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,870
then all of a sudden you know a fifth of the screen is taken up by clash of clans or mobile strike.
40

41
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,480
And it just hurts a little inside you know just to see how all of your beautiful designs get ruined
41

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,140
like that.
42

43
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,520
But as I say more and more so, it is becoming a necessity.
43

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,730
So let's look at some of the other options for advertisement. If not banner ads
44

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,340
then what?
45

46
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,270
Well one of the best performing ways of putting on advertisements especially in game advertisements
46

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,530
is what's called interstitial ads. And these ads take up the entire screen and prevent you from doing
47

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,740
any other action or interacting with the app for say five seconds.
48

49
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,890
You have like a five second countdown here before the cross shows up and you can dismiss them.
49

50
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,060
We've all seen those.
50

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,130
And the performance of these interstitial ads are as expected better than banner ads because they essentially
51

52
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,660
force you to look at it.
52

53
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,450
Now of course this can be a point of contention.
53

54
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,580
People do get annoyed by them.
54

55
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:18,300
But the key is the time point at which you serve interstitials that you have to really note. And of course
55

56
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,900
you being the app developer or you having contact with the app developer you can determine when these
56

57
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,420
interstitials will show.
57

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,430
And the ideal time is a point where the user is in a good mood. Just as you know when I was young and
58

59
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,250
I knew that in order to get a favorable answer from my parents I would have to ask that question at
59

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
a good time point,
60

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,110
this is essentially the same concept. If you present your user with an advertisement at a point where
61

62
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:52,300
they're pretty chuffed with themselves then you're far more likely to get click through and hence revenue.
62

63
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,800
So what are those time points? If you're a game that means for example beating a particularly hard level
63

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,730
or beating up hard boss and if you're an app that means when the user has completed a task within your
64

65
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:13,540
app. So don't interrupt somebody's flow by serving an ad while they're in the middle of something. That
65

66
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,370
never achieves good results.
66

67
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,200
Instead show those ads when they're at a point where they've completed something and they feel good
67

68
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,370
about themselves and you'll usually see that reflected in your revenue.
68

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,200
Now the type of ad that I'm even more fond of than interstitials is actually what's called in-content ads.
69

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,180
So advertisements that don't really look like advertisements so they have the same font the same typeface
70

71
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,810
same color scheme as the rest of your content and is essentially mixed in in there.
71

72
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,430
The thing with this is that you do have to declare to the user that these are adverts but it has far
72

73
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,230
higher conversion rates than either interstitials or banners and especially if you can advertise your
73

74
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,380
other apps you can start to distribute and cross-promote your various apps and it usually works quite
74

75
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,780
well.
75

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,890
So have a think about whether advertising is suitable for your particular app. So if it's a app that
76

77
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:09,580
has high repeat usage something that people use on a daily basis or something that people will spend
77

78
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,400
quite a bit of time in, then you have more chance of getting revenue from impressions of the ads or
78

79
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,330
clicks on the ads.
79

80
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,730
So this tends to apply to games or productivity apps etc. like that. And then think about which format
80

81
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,250
is best suited for your app and what is the best time point to present those ads.
