00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.020
Now in the last lesson, we got an overview of how apps work on the phone.
1

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.970
So in this lesson I want to take you one step further and look at how apps are made from beginning to
2

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.510
end.
3

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.070
Now one of my favourite shows of all time that you get on Discovery is a show called "How Its Made" and
4

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.550
it basically takes you into the factory and shows you how a bunch of random things get built on the
5

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.460
factory floor.
6

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.600
Things that just steel bicycles or floors or drum crushers or skateboard wheels and I just find it so
7

8
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.940
fascinating seeing how all of these everyday objects get made and built.
8

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.580
So if you're curious have a look at some of the episodes and there's some real gems in there like how
9

10
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.030
rubber gloves are made.
10

11
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.190
And it shows you every step of the factory process from dipping it in latex to drying it and rolling
11

12
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.540
it.
12

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.950
And I don't know why but I find it so interesting.
13

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.620
The process that's involved in creating all of these everyday objects.
14

15
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.610
So that's what I want to do here.
15

16
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.140
I want to do a special episode inspired by the show on how it's made: "The App Episode".
16

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.100
So the app industry is absolutely massive.
17

18
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.310
Last year Apple reported it paid app developers 26.5 billion U.S. dollars and that number
18

19
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.620
grew by 30% year on year.
19

20
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.990
So it's a massive industry and it keeps on getting bigger.
20

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.080
Now of course some of that money goes to big companies such as Clash of Clans or Clash Royale or some
21

22
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.390
other form of clashing.
22

23
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.850
But there are also a lot of stories of independent, one-man developers who have made it big on the App
23

24
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.050
Store. And one of the best examples is the 7 minute workout app.
24

25
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.610
Now in the course resource list, I linked to the article that's written by the maker of the 7 minute
25

26
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.380
workout app a guy called Stuart Hall and by himself he built an app that got 2.3 million
26

27
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.290
downloads without spending a cent on marketing which generated him over 70,000 U.S. dollars in profits
27

28
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.870
and was acquired and sold to a company just after 18 months.
28

29
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.680
It's a really fascinating read but he goes through the entire process of how he built this app from
29

30
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.210
idea to app store all by himself with no budget just the skills and know-how of how to build an app
30

31
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.170
and the grit and perseverance of an entrepreneur.
31

32
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.830
So I know that you're taking this course for various reasons.
32

33
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.360
Some people want to get a job as a developer.
33

34
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.820
Others just want to gain a new skill and make apps for fun and other people want to build a business
34

35
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.220
based on an app.
35

36
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.290
But before we get started and really dig into learning and building our apps I think it's really important
36

37
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.010
to first have an overview of the entire process from beginning to end of how an app is built.
37

38
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.980
So step 0 before you do anything else is why ask yourself why do I need an app.
38

39
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.440
And in many cases you actually don't.
39

40
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.370
If you just want to build an app that simply displays data or information say the opening hours of your
40

41
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.030
shop or the services that your business offers then you don't actually need an app you can simply build
41

42
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.670
a website that looks good on mobile and that will take far less time to build.
42

43
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.440
And it's much easier to do.
43

44
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.560
But however if you need to tap into the sensors of the phone or if you want to be able to push notifications
44

45
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.790
to the user, then you probably do need an app.
45

46
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.840
But just make sure that you're on the right path before you even begin.
46

47
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.200
Now once you're sure that you want to build an app then the next step is the idea stage not just coming
47

48
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.970
up with an idea which is the easy part but validating whether if the idea is actually a good one.
48

49
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.890
So let's say that I'm bored of swiping on Tinder for my next match and instead I want to find my perfect
49

50
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.400
match in the form of a Sunday roast.
50

51
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.210
So what if I have an idea for an app that's called Tender and it's going to match me with the dish that
51

52
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.430
I fancy the most right now.
52

53
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.270
And it could be a delivery app such as Uber Eats or Deliveroo where I get that meal made and sent to
53

54
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.720
me.
54

55
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.400
Or it could be just a recipe app where I try to find the thing I want to make today.
55

56
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.200
So here's an app idea.
56

57
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.190
But how do I know if it's actually a good one.
57

58
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.180
Well that's when you would need to validate the idea.
58

59
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.070
Talk to lots of people and get a diverse range of opinions.
59

60
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.420
Make a minimum viable product that doesn't require any technology at all to test and see if people are
60

61
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.350
actually interested or a landing page describing your idea and promote it on social media and see if people
61

62
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.460
actually want it.
62

63
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.860
And essentially what you're trying to establish is: once this app gets made, will people actually want
63

64
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.660
to download it and use it?
64

65
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.120
Now once you figure that out, then you're ready to move on to step two which is designing the app.
65

66
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.680
And in this app development bootcamp course that you're enrolled on, I've included full modules on app
66

67
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.370
design.
67

68
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.300
So you'll learn how to build wire frames how to build prototypes for your app and learn how to use all
68

69
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.320
the tools and the design principles to make not just a functional app but a beautiful app that people
69

70
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.050
will love.
70

71
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.820
And then you can move on to step three which is the actual development the programming of the app.
71

72
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.770
And that is going to take up most of our time in this bootcamp.
72

73
00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.720
We're going to be building over 25 apps and through the process of building these apps.
73

74
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.540
We're going to be learning all of the fundamentals of iOS development and the Swift programming language
74

75
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.360
so that you become a well-rounded developer and you'll be able to tackle new problems that you haven't
75

76
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.090
seen before or build custom features,
76

77
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.680
once you've completed the course.
77

78
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.670
So let's take our Tender app and let's say we've written all the code for all the functionality of the
78

79
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.640
app and we've developed and built it.
79

80
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.700
Then the next step is to test the app. And I'm going to tell you about automated as well as manual ways
80

81
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:41.130
of testing your app so that it looks and works well on all devices so that people all around the world
81

82
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.780
no matter which phone device they have will be have to enjoy using your app so that you can get those
82

83
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.490
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ star reviews that are crucial for your app to get more downloads.
83

84
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.260
Now step five: We're ready to publish it onto the App Store.
84

85
00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.450
And I'll tell you all of the ways that you can get press for your app launch and also what are the rules
85

86
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.600
behind getting your app featured on the App Store.
86

87
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.430
Now that you've made and published your app the next step is to tell people about it.
87

88
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.910
So in this boot camp there's a full course on app marketing as well where I show you all of the ways
88

89
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:21.690
that you can get your first customers get your loyal fans and start getting those downloads and making
89

90
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.640
revenue off the app store.
90

91
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:31.440
Now finally step seven as with all great things you need continuous feedback and continuous improvement.
91

92
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.530
So when your app is alive on the App Store you'll start getting reviews of people who want to request
92

93
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:44.460
other features or they have suggestions and you can take some of those on board and update and refresh
93

94
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.490
your app and continuously improve your user's experience.
94

95
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:56.910
So that's a very quick and broad overview of how apps are made from beginning to end.
95

96
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:03.240
Now if you scroll to the very bottom of the curriculum you'll find that I've included a full length
96

97
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.630
version of this lesson and it's a talk that I give often at conferences, hackathon, and various events.
97

98
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:15.730
And it goes into far more detail on every one of those steps that I've talked about in this lesson.
98

99
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:21.900
So if you're interested getting more details on each of the steps and seeing each of the steps fleshed
99

100
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.870
out, then head over there and take a look at that talk.
100

101
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.900
And then once you're done continue back where you left off in the curriculum track and we're going to
101

102
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.810
get started building our very first app.
