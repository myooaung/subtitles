Now one final point to think about when you are going to go for paid advertising. And the idea is that
1

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.540
you're going to pay for adverts and Apple is still taking 30 percent cut of whatever it is that you
2

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.640
make on the App Store.
3

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.780
Now here's one weird trick where you can claw back more money from Apple. And this is by joining the
4

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.330
iTunes affiliate program. And the idea is that if you are going to pay for adverts that direct people
5

6
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.420
towards iTunes to download your app, you can earn a commission for that purchase.
6

7
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.120
So as an iTunes affiliate, you'll get 7 percent of the revenue that Apple makes on that app downloads.
7

8
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.480
So that basically means that you can actually claw back some of that 30 percent that you're paying Apple
8

9
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.430
by using your iTunes affiliate account.
9

10
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.020
Now the other thing that's really cool about the affiliate program is that you'll commission applies
10

11
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.450
to a full 24 hours.
11

12
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:05.890
So say if I share an iTunes affiliate link with Bob and Bob goes on to iTunes and sees my app but doesn't
12

13
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.110
want to download it.
13

14
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.850
Instead he goes and downloads Clash of Clans and starts paying Clash of Clans a lot of money.
14

15
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.180
As long as that happened within 24 hours of clicking on my affiliate link, then I still earn commission
15

16
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.870
on that purchase or whatever purchases he makes.
16

17
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.260
So it's well worth signing up too.
17

18
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.390
Now unfortunately for the Google Play store even though they've said that they are planning for something
18

19
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.720
similar to this, it has yet to materialize.
19

20
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.470
So unfortunately this is only a solution for the Apple App Store.
