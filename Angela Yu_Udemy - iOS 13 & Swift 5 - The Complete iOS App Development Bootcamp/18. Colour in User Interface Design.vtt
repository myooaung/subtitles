00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.520
Now we've talked a lot about some of the fundamental rules of user interface design and things that
1

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.200
you should keep in mind when you're creating a UI designs.
2

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.560
But where exactly do you stop when you know nothing about design?
3

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.920
How do you create these beautiful designs?
4

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.820
Well we actually have a whole module dedicated to taking you through from use a floor mapping to wire
5

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.250
framing to mockups to prototyping and that will take you through the journey of a digital designer.
6

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.800
But one of the most important things to keep in mind not just when you're approaching design but also
7

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.890
when you're approaching development or coding or starting a business or anything is to keep it as simple
8

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010
as you can to start with.
9

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.080
So when you're creating your website or your app, start with the design that is completely monochrome
10

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.270
just black and white or hints of gray.
11

12
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.050
That way you can focus on the layout,
12

13
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.370
you can focus on the alignment, you can focus on making things look good where they are without being
13

14
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.990
distracted by colors or images or any of the fancy stuff.
14

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.690
So start in monochrome and give it a single shot of color like UBER does to highlight the key things
15

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.240
that you want to
16

17
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.880
draw people's attention to.
17

18
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.390
Now remember if everything is black and white even a hint of color will stand out in a big way. And then
18

19
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.570
maybe add two colors or three and go up from there.
19

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.390
Don't start with complexity and tone it down.
20

21
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.620
Always start with the simplest thing possible and then go upwards.
21

22
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.990
There's a really great website called Dribbble which is where digital designers showcase some of their
22

23
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.330
best work in their portfolios and is also a great place where you can find design talent for your next
23

24
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.450
project or get inspiration about how you can approach your next design project. And it has one really
24

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.410
well hidden search capability and that's the ability to search by color.
25

26
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.980
So the link to the search functionality is in the text below this video.
26

27
00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:00.060
And what you can do here is you can enter a particular hex code of a color and look at how professional
27

28
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.530
designers are using that color or combining it with other colors to make their designs come to life.
28

29
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.570
So the idea is that once you've designed your app in monochrome then you're thinking about coloring
29

30
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.900
it up
30

31
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.020
so have a look over there and see if you can be inspired.
