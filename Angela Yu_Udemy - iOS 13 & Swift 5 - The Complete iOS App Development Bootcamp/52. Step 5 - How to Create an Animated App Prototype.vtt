00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.770
So how did your mockup process go?
1

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.790
Now the question is what to do once you've created all of these beautiful high fidelity photorealistic
2

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.470
mockups?
3

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.180
What's the next stage that you should take your designs to?
4

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.550
Well the next stage of the workflow of a digital designer is turning those mockups into what are called
5

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.040
prototypes. Now prototypes are essentially animated versions of all of those designs.
6

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.220
So it'll show how your app would look and work and animate in real life.
7

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.360
It's almost like you have the app in your hand and you're using it.
8

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610
Now none of this involves any code.
9

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.360
It's all just through design work. And I'm going to show you some of the tools that are most commonly
10

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.120
used to create these prototypes.
11

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.990
Now one of my favorite tools is Marvel.
12

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.420
I spoke about it briefly before in terms of how you can use it to create mockups. But in this context
13

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.850
I'm going to show you how you can use Marvel to create prototypes that you can download onto your phone
14

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.320
and you can start showing people a working prototype.
15

16
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.450
Now Marvel's biggest competitor is invision and it's equally nice to use equally intuitive. And they
16

17
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.290
can both pretty much do the same things and they both have quite a comfortable free tier for you to
17

18
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.320
start getting your feet wet and get used to using these tools.
18

19
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.210
Now there's another tool that I quite like Principle.
19

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.750
Now this is again a Mac app and it's designed very similarly to Sketch.
20

21
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.430
So it's very much focused on user interface prototyping and it's very specialized for that.
21

22
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.450
And finally there's another tool called proto.io.
22

23
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.430
Now between these four tools I'm sure you'll be able to find your favorite one for prototyping.
23

24
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.640
Currently I'm mostly working in Principle and Marvel. So I can use principle to do some more fancy stuff
24

25
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.100
and Marvel to create some basic interactions and I'll show you all of that in a little bit later on.
25

26
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.620
So firstly let's show you what Principle can do.
26

27
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.220
It's basically a Mac app that allows you to set up really simple animations and essentially it works
27

28
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.440
mostly through tween animations.
28

29
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.800
Now tween animations are basically this animation concept where you give the computer image A with position A
29

30
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.220
and size A and then you move the image to another point or you change its size and then you allow the
30

31
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.230
computer to work out all of the frames in between.
31

32
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.930
So let me show you a really simple way of creating tween animation in a tool that you'll be surprised
32

33
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.380
about.
33

34
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.100
And that's Keynote.
34

35
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.450
So I'm going to create a new presentation just going to choose the white one.
35

36
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.140
And on here I'm going to put on an image.
36

37
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.210
I'm going to head over to my workout images and let's put something like the lunge over here.
37

38
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.240
So we got the lungeing person over here.
38

39
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.340
And I'm going to copy and paste this slide and then I'm going to move her over here and I'm going to
39

40
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.150
make her just a little bit bigger.
40

41
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.840
So she's going to go from the left bottom corner to the right bottom corner and increase a little bit
41

42
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.810
in size.
42

43
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.630
Now if I select the first slide and I add this transition effect called a magic move which is basically
43

44
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.540
putting in a tween animation.
44

45
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.450
And when you run the slide it basically computes all the different frames in between that it needs to
45

46
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.520
animate this image going from here to here increasing in size and moving in position.
46

47
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.920
So that's basically how a lot of these prototyping tools work.
47

48
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.940
And in fact you can actually use Keynote to produce your prototypes as well.
48

49
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.010
And in the next lesson I'll show you how you can build your prototypes using Marvel as well as Keynote.
49

50
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.510
So all of that and more on the next lesson.
50

51
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.260
See you there.
