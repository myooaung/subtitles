00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,620
All right.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,390
So the next thing I want to talk about is cross-promotion. And this is basically where you and another
2

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,650
app--
3

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,770
this is basically where you team up with another app developer and you say that I will promote your
4

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,240
app to my users and you can promote my app to your users.
5

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,830
That way we both win because we double our user base.
6

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,830
Now that's the theory and it sounds very good.
7

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,590
But my point is that it works in certain situations, but more often than not from my experience it doesn't
8

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,250
always work that great because you don't want to send your users away from your apps.
9

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,910
They're not a commodity. They're people who you want to build a relationship with.
10

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,480
And if you're pushing other things on them it doesn't always produce the best outcomes.
11

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,660
So instead, what I urge you to do is help your users discover your other apps.
12

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,100
So if you have more than one app that are mildly related say if you have a meditation app and you have
13

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,270
a workout app, then you should be promoting all of your other bundles of apps within each other. So that
14

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,690
way you share your users between your own apps. But those users never leave your own ecosystem. And
15

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:15,660
in most cases they seem to have worked much better than driving traffic towards somebody else's app.
