00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.630
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.170
So in this lesson, I'm going to talk about Third Party Libraries, what they are, and how to use them using
2

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.450
something called CocoaPods.
3

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.080
What exactly are third party libraries anyways?
4

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.960
Well, let's imagine that you have an assignment where you have to write an essay about volcanoes. And, yeah,
5

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.570
you know a little bit about volcanoes already, you know that they're kind of pointy, and they're kind of hot,
6

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.680
and sometimes they emit a lot of gas, which could probably be said of my roommate, too, but you
7

8
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.400
might not know that, for example, volcanoes are named after the Roman god Vulcan, which is this blacksmith
8

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.150
dude, who's really good with fire, or the fact that maybe the largest volcano is actually on Mars and
9

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.220
it's something like 370 miles across which is like about six hundred kilometers in
10

11
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.510
diameter.
11

12
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.940
So where would you find these kind of things out?
12

13
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.410
Well, you might have gone to an actual library, right, and you could take out a book on volcanoes.
13

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.870
So between this book and your knowledge, you can actually cobble together this essay.
14

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.450
Now, I'm not saying this is how you should write essays, copy things from books or from Wikipedia.
15

16
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.740
But, essentially, a lot of times, you don't have the knowledge or the capabilities or the time to be able to
16

17
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.470
completely create something by yourself.
17

18
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.340
So in the case of the app, you can actually combine your code with third party library code that other
18

19
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.790
people have created, and you're able to leverage these third party libraries of code which contain individual
19

20
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.220
modules for specific purposes,
20

21
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.510
say, for example, an animation library that helps you animate the components of your app, or a Lintel library
21

22
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.230
which helps you fix and improve your Swift code, or something like Firebase which we're going to be using
22

23
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.590
a little bit later on in order to work with the databases on Firebase and in Cloud storage.
23

24
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.890
So, essentially, you end up standing on the shoulders of giants saving yourself lots of time and, also,
24

25
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.780
occasionally being able to do things you might not have otherwise known how to do.
25

26
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.310
So let's go ahead and see this in action.
26

27
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.060
Now, the first thing I want you to do is to actually close down the project that you're currently working
27

28
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.960
with. And in your browser, head over to cocoapods.org.
28

29
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.920
This is the tool that we're going to be using to search for and incorporate some third party libraries
29

30
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.290
into our project.
30

31
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.410
Now, when you go to cocoapods.org, there is a search bar which, admittedly, sometimes it doesn't work
31

32
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.240
that well, but most of the time, as long as the server's up and running, you should be able to type stuff
32

33
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.650
in here.
33

34
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.230
Say, for example, if I wanted to find a library that helps me create a typing animation, then I could search
34

35
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.610
for the word "typing,"
35

36
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.960
and you can see a whole bunch of different libraries that we can add.
36

37
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.710
So this top one which is a UILabel with character by character typing animation written in Swift,
37

38
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.210
so that sounds pretty good,
38

39
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.670
that sounds pretty much like exactly what we want,
39

40
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.920
right?
40

41
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.260
So if you go ahead and click on it, one of the key things you have to do is judge whether if these libraries
41

42
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.870
are well maintained and if they're updated regularly.
42

43
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.940
So you can see some of this information over here.
43

44
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.970
You can see that the builds are passing.
44

45
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.470
So these are automatic builds and tests that are run on this library of code. And you can also see when
45

46
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.090
it was last updated.
46

47
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.190
So you can see this one was last updated in October 2019.
47

48
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.800
And right now, it's October 2019 as I'm recording this,
48

49
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
so that's pretty good.
49

50
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.580
Now, the other thing that you can see is when you go ahead and click on this link here with the little
50

51
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.920
GitHub Octocat. It takes you to where that code is hosted.
51

52
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.600
So, it's usually going to be on GitHub.
52

53
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.920
And here you can actually look through the code that enables this capability.
53

54
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.080
For example, if we go into Pod and then we go into Classes, we can see that this is pretty much the
54

55
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.540
class that's enabling the functionality.
55

56
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.370
So it basically subclasses our UILabel and adds a whole bunch of capabilities to it in order for it
56

57
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.200
to animate
57

58
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.300
with that typing animation.
58

59
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.640
So when you're on GitHub, a quality indicator or at least a popularity indicator is by looking at the
59

60
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.510
number of people who have started this project or repository.
60

61
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.460
So this one has 65.
61

62
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.650
And if you were to go back and compare some of the competing ones which also have this functionality
62

63
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.050
and look at how many stars they have, then you'll be able to roughly judge how many people actually have
63

64
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.430
used this, and how many people are interested in it as a sort of proxy for quality.
64

65
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.460
So, now that we found this pod that we'd like to enable in our project to get something like this going
65

66
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.530
on, how do we actually do it?
66

67
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.140
Well, usually on the read-me page,
67

68
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.780
so on the main page of the project that you get linked to from CocoaPods, you'll get a section on installation.
68

69
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.250
And you can see that there's usually a whole bunch of different options.
69

70
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.460
You can either do it manually by copy and pasting this file into your Xcode project. And I don't recommend
70

71
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.150
doing it like this because there's usually a lot of updates that happen to Swift and to Xcode, and that
71

72
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.510
means that you're going to be responsible for maintaining the code afterwards if you want to add it
72

73
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.420
manually.
73

74
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.710
Alternatively, you would have to monitor for changes in this repository and see when the author updates
74

75
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.670
their code, and then copy and pasting it again whenever that happens.
75

76
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.550
That's really, really tedious.
76

77
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.950
So instead, we're gonna be using this great tool called CocoaPods. In the next lesson,
77

78
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.620
I'm gonna show you how to install CocoaPods onto your Mac.
