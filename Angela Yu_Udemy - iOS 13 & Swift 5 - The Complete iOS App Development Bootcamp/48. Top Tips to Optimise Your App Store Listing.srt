00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,460
So on the iOS App Store when you list your app there is a field that you can fill in
1

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,030
for all of your keywords. So it's limited to 100 characters and you can try and stuff in as many keywords
2

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,880
as you want.
3

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,000
So the important thing to note for when you're listing an iOS app is that you don't need to add any
4

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,660
spaces.
5

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,850
If you add spaces they will take up your character count.
6

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,980
So just have keyword, keyword no spaces.
7

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,040
First tip.
8

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,820
Second tip is that the App Store will automatically conjure up all the various plural versions of your
9

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,720
keywords as well as all the different combinations.
10

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,570
So say if we're making a coffee app and you want to have the words Coffee Bean and coffee in there,
11

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,480
you don't have to write coffee, coffee bean. Instead just write coffee, bean, whatever else
12

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:48,970
it is
13

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,070
because the app store already will form all the possible combinations of all your keywords.
14

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,560
Now the third thing to remember is that you can't update your keywords on the fly. In order to update
15

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,130
your keywords
16

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,130
you have to push out an update to your app. So make sure that you think carefully about what you're going
17

18
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,250
to put in here because to a large extent it's going to determine how highly your app ranks for the keywords
18

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,840
and that will directly contribution to your download rate and hence your revenue.
19

20
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,490
Now on the Google Play Store, keywords work slightly differently.
20

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,840
So on the Google Play store you're able to add a description as well as a name to your app. And similar
21

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,220
to how websites work,
22

23
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,190
Google will look through your description to determine what the keywords should be.
23

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,900
So in this case, if you have a particular keyword like coffee, you want to make sure that it appears as
24

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,350
frequently and as naturally as possible in your description.
25

26
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,920
So don't write a description that's just coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee.
26

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,860
It has to be in a natural context.
27

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,260
And the closer to the beginning of each of these fields means that the higher the word is weighted.
28

29
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,220
So if you have an app name that is called Coffee House, it will rank higher for the word coffee than
29

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,930
House coffee for example.
30

31
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,870
So keep your keywords as close to the top left as possible.
