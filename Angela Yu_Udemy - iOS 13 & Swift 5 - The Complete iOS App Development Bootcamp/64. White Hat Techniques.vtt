00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.290
So for those guys who don't recognize this character I'm going to give you a really good TV recommendation.
1

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.160
I know this is not what you're here for but it is just incredible.
2

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.740
Go and watch Westworld.
3

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.730
It is the best thing that happened on TV in 2016.
4

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.190
But if you have not seen this, don't worry.
5

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.300
Firstly I'm not going to give anything away.
6

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.100
But secondly all you need to know is that there are white hat techniques of getting your app downloaded
7

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.160
on the App Store.
8

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.580
And there are black hat techniques which people exploit in order to push their apps onto the top of
9

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.220
the charts.
10

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.310
And I just want to draw your attention to some of these techniques.
11

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.120
So let's start off with some white hat techniques.
12

13
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.180
Everything that I've said in this course is pretty much a white hat technique for getting more app downloads
13

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.400
and ensuring a successful launch.
14

15
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.270
So here's a few more.
15

16
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.010
One is having an in-app video.
16

17
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.470
So a great example of this is the Headspace app which is a mindfulness meditation app that helps you
17

18
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.410
get into the practice of daily meditation. And what they do really successfully is that when you first
18

19
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.240
download the app, they show you a video roughly about a minute and a half long about how the app works.
19

20
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.870
Now you might think that this is a little bit excessive and given how expensive video production is
20

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.820
nowadays especially with nice graphics, you might thinking about skipping it.
21

22
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.560
But here's the trick.
22

23
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.400
Now both the app stores Apple and Google monitor how long users spend inside your app and that contributes
23

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.960
to how you rank on the app stores.
24

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.280
Basically they differentiate the apps which gets opened and then closed immediately or the apps where
25

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.020
people spend more than 30 seconds in.
26

27
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.680
So that is one of their metrics for app quality i.e. the better the app the more that the user wants
27

28
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.910
to spend time in it.
28

29
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.750
So one of the ways of gaining that metric is by having a video and that video can explain how your app
29

30
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.120
works or teach them about something that is within the niche of your app like how meditation works or
30

31
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.300
anything basically that is of interest to that user who download that particular app.
31

32
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.610
And watching a video for 30 seconds is something that is very easy to do and a lot of people will do
32

33
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.840
it and that massively increases your in-app usage time propelling you up
33

34
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.340
the app store search engine.
34

35
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.840
Now during this course, we've been mostly focusing on the iOS and the Google Play store.
35

36
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.280
But remember that there are other app stores. For example there's the Kindle store,
36

37
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.740
there's the Nook store
37

38
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.710
and in China there's all of these app stores for Android because Google Play is banned.
38

39
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.090
So if you have an Android app converting that app apk into one of the formats that can be accepted
39

40
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.500
on any of these apps stores is easy as pie.
40

41
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.610
Now it's a little bit more difficult if you have an iOS app but basically the more places that your
41

42
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.200
app is listed the higher chance that you have of reaching alternate users.
42

43
00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.890
So especially if your app targets the Chinese audience or targets Asia well worth considering to get
43

44
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.420
your Android app onto these App Stores.
