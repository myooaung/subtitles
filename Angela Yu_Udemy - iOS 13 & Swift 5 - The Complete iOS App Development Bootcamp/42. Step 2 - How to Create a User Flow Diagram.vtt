00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:00.820
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.570
So now we've got the color palette down and we know roughly how we want our user interface to look based
2

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.230
on some of the stuff we found on mobile patterns.
3

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.160
What's the next step? The next step is creating a user flow diagram.
4

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.090
Now what is a user flow diagram?
5

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.110
Essentially an engineering diagram.
6

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.170
It's a very high level representation of a user's journey through your app or through your website.
7

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.690
For example say you open up the Amazon app. On the home screen you can decide to search for an item or
8

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.140
you can have a look in your basket and go to check out or you can just browse through the list of suggested
9

10
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.680
items.
10

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.230
So a user flow diagram is what we use to design a user's journey.
11

12
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.920
It's a bit like a website site map. And a user flow diagram is made up of three things.
12

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.320
One you use rectangles to represent screens,
13

14
00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.510
so the home screen or the login screen. And then use diamonds to represent decisions such as tapping
14

15
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.090
the login button or swiping to the left or zooming in on an image.
15

16
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.080
So diamonds offer decisions.
16

17
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.850
And finally use arrows to link up screens and decisions together
17

18
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.730
and in the process you create a user flow diagram.
18

19
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.190
So let's show you an example.
19

20
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.220
So this is the Twitter app and on the left is the home screen.
20

21
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.740
So this is what shows up when you launch Twitter.
21

22
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.460
And that's of course the feed that's that we're seeing right now.
22

23
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.910
And on the right is what happens when you tap the new tweet button over here.
23

24
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.470
So once you tap this you go to this screen which is the compose screen
24

25
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.550
and here you can type in a tweet. And you have two actions essentially. You can either discard your tweet
25

26
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.150
by clicking the cross or you can click the tweet button to send off your tweet into the world.
26

27
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.930
Now of course there's actually quite a few more buttons that are available.
27

28
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.200
But let's just map this very basic user flow of going into Twitter,
28

29
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.350
composing a new tweet and either deciding to discard or sending it out into the world.
29

30
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:19.690
So this feed screen would be converted to a rectangle labeled feed, the compose button would become a
30

31
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.650
diamond which represents the new tweet action.
31

32
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.580
Once you click on the new tweet action. it should take you to the compose screen which is again represented
32

33
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.040
by a rectangle.
33

34
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.990
And finally on the compose screen you have two possible actions that you can take:
34

35
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.150
you can either press cancel to go back to the feed or you can press tweet to send your tweet out into
35

36
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.300
the world. And then we can link all of these actions up with arrows to show how the user progresses
36

37
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.250
through the app and completes a journey of composing and sending out a new tweet.
37

38
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.650
Now going back to our workout app example.
38

39
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.430
So this is something that I've just drawn up off the top of my head,
39

40
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.070
what I would want from my workout app.
40

41
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.640
So you should be able to firstly enter through the welcome screen. And instead of letting users register
41

42
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.400
with email I've decided that they can either log in with their Facebook account or they can log in with
42

43
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.030
Google. And after they log in they are taken to the home screen. And at the home screen they have a number of
43

44
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.560
actions that they can perform.
44

45
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.290
They can either start a new workout or browse through different workouts or they can check their own
45

46
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.220
profile or they can check out their workout stats.
46

47
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.580
Now while this app is very simple and it's relatively easy to map out most of the functionality in a
47

48
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.820
single page, this is certainly not the way that we would recommend you do it because it can become very
48

49
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.470
complex very quickly.
49

50
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.190
But instead what you should do is you should map out a user flow diagram for a single user journey.
50

51
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.470
So what does that mean?
51

52
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.920
For example, if we only wanted to map out the diagram for a user going into the app and completing a
52

53
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.170
workout session, well what they would do is they would go into the welcome screen, they would log in that
53

54
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.880
would take them to the homescreen.
54

55
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.850
They can then click to browse through workouts which takes them to the list the workouts, they select
55

56
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.320
the ones that they want to do
56

57
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.700
and then after they've done selecting they get taken to the workout session screen. And here they can
57

58
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.560
end the workout or go to the next exercise.
58

59
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.670
If they end the workout, they get taken back to the homescreen etc. etc.
59

60
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.480
Now why is all of this necessary?
60

61
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.660
You know, a lot of students ask you know "why can't I just go straight to designing my app in Photoshop?"
61

62
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.310
Or even more extreme,
62

63
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.190
"why can't I just start coding and see how it goes?"
63

64
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.390
Well, because when you're at the earliest stage of designing which is this stage the first stage which
64

65
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.670
is mapping out you use a flow diagram,
65

66
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.440
it's very easy to make any changes as necessary.
66

67
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:09.870
So for example if in our workout app we wanted people to have the option of starting a default workout
67

68
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.330
without having to go through browsing and selecting it,
68

69
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.830
we can simply edit the user flow diagram like so. We're on the home screen,
69

70
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.710
we have a single button or a single action that can take us to the workout session starting a default
70

71
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.330
workout.
71

72
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.560
This process probably took me two seconds.
72

73
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.700
Now this process in Photoshop, having to change the homescreen, having to add a new
73

74
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.810
action, having to link all these things up which would have probably taken me a few hours. And this whole
74

75
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.440
process, if I was doing it in code, would probably take me a few days.
75

76
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.130
So the beauty of designing from as basic as possible,
76

77
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.500
so starting from user flow diagram, is that you get to a point where you're happy with how your app
77

78
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.370
functions or how your app would logically work before you commit yourself to any designs before you
78

79
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.940
commit yourself to miles and miles of code. Which means that you end up saving time and therefore money.
79

80
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.080
A lot of the students who we've had on our physical in-person programming bootcamps have paid you know 40,000
80

81
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:27.990
50,000 easily for an app that is incomplete because they don't start out with a very basic use of flow
81

82
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.760
diagram.
82

83
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.910
They don't go through the formal design process. And only once the app has materialized into code that
83

84
00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.430
they've commissioned a freelancer to do or they've commissioned an agency to do. So they get it in their
84

85
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:48.320
hands and they realize "This is not what I wanted." And making any changes at that stage
85

86
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.420
once designers have worked on it, once programmers have worked on it, is very very costly and very time
86

87
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.430
consuming.
87

88
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.000
So I highly urge you guys to always start from the basics.
88

89
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.040
So just sketch out a user floor diagram. And this is the time where instead of just listening to me
89

90
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.820
telling you all about it, it's time for you to do some hands on work.
90

91
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.490
So the premise is that you're commissioned to design a recipe app. And this recipe app is going to allow
91

92
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.210
the user to do two very simple things.
92

93
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:28.590
One is browse through a list of recipes and two is save or favorite those recipes so that they can refer
93

94
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.000
to it later on.
94

95
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.480
Now it's time to pause the video, take a piece of paper take a pencil pencil and sketch out the user
95

96
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.380
flow diagram for this recipe app.
96

97
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:45.300
And if you get confused at all or if you forget about how we design user flow diagrams, you can always
97

98
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.780
rewind the video and see how we did it for the Twitter app or how I did it for the workout app.
98

99
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.590
And once you've completed the challenge, I'll see you in the next video when we talk about wire framing.
