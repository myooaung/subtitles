00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.860
All right. So how was it designing your user flow?
1

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.730
All right so how was it designing your first user flow diagram?
2

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.280
If it's particularly remarkable or particularly beautiful, feel free to share it in the comment box below
3

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.660
and we can all marvel at your work.
4

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.330
All right.
5

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.650
So it's time to go onto the next stage.
6

7
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.520
What do you do once you've completed the user flow diagram and you've designed all of the user journeys?
7

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.540
Well, you go on to a state called wireframing.
8

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.980
Now what are wireframes? Wireframes are essentially a low fidelity representation of how your app will
9

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.320
look in the future.
10

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.720
So, essentially you're designing with a piece of paper and a pencil and you're drawing out where the
11

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.430
images go, where the buttons go.
12

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.990
Essentially just a sketch or an outline of how your app would look.
13

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.290
And this is really meant to be very rough and ready.
14

15
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.480
It shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes to draw up you know 10 screens in your app because nobody's
15

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.120
judging your drawing abilities.
16

17
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.020
All it has to do is to make the layout of the screen super clear so that in the future when you're designing
17

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.420
a mockup or you're designing a prototype,
18

19
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.670
you know how the screen will look.
19

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.060
So this is about the placement of the images.
20

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.400
Am I going to use a tab bar?
21

22
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:25.380
Am I going to have a navigation controller? etc. And it's only meant as-- and it's only meant as a rough
22

23
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.720
sketch of how your app will work.
23

24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.270
So I'm going to tell you about some my favorite tools for wireframing.
24

25
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.090
Now just a disclaimer, we're not affiliated with these guys.
25

26
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.130
I just use a lot of their tools and I really like them.
26

27
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.900
And so that's why I'm telling you about it.
27

28
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.560
So one of the companies I really like is UI Stencils and they produce these stainless steel stencils
28

29
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.360
that remind me of when I was a kid. And they've created the same thing,
29

30
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.790
so cut outs, of all the common icons that you use when you're designing apps.
30

31
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.980
So for example a location indicator or a heart or a thumb up or the play button and it comes in really
31

32
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.080
handy when you're just sketching things off the bat.
32

33
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.180
And another thing I use from them is a sketch pad which has iPhone or Android phones or iPad or website
33

34
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.850
whatever that is printed on a thick paper and you can essentially sketch on the go all of your ideas.
34

35
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.730
So for somebody like me who has an app idea probably realistically every five minutes,
35

36
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.730
this is really a boon.
36

37
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.050
So I can get those ideas down on paper and see just how terrible or great they are. Mostly they're terrible.
37

38
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.880
But my procrastination saves the world from all my terrible ideas.
38

39
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.740
So if you just want to use these templates you don't actually have to buy it from them.
39

40
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.230
I've included a download link to a free version, a free PDF version that you can download and print out
40

41
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.100
yourself and it's in the text box below.
41

42
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.360
So have a look at that.
42

43
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.620
Now what we're going to do is we're going to take or user flow diagram that we created in the last
43

44
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.020
module and we are going to convert all of the screens.
44

45
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.140
Remember that screens are represented in user flow diagrams by rectangles.
45

46
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.480
So we're going to take all these screens and we're going to turn them into wireframes.
46

47
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.210
Let me show you how I've done it for this example workout app.
47

48
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.270
And please don't judge my terrible drawing. I've decided to go for very simple welcome screen.
48

49
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.250
It'll probably have a background color, a single flat color. And I've got an image of some dumbbells over
49

50
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.260
here and I've got two buttons:
50

51
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.690
login with Facebook or login with Google
51

52
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.170
as we saw in our user flow diagram. Now the next stage if you click on one of these buttons you get
52

53
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.120
taken to the home screen. And on the screen I want to give people an encouraging message when they first
53

54
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.020
land on it.
54

55
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.710
So telling them how many days have they been on a streak of workouts. "You've had a three day streak.
55

56
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.480
So keep it up" essentially.
56

57
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.840
And then there's a start button which allows them to start a workout
57

58
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.450
and also there is a tab bar at the bottom.
58

59
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.080
Now this is compliant with the iOS design guidelines where navigation between screens is mostly done
59

60
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.490
through tab bars.
60

61
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.110
Now if you're designing for Android
61

62
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.240
the rules are slightly different.
62

63
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.390
And the reason for that is on Android you have physical buttons usually on the phones down here.
63

64
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.930
So you've got a back button, you've got a home button etc. So you never want to have two rows of buttons
64

65
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.260
on top of each other because the chance for tapping on the wrong button is very high.
65

66
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.450
So for Android designs you tend to see a hamburger menu so the three lines up here and it looks a bit
66

67
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.170
like a hamburger and you get a pop out menu.
67

68
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.880
It's always important to be aware of the design conventions for the environment that you're designing
68

69
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.130
for.
69

70
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.250
So coming back to work out app you can click on this button to browse through workouts and click on
70

71
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.920
the calendar to see how often you've been working out,
71

72
00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.840
look at your stats.
72

73
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.380
You can click on this button to check your profile.
73

74
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.680
And this of course is the current homescreen.
74

75
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.660
So the next screen that we've got is the workout list
75

76
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.100
so the browsing through the workout screen. And I have decided to go for a sort of table layout where
76

77
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.050
you've got the name of the exercise,
77

78
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.240
you've got an image of the exercise
78

79
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.730
and how many reps you should do each time.
79

80
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:27.880
And here I wanted to be able to tap on these images and select them and add them to my workout.
80

81
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.300
And finally the last screen we've got is the workout sessions screen. Again
81

82
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.020
really poor drawing on my part. You should imagine that this is a man jumping into a star shape. And it
82

83
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.950
could be you know an animated gif or it could be a looping video that shows the user how to do star jumps.
83

84
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.130
And then you keep track of how many sets of workouts they've done,
84

85
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.280
how many repetitions they need to do
85

86
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.980
and then you track how long they've been working out for.
86

87
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.910
And we also designed in our user flow diagram that you should be able to proceed to the next exercise
87

88
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.380
through a button that's simply represented as a right arrow on my screen.
88

89
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:12.360
So that's pretty much a very very simple wireframe of the main screens in my app.
89

90
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.720
Now this has been very easy to create and it literally takes five or ten minutes just to sketchup.
90

91
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.420
And it allows you to formulate your ideas into something tangible.
91

92
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.280
So the next step I'm going to show you is something really cool. And it's a free app called Pop that
92

93
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.260
allows you to take photos using your phone of
93

94
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:39.390
all of these wireframes and you can link them up through buttons and finally you end up with a working
94

95
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.950
prototype on your phone.
95

96
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.130
So let me show you what mine looks like.
96

97
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.770
I've designed a total of nine screens for this hypothetical workout app. And all you do is you design--
97

98
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.400
all you do is you draw them pen on paper and all you do is you draw them out pencil on paper and you
98

99
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:08.400
use the pop app which is free to download on Android and iOS and then you can insert these links. And
99

100
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:16.320
you can say when the user clicks on this area, we should link to the home screen for example. And it allows
100

101
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.070
for some pretty neat gestures and interactions.
101

102
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.910
So for example in my list of exercise screen, I've decided to designate an area which allows you to swipe
102

103
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.300
up and it links up to the next page that simulates what would happen in the app if you just swiped up
103

104
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.150
on that table of exercises.
104

105
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.970
Let me show you what this looks like when it's completed.
105

106
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:44.340
So here's my workout app and I'm going to choose to login with Facebook.
106

107
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:53.210
I get taken to the home screen and I decide to browse through my workouts and I can see that there's
107

108
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.950
these images of my workouts.
108

109
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.220
I'm going to select the ones that I want to do.
109

110
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.740
So I want to do some squats, some star jumps etc..
110

111
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.750
And then I'm going to swipe up to see some of the other exercises.
111

112
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.280
Okay.
112

113
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.240
So I'm done with my exercises.
113

114
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.720
Let's go back to the home screen and start the workout.
114

115
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.830
So this takes me to the workout session and it tells me that I should be doing star jumps 30 of them
115

116
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.250
and I've been working out for 15 minutes.
116

117
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.630
I can either end the session or I can progress to the next workout.
117

118
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.120
And this is meant to be sit ups.
118

119
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.300
I'm sorry this doesn't look like sit ups but just bear with me.
119

120
00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.260
And then on the screen I'm going to end my session and go back to the homescreen and have a look at
120

121
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.250
my stats.
121

122
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.710
These were the days in the last month that I have been working out.
122

123
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.010
There's some more detail down here which I can swipe through
123

124
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.300
and then if I click on this graph button it shows me the graph of how frequently I'm working out and so
124

125
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.920
I can toggle between these two like so.
125

126
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.880
And then finally we're gonna to have a look at the profile page which just shows an image of the user, their
126

127
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.340
name and some of their body stats
127

128
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.880
and you can edit that as needed.
128

129
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:11.220
And then we go back to the home screen and that's essentially a working prototype that was created in
129

130
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.570
less than 30 minutes.
130

131
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:12.950
All right.
131

132
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.330
So you got the hint.
132

133
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.960
This is again your turn to do some hands on design work.
133

134
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:26.280
And going back to that recipe app, we want you guys to turn that user flow diagram into wireframes.
134

135
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:33.030
So for every single screen that you've drawn, you should have a screen that sketched out as a wireframe.
135

136
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:40.470
And then we want you to download the free Pop app onto your phone and link up the different screens
136

137
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.120
through creating these buttons.
137

138
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:50.790
So all you need to do when you're using Pop is you just need to select an area and click link to and
138

139
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.400
decide which screen you want to link it to.
139

140
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.510
And once you've linked up all the screens you'll have a working.
140

141
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.130
You'll have a simple working prototype that you can show anybody.
141

142
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:08.620
So very often people have ideas and they can't quite articulate it in a way that anybody understand
142

143
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.110
what it does.
143

144
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.920
This is the perfect way to putting those thoughts down into an actual prototype that you can show people
144
