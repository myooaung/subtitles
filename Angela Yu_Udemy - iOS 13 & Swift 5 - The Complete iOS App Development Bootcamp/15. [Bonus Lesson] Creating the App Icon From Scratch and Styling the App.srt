0
1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,170
All right.
1

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,260
So at the moment, this is what our app looks like.
2

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,540
Now, I want to make a few modifications
3

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,420
to the app to maybe jazz it up a little bit.
4

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,580
So the first thing I want to do is I want to make that image fill the entire space of the image view.
5

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,220
So let's change that image view from Aspect Fit to Aspect Fill.
6

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,470
Then I want to change the nav bar color to maybe something that looks a bit more like a garden app,
7

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:35,100
so some form of green, and I'll change the background view as well to some sort of nice light green color.
8

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,520
That means I need to change my label to a white text.
9

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,110
I'm also going to change that camera to a white camera.
10

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,520
All right. So, now I'm going to show you how we can create a neat little app icon for our app.
11

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,430
So I'm just going to go onto Freepik, which is a really nice website for graphic resources, and I'll
12

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,720
just search for flower. All right. Cool. So we've got loads of different types of flowers,
13

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,690
but I want something kind of simple, maybe something like one of these flowers.
14

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:10,300
So let's go ahead and download it and unzip it. As you can see, they include the license, but also a file
15

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,070
that we can edit inside illustrator.
16

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:19,900
So that's an EPS file which is, basically, a vector file. So the flower that I'm quite keen on is
17

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,270
probably this one. So I'm just going to select it and copy it by command C, and then I'm going to open
18

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,340
up Photoshop and make a new canvas.
19

20
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:35,800
So this is really important because we're going to be making our app icon the easy way by using this
20

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,260
website, MakeAppIcon
21

22
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,770
You can see that they want your starting image size to be 1536 x 1536.
22

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,110
So super large.
23

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,460
So that's what I'm going to make here, 1536 x 1536.
24

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,340
Hit enter.
25

26
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:50,890
All right.
26

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:58,180
And then I'm going to paste my image in as a smart object and I'm going to scale it up, so that it looks
27

28
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,480
reasonably large on screen.
28

29
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,610
So maybe about this size, I guess.
29

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:09,700
Now, I'm pretty bad at centering by eye, so I'm going to use Photoshop to help me do that.
30

31
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,520
So I'm going to select the entire screen, and then I will make it horizontally and vertically centered.
31

32
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,720
Sweet.
32

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,600
So the next thing I want to do is add a gradient to the background to make it look nice and apply.
33

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,530
So to do that, I'm going to go back into Illustrator, and then I'm going to select some colors from this
34

35
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,090
image that we chose.
35

36
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:38,110
So I'm going to use the color dropper tool, of course, and I want to use a nice dark purple.
36

37
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,890
So let's copy that hex code and I'm going to add a gradient here.
37

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,860
So, as you can see, I've actually already added it in here, but we'll just do it again to show you.
38

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,140
So here I'm going to add that color I got from earlier on.
39

40
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
And then, the other side of the gradient
40

41
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,700
I'm just going to use a, maybe, a lighter purple, like maybe one of these.
41

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,810
All right. So let's copy that and get back into Photoshop and edit this.
42

43
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,230
Let's change that color to this one.
43

44
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,050
All right. Cool. Looking good.
44

45
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,480
Now, I'm going to add my gradient.
45

46
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,280
Maybe I'll just drop it down vertically.
46

47
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,040
Looks, looks all right.
47

48
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,010
I think I could make this a little bit brighter. of a little bit--
48

49
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,660
bit more purple, but brighter of a color, and hit
49

50
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,240
OK.
50

51
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,480
Yeah, that looks pretty neat.
51

52
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,380
Let's put our image on top.
52

53
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,250
Looking good.
53

54
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,500
So let's go ahead and save this.
54

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,580
I'll call it WhatFlowerAppIcon.psd, and I'm going to uncheck the layers and I'm going to save
55

56
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,570
it onto my desktop. All right. Cool.
56

57
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,520
So once that's done, then I'm just going to drop it in here.
57

58
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,120
This is literally the easiest thing ever.
58

59
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:06,360
So I've got my desk top open and I'm just going to drag this image in PSD format into the toaster.
59

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,580
And you will see it going into the toaster, it's s really neat animation, and it's going to bake it for a
60

61
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,330
little while.
61

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,230
So it's going to ask you for an e-mail address to send the processed images to you, so you can use whatever
62

63
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,800
you like.
63

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,740
I personally have a burner email address just for these kind of purposes.
64

65
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,380
So the icons that I want I don't want it for watch and I don't really want to subscribe.
65

66
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,130
And then all you have to do is just add your email and you'll be able to download it. And you can see
66

67
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,300
that they provide all of the sizes that you need.
67

68
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:37,860
All right.
68

69
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,750
So let's go ahead and check e-mail. All right, so there's our app icon for MakeAppIcon and I'm just going
69

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,590
to download the ZIP file that they've provided.
70

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,020
Okay.
71

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,190
So I'm going to unzip that app icon and then you can see that you've got three folders:
72

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,940
android, imessenger, and ios. The one that we're interested is the ios. And you can see that you've got all
73

74
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,360
the icons that you need
74

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,660
and also it's formatted in a way that you can basically just drag and drop it into your folder.
75

76
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:10,630
If you have a look inside your assets.xcassets folder and you say show in Finder the app icon,
76

77
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:18,130
you can see that it's named exactly the same, Appicon.appiconset. So all we need to do is just to replace
77

78
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,450
this folder.
78

79
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,180
So I'm--so just to recap.
79

80
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,550
I'm in the assets.xcassets with the AppIcon selected. Currently, it's completely empty.
80

81
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm going to right click and say show in Finder.
81

82
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,410
So this is where it is,
82

83
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,570
Assets.xcassets, and then I'm going to delete this, and instead, drag this new one in here.
83

84
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,470
And you'll see that it updates an Xcode and it's all beautifully classified,
84

85
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,550
none of this dragging and dropping.
85

86
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,910
So some of these are not placed because they are of the wrong size.
86

87
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,020
So all we need to do is just to delete them
87

88
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,690
and you're good to go.
88

89
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,350
So let's check out our beautiful app icon on our phone.
89

90
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,730
And there it is.
90

91
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,050
Looks pretty neat, right?
91

92
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,750
So you can go ahead and style your app, however, you like, change the colors, change the layout, change the
92

93
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,610
designs. Basically, go nuts,
93

94
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,910
make it your own, and make it however you want it to be.
94

95
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,420
So I hope you enjoyed learning how to convert various models into a format that we can use with CoreML
95

96
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,120
and creating our flower classification app.
96

97
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,210
So there's loads of places where you can find pre-trained models.
97

98
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,530
The easiest is probably just Googling it for the particular implementation that you want and see if
98

99
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,420
it exists.
99

100
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,160
But for Caffe at least, I know that there's something called Model Zoo where you've got a whole load of
100

101
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,350
pre-trained models that you can basically download and use. And I'll include a link to this
101

102
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,850
in this lesson as well.
102

103
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,100
So onwards and upwards, and I will see you on the next module.
