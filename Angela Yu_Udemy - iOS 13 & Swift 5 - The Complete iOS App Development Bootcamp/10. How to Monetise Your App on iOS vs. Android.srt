Now one of the things that people tend to think about too late is how are you monetizing your app.
1

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,380
And this is something that you should be thinking about before you even start coding before you even
2

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,440
start designing your app because the method or the strategy that you choose to monetize your app will
3

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,800
determine how will determine a number of factors later on.
4

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,850
So we're going to talk about some of the most common ways of monetizing apps some of the pros and cons
5

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,890
and in which cases you should be using which.
6

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,480
So the first thing to mention is that monetization on the Android platform is slightly different from
7

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,730
monetization on the iOS platform.
8

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,850
The most important thing that you notice on the Android platform is that nobody is willing to pay for
9

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,600
apps.
10

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,090
Generally you find as an app developer that people on the iOS platform tend to have more cash lying
11

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:02,190
around and they're more willing to pay you know $1 or $2 for a once use app for example.
12

13
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,980
Whereas on Android people are far more reluctant
13

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,060
and so you see the free apps doing a lot better on Android.
14

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,740
Now of course app developers still need to pay their mortgage and feed their children.
15

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,870
So people have simply developed different monetization strategies when they're developing for Android
16

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,850
and iOS.
17

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,980
So for example most people who are creating Android apps will make it free to download and will probably
18

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,550
get their revenue back from advertising.
19

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,780
So we're going to talk a little bit more about mobile advertising in a little bit.
20

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,950
But essentially you have to realize that as a user, if you're not paying for something to use it you're
21

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,130
still paying somehow.
22

23
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:47,700
And the somehow for Android is either through ads which is relatively whitehat, it's relatively accepted
23

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,590
by people because it's visible you know we know that we just have to be bombarded with ads if we don't
24

25
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,510
want to pay up front.
25

26
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,850
But the other sort of more hidden way that we've seen various developers monetizing on Android is actually
26

27
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,580
through data.
27

28
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,550
So through selling user data. And sometimes you can see some really terrible apps
28

29
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:14,310
for example a calculator app that requests permissions for your contact, for your location.
29

30
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,350
I mean why the hell does a calculator need your location to work?
30

31
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,130
And that's because the developer is actually selling your data.
31

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:34,820
It's a relatively gray area with unclear guidance from both app stores as to how legal it is
32

33
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,810
and one of the things you have to be careful as a user is to really look at those permissions that the
33

34
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,000
apps are requesting and and try to minimize your risk
34

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,340
if privacy is something that you're concerned about.
35

36
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:56,220
So with so, that's mostly about Android and with Apple you see a lot more users who are willing to pay
36

37
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,730
upfront for the app.
37

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,970
And although there is a slight trend towards free apps with ads which is driven mostly by some of the
38

39
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,720
bigger players like Facebook or like Google their apps which are all free to use and look beautiful
39

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,850
and work really well.
40

41
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,710
Well, most of the time. But there is a slight trend towards advertising. So without further ado let's discuss
41

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,070
some of the ways in which you can monetize your apps.
