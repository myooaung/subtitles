00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.870
Now first and foremost, I want to talk about color theory.
1

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.470
This is so fundamental to not just digital design, but in fact design everywhere. Because of our retinas
2

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:17.070
innate ability to differentiate different frequencies of light waves, we're able to see different colors.
3

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.380
Of course, you know, you can get very philosophical about this whether it's my version of red is the same
4

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.800
as your version of red but it's well known that certain frequencies i.e. certain colors or certain shades
5

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.170
evokes different sentiments in people that are pretty much uniform.
6

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.130
So let's have a look at some of the various moods that are attributed to different colors and how you
7

8
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.280
can use different colors to achieve different ends.
8

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.760
So the first one we're going to look at is red and this is traditionally associated with love, energy,
9

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.010
intensity.
10

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.230
So you end up seeing a lot of car adverts that used red as one of their primary colors in the color
11

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.030
palette.
12

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.500
And the reason is it's meant to be exciting, it's meant to be fast and it conveys the intensity that
13

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.890
people look for in fast cars.
14

15
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.360
And also when you're looking at ads that are trying to sell you something relating to love, you see the
15

16
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.470
color red being used predominantly in that color palette.
16

17
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
So I think it's really helpful analyzing adverts because these are essentially really well-thought out
17

18
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.470
experiments in persuasion and manipulating human psychology.
18

19
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.400
Advertising agencies are essentially really really good at using their print ads or they're moving image
19

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.530
ads to persuade us to buy certain things. And they do that through different ways either by evoking certain
20

21
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.680
emotions within us or by suggesting to us the idea that we could be as happy and successful as the people
21

22
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.510
in the adverts
22

23
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.120
if only we just bought whatever it is that they were selling to us.
23

24
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.340
So I'll leave the ethics and laws aside for the philosophers,
24

25
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.720
but in terms of studying what works in design, adverts are really helpful for and helping us identify
25

26
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.420
some of those key factors.
26

27
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.460
So the next time that you see an ad try to see what techniques they're using or which design principles
27

28
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.200
they're using to either make their design look beautiful or try and see what emotion they're trying
28

29
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.250
to evoke in you.
29

30
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.310
So red sells to people on this idea of intensity, of love, of excitement.
30

31
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.100
Now let's look at the next color palette, yellow. And yellow tends to be used for things that try to convey
31

32
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.240
joy, happiness, intellect and it's also an incredibly attention grabbing column which is perhaps why if
32

33
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.360
you guys remember this advert made the news in the UK certainly about this protein shake company.
33

34
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.120
Now of course there's a lot of discussion regarding the message of this advert
34

35
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.960
but that's for somebody else to discuss. What I'm interested in is why did this particular ad attract
35

36
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.440
so many people's attention
36

37
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.490
and in the end criticism when there are so many other adverts that essentially have the same message?
37

38
00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.930
And I believe part of that is their choice of color palette. The use of this bright shade of yellow is
38

39
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.850
incredibly attention grabbing.
39

40
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.190
It's like taking a huge fluorescent highlighter and highlighting the whole ad.
40

41
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.480
Now I remember seeing them when I was walking around in the London underground system and it was impossible
41

42
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.280
to not see it because of how attention grabbing that color is.
42

43
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.110
But remember, if you have an app with a background that is this kind of bright yellow because the color
43

44
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.030
is so intense,
44

45
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.940
people won't be able to stare at it for a very long time and you will get attention fatigue.
45

46
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.410
So this is something that is probably better used for attention grabbing purposes, so say for your app
46

47
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.260
icon designs or for your apps screenshot designs that go up on the App Store so that when that user
47

48
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.150
is scrolling through the App Store that your particular app grabs their attention and becomes the one
48

49
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.250
that they download.
49

50
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.530
In terms of the actual design for your app for the background or etc. this particular shade of yellow
50

51
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.150
is probably a bit too intense.
51

52
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.490
And then we've got various shades of green which tend to convey ideas of freshness, safety, growth.
52

53
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.650
So you see a lot of food related services using this in that branding
53

54
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.440
for example Amazonfresh. What else conveys freshness more than this grassy green color palette?
54

55
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.930
And it's also probably why all of these food bloggers managed convince millions of people into this green
55

56
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.890
juice craze.
56

57
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.730
I mean if you look at the thing it seems to be the very emblem of life and freshness itself even though
57

58
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.320
you might be like me and not much of a convert because it tastes absolutely gross, but you can see through
58

59
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.530
its color palette why it would appeal to health conscious people.
59

60
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.370
So choosing a color palette is not just about you know advertising and attention grabbing,
60

61
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.450
it's also about selling your product and appealing to certain instincts or desires that people have.
61

62
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.100
Next we're going to talk about blue which has traditionally always been about stability, trust, serenity.
62

63
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.230
And you know in fact when you think about anything that's related to medical or medicine or health, it
63

64
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.810
tends to be using a blue color palette.
64

65
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.860
So here's a tip that you might expect
65

66
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.100
from a design class.
66

67
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.520
But the next time that you go to a job interview, if you wanted to instantly come across as more trustworthy,
67

68
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.970
the tip from the designers is to wear a blue shirt. Without speaking, the color already speaks for you
68

69
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.880
and conveys this idea of stability and trust.
69

70
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.080
I mean just look at this guy.
70

71
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.200
I would give him a job even though he doesn't even have a face.
71

72
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.080
So equally when you're making a design that needs people to have faith and trust in you, then blue is
72

73
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.800
a good choice.
73

74
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.900
And finally we've got purple which is meant to evoke ideas of royalty, wealth, femininity.
74

75
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.300
So this is pretty much the color of choice for a lot of payday loan companies and especially those are
75

76
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.050
targeting women for some reason.
76

77
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.350
But actually it's a beautiful color palette and I wish that more people would use it for projects other
77

78
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.690
than payday loans.
78

79
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.370
So the next time that you're designing an app, the first thing to think about is what emotions them what
79

80
00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.240
ideas are you trying to convey in the user and pick a color palette accordingly.
