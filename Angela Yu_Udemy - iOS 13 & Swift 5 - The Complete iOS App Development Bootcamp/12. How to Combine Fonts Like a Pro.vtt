00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.690
Now when you're combining different typefaces usually you will have a different typeface for the heading
1

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.510
versus the body.
2

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.520
So if you're thinking about a webpage, you know your your title will usually be different from the body
3

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.780
in terms of the font or the typeface.
4

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.170
And this is to create slight contrast an interest in your designs. So let's look at some of the common
5

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.740
rules that designers use when they combine different fonts.
6

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.120
The first rule is that serifs and San serifs work together really well.
7

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.390
So if you have a heading that uses a serif typeface and a body that uses a san serif typeface then
8

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.120
that tends to create a good design because san serifs have slightly increased readability compared to
9

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.810
serifs.
10

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.280
So they are great typeface for the body of text.
11

12
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:52.140
And similarly the other way also works quite nicely if you have a san serif heading but with a serif
12

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.960
body. And that little bit of contrast creates a beautiful design.
13

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.120
Now just don't mix a san serif with san serif or serif with a serif because it can look a little bit
14

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.850
bland and undifferentiated
15

16
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730
and hence it can look undesigned.
16

17
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.930
And the other thing is that while we tend to say that two different typefaces or two different fonts
17

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.190
will make your design look more elevated, to many fonts will ruin a good party.
18

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.500
So, if you find yourself using three or more fonts, then really think hard about it and evaluate whether if
19

20
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.020
you really need so many fonts. The rule to stick to is that two different fonts will look really good,
20

21
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.300
three is really at a stretch but four is already way too many
21

22
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.270
and you should be cutting down. So as we discussed with the different colors having different moods,
22

23
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.220
so do fonts. And this designer actually came up with a different type face for each of the States of America.
23

24
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.650
So for example Alaska is represented by this snowy kind of typeface
24

25
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.780
and Texas is represented by the Western typeface.
25

26
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.500
So each typeface has a personality and has a mood.
26

27
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.820
If you use the wrong type face with the wrong mood for your designs it can look incredibly jarring.
27

28
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.510
So always try to appreciate the mood of the typeface. Just as in the beginning of the talk when we
28

29
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.140
compare these two love letters, appreciating the mood of the typeface is incredibly important.
29

30
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.850
And if you mix together different moods your design can look incredibly strange.
30

31
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.760
For example this one here where you've got a you know roaring 20s kind of fonts combined with the mechanical
31

32
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.060
typeface, looks just odd and very out of place.
32

33
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.430
And similarly here where you've got something that looks like it's from days of Chaucer versus the typeface
33

34
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.560
for the Compaq computers branding
34

35
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.750
then again it looks very strange.
35

36
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.330
So try to make sure that the era of your typefaces are similar.
36

37
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.160
So to remember previously when we spoke about the different families within the serif and san serif families
37

38
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.950
where certain typefaces were from slightly older days versus some which were slightly more modern.
38

39
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.480
If you mix different typefaces that are markedly from different eras it can look very strange as well. But
39

40
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.210
if you get the mood of your typefaces right then you start creating some incredibly beautiful designs.
40

41
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.360
So to summarize the things that you should try to keep similar are the moods of the typeface as well
41

42
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.930
as the time era,
42

43
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.520
so combining something that's old with old and new with new. And the things that you should contrast
43

44
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.030
is the serifness, so a san serif heading with a serif body and vice versa.
44

45
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.910
And the other thing that you should contrast is the weight of your typeface.
45

46
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.680
So for example when you're working in a word processor, you only get the choice between regular and bold.
46

47
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.630
But actually when you download fonts in its entirety, you get a whole range of weights from light to
47

48
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.750
thin to medium to bold extra thick et cetera and you can play around with these different weights
48

49
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.940
contrasting them between the title and the body to create interest in your designs.
49

50
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.620
And finally these six fonts just never ever ever use them and stay as far away from them as you can because
50

51
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.110
no matter what you do they will pretty much never ever look good in design. And even if we're just designing
51

52
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.930
for the neighborhood bake sale, remember that practice is everywhere so don't relapse and go back to
52

53
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.870
comic sans.
53

54
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.990
It's not worth it.
54

55
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.590
OK.
55

56
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.770
And similar to- so similar to the tools I mentioned in the color theory part of the lesson,
56

57
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.900
I have some really nice tools that I like to use for typography as well.
57

58
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.500
There's one called WhatFont
58

59
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.490
which is a free tool for Chrome and Firefox I believe which allows you to essentially spy on the web
59

60
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.570
pages that you come across day to day.
60

61
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.530
So if you are reading the New Yorker and you're suddenly thinking "Oh you know what? That that font will
61

62
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.850
work really nicely for the project that I've got in mind."
62

63
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.780
Then you can use WhatFont to just highlight it and see what is the typeface they using, what's the size, what
63

64
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.930
the color, what's the
64

65
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.650
line height, what's the thickness of it,
65

66
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.280
what's the weight of it etc.
66

67
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.890
And it's really really useful.
67

68
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.000
Now what if you find a font that you like
68

69
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.560
how do you go about downloading it?
69

70
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.810
Well there's quite a lot of websites that cater to download.
70

71
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.440
So font.com is one such example.
71

72
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.720
But in most of them you do have to pay for commercial use.
72

73
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.440
But this website Font Squirrel has a whole bunch of fonts that are free for commercial use.
73

74
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.860
Then I like to use a tool called Sky Fonts which is a Mac app which allows you to incorporate a new
74

75
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.940
font into any of your application pretty much in two taps.
75

76
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.300
So it's a really really easy way of starting to use some of these new fonts that you come across.
76

77
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.870
All right so that was a whirlwind tour of typographic relating to digital design.
77

78
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.100
In the next section we're going to talk about user interface design and some of its intricacies relating
78

79
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.680
to mobile development.
79

80
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.260
So I'll see on the next lesson.
