So why exactly is app design even important?
1

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,180
Why are we dedicating this time to learning about it?
2

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:14,010
So currently in 2016, there's around 2 million apps on the iOS App Store and around 2.4 million on the
3

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,860
Android Google PlayStore.
4

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,420
That's a lot of apps.
5

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,320
When you release your own app into either platform, it's like a drop in the ocean. And 
6

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,760
in order for your app to stand out and to be downloaded, we need to care about design.
7

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,350
But also if you think about it despite all of your hard work, all of your blood sweat and tears that
8

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,960
you've poured into this amazing app, it only takes three taps for a user to completely wipe it from their
9

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,100
device and that's usually due to user experience problems,
10

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,310
they get frustrated with using the app or that it doesn't create an emotional response from the user.
11

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,760
Because at the end of the day how much a user likes your app is not related to how feature rich it is
12

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,120
or how good the code is, although those are important.
13

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,360
But the most important thing that actually makes people fall in love with your app is the design.
14

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,930
How easy is it to use,
15

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,370
how beautiful is the interface.
16

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,750
These are emotional responses that are not related to the features in your app or the code.
17

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,350
And that's why we need to focus on the fundamentals of app design in order to make your app as beautiful,
18

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,870
as delightful as it can be so that users will fall in love with it and hopefully you'll get those 5
19

20
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,070
star reviews that's going to propel you to the top of the App Store.
