Now a really useful tool is something called Review Monitor from launch kit which I think was recently acquired
1

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.330
by Google actually.
2

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.040
But basically what it allows you to do is to monitor all the reviews and ratings that get posted for
3

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.250
your apps either--
4

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.740
You can either get it sent to your inbox as soon as it happens or you can get it sent to your Slack
5

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.640
via chat.
6

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.890
So this is a really really useful tool because you always want to be on the pulse of what is happening.
7

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.140
Very often you see that you know a new version of iOS gets released and your app that works for iOS
8

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.020
9 no longer works for iOS 10 and starts crashing everybody's iPhones.
9

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.190
You want to know about that as soon as possible and and review monitor can be a great way of doing this.
10

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.090
So in summary, take review seriously, try and prompt users to give you a review after they've used it for
11

12
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.380
a substantial amount of time,
12

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.480
so that's usually three consecutive app opens for me. And the third thing is to make sure that you can
13

14
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.640
filter the unhappy, the confused and the happy users.
14

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.820
This way you can tailor your approach for them.
