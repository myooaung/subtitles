So the first thing I want to talk about is email marketing. I think the marketing veterans and the
1

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,450
pros all know just how much of a gold nugget this is.
2

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,710
But I feel like a lot of people who are coming into marketing anew they don't realize the full power
3

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,010
of email. And a lot of people think that it's dated or it's old or nobody uses email anymore.
4

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,120
It's not true.
5

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,690
Email is still king.
6

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,870
So one of the most important things you need to know about launching your app is that both app stores,
7

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,900
iOS and Google Play, take note of your stats
8

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:43,840
on the first 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days of its lifetime on the App Store.
9

10
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,060
So when you first launch, those are your most crucial periods.
10

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,670
And both app stores look at your metrics.
11

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,280
So this could be the number of downloads, it could be how many reviews you're getting, how positive reviews
12

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,750
are, how much time people are spending within the app, how often they're opening it up etc. etc. So essentially
13

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,800
they all have algorithms for detecting trending apps. And if they see good metrics within those periods
14

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,090
I mentioned then you have a chance of getting featured on the App Stores.
15

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,120
And I think it was last estimated that a feature on the front page of the iOS App Store was worth something
16

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,020
like around 300 grand in marketing budget.
17

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,790
So it's well worth trying and well worth doing.
18

19
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,640
Now the question is, how do you get those favorable metrics
19

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,330
when you initially launch? Well in order to do that you need an email list.
20

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,050
And the idea is that you collect you know around 10,000 emails or more of people who have explicitly
21

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,950
stated that they're interested in downloading your app.
22

23
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,890
Now this is not about buying an email list off the internet and spamming people.
23

24
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,220
Firstly, the problem is that you'll get very low deliverability. So your emails won't even reach the inbox.
24

25
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,690
It'll probably get stopped by the spam filter.
25

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,890
But the other thing is that it will drag down your credibility rating to the email service.
26

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:15,090
So if you try to send legitimate emails in you know in the future, you will have problems getting through
27

28
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:23,750
the spam filter because you've mass-emailed a bunch of people who labeled you as unsolicited spam.
28

29
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,380
So it's really important to only email people who actually want to hear from you.
29

30
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,830
This is not just a politeness rule, but actually it will determine your success for years and years.
30

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,020
So be really careful about that.
