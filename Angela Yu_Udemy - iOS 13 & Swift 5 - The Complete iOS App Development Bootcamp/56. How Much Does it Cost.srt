So one of the first things about Facebook ads that a lot of people want to know is isn't it really expensive?
1

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,580
And on a relative basis compared to something like Google adwords,
2

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,080
yes it is expensive.
3

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,530
You'll usually paying something between 50 cents and a dollar for one click.
4

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,670
So that click is simply a click from the Facebook platform onto the App Store.
5

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,870
It might not even equal a download.
6

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,710
So you have to be aware of these costs and make sure by acquiring that one user, you can in fact make
7

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,000
back the same amount if not more from that acquisition.
8

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,680
But on the other hand if you think about the minimum cost of Facebook advertising it's something as
9

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,170
low as a dollar a day.
10

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,450
It just means that your ad won't be as competitive as other ads and it won't be shown as often.
11

12
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,640
So there's two main styles of advertising. And one is pay per click
12

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:57,090
so this is how much are you willing to pay per click on your action button
13

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,310
so that could be download now buy now, whatever it is you decide to name it.
14

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:08,060
Now the other option is cost per thousand impressions or CPM. And this is where you pay for a thousand
15

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,260
people to have come across your ad.
16

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,290
Now that could be in the right hand side bar, that could be in the middle of the feed, that could be on
17

18
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,080
Instagram that could be basically a glance.
18

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:28,010
Now paper click or CPC is way more expensive than CPM and what you should do is to try and improve the
19

20
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:35,840
conversion of your actual ad so that you make those 1000 impressions really count and you can get more
20

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,410
clicks by paying less by doing so.
