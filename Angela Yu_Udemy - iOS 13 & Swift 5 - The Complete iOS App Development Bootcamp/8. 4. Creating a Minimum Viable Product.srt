00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,140
Okay. So what do you do once you've created the landing page and you've demonstrated that people are interested
1

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,930
in it?
2

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,890
Do you go ahead and pour in you know 30 grand 40 grand to build the app?
3

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,590
Or do you, you know, go ahead and spend six months or a year of your time and build a full blown version straight
4

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,250
away?
5

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,030
Probably not.
6

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,930
So the next step after you've demonstrated interest in your product is actually building what's called
7

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,420
a minimum viable product.
8

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,880
And this comes from you know the lean startup kind of methodology where you really don't assume anything
9

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,120
about your users or about your buyers and let them guide you in your development cycles.
10

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,360
So I'm going to bring back this example of Great little Place which is an app that allows you to discover
11

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
essentially cool things to do in London.
12

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,180
And it's I think it's user submitted with a little bit of curation as well.
13

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,600
And the reason I want to talk about it is because we saw earlier on how they collected emails through
14

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,280
their landing page and gathered interest in this app but they didn't go straight away
15

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,260
jumping into building the app. Instead what they did was spent you know five 10 minutes maybe building
16

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,210
a Facebook page.
17

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,940
And what they did was they use this to validate the concept even further.
18

19
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,810
So by having a page called "I know this great little place in London..." they publish posts on discoveries
19

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,620
or places, let other people of the community join and publish their own little tidbits of local knowledge
20

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,690
and they can look at how many people are interested in this.
21

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,060
How many people are reacting to the post,
22

23
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:44,460
how many people are liking the page, following the page and really being able to build a community around
23

24
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,840
this concept, being able to demonstrate that it works that people are interested in discovering these
24

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,230
little bits of no local knowledge.
25

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,190
It's very easy sometimes as a founder to get really carried away with your idea and believe that the
26

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,880
whole world needs it and it's obviously going to be a huge hit before you've demonstrated any of this.
27

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,650
Instead, the sort of more careful way of demonstrating interest by looking at sign ups, gathering those
28

29
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:18,720
sign ups those emails for later use and building a MVP or minimal viable product just to test out if
29

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,780
the concept works
30

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,410
and if people would actually use in real life. And sometimes you can see that people guide your product
31

32
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,850
development. For example on the Facebook page you've got people saying "Do you have an Apple app or do
32

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,860
you have an Android app?"
33

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,610
And by looking at how many people make these kind of requests, you can see how much interest there is
34

35
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,390
because they actually you know gone off their own back to write this.
35

36
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,620
So they're clearly interested in something like that
36

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,840
if it were available. Now your MVP will differ depending on what kind of product you have.
37

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,410
So usually for a lot of these kind of services or data orientated kind of products, Facebook page
38

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,340
is actually a really really easy way of doing your
39

40
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,160
MVP. Now this is another company called the Jamie app which the concept is very simple. It allows you to
40

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,010
meet other professional in the sort of startup adjacent world.
41

42
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:17,520
They could be designers, product managers, certainly interesting people. And the company sets you up with
42

43
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:24,270
a 30 minute meeting every Friday morning and even though they're called the Jamie app, they actually
43

44
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,650
don't have an app.
44

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,510
Instead what they have is an MVP.
45

46
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,490
So the beginning of every week, the app will send you an email asking for your availability on Friday
46

47
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,370
at 10AM and you can say yes or no.
47

48
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,990
And if you say yes, they'll set you up with a random person to me and you say no
48

49
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,500
then they leave you alone for the week until next week.
49

50
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:50,340
It's basically an interesting person that they found for you and allows you to really settle on a date
50

51
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,110
and time that you're both available and then essentially meet up and meet this random person.
51

52
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,170
So instead of jumping down the route of building a really complex app or you know putting in a whole
52

53
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,270
bunch of features, this is actually the core of the product.
53

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,790
It's just about setting up random people to meet once a week. And doing this via just sending emails
54

55
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,640
means that there's no infrastructure, there's no investment. You don't have to build anything.
55

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,810
It's just a MVP.
56

57
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,220
And by doing this they've actually gathered you know tens of thousands of users and they've demonstrated
57

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,770
a real need in this kind of product.
58

59
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,930
So the next step of their product development cycle I presume is actually getting a bit of funding and
59

60
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,660
being able to demonstrate that traction using your MVP. Being able to show look at how many weekly users
60

61
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,180
we have and how many people we've set up already,
61

62
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,390
this is clearly a need that people have
62

63
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,130
you're far more likely to get the interest of VCs or angels and people who can help you build this into
63

64
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,170
a real fully fledged product.
64

65
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:56,820
So before you really jump the gun and you know build the product of your dreams, think about what it
65

66
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,330
is that other people want and try to build a core version, a stripped down version of your idea so that
66

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,140
it really is just one concept.
67

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:12,480
Very often when we do these large talks and when we do some of the larger courses you hear lot of people
68

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,580
saying you know "I have an idea that's basically like Facebook meets laptop meets Twitter and I want
69

70
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,780
to launch it in like a week and it's going to be a huge success."
70

71
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,420
Well that will take quite a lot of building time to make
71

72
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:24,750
right?
72

73
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,010
Why not test your idea first?
73

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,050
See if people actually want it. Build a you know really really stripped down version and then see how
74

75
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,600
it goes. See what other features people want instead of presuming them because no matter how hard you
75

76
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,350
try, you can't know what the--
76

77
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,190
You can't really know what the hive mind wants or what it is that you know will be a success.
77

78
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,620
So build an MVP.
78

79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,520
Think about having a product where have all the features that you possibly want and take out one feature
79

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,600
at a time and keep asking people you know, would you still use this? Would you still use this? Would you
80

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,110
still buy this? Would you still buy this?
81

82
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,370
Until you get to the point where you have barely anything in this product and people are still willing
82

83
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,260
to use it or buy it. That is your core product, that is your core concept and build an MVP around that
83

84
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,520
and then test out and see how people respond to it.
84

85
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,560
Look at your growth, look at your traction, look at how many more sign ups you're getting every week,
85

86
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,490
look at how often people are engaging with your product whether it's on Facebook whether it's through
86

87
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,020
email. Doesn't really matter
87

88
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,730
just keep it really really simple.
88

89
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,840
Now this is a really good story.
89

90
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,040
There's a company called Gimlet that essentially makes these really great podcasts about startups about
90

91
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,060
the tech community etc. and have a whole bunch of really really good episodes.
91

92
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:50,400
One that I would highly recommend is a is a hour long interview with some of the previous employees
92

93
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,120
of Grooveshark which was this music streaming service.
93

94
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,700
And it's kind of a really sad story about how Grooveshark was run and how it eventually died. But the
94

95
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:06,160
sort of you know de-brief and analysis is really really interesting and I'll link it in the video below.
95

96
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,740
But another thing I'm going to link is on their episode where they built a minimum viable product which
96

97
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,570
is just a I think it was like a five minute video showing a prototype.
97

98
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:21,190
So it's not a real app, like you can't download it. It's just a bunch of images that's narrated with a voice.
98

99
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,430
And they showed this video to a bunch of listeners of their podcasts to see how many people would want
99

100
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:33,210
these features, which features they wanted, and they had this Google form at the end surveying essentially
100

101
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,460
what do you think is good,
101

102
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,680
what kind of features do you want
102

103
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,040
in this app, is an app even necessary?
103

104
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,050
That's always a question you should actually ask yourself before you build any app.
104

105
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,480
Should I be making an app?
105

106
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,750
Can it be a website? Can it be simpler?
106

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,140
But essentially they used the survey to gather feedback on their minimum viable product. And it's a really
107

108
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,780
good story or description on how the whole process works.
108

109
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,350
And I would highly recommend if you have a few minutes to spare
109

110
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,590
have a listen to that.
