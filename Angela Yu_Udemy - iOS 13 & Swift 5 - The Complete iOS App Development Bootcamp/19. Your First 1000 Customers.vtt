00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:00.720
All right.
1

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.410
So the topic I'm going to address today is super important.
2

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:12.150
And this is essentially how do you go about getting your first 1000 customers? Because they are the most
3

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.780
important people in your life as a startup or as a founder.
4

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.750
When you are big or when you're well-known when you have your reputation, your customers will come naturally.
5

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.410
The hardest part about launching a startup or launching a product are the first 1000 people who believe
6

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
in you and your vision enough in order to take a chance and buy it.
7

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.140
And once you've cracked that and you've got over a thousand customers, you are able to grow more organically.
8

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.480
You can spread by word of mouth or your website will start ranking on Google.
9

10
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.800
It's really the early phase when you have no reputation,
10

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.760
not a lot of capital to spend,
11

12
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.780
no word of mouth,
12

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.550
you are on like page 10 of Google
13

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.340
even when people search the name of your website.
14

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.760
So this is what that's all about.
15

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.680
And a lot of things I'm going to talk about don't just apply to apps but in fact any sort of business
16

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.390
or product that you're going to build. You're probably going to have to explore some of these techniques.
17

18
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.300
And there's a really really good article by Kevin Kelly on his blog which is linked in the text below
18

19
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.220
that I really recommend you read and it's all about this idea of 1000 true fans. And the concept is that
19

20
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.940
if you're creative or if you're somebody who makes things, essentially to survive what you need is not
20

21
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.310
a million people who like you but in fact just a thousand people who love you.
21

22
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.030
And we've certainly lived by this principle at the London App Brewery.
22

23
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.730
We really believe in building you know true fans who love our product or who love our business and we
23

24
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.520
go to the end of the world for them.
24

25
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.020
And I think it's a really good way of thinking about your customers
25

26
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.400
you know. It's just as in life you know if you try to please everybody
26

27
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.960
you won't really get anywhere other than displeasing yourself. And in business if you try to make your
27

28
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:12.030
market everybody i.e. my product is for everyone on Earth, then you won't have any real customers that
28

29
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.220
love your product.
29

30
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.580
So this is some prerequisite reading if you will.
30

31
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.630
And I think it's a really good starting point for marketing anything because so few people who live
31

32
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.560
by these types of rules and instead you have all these marketers who are chasing cliques who are trying
32

33
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.330
to spam everywhere.
33

34
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.850
And instead the problem is actually very simple.
34

35
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.890
You're trying to build a product that has value for somebody and you're basically trying to demonstrate
35

36
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.270
that value and continue to provide more value to them and in return you're rewarded for your efforts.
36

37
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.890
So in this module I'm going to focus on six topics that I think are underutilized in online marketing
37

38
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.920
in general and these all definitely apply to apps and-- but also they apply to--
38

39
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.090
but they also apply to other kinds of products that you might want to launch.
39

40
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.220
So if you have an app idea and this is going to help you a huge deal
40

41
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.820
I certainly wish that somebody told me some of these things when I first started out trying to feel
41

42
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.550
in the dark essentially. And I hope that they'll help you in your journey of launching your app or launching
42

43
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.100
your product in order to succeed with a huge bang, in order to succeed.
43

44
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.110
So without further ado, let's get started.
