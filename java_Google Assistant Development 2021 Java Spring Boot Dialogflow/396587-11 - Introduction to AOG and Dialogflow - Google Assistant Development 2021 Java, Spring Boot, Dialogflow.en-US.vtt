00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.110
In this video,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.700
we're work together on setting up or project on Google.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.750
So I navigated to chrome and type in actions on Google.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:18.070
And we should not Celik the the first inning for the developers Google that camp,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.650
but instead the second link that were directors to the console.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.450
That actions that google dot com on this page,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:40.240
which should the click or new project wait for the loader to finish.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.650
Okay.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.950
And for the project name,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:58.990
we can choose something like book management and click on Create Project on this page.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:09.230
War prompt with the some specific type off types off project that we can build what I'm

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.050
interested in the conversational type of project.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.470
Once I choose this,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.320
I'm redirected toe the for a second figuration page.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.550
You can see on actions that google dot com,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.050
and the first step is to decide how your action should be involved.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.290
Where Shankly,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.250
which will click on this on on for the display name,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.150

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.250
It's OK and click on the save button.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:08.050
Okay,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.470
and get started.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.700
Basically,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.850
by creating this actions,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.130
behind the scenes will be redirected toe dialogue flow interface.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.420
Over here,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.150
we can see some built in actions,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.150
but I will choose to create a custom intent.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.050
Once again,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:03:01.320
you can see the dialogue flow page being open and there are all sorts off configurations

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.530
that we can set up,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.550
such as the default language.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:18.100
30 full time zone can see that it maps to the project event fire on my Google platform and

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.170
I choosed book management agents such as,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.550

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.200
Wait for this to save.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.500
Okay?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.480
And you can see that basically this new agent has been created and it's ready to be

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.280
configured.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.850
