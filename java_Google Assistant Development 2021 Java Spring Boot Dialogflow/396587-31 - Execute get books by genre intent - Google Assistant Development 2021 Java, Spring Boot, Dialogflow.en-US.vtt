00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.300
Now it's time to invoke the full flow for retrieving Ah,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.550
book based on its general.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.430
So I have,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.900
ah,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.450
the application startup.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.050
I just clear the console for the lock messages to be properly shown on Let's start to Flow

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.050
.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.650
So let's type in something like get all novel books.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.950
This will really three all novel books,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.950
okay.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.120
And let's shoes.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.650
Ah,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.150
a book from here.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:01:03.090
Let's go with the war in peace so we can type in something like provide info for war in

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.650
peace.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:13.230
And you can see that we were able toe extract data from our a p.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:28.030
I Okay again door quick fix here just to add a space after the Yeah,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.740
over there one x 69 I want to add the space,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.250
but in the the year and,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.650
uh,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.150
and state month,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.250
this is just for a better visibility.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.840
In order to do this,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.990
we just need to go here and the with an empty space.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.890
Let's stop the server and the started.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.650
Once again,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:13.150
we can also do a training phrase such as book title.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.100
Since we don't need toe,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.650
add any additional ah,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.400
awards for our intent.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.110
Invocation.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.050
We just need to specify the book title.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.690
So let's do this.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.680
First,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.650
we'll extract the novel books,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.700
Okay,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.250
And now let's just simple say,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:03:00.740
war and peace as this is the book title and you can see it works and also we are able toe

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.330
