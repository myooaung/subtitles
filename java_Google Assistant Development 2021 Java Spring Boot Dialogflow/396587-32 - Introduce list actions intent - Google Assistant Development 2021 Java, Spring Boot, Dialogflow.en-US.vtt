00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920
so far,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.510
so good.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.750
We were able to build the business logic toe handle this intense,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.770
but somehow we need to had the user.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:20.350
We need to tell Google assistant that the he can provide specific operations to the user

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.020
something like,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.650
Um,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.770
help,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.920
help or support.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.150
Let's collect like this so we can build this using on additional intent.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.850
And let's call this intent list actions.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.950
Let's save this intent.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.260
So basically,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.530
what will happen is that we can,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.150
ah,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.430
ask Google home.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.910
What can you do or we'll do support?

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.250
And Google home behind the scenes will be ableto tell us what operations he has built in.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.250
So let's go with some training phrases such as What do you support?

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
Maybe another one.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.250
Tell me about you.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:32.710
Let's go Something like what features do have and what can you do?

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.850
Okay,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.170
now we don't need any slot feeling,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:55.840
but we will need this enable Web book called for this intent and let's save now under our

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.790
service,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.850
let's create this new intent.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:19.890
So least actions okay on let's go to our actions controller and over here will somehow need

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.530
to handle this intent.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.920
But this intent will not be handled by auto and book.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.510
What,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.070
in fact,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.650
will be handled by the Action Service
