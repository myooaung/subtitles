00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
Let's add the Guilt Boutique There's by author Business Logic under our spring put

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.750
application.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.300
So first,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:20.250
let's create a new intent public Started Final stream Get booed Details by authority

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:36.850
Constand Let's call it get book details by a lot or okay,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.590
now let's go on.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.550
There are actions controller.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.350
No effect.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:00.270
We should go on the book service and create a new a new metal toe.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.710
Basically handle the yet books pilot or get booked.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.550
It is by alter business logic.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.590
So I created or for intent,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.510
not a show for this.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:32.280
And ah has created method that we return on action response yet book details and we receive

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.550
actually requests us.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.950
Ah,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.370
where a mentor I'm building now.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.850
Ah,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:47.150
string builder object that will keep our response over here.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.370
And also,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:03.920
let's also set up our response builder that will be initialized with North Now is the first

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.630
thing we need.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.350
Toe extract the book book title Perimeter from the request since if you recall,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:30.900
we've have here the the book title para Meta so plus this string book title The request yet

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:40.520
Viral Mentor Book title It should map the same or name as in the intent to find under

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.450
dialogue flow.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:03:00.140
Now we toe find the book in our database that has this type of In order to achieve this

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:09.000
will need to go on their book repository and had than you met that find why title

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:23.280
containing in your case such as we to find the book that has a similar value with a title

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:39.400
that we provide and dirty in the s parameter Now book title equals pokery boy story and use

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.150
that newly implemented method.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:59.300
And if we were able toe find the book in our system we need to start creating the actually

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.050
poor response that will be sent to the user.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:19.470
Let's add a comment for this start populate er his phones that will be sent to user and

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.150
this will contain book details.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.860
So we'll start creating this.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.300
Ah,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:43.350
this structure Let's go on the book with Deal and the over here Our create a new list

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:52.050
similar to the previous tool is that we already have for previous cases.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.350
Unless called this list.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.850
Let's book details messages.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.000
It's so no,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.500
our a list and we will need a set off messages for this list I copy pasted here for you

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:23.560
guys who 30 view and similar toe Those two methods we will need,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.660
Oh,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.550
no additional metal to extract some more,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.260
some data,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.240
some random,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.250
a message from from the list.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:42.650
And now let's go to book service and start creating the actually response.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.500
So response.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.350
A pent book with deal.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.750
Get around them.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.250
Book deters message.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:10.980
So this will get a random message from the list,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.860
for example.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:12.660
Okay,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:22.650
here are the book details Now let's continue So response.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.250
Append book.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:34.350
Get Seiple and Ah,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:50.450
that's also concoct innate something like was published in Let's Get the Book Publication

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.950
Year.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:07:01.930
That's also do another concatenation such as and can be categorized as,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.250
Ah,

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.150
we need to set the general here.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:24.830
So response a Bend book Get Jonah has continued the process response upend That said that,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.350
uh,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.850
new message.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.940
But first the dot complete the sentence,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.650
and the message will be.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.350
Here is a short summary,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.650
and as the next step,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:48.550
we need to get the book summary so we're upend the book yet summary.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:08:01.600
And now let's create the response builder object with the response,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:12.720
and we will use the Method Toe and the conversation this method comes directly from the

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.590
actions on Go,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:13.910
go.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:20.030
This will end actually the conversation with the user.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.430
So but in ah,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:28.970
the Google assistant and the user So responds real dark your response builder at the

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.850
request at the response to sing and this method and conversation.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:41.450
And if we're not able to extract the book,

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.680
we will,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.150
uh,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
need another Ah,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.870
in four months,

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.350
you've met the message to handle this case.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:09:08.180
So I went toe book with deal An added public static final string not phoned message with a

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:08.960
statement.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.940
I did not found the request.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:21.050
That book Could you please try again?

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.950
The question mark.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:30.000
So let's add this.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.550
Ah,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.150
his message here.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.130
Response upend.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:44.880
So this message will be sent only if you if we were not able toe find the book in the

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.450
system.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.050
So not found message from the book with deal.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:10:03.640
And we need to create the response builder object with the response.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:11.700
But this time we should not end a conversation with the user Since we need the the new book

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.050
name response builder.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:29.440
Your response builder request had response to strength and as a final step,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:45.580
we need toe send back the response two years are are greater action response from the

00:10:45.580 --> 00:11:00.510
response builder build method there any turning back the actual response That's great.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:10.370
We implemented some some lines are quote for this matter toe handle this case and now since

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.550
book service will also handle this Ah,

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:21.590
intent is just a matter off adding that case right after these books by water,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:29.020
existing case and book service will know how to handle things very stoned off for intent on

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.300
notation this
