00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Since we have the entities set in place,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.870
it's a good time toe.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.950
Discuss about database.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.750
So for this court's,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm using my square low that are Berries in order to download and install it,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.720
you just need to navigate to Google chrome or any other Roeser type in ah,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.600
workbench,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.950
my school and go to the download section over here.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.750
You can choose,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.480
for example,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.150
the win those 64 mso installer and click on download.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.600
After you install it,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:01:00.640
you can open the my school workbench and you will see something like this and you can see a

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.710
connection being made for the default.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.550
My skull port free Free 06 So this is the default connection.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.520
I configured my school toe,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.050
have the user name route,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.370
and for the password,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.680
I use something similar.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.390
Since I'm working locally,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.670
I'm using the past words such as Pass.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.250
You can see that the password is by the far store it involved.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.450
Okay,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.550
let's close this since ah,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:45.870
when it to set up some are specific properties for springboard to be able to connect to the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.140
ah,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.550
my school database.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.910
So I navigated to application that properties and will just copy.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.150
Pay some properties and we'll explain each one of them.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.850
You can see that it's important Toe set up that that asshole's driver name.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.000
This is my school specific.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.750
Since you recall that were imported the maven dependencies for my school.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:23.090
The data sues U R l will have that that buries created for book management So that that the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.480
base will be called book management once again that that up race that that a source of user

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.680
it's ah route and the password.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.320
It's ah,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.150
past simple pass work.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.890
This will,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.450
uh,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:51.140
help us to see what the GP queries were made to the database online.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.850
12.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:00.830
You can see that I set up the high Borden eight dd Arlotto and also the my school dialect.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.850
So I navigate that back to the workbench.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.150
And over here we need to create the database called Book Management.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.210
Let's exit.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.810
Quit this,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.440
and you can see that the database has been created.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.350
Okay,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.900
so the next step will be to insert some authors,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.950
and some books to the database will do this in the following video
