00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
At this moment,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.350
we're already that's the least actions,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.750
corresponding intent and business logic.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.750
1/4 is demo session.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.750
I would not like to use the existing testing environment on the right side of the screen,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.400
but instead let's go on their integrations and you can see that we have the option to

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.050
choose between many,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.810
many testing tools.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.150
Let's choose the Web demo.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:47.400
You can see that we are able to test our our agent using go dialogue flow generated testing

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.950
environment on browser.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.810
So now I started the application,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:04.850
since the server was not running and we'll clear the logs one more time.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.650
Okay,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:19.330
And let's go under this book management agent console and let's test the least actions I've

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.960
type in.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.050
What can you do?

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.120
And you can see that I was able to return no response from the job application.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.110
Let's continue the the process,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.250
and I will.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.430
As for all drama books we received,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.250
the Hamlet has ah as thesis general type of book,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:59.150
and at the final step we were able to or return book specific details.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.560
So once again,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.290
this is an alternative way to use this there look flow,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.350
but toe test our tour
