00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.650
What we want now is to have some authors and books set up into the database,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.890
such as We will have some data to play with.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.750
So in order to achieve this,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:33.550
we can create a new class and let's call it load data in DB and this class misto implement

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.450
Colman's lined runner such as this Willow.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.350
This will run on application startup that's also annotated with the component.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:57.750
So in order to insert data,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.680
I was thinking to have free or doors and each other will have two books you can add,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.360
of course,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.940
as many authors and books as you wish.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.160
But ah,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.560
you don't need to see me typing all this data.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.300
So I made the research and will provide you with this text.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.480
I will copy Paste the longer,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:40.690
long texts here so you can see that I have created on Auto or Mark Twain a book Life on

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.620
Mississippi with Jarrah,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.430
the publication Year and the Summary.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.450
Same for the second book.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.540
So over here we have the book Juan,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:04.350
and also book to both books were added to the author's book Corresponding List,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.950
and now we'll need to save the Autor into the database.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.580
But in order to achieve this,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.200
we need to inject the authority depository.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.450
So private auto repository auto repository.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.950
Okay,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.110
that's what for this thing import and the not saved the auto to the database.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.720
So behind the scenes,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.550
this will also save the corresponding books.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.450
I'll do the same thing for the second author,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.760
and,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.300
ah,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.800
his corresponding books.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.740
So let's,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.210
uh,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.580
copy paste this long text once again,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.580
I will provide you with this.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.110
Ah,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.350
sample text that you can use.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.850
The second author is William Shakespeare,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.710
and I added here,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.400
too,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.350
off his works.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.890
Also,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:37.370
this long summary for each of these two books and two books were added to the author's book

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.150
list and save toe the database using the author repository.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.120
Now,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.350
let's do the same thing for the third and final water.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:01.130
I choose the Leo told story with the do off his books.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.350
Both of them are novel.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.050
So this is the third autor.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.920
Also,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.870
you can see that the summary is so it's a bit long,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:23.470
and the books were added to his list and saved to the database.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:34.750
Okay,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:44.130
so now we need the mechanisms to prevent this goto run each and every time the application

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.790
start,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.950
Since I only want the those theaters toe be set only once.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:03.650
So let's do something like if auto repose Story has any data.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.990
So basically,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.550
if it's able to find any alters in the database,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.090
let's ah,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.250
let's return from this ah method.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.890
So this for your Thorsen.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.050
Their corresponding books will be created on Lee once using this simple coat.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.150
Now it's time to start the application.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:44.550
Springboard Server is starting,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:53.620
okay?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.250
And you can see that Ah,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.510
author and book corresponding tables have have been created there.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.290
Also,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.750
the data has been inserted toe my skill that are Berries.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:15.700
Let's check this So we have the book management that our base on.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:27.620
Let's do a for select on the author and you can see that we have the three daughters being

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.250
set up.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.750
Let's do another Selleck for the book,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.160
and the books are present.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.680
Also,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.190
they have affording key toe the corresponding alter
