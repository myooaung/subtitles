X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
as the next step.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.350
I would like to set up the author entity and corresponding repository.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.850
So let's go on the management domain and create a new class.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:21.440
Let's call it auto or click on finish.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:35.900
And over here the first step is to annotate this class with the entity that's import from

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.750
Jack Box Persistence that entity.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:49.550
And we should also just a good practice toe set the stable name even if it matches the

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.700
class name with the first letter as lower case.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.010
Now,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.450
we'll,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.950
uh,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:07.450
like to add some so fields such as private long I d private sink given name.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.450
That's also add the last name also also string.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.850
Okay,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.650
looks good.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.360
Now we should generate the default.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.850
No argument,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.850
constructor.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.190
Actually,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:42.690
let's type it since it's ah simple Publico tour and also the public caught or swing given

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.750
name and last name.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:58.290
So this that given name equals with the perimeter provided as argument in the constructor

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.450
for the human name.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.050
And the same thing will happen for the last name,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:14.830
because the next step,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.580
we should in fact,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.670
Jerry Yeah,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.910
hash code in equals for both the given name and the last name just remove the I d for this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.650
example,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.950
and we should also jury the string method.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.850
Okay,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.460
I selected this once again,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.030
moving di di Since I'm not interested in it on,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.970
let's remove this statements and just your concatenation between the given name and the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.550
last name Something like this.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:09.250
Let's remove this and the spirits and keep the last name.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.790
Okay,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.850
this looks good.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:29.940
As the next step,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.750
I suggest to add some more spit specific away.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.370
G p a.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.050
Your annotations.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.190
So all remarked this as,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.560
ah,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.650
a primary key,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.550
the i D and also the jury that value.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.750
Let's use the straight strategies such as generation type identity.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.050
Okay,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.450
good.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.570
Next,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:14.050
Let's move for forgiven name to add The corresponding data will use the column annotation.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:25.050
Let's go with the 50 at the length This is required so annotated with not normal.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:38.530
And also let's go with the the size with the medium one value and the the maxim the maximum

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.680
sum should match.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.850
The 50 will do something similar for the last name,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.150
So courtroom link 50.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.060
Of course,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.000
you can change this,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:04.250
but this is just an example how you can implement a simple auto entity,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.050
so maximum should be 50.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.520
Okay,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.150
great.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.180
Now let's go on.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:24.950
There are Repository package and we're create the corresponding go J p A repository.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.050
Let's call it the auto repository.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:39.920
We'll annotate it with the repository stereotype and this should extend the spinning data

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.120
GP specific J p.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.160
A report story and it's who have the order and the long,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:59.090
long will match the type off the primary key such as the I.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.600
D.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.100
You can see that also,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:08.830
I set up some some constraints for the given name and last name toe be unique.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:18.110
This is just an example that I choose for these so author entity and also generated the get

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.150
our sense setters.
