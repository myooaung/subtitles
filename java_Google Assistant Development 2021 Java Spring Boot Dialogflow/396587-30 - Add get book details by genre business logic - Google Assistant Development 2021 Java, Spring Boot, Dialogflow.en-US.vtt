00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
so I think you might see that Get book Details by author is somehow similar.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.040
Toe get book details by Jara.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:17.990
So let's try to somehow or use the existing business logic from get book details by author

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.020
and basically or use it.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.130
Forget book details by Jara,

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.450
since the code is somehow common.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:36.850
So I went to book service and go somehow.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Let's go here.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.450
Let's create the new Let's create the new intent.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:01:06.150
Let's call it for intent and this will handle the get book details by water on.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.370
Let's create the corresponding method that will create that were returned the action

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.050
response.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.450
So get book details by water.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.730
You can see that I'm going with her.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.850
A method name that it its more descriptive.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.450
Let's add the specific logging message,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.840
executing,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.650
intent,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.350
intent to deal.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.450
Get Booked eaters by Arthur.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:50.150
And this method will in fact called the get book details existing Met it.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.550
Okay,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:02.730
so let's remove that annotation from the method from the previous method on.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:11.390
Let's create a second intent that will handle the get book details by Jara.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.950
So both off this Ah,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.370
both this metals will in fact,

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.450
behind the scenes.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.750
Expect the book title and based on the book title,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.250
we'll use this concho toe basically really turned,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.650
Ah,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.950
detailed description off the book to the user.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.660
So intent you still get book details about general and same thing.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.150
We need to call that method,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:03:01.240
and I think that's basically we have to intense that will invoke the same same business

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:13.250
logic to create the detailed book description so as a nest next step would just need to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.450
invoke the new intent to see it in action.
