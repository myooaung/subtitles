00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.050
has continued the development off entities and the Let's work on adding the book entity.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.850
So I created a new class called book.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:26.440
We need to annotate it with Java Persistence Entity and also let's at the table name to be

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.950
a book.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.800
We need the I D for the primary key.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.250
Let's add a title of the book.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.240
Also,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.450
we can work with the Jaar off the book publication year,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.980
and let's also add the summary.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.200
Now it's a good thing toe.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.550
Add on on government constructor for our book entity and also a constructor with arguments

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.950
So Public book.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:18.550
We'll use the title now Zara and the publication year,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.650
but somebody will be added as a setter at a later point.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.960
Ah,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.750
this title Zara and the publication here.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.550
Okay,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.890
and now it's a good thing.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.350
Toe generate getters and setters.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.800
Let's remove the I.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.250
D.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.950
Okay.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.250
And those generate are hash code in equals methods,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:06.550
and we also need to sing method who are here.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.560
We're not interested in the i d genre in summary,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.650
since I more interested in the title for the to sing method.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.690
Okay,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.570
let's save us.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:39.110
Looks good and now we need to add some specific JP connotations.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.370
So this is the I D,

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.830
such as primary key,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.130
the jury value with the strategy that seems tragedy,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:59.800
the strategy as for both or so we'll use the identity now looks move toe the title,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.680
and we will use the column linked as 100 and cities as,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.180
ah,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.950
unique.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.850
This is just something that I choose for this example.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.490
They should be required.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:31.530
And also the size should be between minimum one in the length off the column 100 something

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.150
similar for the genre.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.350
So length 50.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.870
This is also required,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:53.350
and the size once again between no minimum one and the new length for this column.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.950
50 for the publication year I was just made.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.180
Make this,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.750
Ah,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.310
a mandatory field.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.120
So not nor and now,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.050
for the summary were will need a long summary.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:28.250
So linked 1000 for the column not nor in the size between minimum one in 1000.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.650
The column length okay,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.450
looks pretty good.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.590
We have,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.080
ah,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.470
all the pieces Now we should book toe,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.850
move to the repository package and create the book repository.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:05:05.760
Let's hear are notated with the repository and let's extend the JPL report story for book

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:14.830
and long as they identifier so things look pretty good.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:26.390
What we need to do now is to somehow connect the water and book entities so we'll do this

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.350
in the following video.
