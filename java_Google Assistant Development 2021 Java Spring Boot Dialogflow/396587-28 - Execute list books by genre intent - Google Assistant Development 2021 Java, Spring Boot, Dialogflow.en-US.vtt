00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
so now it's timeto execute the list Books by General intent,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.500
if you'll recall,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.690
was set up in place.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.150
The business logic.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.790
Let's now start,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.110
though.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.170
Server case.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.890
Avery Starting spring with application with the embedded Tomcat server and political that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.550
we have anger rock behind the scenes.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.860
So let's wait a few seconds.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.350
Okay,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.390
has cleared the logs on Let's Go.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.800
It's something like,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.360
Ah,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:01:02.600
get or novel books unless presenter and you can see that we were able to extract all the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.560
novel books from the From the Springboard job application And behind the scenes,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520
the MySQL databases is invoked,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.450
and we are searching for once again for all novel books you can see here.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.910
This is just the just to prove that these two are novel books based on the general that we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.550
set up
