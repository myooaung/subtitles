00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
let's continue our process and build our next intent.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.720
So if you recall in the previous video,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.180
we were able to extract the list of authors and we want the user toe.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.700
Now select on author and based on the Arthur will provide him with the list of books.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.250
So let's go under the intense of the work here.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.950
Let's add a follow up intent.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.340
We have multiple options,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.150
but we'll go with custom.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:49.610
A select the intent and,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.120
ah,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.100
let's call it Let's remove this cost.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.350
Um,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.830
on uh,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.540
basically,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:14.570
I want this toe Toby called least books by author.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.450
You can see that we have the context least offers follow up.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:33.570
This is the context for the Google home after Google Home Finishes with the least author's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.010
intent.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.050
So is the follow up from the previous intent.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.630
It's important for us to know in which context we are,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.630
such as well controlled,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:55.210
the corresponding business logic for the training phrases we can ah use the given name and

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.950
last name off the author.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:09.540
But we need American is to somehow change and actually extract this these values from the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.280
Google home,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.450
so we'll need to use this building and it is that Google home provide.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:29.050
So I selected given name and school a bit we can search for sees that given name.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.960
The new value will be out of there sooner.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.190
Names Okay,

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.150
we should add it.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.650
And the same for for the last name.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:03:01.600
Let's select the last name Scroll down a bit and select the cyst last me So once again

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:11.480
given name and last name will be will actually act as slots in our Web service requests

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.880
that is received from Google Hope.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.440
Okay,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.750
we saved this and you can see that the given name and last name.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.650
Ah,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.750
some some perimeters added over here we should mark them us required.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.450
Okay.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:04:01.800
And let's add some additional training phrases That's type let's select given name and the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.550
last name.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:11.340
So once again given name and last name will be use that slot will have.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.990
For example,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.050
let's select Leo Tolstoy or let's select Mark Twain.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.500
Okay,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:32.100
I saved this intent that's have some additional training praises for agent training.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:43.110
So I want to know about given name last name So you can imagine this like I will tell

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.850
Google home I want to know about William Shakespeare.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:05:03.150
Let's say this one also and then save and maybe one more.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:13.050
There will be more about given name and last name.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:23.450
Selected this slop and the slot for the last name,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:36.940
Click on Save and then saved agent training completed.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.300
So far,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.800
so good.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.550
The agent is basically trained for this type of intent.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.950
Let's scroll down a bit.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.560
Let's a copy base than the basically.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.890
I want to change this list.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.090
Authors cost,

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.260
um,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:04.550
to lease Books by Author toe have everything in place.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.770
Okay,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.050
we're not at any responses but will use the fulfillment,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.350
and we were enabled the weapon call.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.410
And also we need the weapon.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.350
Call for slot feeling for both the given name and last name.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:30.550
Since we need to extract those two values under our springboard job application,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:41.920
let's save once again this intent agent training completed.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:56.850
Let's go to intense and you can see that for the least author's intent,

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:04.060
you can see the context this list autres follow up.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.600
So after the Sinton finishes we are on the list.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:18.050
Daughters follow up context and before this book by author will start,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:28.050
this will start from a specified context such as least daughters follow up context,

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.250
so this too intense are related
