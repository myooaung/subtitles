00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
Let's start implementing the business logic for our least author's intent were able here to

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.450
extract the intent name,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.340
and first.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:22.570
But I would like to do is tow give each and every time a random message our and the message

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.950
that is ah,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:34.180
received by Google assistant and also random message that will will be added to the list

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.690
off authors response.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.390
So let's try to do this.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.150
First.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:49.210
I created this Ah auto brutal class and we'll have to to initial this off messages here.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.850
The 1st 1 is list off message messages for incoming requests,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:04.750
basically for the least author's intent,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:24.030
and the 2nd 1 will be the list off messages sent as sent as response once again for the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.410
least author's intent.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.080
So let's build a lists.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.970
Will use static list Public study,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.890
Static finalist,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.900
string off type string.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.080
Let's call it at least off oh,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.950
tours messages and will be on your A list.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:02.500
Let's import the corresponding interface in class,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.750
and we will create the second list Public static final list of string.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:29.740
Let's call it list off auto or selection messages and once again on your A list now under a

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.920
static block I would like to set up some some default messages that Google assistant can

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.150
use for both our list of authors intent double tours,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.770
requests and also response.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.950
So just copy paste here the list of messages.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.340
So once again,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.450
when the list of voters intent is invoked,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.450
we'll tell Google assistant Wilder messages such as Final.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.750
Here is the list of authors,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.550
and after this,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.370
after the list will be created,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.300
we will had the response.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.820
Searchers.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.150
I can provide least off authors if you choose another.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.650
What I'm building now it's,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:33.630
ah mechanisms toe ad each and every time or random message since I don't want Google

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.100
assistant toe tell us each and every time,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.150
the same the same response.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.350
So she he should be ableto around the message from both please.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:59.850
So I created this method where I will create the A random next thing from the initial list

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.850
.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.350
This the voters messages.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:14.550
So the list of authors value will have various between zero one in two.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.940
So,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.610
based on the A random value,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:27.350
will extract that that random value from the list of voters messages and sent it back toe

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.810
to the user.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.080
Asked this Ah method response.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.650
We should do the same thing from for the second list.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.970
Okay,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.750
I'll create the second method now.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.450
Public static string.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:05:00.050
Get around them authors selection message.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:08.800
And once again we will create ah on integer valued that will get a random message from the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.690
second list,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:32.350
your random next thing off list of voters selection messages and also get the size here.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:40.050
Harry turned that random statement from the second list.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.980
Okay,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.310
good.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.530
So we have implemented the mechanisms to get a random message each and every time this

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.150
lister or Taurus intent will be requested.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.330
So in the next video,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:07.400
we'll see how toe actually use this business logic once again,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:19.130
list of voters messages that is the the random or method for the 1st 1 And at the bottom,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:26.410
you can see the random method for the second list that would once again extract the or and

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.850
a message from it.
