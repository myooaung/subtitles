00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
uh,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.880
blessings.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.630
Today's Lesson three of dog psychology.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.150
What we're gonna be talking about today is how not to confuse the dogs in the three three

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:45.850
main ways that were confusing our dogs over thousands of clients and thousands of dogs

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.520
being trained.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.490
Usually it's always some of the same reasons why there's confusion,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.750
which produces a struggle.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.730
And today,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150
that's what we're gonna be going over number one.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.540
The first way to really confuse your dog.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.200
First and foremost is when they do something they're not supposed to.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.560
We say their name to get their attention,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.720
and then we scold them again.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.530
I'm going to repeat one of the main ways that we can confuse their dog is when we say their

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.750
name Rufus and the dog looks and then we discipline.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300
We scold.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.000
We do something where the dog understands it's not affection.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.080
And with the difference is is that with humans and with Children,

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.570
we can differentiate what our name,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.190
our trigger word is and the actual scolding so to a dog.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.880
If they hear Rufus No,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.250
What starts to happen is every time Rufus gets called instead of Rufus Yeah,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.370
what should I do?

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.250
What can I do,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.250
it turns into what's wrong with my name.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.220
And if you have a dog and if you if you scold them with their name and they shy up or they

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.250
become submissive,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.150
that's confusing them.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.550
We want their name to be something that's utilized for positivity.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.860
How we can make this different is instead of Rufus.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.560
No,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.110
it's no.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.580
And then the dog looks at you.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.170
Rufus.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.740
Yes,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.650
you have my attention.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.750
Come,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.250
we're off.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.610
Whatever else he wanted to do,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.150
Number two,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.200
another extremely important factor to remember.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.550
If we do scold our dog or discipline,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.200
we want to make sure that we don't discipline.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.850
And then right afterwards,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.090
being that were humans and we're very catering.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.930
We want to show the animals that we're sorry and that we forgive them.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.050
So we show them affection.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.010
And in a sense,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.390
it's like giving him a smack and then giving him $100.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.810
The smack isn't going to be hard enough for them to not want $200.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.450
So if we continue to discipline and then we show affection right afterwards,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.350
they will never really know that what they did was negative or unwanted in the first place

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.380
and you're canceling out your correction.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.950
Not good.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.430
We want to make sure that we give the dog the opportunity to understand the difference

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.570
between affection and discipline so they don't get that confused as well.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.150
So as an example,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.270
let's say we're walking Rufus down this road and here comes another dog and Rufus starts to

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.510
show signs of aggression or uncomfortable it and he starts to bark and we stop Rufus and we

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.680
say,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.950
No,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.290
we're not gonna have that anymore.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.040
Attention to me immediately afterwards,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.190
as soon as Rufus stopped,

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.550
I do not want to praise him.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.650
All that will show Rufus and his psychology is that whatever he did,

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.300
it was okay.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.970
He just had to stop,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.350
and then he would get affection.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.000
So the action in the root cause of the problem never ever stops.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.490
Rufus just barks quicker.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.960
It's It's a little bit faster.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.280
Maybe,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.050
but it's still confused of what he was doing is wrong or not.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.050
So we have to give a whole another scenario.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.340
We have to set the situation up a whole nother time,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.050
if not 234 times.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:35.290
And now we walk Rufus right back past that dog in the Rufus erupts again starts to bark.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.280
We stop him again.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.730
We go back 1/3 time the third time,

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.200
Rufus says.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.590
You know what?

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.650
Struggling isn't working.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.120
It's much easier if I just look up to you for advice.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.370
Since you're becoming my leader,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.090
I don't have to worry about that dog anymore.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.750
That third opportunity was the opportunity where now we can come in with affection.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.170
Now we will not confuse the animal by disciplining and showing affection.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.750
Within the same scenario,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.250
we need to give ourselves more time in between to cut that amount of confusion.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.780
Number three.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.030
All too often,

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.150
people say,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.080
Berhard,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.880
I tried this system.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.940
I tried this system and I tried this system and tried this system,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.790
and I tried 15 different things in three days to try to get my dog to stop doing something

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.480
again.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.920
Family.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.730
This is very,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.200
very confusing for the dog.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.500
They work much easier and much more simply if we go straight and we just have more

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.250
repetitions in whatever we were doing.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.280
Dogs are very intelligent.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.050
They could pick up on thousands of different ways to train them,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.210
but really,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.950
if they could talk to you.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.720
What they would say is this.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.550
Please use one and just make sure you're really consistent with what that IHS.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:57.450
If we do not allow the dog to have enough repetition in a specific way of doing something,

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.950
it will only cause more confusion if we switch and when we switch,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.380
What if they were right about to get it?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.100
We switched right beforehand,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.110
and now they're confused,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.090
and now they have to go through a whole nother process of learning a whole different way.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.490
And at the same time we become frustrated.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.280
And if you've been one that has tried many different systems in many different ways with

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.110
your dog and the dog just seems to get more confused and more confused and we're blaming

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.950
our dogs,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.460
it's a good time to understand where that confusions coming from.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.210
It's coming from with inside of ourselves.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.720
We are not being repetitive enough in the same system.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.710
We are not being consistent enough for our dog,

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.900
and how can we expect them to be consistent if we can't be consistent as the leader?

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.400
That's not an effective leader that's not an efficient leader,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.250
and it's not a leader that they can trust.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:53.840
So we're going to recap what will confuse them the most one using their name as a form of

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.370
discipline.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.990
We don't do that.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.450
We separate their name and no number two.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.950
If the dog does something wrong,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.710
we want to make sure that we don't discipline and show affection right afterward.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.890
And the third.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.850
Last but not least,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:19.080
we need to make sure that we stick with one system for a long enough period of time between

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.550
25 to 50 repetitions before we expect our dog to get it whatsoever.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:29.670
And then we need to have an opportunity to go another 25 to 50 repetitions when there's

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.650
distractions around.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.650
So if you're thinking to yourself,

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.480
why is my dog confused?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.180
It is probably due to one of those three,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.090
if not all of them.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.410
90 plus percent of people don't catch that,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.790
and it's because as humans are human psychology,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.450
we do that with our own Children,

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.570
and we get away with it because of rationalization.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.150
The child understands the difference between discipline and affection.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.900
The child understands the difference between their name and discipline.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.190
A dog won't.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.850
We'll take a moment and really feel into ourselves.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.770
Where is this happening?

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.750
When is this happening?

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.050
Now we have an opportunity to change it.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.730
Now we have an opportunity without any formal training,

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.550
simply just from psychology alone.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.390
To understand our dogs much better,

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.420
much more effectively without confusion.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.850
Enjoy This week.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:36.390
Enjoy Today I would start to better relationship with your daughter blessings and until

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.650
tomorrow trained play.
