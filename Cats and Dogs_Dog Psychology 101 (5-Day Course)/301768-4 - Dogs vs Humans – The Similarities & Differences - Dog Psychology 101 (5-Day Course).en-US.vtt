00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910
today,

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.950
we're gonna be talking about the differences and similarities between dogs and humans.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:29.150
Now you're in my home,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.590
My large.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.750
The bears done Thank you for coming back a little bit about me.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.380
I've been professionally training dogs for over 10 years.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.130
I've learned from different quote unquote Master's read lots of books,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.550
just like I'm sure a lot of other dog trainers did.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.570
And what really set me apart was being able to get in front of the amount of dogs that I

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.900
did.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.480
Thousands and thousands of repetitions and thousands and thousands of dogs.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.450
And in doing so,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:09.730
growing and needing more land coming up on top of the mountain with the dogs sleeping

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.600
outside.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.240
The past couple of years,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.970
I've slept in a teepee to be able to connect more,

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.270
not only to myself,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.030
to nature,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.930
to the elements,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.050
to dogs.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.650
We all sleep outside.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.650
We sleep outside together,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.770
we train together.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.750
We live together.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.650
So for the past 10 years I've been a deep,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.560
humble student,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.930
two dogs and wolves,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.650
and I'm happy to be able to share with you what I've learned and how much we are similar.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.300
They say the dog is man's best friend.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.870
And there are reasons for that,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.050
not just to have a fun line to say,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.450
and they're also very,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.940
very big differences To start,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.600
we'll start off on similarities.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.250
Dogs as well as wolves and humans are both pack animals.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.890
We move in groups and packs,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.030
and we do that for safety.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.600
We do that for resource and protection within that pack structure.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.550
What's also similar is that we learned through physicality is and repetition touch.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.150
Tactile nous is extremely important,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.900
and how we touch is extremely important to make sure the dog feels safe to make sure that

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.960
we feel safe to make sure that we feel supported and embraced.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.070
Another similarity is that it makes us feel more comfortable when we know there's a leader

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.690
that we can look up to.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.230
We don't have to figure everything out by ourselves,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.970
especially at times when there's heavy distraction and confusion.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.450
The similarity is that we both are species.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.310
Both needs discipline of some sort and affection.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.950
To truly understand those physicality ease before words actually mean something.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.350
There needs to be a physical before we truly understand what I love you can possibly mean

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.380
there needs to be soft touch,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.480
a sense of safety,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.610
a sense of protection.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.710
That's something that's very similar with us.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.150
It feels good when we show each other affection.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.080
It's one of the reasons why there are so many service dogs in therapy dogs that chemically

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.620
in our brain.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.600
As soon as we touch the animal in a soft,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.410
gentle way,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.980
the endorphins start to flow.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.520
The serotonin starts to flow.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.950
The dopamine starts to flow.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.510
Those are the feel good chemicals with inside of us,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.650
so to be able to tap into that with each other is very special.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.010
And now let's go into differences,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.360
although we are as human beings and wolves were both living,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.220
breathing,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.860
feeling,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.150
thinking animals.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.590
But there are differences in the way that we think the first main difference is how we

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.350
process.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.850
Typically at the age of 3 to 4 years old.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.980
Children start to have a process of rationalization where we can rationalize what our next

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.920
movement is going to be for what we feel is going to be best.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.770
Dogs do not have that capability.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.110
They will never have that capability.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.600
They based what they do off of if it works or not.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.280
their life Experience dictates that it's extremely important because it's one of the main

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.050
reasons why humans humanized Doug's because they think that they also rationalize.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.350
So as soon as we can get that out of our mind and that the dog is very simple in its nature

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.350
,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.090
if something works,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.200
they'll continue doing it until it doesn't work anymore.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.700
And then one of two things happen.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.260
We either dictate what the next reaction will be in what needs to be taught or we give it

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.360
it.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.460
Leave it up to them to have a different,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.250
an alternative way of doing something.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.490
They're very opportunistic in their basic nature.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:20.460
They will take the path of least resistance every single time were given the opportunity as

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.120
humans.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.830
What different shapes between that is We typically continue to do the things that do not

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.520
work over and over and over again,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520
but we expect them to change.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.150
We accept.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.750
We expect a different result,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.390
which some people consider is the definition of craziness or insanity.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.410
Dogs don't have that they will do.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.650
It works until it doesn't work anymore,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.450
and then it will switch and how much more simple it would be if we picked up on that.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:58.990
Another difference is that a dog's basic nature from birth is to be dominant.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.770
And although there are different varying degrees of dominance and or submissiveness,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:13.150
it is very important that the basic nature of the dog is to be dominant.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.300
It is to take lead.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.640
It is to protect itself.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.450
It is to challenge when necessary.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:27.650
And I believe that the first peoples we're also dominant.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.160
However,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.890
over the past couple of thousands of years of breeding in different programming

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:44.290
indoctrination and a submissive way of being that now human beings are basic,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:51.080
nature has turned into one of being very submissive and by meaning submissive.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.150
It is that we are very easily willing to be led,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.610
and we don't really have to expect much and being that were so submissive by our basic

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.120
nature.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:09.510
So catering and forgiving the majority of the time,

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.190
would I have found my decade of professionally training dogs and people is that it's one of

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.550
the main ways that were confused.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.050
We generally I just want to be submissive,

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:29.260
and the majority of dogs tend to take the dominant role much easier for us to understand

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.690
that and to understand that from their perspective,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.000
as long as they continues to work,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.900
they will keep doing it.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.920
If it continues to work that they protect,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.820
they'll keep doing it.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.380
If it continues to work to go to the bathroom in the house,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.650
they'll keep doing it.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.580
If it continues to work to dominate,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.600
they'll keep doing it.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.790
And in return,

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.450
if it works for them to become submissive,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.950
if it works for them,

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.350
they will do that as well.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.750
But we have to be the ones that dictate that relationship.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:15.550
So the main similarities and differences recap we both move in groups and packs.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.050
We both learned from physicality is and repetition.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.100
We both need affection and or discipline.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.820
We need to feel like that.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.850
We have a place within our structure.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.150
We want to make sure that we're not confused.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:40.670
We're loved and showing affection to the main differences are we rationalizes human beings

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.510
Well,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:48.120
it takes us a while to truly live in an opportunistic way of taking the path of least

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.790
resistance,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:55.790
continuing to do and to move in the ways that work and changing the ways that don't not

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.300
expecting something different,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.450
but doing the same thing.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.120
It's time for us to learn a little bit more to embrace a little bit more the way the dogs

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.860
air so special,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.980
just being dogs and not humanizing them,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.290
not giving them human emotions for human reasons,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.180
in human rationale that will only confuse things.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.510
It will only bring Comore confusion and more struggle to your relationship.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.450
Dogs air so special just the way that they are.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.430
Our memories are extreme,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.650
but there's your even more.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.850
Our capabilities are extreme and so are theirs.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:41.560
So we'll appreciate ourselves as humans and what give us our natural capabilities and

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.150
instincts and nature,

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.640
and we'll do the same thing with our dog.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:54.930
The homework for the second video dogs versus humans is to really see and thinking,

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.190
too,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:03.720
how and if we are humanizing our dog and how we're putting human emotions for human reasons

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.150
in human rationale into anything that the dog may be doing.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.580
If that's happening,

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.950
let's go ahead and pause.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.450
Let's understand where humans we think the way that we do and that it may not make sense,

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.350
and that may be the first step,

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.200
and understanding your dog more is to understand that maybe we don't know that much about

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.610
them and in turn,

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.990
and understanding ourselves more.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.450
Maybe we understand we don't know that much about ourselves.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.440
So sit with your dog.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.300
Sit,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.750
be in meditation.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:44.420
Being the thought process of how we can be showing up more in the very first way is is

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:51.920
understanding in them and appreciating them for being dogs for their own instincts and

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.550
their own basic natures that we will not be able to breed out of them.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.080
Dogs are dogs.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.200
The descendant of wolves.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:08.230
Genetically still 99.8% the same as a wolf will honor that will respect that will cherish

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.450
that.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.550
And we're gonna learn so much because of that.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.680
Enjoy the homework.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.890
Enjoy the meditation.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:22.960
This is a wonderful exercise to go introspective and to figure out how we can understand

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.550
our dogs that much more.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:29.050
Thank you for coming and listening to the second video.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:35.240
Thank you for taking one extra step in a better relationship between you and your dog,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.920
and I'll be seeing you tomorrow.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.850
Until then,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.250
train
