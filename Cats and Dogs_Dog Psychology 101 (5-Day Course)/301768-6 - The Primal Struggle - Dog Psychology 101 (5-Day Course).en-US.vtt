00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.070
blessings.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.660
Thank you for tuning.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.140
And again,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.810
this is Day four and dog Psychology 101 Today we're going to be talking about the primal

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:35.690
struggle in dogs by our basic nature.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.890
Human beings are very catering.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.150
We want to forgive.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.810
We want to make excuses.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.950
We want to placate.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.350
It's much easier for us to do that for dogs,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.850
their basic nature from birth.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.150
It's very easy for them to be dominant.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.190
Within that dynamic,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.600
there are times will be struggles.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.280
And as we went over in the previous video of the confusion,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.050
what will be confusing them the most?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.090
It's vitally important that we talk about this struggle.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.150
When a dog is confused,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.400
it's struggles.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.300
It will struggle first,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.380
psychologically feeling to itself.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.720
Well,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.850
I've been the leader for so long.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.550
What do I do?

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.890
I can show dominance and dominance can look many ways.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.720
I conjuncture.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.280
I can make noise.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.100
I can try to pull away from the leash.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.900
I can act like I'm not listening.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.150
I can go the complete opposite way and not come back to you.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.260
I can make it hard on you because the definition of dominance is not willing to be led.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.800
And then on the flip side,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.280
if the dog becomes submissive when the struggle happens,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.450
that can look like paying more attention energetically in their body calms down.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.370
There's a big difference in submissiveness and fearfulness.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.520
Fearfulness would be doing everything in there capability to get away from you to get away

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.570
from this situation.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.970
Today we're talking about the dominant and submissiveness,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.930
and in that struggle,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.950
what we're looking for is to make sure that when we get the dogs attention,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.990
that they become more submissive,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.980
more easily willing to be led.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.590
Okay,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.600
you have my attention.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.010
Now what should I do?

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.910
I don't I don't know.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.420
I don't want to struggle physically,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.950
so I'll just sort of give in.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.050
The first struggle,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.150
after psychologically struggling,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.850
will be a struggle in the physical dogs.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.490
Do it with other dogs for dominance reasons,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.350
and it will also do it with humans.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.610
However,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.960
what happens is is that we assume that a dog at times will struggle with other dogs and we

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.740
just have to figure it out.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.110
That's what I hear a lot and I don't agree with that because if that struggle happens to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.790
humans,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.650
that's when we say hope the dogs aggressive hope the dog needs to be euthanized.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.540
There's no trainer that can train this specific dog,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.950
because now it's showing aggression.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.780
And we have to understand that aggression is not emotional to a dog.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.490
It's a byproduct of confusion and struggle.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.090
It's like I said before they could struggle in a way of becoming submissive.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.350
Taken,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.960
struggling away,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.400
of becoming more dominant in that more dominant struggle typically equals to aggression.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.150
But it's not because they're mad at you.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.870
It's because it works.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.730
So when the aggression pops out,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.050
that's also due to being confused.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.060
It's not being a bad dog.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.380
It's not being a mean dog.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.850
They're confused of what's gonna work best to keep themselves safe.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.800
So when we take lead over our dogs,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.270
if they are the leader and they're already growling and they're already snapping at us,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.210
possibly even biting us and then you try to take over as their leader,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.270
we have to assume there will be a struggle.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.560
That struggle will pass the psych psychological aspect of it.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.100
It will go to the physical.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.150
We have to be very safe at that point,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.500
safe in our minds,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.380
safe in our body.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.410
I'm gonna teach you how to do both.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.510
But for today's video,

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.880
we need to understand this.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.200
We need to understand that if our dog is showing aggression,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.680
be it with another dog or a person or a child,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.090
or do toe resource guarding.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.070
Whatever the case,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.920
maybe it stems from confusion first and that primal struggle in a dog.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.850
It will do whatever works.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.480
The fastest aggression starts to work well,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.020
that that will be the struggle that we're having to deal with.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.350
That does not mean the dog needs to be euthanized.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.550
And this is happening all too often.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.110
And over my 10 year career,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.410
thousands and thousands of dogs.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.040
When I go into the vet offices,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.810
they tell me again,

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.000
Yep,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.210
we had to euthanize another one.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.440
Yep,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.680
we had to euthanize another one.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.890
People couldn't get it trained.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.320
That never has to happen.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.380
A dog never needs to lose its life due to aggression.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.150
We're due to confusion.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.290
They can all switch.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.750
We can pre program every single one of them.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.300
We just have to know we have to be able to embrace that struggle.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.730
You got to keep ourselves safe to know,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:30.410
to keep the dog safe to make sure that we don't add to the confusion and show aggression

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.550
towards our animals.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.580
And then they won't trust us.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.550
So if they're already coming from a perspective of I'm confused and I'm struggling and now

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.750
I don't think that I can trust you.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.710
The possibility of that primal struggle with you is there.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.080
This is the time where we need to stop.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.550
We need to reevaluate.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.380
We need to see that if just like in the last video,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.290
one of those three components of confusing a dog,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.010
what we're doing,

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.480
how often we're doing that.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.750
And if we are into the primal struggle of the animal to take a deep breath and to

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.340
understand.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.770
Okay,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.850
this is normal.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.290
All animals struggle when they're confused.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.350
And in continuing with this program,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:21.680
we'll understand how to make that work most effectively and efficiently where we can build

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.750
the dogs confidence,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.750
make sure they're not confused.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.230
And at that point,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.000
if they're not confused,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.860
there is no struggle,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:37.050
which means they will always stay submissive and submissive is calm collected.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.480
What's going on?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.180
Where we going?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.710
Okay,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.800
I just gotta follow You just gotta listen to you,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.510
you seem to know what's going on.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:51.750
I don't That's what makes it easy for a dog and to live in a society that's we live in with

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.750
.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.870
His busiest things are with his confusing.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.650
Those things are,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.910
especially if you want to take your dog into areas that air heavily populated,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.050
heavily distracted.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:07.750
If we want to lessen the amount of confusion we need to make sure we understand where

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.880
they're being confused.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.200
And if the struggle comes,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.790
if that primal struggle comes,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.950
we need to know how to effectively and efficiently work with that fight,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.470
not to euthanize them,

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:26.250
not to put them on puppy Prozac and fog them and make them even more confused.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.250
We can just simply work with their psychology and understand.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.350
We all struggle and we can all re program.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.740
I'm gonna teach you how to do that with your dog.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:47.150
This for today will conclude the primal struggle in dogs and understanding the fight.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.020
I hope we really take the necessary time to feel into this.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.950
And if we've ever had a dog before that was a showing aggression,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.610
it was possibly harmful to itself.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.180
In others,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:06.840
we felt that the only way that we could take care of decision was euthanization that I'm

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.150
here to tell you that you did exactly what you felt was best in the moment.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.850
But now there's a new way.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.780
We don't have to do that anymore.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.710
We can keep our dogs,

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.650
we can work with them and we can make sure that they don't show those tendencies any longer

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:20.650
.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.470
We can build their confidence if there is going to be a struggle.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.450
If that primal struggle does come,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:33.260
we want to make sure that we understand how to push them in the way of submissiveness.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.250
Very easy going and willing to be led.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.050
Thank you again for coming into Day four.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.650
The primal struggle in dogs understanding their fight.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.370
I would forward to seeing you tomorrow.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.560
This has been a big four days.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.410
Tomorrow will be completing with fifth day.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.150
Until then,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.850
train play.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.150
I love
