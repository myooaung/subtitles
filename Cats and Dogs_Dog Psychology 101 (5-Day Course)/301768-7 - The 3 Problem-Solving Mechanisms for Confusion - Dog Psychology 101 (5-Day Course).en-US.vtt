00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Oh,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.100
let's see.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.910
Luna Berhard here.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.280
Day five.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.950
Dog Psychology 101 Look where we're at.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.000
Correct the beat.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:43.340
Day five is going over the three problem solving mechanisms a dog has when they're confused

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.340
.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.100
What a better place to talk about it in a place where there's more distractions and just

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.020
about everywhere mawr energy and dog energy to just about anywhere else you could possibly

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.450
find.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.530
So there is a lot of distraction.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.750
There is a lot of confusion that happens here.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.060
And for an example.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.260
A few minutes ago,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.600
as I was walking with Luna,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.150
two dogs come up and they go to smell her and then all of a sudden start to attack her.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.540
That's confusing to a dog,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.850
especially when it's a kind dog just wants to hang out and enjoy.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.150
So when that happens,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.820
a dog has three ways to process that bacon.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.210
Number one fight.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.750
That fight could be psychological or physical.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.450
Usually the dog will only fight when they feel that their leader.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.520
But that is an option in our society.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.510
When a dog is confused and they go to immediately fighting.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.150
Usually that's because they were fearful.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.350
I didn't know what to do,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.850
and the only thing that did work was fighting.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.350
So we want to make sure we understand just why we talked about the primal fighting dogs.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.550
But just because it's an option doesn't mean is that they're turning aggressive.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.150
It means that they can fight if they think that it works.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.650
Number two is flee.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.410
They can run.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.950
They can high tail it out of there.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.550
They could put distance in between them and whatever the perceived threat is,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.750
and or energy three bacon freeze.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.330
Freezing is where the energy comes at them,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.450
and they don't know what to do.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.190
Sometimes they stand in freeze and their sphincter comes up and they get really tight.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.680
Sometimes they lay to the ground in understanding the fight,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.050
flight or freeze.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.060
What we need to understand is,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.110
is that fighting most of the time it's not gonna be the wanted behavior.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.680
Fleeing most of the time isn't going to be a proper behavior.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.760
If you're in a large area and the dog just keeps on running and running and running and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.870
freezing at times,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.890
we'll get the dog even more discipline than anything else would have.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.630
So in order for us to not be confused about this.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.930
We just need to take it for what it is for the dog.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.850
I have three options and I'll do whatever works the fastest unless they don't have to worry

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.250
about it.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.140
Which,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.070
like for Luna,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.550
she didn't have to worry about it.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.650
She just had to get closer to the leader.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.750
As soon as the two dogs tried to jump on her and I told her to come,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.630
she immediately came right to me.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.020
They will do that if they feel that you are their protection.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.700
There is that fourth opportunity nobody really knows about,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.870
because the majority of time,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.450
the dogs of leaders and they feel like they have to figure it out for themselves.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.350
But that fourth opportunity is going to be to get to the leader.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.550
So it's not fighting the dog.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.470
It's not necessary fleeing the situation.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.950
It's just getting to where the strength of the Pakis and that's what the leader.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.780
So we want to make sure,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.580
especially if we're going to be having fun with our dogs and taking them into places as

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.050
such,

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.950
where there's lots of fun stuff happening and there's about ah fight every 5 to 10 minutes

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.950
.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.150
That could be confusing for some dogs.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.280
And over all of my years Ah,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.450
professional dog training.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.190
I spent lots and lots of time in these places,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.640
but not just to let the dogs have fun to actually train them to train them in what to do

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.860
when another dog attacks them to train them.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.530
What to do when another dog is chasing them and they're not letting them up to train and

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.430
what to do if they do freeze that way,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.720
they don't get attacked even harder.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.050
Some clients love these places.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.690
Their dog gets to run.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.250
They don't have to expect much out of them.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.590
Seem like they're having a lot of fun,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.430
regardless of the back and forth dominant submissive struggle that happens here every

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.280
single time they see an approach,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.750
another dog and then other clients say I would never go there in a 1,000,000 years.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.910
They took their dog here and their dog was attacked,

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.200
and from then on they were extremely fearful.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.350
So we have to understand first and foremost how the dog processes if they're confused,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.310
fight,

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.750
flight,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.450
freeze.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.510
If they're the leader,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.410
if they're follower,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.450
they'll just get to the leader.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.550
That's what I'm here to teach you.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.550
I'm here to teach you all of it.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.820
But first and foremost,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.070
let's be the leader for them,

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.970
the appropriate leader.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.550
That way,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.460
when they're confused,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.090
all they have to do is look to us for advice.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.360
They don't have to try to figure everything out underneath the sun that happens in our

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.950
society is expecting them to understand too much.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:27.650
Day five Dog psychology 101 three Problem solving mechanisms A doghouse.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.350
Thank you for listening.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.040
Thank you for being able to stay with me these five days to progress with me.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.150
Being able to understand your dog from their perspective is different.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.410
We're going to be myth busting so much out there when it comes to people that are

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.620
humanizing dogs.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.910
And not for the sake of just saying that we think we know better from the sake of our dogs

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.550
mean more.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.430
We need to understand them.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.750
For them.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.650
This is a huge and crucial part of that.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.450
Moving forward will be the main training course.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.980
This is where we're gonna be going over exactly how to handle your dog.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.060
This is where we're going to be going over exactly what tools to be using with your

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.840
specific dog.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.460
This is when we're gonna be going over exactly how to discipline and show your dog.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.340
Affection is most effective and efficient for your specific dog,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.570
the main training courses where you're going to be formally and physically training the dog

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.570
,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.950
having all that fun in action right now.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.950
And I'm looking forward to going on that journey with you.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.080
The only way we can go on that journey is if we understand that more psychologically.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.450
And that's what dog psychology one no one is all about.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.480
Without this first course,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.320
we will not understand them to the point to where we need to when we get to the main

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.250
training course.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.760
Thank you for being here with me.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.750
I look forward to continuing this training together,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.700
and until then,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.840
train Wait
