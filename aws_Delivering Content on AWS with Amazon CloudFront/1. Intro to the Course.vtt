00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.166
Hey there.

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.916
I'm Andy Dyrcz,

3
00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:09.024
and today I'd like to talk with you about Amazon Web Services CloudFront.

4
00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:11.845
I've decided to write this course because I believe that CloudFront is

5
00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:16.032
a tool worthy of being in everyone's Cloud toolbox.

6
00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:19.665
CloudFront has a focus on simplicity and speed.

7
00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.821
This focus helps you quickly get set up and running

8
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:26.452
distributing your content fast and cost effectively.

9
00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:26.934
In this course,

10
00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.792
I'm going to show you how to provision and deploy a web

11
00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:34.475
application and static content utilizing CloudFront.

12
00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:36.291
To help drive home these concepts,

13
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:39.262
we'll deploy a simple web application for a marketing website

14
00:00:39.262 --> 00:00:43.319
for an upcoming fictional conference event.

15
00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:47.574
This application is what's showing on the screen during this introduction.

16
00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:50.320
This application, the AWS console,

17
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.961
and the terminal will be used to show the key features of CloudFront,

18
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.042
plus, each module in this course has tons of examples,

19
00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.576
which are in this repo.

20
00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:03.622
All of this are designed to help you learn how to use CloudFront to

21
00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:06.785
quickly and securely deploy your applications.

22
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:10.802
In this module, we'll start with a high-level overview of CDNs,

23
00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.496
from there, we'll introduce you to CloudFront,

24
00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:16.663
and you'll learn why CloudFront is a pleasure to work with.

25
00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:21.758
After that, we'll get to work and begin our initial setup for the course.

26
00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:22.079
Finally,

27
00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.010
this module will conclude with you understanding the principles

28
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.660
and benefits of using CloudFront as your CDN,

29
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.107
as well as you having a basic setup ready to begin configuring

30
00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:36.000
things as we progress through this course. Let's begin.
