1
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:06,198
So by now, you should have a high-level understanding of how a CDN works.

2
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:10,490
Let's expand on what the benefits of implementing a CDN are.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,613
Although the benefits of using a CDN vary depending on the

4
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:15,832
size and needs of your internet property,

5
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:18,682
the primary benefits for most users can be broken

6
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:21,891
down into four different components.

7
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:25,226
Improving website load times,

8
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:30,036
by distributing content closer to website visitors by using a nearby CDN server,

9
00:00:30,036 --> 00:00:33,915
visitors experience faster page loading times.

10
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:37,409
As visitors are more inclined to click away from slow loading sites,

11
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,297
a CDN can reduce bounce rates and increase the amount of

12
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:43,498
time that people spend on the site.

13
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:49,131
In other words, a faster website means more visitors will stick around longer.

14
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:51,593
Reducing bandwidth costs.

15
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,220
Bandwidth consumption costs for website hosting is

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,166
a primary expense for websites.

17
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,832
Through caching and other optimizations,

18
00:00:58,832 --> 00:01:03,536
CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide,

19
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:07,287
thus, reducing hosting costs for the website owners.

20
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:11,052
Increasing content availability and redundancy.

21
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:13,824
Large amounts of traffic and hardware failures can

22
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,027
interrupt normal website function.

23
00:01:16,027 --> 00:01:17,666
Thanks to their distributed nature,

24
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,617
a CDN can handle more traffic and withstand hardware

25
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:24,280
failure better than many origin servers.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,931
And finally, improving website security.

27
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:31,564
A CDN may improve security by providing DDoS medication,

28
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:38,037
improvements to security certificates, and other optimizations.

29
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:44,741
You may be asking yourself, Andy, how does a CDN improve website load times?

30
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:47,190
When it comes to websites loading content,

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,055
users drop off quickly as the site slows down.

32
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:56,648
CDN services can help to reduce load times in the following ways.

33
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:59,574
The globally distributed nature of a CDN means reduced

34
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:02,701
distance between users and website resources.

35
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:07,247
Instead of having to connect to wherever your websites origin server may live,

36
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:11,184
a CDN lets users connect to a geographically closer data center.

37
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:15,049
Less travel means faster service.

38
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,833
CDNs can reduce the amount of data that's transferred by reducing file sizes

39
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,720
using tactics such as minification and file compression.

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,246
Hey, smaller file sizes mean quicker load times.

41
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:31,296
CDNs can also speed up sites which use TLS certificates by optimizing

42
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,988
connection reuse and enabling TLS false start protection.

43
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:36,854
And don't forget,

44
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:40,135
hardware and software optimization such as sufficient load balancing and

45
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:46,048
solid-state hard drives can help data reach users faster as well.

46
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:51,479
Okay, so how does a CDN reduce bandwidth costs?

47
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,423
You might be thinking to yourself that implementing a CDN

48
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:57,791
will have its own costs and rightfully so,

49
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:02,057
yes, there will be a new cost for whatever CDN solution you implement,

50
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:08,128
but bandwidth costs are usually where your web host tries to get you.

51
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:10,902
A few gigabytes of monthly transfers can quickly add

52
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:13,927
up and outspend the CDN costs.

53
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:21,207
Every time an origin server responds to a request, bandwidth is consumed.

54
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,373
Utilizing TTLs, or time to live,

55
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:28,716
on the content you host from your CDN can greatly reduce how often your CDN

56
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:33,698
has to request and transfer data from your origin servers.

57
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:36,271
Regarding content availability and redundancy,

58
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:41,756
how does the CDN keep a website always online?

59
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:45,648
Uptime is a critical component for anyone with an internet property.

60
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:49,533
Hardware failures and spikes in traffic as a result of either malicious attacks

61
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,703
or just a boost in popularity have the potential to bring down a web server and

62
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:57,357
prevent users from accessing a site or service.

63
00:03:57,357 --> 00:04:03,100
A well-rounded CDN has several features that will minimize downtime.

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,611
Load balancing distributes network traffic evenly across several servers

65
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:12,072
making it easier to scale rapid boosts in traffic.

66
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:16,548
Intelligent failover provides uninterrupted service even if one or more of

67
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,319
the CDN servers go offline due to hardware malfunction.

68
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,237
The failover can redistribute the traffic to the other operational servers.

69
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:29,170
In the event that an entire data center is having technical issues,

70
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,004
anycast routing transfers the traffic to another available datacenter

71
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:38,832
ensuring that no users lose access to the website.

72
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:43,831
I mentioned earlier that one of the roles of a CDN was to provide security.

73
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,648
Well, how does a CDN protect your data?

74
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:51,319
Information security is an integral part of a CDN.

75
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,608
A CDN can keep the site secured with fresh TLS certificates which

76
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:57,171
will ensure high standard of authentication,

77
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,870
encryption, and integrity.

78
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,427
One of the most substantial security vulnerabilities of web

79
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,378
properties on the modern internet is the use of distributed

80
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:09,261
denial of service attacks, or DDoS.

81
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:09,849
Over time,

82
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:13,686
DDoS attacks have increased in size and complexity with attackers

83
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:17,193
utilizing botnets to target websites with high traffic.

84
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:21,671
A large and properly configured CDN has the potential benefit of

85
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:26,123
scale as a protective factor against DDoS.

86
00:05:26,123 --> 00:05:30,063
By having enough data center locations and sizable bandwidth capabilities,

87
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:35,448
a CDN is able to withstand and mitigate an amount of incoming attack traffic

88
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:39,763
that would easily overwhelm the targeted origin server.

89
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:42,894
Web application firewalls, or WAFs,

90
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,092
protect your internet property from common

91
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:47,840
vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks,

92
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,259
cross-site scripting,

93
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,694
or cross-site forgery requests with no changes to your existing infrastructure.

94
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:57,125
Most CDNs allow you to apply these protections to your

95
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:02,684
traffic before it reaches your origins servers.

96
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,328
Wrapping up, in this lesson, we learned,

97
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:08,825
in general, how CDNs are designed to improve website load times,

98
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:13,816
reduce bandwidth costs, increase content availability and redundancy,

99
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:21,000
and improve website security. Next, we'll learn how Amazon's CloudFront applies these principles.
