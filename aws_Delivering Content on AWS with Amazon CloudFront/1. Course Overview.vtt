Hello everyone, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:07.332 --> 00:00:12.148
Delivering Content on AWS with Amazon CloudFront.

3
00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:15.661
My name is Andy Dyrcz, and I'm a principal architect for Linkfire.

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.133
I get to design systems that are helping people share new

5
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.818
music with people all around the world.

6
00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:21.651
On a global level,

7
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:24.972
we have to scale-out to handle a lot of web traffic and it

8
00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:27.721
would not be possible without the use of a CDN in front of

9
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.119
our systems to get it done.

10
00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.584
CloudFront is Amazon's content distributed network service which speeds up

11
00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:39.357
distribution of your static and dynamic web content such as HTML,

12
00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:43.381
CSS, JavaScript, and image files to your users.

13
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:46.529
If you're interested in scaling your web content to a larger audience,

14
00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:48.693
but don't want to take a hit on performance or cost,

15
00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:51.472
I believe this course is for you.

16
00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:54.210
This course will quickly get you up and running with CloudFront.

17
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.398
This includes covering why CloudFront is a powerful solution,

18
00:00:57.398 --> 00:01:00.504
creating and optimizing CloudFront distributions,

19
00:01:00.504 --> 00:01:03.973
traffic management, and security.

20
00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:04.750
By the end of this course,

21
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.343
you will know how to distribute the web content faster with CloudFront.

22
00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:12.258
Now before we begin this course, you need to have an AWS account,

23
00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:16.311
you should be familiar with the AWS console or the command-line environments,

24
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.135
and you should have a basic understanding of how the internet works.

25
00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:20.813
Having said that,

26
00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:23.584
I hope you're as excited as I am as we begin this journey of

27
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:31.000
delivering content on AWS with Amazon CloudFront here, at Pluralsight.
