1
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:03,099
In the last video,

2
00:00:03,099 --> 00:00:07,365
we discovered that it takes around 7 seconds to completely load our website.

3
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:11,716
In this video, I challenge us to get it under 2 seconds.

4
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:12,731
How you ask?

5
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:17,537
By simply creating what is called a CloudFront distribution.

6
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:21,327
A distribution is the collective name of all of the

7
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,274
configurations you enabled to delivery your content.

8
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,281
This means setting your origin and all of the associated

9
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:30,400
rules for caching and traffic handling.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,035
In this lesson,

11
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:33,346
we're going to create a distribution that will sit

12
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:37,069
between our web content and the browser.

13
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:38,327
While we'll go through this quickly,

14
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:42,139
we will deep dive into each element in the following videos.

15
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:42,449
Basically,

16
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:44,977
this run-through is to build your familiarity with the

17
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:48,631
CloudFront distribution options.

18
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:53,622
From within the Management Console, let's head over to the CloudFront service.

19
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:55,566
If you have not created a distribution before,

20
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:58,563
the first screen you should see is the Getting Started window

21
00:00:58,563 --> 00:01:01,833
with the big blue Create Distribution button.

22
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,884
For now, click this button.

23
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:06,493
Next, you will select the delivery method.

24
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:08,476
We want to use web method.

25
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:11,131
Choose getting started.

26
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:15,489
Alright, now there are a lot of options to fill out, but don't be intimidated.

27
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:16,839
While there are a lot of options,

28
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:20,977
just know that there are really only three main sections,

29
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:29,707
default origin, default cache behavior, and distribution settings.

30
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:33,127
At the top, we have the Origin Settings section.

31
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:36,704
This is where we assign our origin to our distribution.

32
00:01:36,704 --> 00:01:40,296
To set our origin domain name, click on the empty field.

33
00:01:40,296 --> 00:01:42,589
You'll notice a drop-down menu.

34
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:45,002
If your origin is hosted within your AWS account,

35
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,730
then you should see it as an option.

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,781
Our event website is hosted on EC2 instances with an ELB in front of it.

37
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:55,166
So we'll find under Elastic Load Balancers,

38
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:59,579
the Pluralsight-demo ELB hostname listed.

39
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,674
We'll discuss other options for choosing origins in the preceding lessons video.

40
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:09,984
For now, we can leave the origin path blank.

41
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:12,760
We'll give the origin ID something more familiar than this.

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,803
You can leave this as the ID that AWS generates for you,

43
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:22,410
but as time goes on, it's kind of nice to have a friendly ID here.

44
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,386
Minimum Origin SSL Protocol is listed as minimum because you need to set it

45
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:32,256
to the lowest level of TLS that your origin supports.

46
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:36,792
Our ELB is using ELB security policy TLS 1.2.

47
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:40,797
So here, we will choose TLS version 1.2.

48
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:45,331
Try to avoid TLS version 1 or SSL version 3 if you can.

49
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,199
I know some applications out there still need to support those,

50
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,720
but please choose wisely as those versions are known to be insecure nowadays.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,186
You might need to work on upgrading your TLS on your origin,

52
00:02:56,186 --> 00:03:00,374
but that's for a different Pluralsight lesson.

53
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:04,703
Let's set the origin protocol to HTTPS only since our origin

54
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:07,766
is currently listening on HTTPS port 443.

55
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:15,783
For the time being, we can leave all timeouts, ports, and headers as they are.

56
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:19,707
Let's move onto default cache behavior settings.

57
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,738
Remember, we are setting the default behavior,

58
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:25,981
that's why our path pattern is set to default.

59
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:33,817
Let's enable redirect HTTP to HTTPS for the viewer protocol policy so

60
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:36,703
that way if someone requests our content through HTTP,

61
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:42,353
they will automatically get redirected to HTTPS.

62
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:46,644
For now, we will only allow get and head methods.

63
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:53,309
We don't need options or anything else with put, post, patch, or delete.

64
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:58,141
Okay, we're going to jump down to cache based on selected request headers.

65
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:01,120
Since we're using an elastic load balancer as our origin,

66
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,297
we need to either enable all or whitelist which headers reach our origin.

67
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:11,375
We're going to go with whitelist and then add host to our whitelist

68
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,745
which will set the value for the domain name of the origin that is

69
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:19,052
associated with the requested object allowing us to cache objects

70
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:22,930
requested at our domain name.

71
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,001
Object caching,

72
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:28,436
let's pick customize so we can set out TTLs at CloudFront

73
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,515
and not rely on our origin cache headers.

74
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:35,139
We'll leave these as the defaults.

75
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:35,846
For the time being,

76
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,990
we don't need to afford cookies nor do we need to afford query strings,

77
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,189
so we can leave them set to none which will improve our

78
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:46,590
caching by caching every request that we get so anything in

79
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,470
the future will already be cached.

80
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,965
And we can leave Smooth Streaming and Restrict Viewer Access set to no,

81
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:59,712
but we will move compress objects automatically to a yes

82
00:04:59,712 --> 00:05:03,747
and we can skip over lambda for now.

83
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:08,667
Alright, and now we're on to our distribution settings.

84
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,447
Price class.

85
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:13,324
Let's use all edge locations right now.

86
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:18,030
We're not working on our WAF, so we can just leave that for the time being.

87
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,818
For our CNAME,

88
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,408
we're going to want to put in the domain name that

89
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,699
we will use to reach CloudFront.

90
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,896
So we're going to put in www.dyrcz .me.

91
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,700
Leaving the default certificate is just fine if you're going to use

92
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,664
the CloudFront domain name that is generated for us.

93
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:40,669
Since we're using a custom domain, or a CNAME,

94
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:45,293
we will choose our certificate from ACM.

95
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:49,873
Leave supported HTTP version as-is.

96
00:05:49,873 --> 00:05:56,373
We're going to set index.html as our default root object.

97
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,315
Leave logging off for now.

98
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,526
We'll discuss that in a later video.

99
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:07,160
Okay, we can leave everything else and we're ready to create our distribution.

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,484
But before we do so, if you hop into your terminal,

101
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,095
if you followed along with the previous videos,

102
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:18,870
you should be able to list any existing CloudFront distributions from here.

103
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,815
If you run this command, you can list all of your distributions.

104
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:31,217
An empty return means that there is no CloudFront distributions.

105
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:36,194
Okay, we can go ahead and click our Create Distribution button now.

106
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,946
So we can now see that our distribution is being deployed.

107
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:43,289
We've been given an ID and AWS has created a domain

108
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,876
name for our CloudFront distribution.

109
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:52,513
If I hop into Route 53 real quick and add a record for www

110
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,859
pointing to my CloudFront distribution,

111
00:06:54,859 --> 00:07:01,381
we should see some major improvements right off the bat.

112
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:04,233
In the meantime, if we run this command again,

113
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,476
you will now see your distribution with all the same

114
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:11,288
details such as distribution ID, domain name,

115
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:15,558
CNAME, and origin, plus more.

116
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,693
Okay, the moment of truth.

117
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:22,307
Go ahead and open up a browser, toggle your Developer Tools,

118
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:25,173
and load www.dyrcz .me.

119
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,097
And there we go.

120
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:30,783
We can now see that it took less than 2 seconds to load everything.

121
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,487
Isn't it amazing how much of an improvement we can get by

122
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,445
setting up a CDN in front of our content.

123
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:38,228
Alright, there you have it.

124
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:40,255
We have a major success.

125
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:41,971
Just by setting up the CloudFront distribution,

126
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:47,628
we've seen our response times reduce drastically.

127
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:53,000
In the next videos, we'll discuss everything we just went through in much more detail.
