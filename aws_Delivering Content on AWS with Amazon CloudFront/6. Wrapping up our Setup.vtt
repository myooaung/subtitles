00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.703
Well, that was a lot of information, but we learned a lot.

2
00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:07.770
I feel it was important to make sure you understood what a

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.440
CDN actually does and how it does it,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.317
in addition to how CloudFront operates before we begin to

5
00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:17.245
tear it apart in order to set up our own.

6
00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:20.131
You now know there are general expectations of a CDN and

7
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:22.799
knowing this will help you understand why we are doing

8
00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:25.911
something within the CloudFront service.

9
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:30.153
We learned that a CDN brings your end users closer to your content.

10
00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:34.781
By having Edge locations, you reduce the roundtrip time for a request,

11
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:37.834
thereby, improving the end user experience.

12
00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:42.955
This also improves costs, site reliability, and security.

13
00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:45.921
We also learned how AWS has architected CloudFront to

14
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.071
improve response time and reduce costs.

15
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.430
You know there are elements in place to improve your security

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.875
stance and the stability of your application.

17
00:00:54.875 --> 00:01:05.000
You've also set up your own AWS account and installed the CLI on your machine. Let's head over to the next module to create our first distribution.
