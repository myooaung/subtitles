00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,711
So far, in the previous module, we have spent a lot of time discussing theory.

2
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:10,108
It's finally time where we get our hands dirty and begin

3
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:12,710
setting up our CloudFront distribution.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,101
I mean,

5
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:17,068
it's not like people are moving closer to our origin to access our content,

6
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:20,254
so let's move our origin closer to them.

7
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,240
Let's begin by taking our demo application and

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,904
assessing its current performance, that way we have a baseline measurement.

9
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:27,729
Once we have that,

10
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:30,276
we will set up our CloudFront distribution so we can

11
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:33,107
better deliver and optimize our content.

12
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:36,634
We will finish off by reassessing the performance of our website to

13
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:39,773
determine how much improvement CloudFront has provided.

14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:47,000
I bet you will be surprised how much we can improve by the end of this module. Let's get started.
