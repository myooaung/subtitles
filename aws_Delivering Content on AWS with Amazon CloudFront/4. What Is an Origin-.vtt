00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:05.296
When you create a distribution, you specify an origin.

2
00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:11.526
An origin is where you direct CloudFront to send requests for your content.

3
00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:16.154
CloudFront supports using several AWS resources as origins.

4
00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:16.979
For example,

5
00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.794
you can specify an S3 bucket or custom origins such as

6
00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:25.718
EC2 instances or your own HTTP server.

7
00:00:25.718 --> 00:00:28.462
When you use S3 buckets as an origin for your distribution,

8
00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:32.784
you can place any object that you want CloudFront to deliver into your bucket.

9
00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:36.303
You can use any method that is supported by S3 to

10
00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:39.096
put the objects into your bucket, for example,

11
00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:44.482
the management console, API, or even third-party tools like Boto.

12
00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:47.766
You can create a prefix or folder structure in your bucket to store the

13
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.761
objects just as you would with any other S3 bucket.

14
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:54.425
Using an existing S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin

15
00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:57.090
server doesn't change the bucket in any way.

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.315
You can still use it as you normally would to store and

17
00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:04.539
access S3 objects at the standard S3 prices.

18
00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.220
A custom origin is an HTTP server, for example, your web server.

19
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.692
The HTTP server can be an EC2 instance or an HTTP

20
00:01:14.692 --> 00:01:17.153
server that you manage privately.

21
00:01:17.153 --> 00:01:20.489
An S3 origin configured as a website endpoint is

22
00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:23.382
also considered a custom origin.

23
00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:26.342
When you use a custom origin that is your own HTTP server,

24
00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:29.743
you specify the DNS name of your server,

25
00:01:29.743 --> 00:01:32.339
along with the HTTP and HTTPS ports,

26
00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:35.897
as well as the protocol that you want CloudFront to use

27
00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:39.098
when fetching objects from your origin.

28
00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.106
Okay, there you have it.

29
00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:44.275
You now know what a CloudFront origin is.

30
00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:53.000
You learn that you can use S3 buckets or custom origins such as EC2 instances or any other web server.
