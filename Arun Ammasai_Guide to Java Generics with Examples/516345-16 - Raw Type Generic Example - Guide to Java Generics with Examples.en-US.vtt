00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Hello everyone, welcome back.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.465
So we're talking about generics class and generic methods, right?

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.210
So there is one more thing which we need to know.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.505
It is called as a generic type.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.410
Because let me give you a simple example.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.285
What is not generic rod type?

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:21.360
Let's take an example. I'm going to create a list of some objects like list.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:32.395
And so, so list, new ArrayList.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:38.045
So this is just a list declaration. That's all right.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:41.180
So let's see what's going on here is here around

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.375
US type of parameterized class and the line number eight,

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:48.650
because I'm using it, I list here and that is a rod type.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.930
So what do you mean we're not a rod type?

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.845
For example, if I have any type is specified here,

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:57.875
it is not going to be a rod type.

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:01.820
And here you need to use the diamond operator.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.005
That's all.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:04.655
So this is not a rod type.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:10.115
So the moment you remove everything and it becomes a raw type.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.275
So what is the advantage of it?

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:15.530
So when you have a rod type, what did happen?

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.450
You can add any kind of disease list.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.510
Add, you can add spring.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.420
And you can add.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.850
So when you include a long list,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.430
which means you can add any dipole for data.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.300
But at the moment, which I'm inclined to modify it here.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.180
What happened? We got an error because this particular list is dedicated for a string,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.720
but you are trying to add an interior or you're trying to add a character.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.565
So that is a problem with that.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:13.595
So raw type, it's not up,

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:17.480
prefer to use, sort of never tried to use a raw type.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.485
Okay. The same thing is available in January.

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:27.510
So let me show you how it can be done or how would this looks like.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.930
So for now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a simple class called flash gas.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.170
So here, and I want this to be a generic class.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.080
So what do we need to do? We have to introduce the diamond operator.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.385
It's going to be a T here.

00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:48.560
And we had to provide what is the type here?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.120
T is equal to t and all I need is distributed and settlements all.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.520
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.330
I'm going to use the Shape class.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.660
Okay, so what I'm gonna do Shape class,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.410
and for now, I'm gonna pass as an integer here.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:15.350
So shape is a new ship and I can add some element into it,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:23.600
the shape dot, and also renally saved up set of valid.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.485
Now.

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:26.720
So let me print the data as well.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.670
So what is available in the object?

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.100
So I'm going to provide us this out here.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.360
So the data is shaped dot d.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.290
Okay?

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.290
So till now we don't have any problem ignorant is yes,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.360
that data is a 100.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.780
I don't need this. Fine.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.955
So now let's try to use a raw type.

00:03:52.955 --> 00:03:56.270
There aren't a means a type available,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.290
but you are not providing any specific type to it because it's a list of object,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.640
but you are not providing any object.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.305
You're just providing just a simple list.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:04.400
It can then anything.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.805
The similar way the Shape class contains a type.

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:09.650
You can pass any type,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.420
but at the same time,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.160
you don't have to put anything at all,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.155
which means not type.

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:20.300
So that's an autumn time domain is shaped glass shape 1 is

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.865
equal to new shape class. Right?

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.770
And then what I'm trying to do oral,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.380
what I can do is I have shaped glass shape when I'm trying to

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.890
assign the previous object which we created.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.785
See what happened again.

00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:45.474
So raw use of parameterize to class in shape class line number 10 because it's an erotic,

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:48.055
even though shape contains an integer here.

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:53.230
But that Amira, I'm trying to ask then is a shape 1 which is i shape class.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.600
It doesn't have any type specified in him,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.740
so it's a raw type.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.320
So here you will not get any warnings. No warnings here.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.580
Okay, let's try something different.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.610
So let me try to add something into shape.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.835
One object dot set T,

00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:19.190
and I'm going to add some string here, Uh, hello.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.695
Okay, The moment you try to add something here, see what happened here.

00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:25.615
Uncheck the call to set T,

00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:32.050
which means you're getting a warning saying like this is just an uncheck the call equity.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.775
So here we are getting uncheck the call.

00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:42.580
Okay, this is not going to bring any problems.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.535
It will just letting you know that there is a possibility of error in the future, right?

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:51.700
So what is the next thing? So what I'm trying to do now,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.290
I'm trying to override the object.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.300
For example, shape is equal to shape 1.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.915
The moment I added, see there's unchecked as seven here. That's what happened.

00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:11.390
So what is trying to do is the shape is a proper one.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.140
The shape one is not a proper one because shape is not an odd time,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.715
but sharepoint is a raw type.

00:06:16.715 --> 00:06:18.590
Correct. So that's what happening.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.475
So unchecked assignment, normally we call that as a warning for uncheck the conversions.

00:06:25.475 --> 00:06:29.550
I can simply say and checked.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.865
That's all I would be our erotic.

00:06:34.865 --> 00:06:37.325
So if you want me to keep it as simple word,

00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:38.600
if it is a raw type,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.500
that is the generic left without any type, that's all.
