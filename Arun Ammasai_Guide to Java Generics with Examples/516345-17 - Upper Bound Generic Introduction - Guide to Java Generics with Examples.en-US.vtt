00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.610
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.260
So we discuss lot of things I would, uh,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.700
generates and generic methods and classes, right?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.085
So we need to know one important things.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:13.635
There is something called a bounded type parameters.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.455
First, let's try to understand what is a bone or type.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:21.180
So there are situations when we required some restoration.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.205
So you are trying to call some particular method,

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:24.930
which is a generic method,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.560
but you want to restrict the types, for example,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.225
the methanogen supply generic,

00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:32.640
which will accept any kind of, uh, types, right?

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.190
But you want to Wanli pass the number data or number type,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.455
which means integer, float, long, double.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.105
So if you tried to pass a string,

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:49.985
that has to throw an error message because that is bounded to allow only the numbers,

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:52.610
not other types of data.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.345
So to declare a bounded type parameter list,

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:59.630
the type of parameters name followed by the extends keyword.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.660
For example, if you want to implement something like I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.215
want to only allow them numerical data are numerical type.

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:10.280
You have to provide extense number,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.125
so x and it's the keyword which will allow us to use the subtypes of numbers.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.895
What are the subtest of numbers?

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:20.090
I mean num, integer, double long.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.895
Everything right, in coding.

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:28.579
Double float or not. And parameter followed by excellence called as an upper-bound.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.195
It's okay.

00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:31.520
So in, in bounded type parameters,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.490
the first thing we should talk about what is the upper bound,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.010
okay, so NF2 enough.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:44.150
So we, let's create a simple example and then we'll explore how it has to be done.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.070
Let's jump into the example.
