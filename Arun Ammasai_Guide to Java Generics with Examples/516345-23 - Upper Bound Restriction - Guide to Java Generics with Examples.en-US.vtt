00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.175
Welcome back.

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:04.155
So we're here, we're going to lower your bond.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.240
I have to show you something like there is

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.790
some risks to chin when you are using the upper bound.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.640
So here you have a method which will takes

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.495
a list and it is just iterating and displaying. There is no issue.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:17.775
So what happens if I want to add something into it?

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:20.490
So add some into the existing object.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.970
It is not possible in upper bound.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.065
So how I can do that?

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:28.070
So let me try a simple example.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.950
So public, static, and I'm

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.640
going to call add family member.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.515
So here what is happening is,

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:45.755
which means I'm going to get again this same output here.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.970
I mean the inputs.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.590
So we got the same output here.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.390
And then, so what I'm trying to do is I'm not trying to iterate.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.060
So I have a list of some data,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.010
so I want to add something into it.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.280
So what I'm trying to do, list dot,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.420
add, and I'm trying to add a new sun.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.755
It's throwing an error.

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:20.375
I'm not able to add it.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.235
Okay, So let me try something else.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:24.410
So let's add.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.670
So maybe I can use the base class like your grandfather so I can try that.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.090
So new grandfather.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.810
But still it, so I mean,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.465
it is giving me compilation error.

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.025
So just know this thing.

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:44.030
When you are using upper bound with a wildcard,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.650
you don't have the ability to modify the object or you can add something.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.515
It's kind of a read-only, right?

00:01:51.515 --> 00:01:52.820
So if you want to add something,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.960
if you want to modify something,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.105
we need to go for the lower bound.

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:58.970
So that is a reason we need to go over a lower bound.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.360
Okay, so in the next exam I'm going to show you how we can ask you

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.750
the lower bound and how you're going to add elements into it.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.150
And what are the restriction while you're using that?
