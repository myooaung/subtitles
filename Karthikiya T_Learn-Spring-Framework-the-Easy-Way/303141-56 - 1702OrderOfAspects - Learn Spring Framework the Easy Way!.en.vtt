00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
In most cases,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.690
you might want to get control on the order off execution off these aspect.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.170
For example,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.650
in our previous output,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.930
the logging aspect was taken care before the transaction.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.450
Biggane.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.720
Maybe I wanted to perform transaction first before ah,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.750
logging message.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.780
If you want to get comfortable on the order of these aspect,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.280
then you have to set the precedent.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.730
And the aspect with less presidents will have the higher priority to get executed.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.250
First,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.790
let's take a look at an example off scene.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.530
So my goal is to perform the transaction first before logging.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.840
So for that,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.450
I just have to introduce an annotation to set the president's.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.350
And the annotation is simply harder.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.750
And I would give some value.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.660
It doesn't matter what value that you given here,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.090
but make sure if you won't execute transaction first.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.650
The value off order is less than the logging aspect.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.550
So in here on it to set a value that is higher,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.250
then whatever I set in here.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.280
So now the transaction aspect will have the higher presidents,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.290
and so these will be executed first.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.040
Well,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.570
I don't mean to say that all these would be executed.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.350
Stride away.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.030
Well,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.190
we'll take a look at the opera,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.860
and then you will understand if you're under program now,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:37.290
you would notice that the transaction aspect executed first and then the logging and while

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.850
exiting or off the mattered,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.550
it's the opposite.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.100
The logging aspect executed first,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.530
and then the transaction.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.620
This is kind off,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.470
like the left for approach last in first start.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.550
The last aspect that comes in is the 1st 1 to go out,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.270
and it actually makes sense to work in this manner.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.650
And in case if you have a couple off advisers reciting in the same aspect,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.740
for example,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.780
let me just quickly copied this mattered and create another mattered.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.700
Let's call it before too,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.350
and enter too.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.000
Then you don't have much off the control on the order off execution.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The order is now undefined,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.950
and you don't have control on it.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.930
You can't have an annotation like order or something.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.050
It doesn't work here.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.000
In this case,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.070
you just have to simply copy whatever is reciting in here to the same method.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.290
And here you can have control on the order off execution.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.750
Let me get it off this.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.810
All right.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.550
That's about it.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.450
I'll see you soon
