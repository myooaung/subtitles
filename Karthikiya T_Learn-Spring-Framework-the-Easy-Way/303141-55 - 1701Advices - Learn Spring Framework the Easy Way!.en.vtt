00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
in this video,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.650
we're gonna talk about various different advisors you can configure using aspect J.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.630
We've already taken Look at an example off before and after advisers,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.810
but there might be instances very might want to execute and advise after successfully

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.030
returning from the advised.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.690
Mattered are after the advised method through an exception.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.280
So here are some of the annotations that would help us accomplish the same.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.480
So just try to pause the video for a while,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.830
take a look at these definitions and try to understand what each one of these annotations

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.500
are doing.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.250
And then we'll take a look at an example programmatically.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550
Okay,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.600
here we are again.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.300
For the sake of simplicity,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.850
I'm going to get it off one of the methods from here,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.670
and we would experiment with only one mattered.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.970
We've already talked about before and after.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.900
But one thing that I should mention is that when you have the following Ed Wise,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.650
after this will be executed,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.720
regardless of the result off,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.800
the advised mattered.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.500
So even if this method throws an exception,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.040
this would still get executed.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.580
You can think of this as it is in a finally block,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.560
and it will be executed regardless off the advice mattered,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.470
returned successfully or not,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.950
you know that illustrate that.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:37.160
Let me try to explicitly throw another point exception and let's start on the program and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.240
make sure that the ad wise would get executed.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.610
Okay,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.980
we got an exception,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.050
which is expected,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.950
but the key thing to note is the After Ed Wise was executed as well.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.380
If you won't execute the advice only after successfully returning from the adviser mattered

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.380
,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.580
then you have to use after returning.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.410
So this is an imitation that would help us with the same now if you're on the program.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.250
Since there is an exception in the advised mattered,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.950
we should not be seen that log message and you don't see it.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.230
And in case if you would like to print the log message when there is an exception in the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.250
advised mattered,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.050
all you have to do is to create another advice,

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:44.790
and this must be called and there is an after throwing is the imitation that went to use

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.860
and off course.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.250
You can have the same at the name.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.090
Strain the name to something else and on the program.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.050
Since we have an exception here.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.360
We should be able to see this message,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:11.710
But But let's just change the message and headed books.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.250
So this is the entered log message,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.330
and then we're able to see the exceptional log message.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.500
It's as simple as odd.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.300
Okay,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.570
we have one more annotation to explore,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.050
and that is around.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.550
And that is essentially combination off all these three advisors.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.050
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.390
So I'm just going to simply copied this mattered and annotated tiles around,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.560
and that's all.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.550
It'll change the name a round head wise.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.550
What are the name that you wish to give?

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.650
So here,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.650
this particular advises more applicable in case off transactions.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:17.430
So what I'd like to do is I would like to start the transaction before execution off the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:28.450
advised method bacon transaction and in kids off everyone method.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.720
We don't get the joint point as an object,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.150
but we get proceeding joined point.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.950
We'll see why this is useful in a while.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:50.550
So this will be executed before the execution off the advised mattered.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.480
And then after we execute this,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.700
we need to signify spring that we want to proceed with the advised matter execution So

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.400
we're going to use this object to say,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400
proceed with execution.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.350
And then after the advised matter gets executed,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.520
we wanted to perform something,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.290
and in case off a transaction,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.150
we want to commit the transaction.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.220
But there could be a case where the transaction might fail.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.400
In that case,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.750
the advised matter will throw an exception.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:33.350
So I went to wrap this code around the try catch block surround with dry catch block.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:40.480
And in here we're going to do something,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.080
maybe roll back the transaction,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.570
that sort of thing.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.250
So essentially with their own annotation,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.100
were able to accomplish all these three advisors in one goal.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.350
No strike to run the program.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.450
And first make sure.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.150
Okay,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.440
first,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.130
let's drive with the exception,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.180
So the transaction should be rolled back.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.620
And sure enough,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.960
we're not seeing the comet transaction and the transaction is rolled back because often

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.850
exception.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.980
Let's try to get it off this and try it again.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.820
This time out transaction should be committed,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.870
and sure enough,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.650
it walked.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.380
Now,

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.270
another thing to notice here is we're able to combine multiple aspect like logging

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.190
transaction like was.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.870
It can include any number off aspects as you wish,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.350
but as a good practice,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.550
you should try to not mix all the aspect in a single file.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:48.180
It's better that you would separate these files as separate concerns.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.260
So majors quickly copied this file and create a double.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.950
Get off it and let's call it transaction aspect.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.460
Here it is.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.450
Let's get it off this method from here,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.950
said the file.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.050
And we're going to keep that mattered over here.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.650
It's as simple as that.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.490
Save the file and run the program.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.790
And okay,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.660
we're not seeing the transaction aspects,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.850
because can you get the problem?

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.880
It's quite simple.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.840
The issue is.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.360
Wouldn't specify,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.040
are being inside our conflict files.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.500
Celeste quickly do that,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.960
and this is going to be the transaction aspect.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.570
It's as simple as that.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:55.230
Now let's try to run the program,

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.750
and this time it will work.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.890
All right,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.960
that's about it.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.950
I'll see you soon
