00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
in this video,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.560
we're going to talk about attribute that could be part off the advisers and the type off

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.400
attribute used is dependent on the type off advice that you're advising.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.150
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.620
For example,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.630
in gets off after returning advise you might want to get access to the value that gets

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.350
returned by the method.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.820
In that case,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.350
it can make is off the falling attribute returning.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.200
Let me copy it and pistol here.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.070
And when you introduce an attribute in this manner,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:49.550
you also need to make this expression as part off a point cut attributes point cut equals.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.450
It's basically in the form off key value pairs.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.750
How this attribute And here we have it.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.110
And inside our method,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.560
all we have to do now is going to catch the return value.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.650
In our case,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.410
we're targeting this method and earlier this Waas returning nothing.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:24.820
But now I have changes to return Boolean value someone to catch the same And here and but

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.430
this name no,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.170
guess what?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.800
We can get access to the return value and in our case,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.250
the value is going to be true.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.490
Let me also try to print it.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.690
So that's for sure that things are indeed working just like so.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.320
And that's older restaurant.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.380
Let's on the program and make sure things are working.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.390
Sure enough,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.150
it worked.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.480
Likewise,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.550
in case Off,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.710
after throwing you can get hold off,

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.190
the exception object not gets thrown.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.600
And for that you have to use the following attributes in the similar fashion.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:21.140
Just as we used in here under simply going to copy it in here and try to read the the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.050
exception,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.850
This is going to be off time exception.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.880
Let's put it where Agenda Rick and Inside Accord.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.050
Let me just try toe display it.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:43.480
And also we need to make sure that there's some exception that gets thrown from here or

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.300
make it back to a wide and when I make it to avoid and I need to make sure that and no

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.250
longer expect any kind off return value here,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.710
save the file and let's throw some kind of an exception.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.050
Let's draw our in famous no point exception.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.750
Throw new no point or exception,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.750
and that's on the program.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.350
We should be able to display the exception,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.190
and sure enough,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.950
it worked.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.230
All right,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.150
that's about it.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.770
I will see you soon
