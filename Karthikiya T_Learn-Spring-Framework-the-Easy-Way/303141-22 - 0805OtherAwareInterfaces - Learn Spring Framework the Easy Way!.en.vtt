00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.050
in case of your curious Astor water all the available ever interfaces,

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.950
then search for the interface ever,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.020
which is the parent interface for all the ever interfaces in the official website offspring

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.750
Dark start spring dot Ivo and then you would notice that it has a lot off sub interfaces

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.920
and we had all that explored some of these.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.290
We've talked about the application context ever.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.990
We've talked about the being name of air,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.350
and they've also talked about the resource loader at their.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.400
Likewise,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.320
we got many other interfaces and each would serve a different purpose.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.300
And in fact,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.880
we're going to be exploring some of these incoming videos as we progress through the course

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.880
.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.970
For example,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.320
when we talk about even handling in spring,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.570
this interface will come into picture,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.510
the application,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.850
even publisher of air.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.650
And if you're developing a spring embassy application,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.010
then thes two interfaces will come into picture.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.710
So stay tuned down the line as we progress through the course.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.740
We will definitely be calling a great deal of these and professors either directly or

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.480
indirectly,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.900
and Justin gets If you want to have a quick glimpse off what these interfaces are doing

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.900
Then just click one off these interfaces scroll down a bit,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.780
and then it should be able to see the description off it.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.490
So just try to get a glimpse off what they're doing and down the line will have some

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.250
practical examples demonstrating the same.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.850
All right,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.900
I'll see you soon.
