00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
So the solution to our problem is we're going to set the JV Ampara mater.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.760
Now they're multiple ways you can set the JV and perimeter.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.570
You can set it at operating system level or we can set it at server level,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.560
for example for using Tomcat.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.650
Then you can set the pyramid dress part off Catalina Dark Properties.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.780
But what I'm going to show now is how we can set it in Eclipse and Roman.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.350
So when you hope for your mouth over the play button,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.350
whatever the name that you see willing to send the William Argument,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.990
you click on this down at a button and then go to run conflagrations,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.370
choose your application,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.350
click on arguments and here you're going to set that perimeter.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.950
It's going to be spring dot profiles dot act to,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.450
and you would point to your favorite profile.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.330
Now,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.390
in case off production enrollment,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.440
your customer must be setting the same property.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.990
But in his case,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.550
this would be with the name production.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.290
So now let's run the program and make sure we use my SQL.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.550
And it worked if retained this to production.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.610
Okay,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.360
actually,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.910
we have to get it off this from here because when you explicitly specify the profile in

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.780
your source code,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.950
this would take the priority,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.360
for example,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.750
for under program again with a different profile.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:42.250
I'm going to make this to production this time,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.350
so it's still my skill database.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:55.220
So let me just get it off this from our source code as it's bad practice now run the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.900
program.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.040
This time it should be was great.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.750
Ask your and it works.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.530
So now this is definitely better because you're not hard,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.110
according the name of the profile in your source code.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.320
But the profile would,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.050
which was in depending on the enrollment on which your application runs.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.740
That's about it.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.750
How's he assumed?
