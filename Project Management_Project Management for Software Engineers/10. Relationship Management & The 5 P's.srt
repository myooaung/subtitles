1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,615
Relationship management, or what I like to call customer service and then some.

2
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:12,865
This section of relationship management will cover customer service,

3
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:16,482
your customer's expectations, developing and building relationships,

4
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:21,149
and how you can manage and improve those very crucial

5
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,615
relationships as a project manager.

6
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:29,615
Okay, let's get started.

7
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:31,615
What is customer service?

8
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:37,615
Customer service is the act of taking care of the customer's needs.

9
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:40,615
It sounds very simple, but it actually is pretty challenging.

10
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:44,415
Now sometimes as PMs we get so focused on our many tasks,

11
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:47,215
we lose sight of the customer's needs.

12
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:51,615
It will happen, and it's happened to me certainly as well.

13
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:57,615
As PMs, we want to provide and deliver professional,

14
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:01,615
helpful, high-quality service and assistance before,

15
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:10,615
during, and after the customer's requirements are met.

16
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:15,060
Just like I had the five Cs for effective communication,

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,615
for customer service, I have my five Ps.

18
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:22,472
Here are some characteristics of really good customer service.

19
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:24,615
The first, you're a provider.

20
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:28,990
You will provide the needs and desires for your customer.

21
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,615
You are focused on their needs.

22
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:32,070
Promptness.

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,615
Promises for delivery of your services must be on time.

24
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:40,321
Delays and cancellations should be avoided at all costs,

25
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,615
and never be late for a meeting certainly.

26
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:44,115
Politeness.

27
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:47,115
Politeness is almost a lost art.

28
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:50,115
Saying hello, good afternoon, sir, mam,

29
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:54,949
thank you very much are a part of good customer service,

30
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,504
even in project management.

31
00:01:56,504 --> 00:02:00,782
Don't forget, always use good manners not only for your customers,

32
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,726
but everyone you deal with.

33
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:08,615
This builds your quality and character, plus it's just the right thing to do.

34
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:09,115
Professionalism.

35
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:12,115
All customers should be treated professionally,

36
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:17,882
which means the use of competence or skill expected of the professional,

37
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:18,815
of you.

38
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:22,706
Professionalism shows the customer they're cared for and

39
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:27,070
this builds trust in you and your team.

40
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:27,615
Personalization.

41
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,472
Using the customer's name is very effective in

42
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,615
producing a connection with each other.

43
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:36,553
Customer's like the idea that whom they do business

44
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:39,615
with knows them on a personal level.

45
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:42,315
Quite frankly, I have a hard time remembering names,

46
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,615
so I spend extra time learning them and getting to know

47
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,086
my customers just a little better.

48
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:50,145
So think for a moment.

49
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,615
Use this list as a checklist.

50
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:55,070
Rate yourself on a scale of one to five.

51
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:03,000
How did you do? Think about what you could do differently and start doing it tomorrow.
