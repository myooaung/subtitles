1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,823
So now that we have the project defined in the previous section,

2
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:09,047
this section is on project planning, so let's plan the project.

3
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:14,190
Here's a quote, "Plans are nothing, planning is everything.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,762
" This is a great quote by Dwight Eisenhower, Mr.

5
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:18,095
D-Day.

6
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:22,962
What he is trying to say is that the process of creating plans is

7
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:25,762
actually more important than the plan itself.

8
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:31,489
You will find that you will learn and discover so much more about the

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,762
project than you imagine through the planning process.

10
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:38,262
The plan is mainly the outcome of the planning process.

11
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:39,312
By the way,

12
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:43,690
the plan is never static since the planning process is

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,905
continuous throughout the project lifecycle,

14
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:50,762
plans are constantly updated and improved.

15
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:53,562
So the project definition step provides the what,

16
00:00:53,562 --> 00:00:56,712
that is what is the project going to do,

17
00:00:56,712 --> 00:01:00,162
and in this section, we will discuss the how,

18
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:03,762
in other words, how the project will get accomplished.

19
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:11,762
The plan is merely the outcome of the planning process.

20
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:16,762
We are now transitioning from the what to the how.

21
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:20,262
Now the what, that's the project definition,

22
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:22,949
determines what the project will do,

23
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:27,762
and it documents what we want to accomplish in our project.

24
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:30,604
Now the how, which is coming in this section,

25
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:34,199
the project planning focuses on how the project will be accomplished,

26
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,574
how we're going to get those deliverables done and developed,

27
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:44,699
and also determine how the project will be managed along the way.

28
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:49,762
Okay, now let's segue into a few definitions first.

29
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,512
Definition of project planning,

30
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:57,262
project planning is defined as the process for determining all the work tasks,

31
00:01:57,262 --> 00:01:59,762
the resources, schedule, and cost.

32
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:00,762
I mean,

33
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:07,984
this really is the essence of project planning and the main part of this module,

34
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:12,428
but also project planning addresses all sorts of other aspects

35
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:16,428
such as project control and project execution,

36
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:25,762
and we're going to address those in the following three modules a little later.

37
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:32,984
I'd also like to stress that project planning is a very disciplined process,

38
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:37,879
and it requires discipline for completing a project successfully.

39
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,762
You're going to need to be able to articulate objectives of the project,

40
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:48,291
what are going to be the deliverables of the project,

41
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,762
come up with reasonable estimates and schedule,

42
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:54,130
apply resources, and then go execute the project.

43
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,034
And again, I just want to stress that it's a disciplined process,

44
00:02:59,034 --> 00:03:01,762
in other words, you have to know what you're doing,

45
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:13,000
you have to stay true to the cause, and focus at all times for success. Okay, let's move on.
