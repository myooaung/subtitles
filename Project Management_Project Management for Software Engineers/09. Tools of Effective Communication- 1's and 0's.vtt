00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.750
Now let's do a quick recap.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500
We just covered the physical tools, ICU on the left,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
and now let's cover the more electronic tools on the right,

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
what I call the 1s and 0s.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.548
Okay, let's get started.

6
00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:24.548
Status reports are one of your most important communication tools.

7
00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:26.653
So, why send status reports?

8
00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:27.074
Okay,

9
00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:32.127
the intent and reason for status reports is to inform your customer

10
00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:35.270
and stakeholder on the progress of the project.

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.159
Remember the progress of the project is measured by your

12
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.465
key performance indicators we discussed in the project

13
00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:44.548
control portion of this module.

14
00:00:44.548 --> 00:00:48.313
Some examples may be milestones, budgets, schedules, etc.

15
00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:53.798
The lack of a project status report is usually interpreted as either

16
00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:57.548
something's wrong or you don't know what's going on.

17
00:00:57.548 --> 00:01:02.180
You do not want that impression of you or your project.

18
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.022
In fact,

19
00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:08.748
your consistent status reports following the five Cs will support a positive,

20
00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:13.548
professional perception of you by your stakeholders and customers.

21
00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:19.366
Okay, always status your customers consistently and regularly.

22
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.548
Never miss one.

23
00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.430
Also, status your team.

24
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.195
You may use informal emails or informal meetings,

25
00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:30.094
stand ups, things like that, walk-arounds,

26
00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:33.366
and also they'll be very consistent.

27
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.548
And status your management.

28
00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:37.607
Remember you work for someone.

29
00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:38.842
Be consistent, again.

30
00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:42.948
I suggest also copying your management on all status reports

31
00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:45.348
going to your stakeholders or customers.

32
00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:50.548
He or she will also see the progress and quality of your work.

33
00:01:50.548 --> 00:01:51.786
That's important.

34
00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:56.739
And lastly, again, always follow the five Cs.

35
00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:03.548
Okay, now let's check out emails as the next important tool.

36
00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:08.548
Emails are probably the most common way to communicate in business.

37
00:02:08.548 --> 00:02:12.148
Phones, of course, are also very important and very common as well,

38
00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:14.548
but emails seem to predominate the world today.

39
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:18.548
So to make your life more simple, come up with templates that you can use.

40
00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:22.548
So maybe you lay out an email for a customer and then

41
00:02:22.548 --> 00:02:25.548
just reuse it for your weekly updates, for example.

42
00:02:25.548 --> 00:02:27.798
The same approach may apply for each project too.

43
00:02:27.798 --> 00:02:30.960
You may have a template per project or a template per customer,

44
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.077
and whatever works for you and maybe you'll apply to

45
00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.548
other projects and customers as well.

46
00:02:37.548 --> 00:02:41.748
Now in an email, the TO portion is for the intended audience.

47
00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:44.548
Those are the people who must read it.

48
00:02:44.548 --> 00:02:47.706
Those are the people you want to really read it.

49
00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:50.548
Do not put every Tom, Dick, and Harry here,

50
00:02:50.548 --> 00:02:54.120
only the people that must absolutely need to read it.

51
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.548
Then there's the CC.

52
00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:59.548
I don't know if you remember or not, but CC stood for Carbon Copy.

53
00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:03.313
It is for the optional audience, and remember,

54
00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:07.548
don't expect this list to actually read your email.

55
00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:10.548
You are sending it as an FYI or out of courtesy.

56
00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:16.730
If you really want someone to read it, put their email address in the TO portion,

57
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.639
the targeted audience.

58
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.548
Okay, the subject.

59
00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:24.070
Most people haven't a clue what to put here.

60
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.548
Of all the five Cs, I strongly recommend compelling is the one should follow.

61
00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:35.548
Something short and something that will entice them to read your email,

62
00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.548
no fuzzy subjects please.

63
00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:39.232
And lastly, the body.

64
00:03:39.232 --> 00:03:44.285
After you write your email, quickly glance over it to make sure,

65
00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:48.317
is it clear, is it concise, is it courteous,

66
00:03:48.317 --> 00:03:51.548
is it consistent, and is it compelling?

67
00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:56.601
Just those five easy steps for each email and you will greatly

68
00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:59.548
improve the impact of your emails immediately.

69
00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:00.003
And remember,

70
00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:03.184
with the emails you are not in the room with them reading it right

71
00:04:03.184 --> 00:04:06.148
next to them filling in the blanks so to speak,

72
00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:08.148
so you must communicate well,

73
00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:14.625
so they can clearly understand what you intend to say and get your message,

74
00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:21.548
and that is best done by following the five Cs.

75
00:04:21.548 --> 00:04:24.691
So let's first talk about the good reasons why we want

76
00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:26.691
to use the telephone or the phone,

77
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:30.625
and then secondly we're going to talk about the not-so-good reasons.

78
00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.548
Okay, first the good reasons.

79
00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:33.048
Urgency.

80
00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:35.548
Because phones provide instant communication,

81
00:04:35.548 --> 00:04:39.548
nothing beats a phone for getting someone's attention.

82
00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:41.607
Short of walking up to someone's desk,

83
00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:44.548
phones are the most urgent form of communication out there,

84
00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:46.681
so use it accordingly.

85
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:48.815
Also, in building relationships.

86
00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:52.548
Because they use voice and social cues,

87
00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:55.019
phones allow people to convey personality,

88
00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:59.548
that makes them the best way to strengthen the business relationship.

89
00:04:59.548 --> 00:05:03.548
Conversations can get interesting, personal, and informative in seconds.

90
00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:06.412
All it takes is a deep breath, a sigh,

91
00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:09.912
or some other non-verbal audio cue for you to realize how

92
00:05:09.912 --> 00:05:12.730
to course correct your conversation.

93
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.548
Gleaning non-public information or private information, personal information.

94
00:05:18.548 --> 00:05:20.423
Because phone conversations are usually unrecorded,

95
00:05:20.423 --> 00:05:23.898
they encourage people to open up on issues with your projects

96
00:05:23.898 --> 00:05:26.348
that people may otherwise shy away from,

97
00:05:26.348 --> 00:05:31.548
so you can often learn more from asking a question on a call than

98
00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:36.048
you can by asking the same question in email.

99
00:05:36.048 --> 00:05:37.548
Addressing sensitive topics.

100
00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:41.748
Because of a phone's privacy and the ability to convey a human voice is

101
00:05:41.748 --> 00:05:44.691
the tool of choice for addressing sensitive topics,

102
00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:50.405
phone conversations give the caller an opportunity to ask questions,

103
00:05:50.405 --> 00:05:54.881
explore possibilities, and brainstorm instantaneously with others.

104
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.548
Next is herding kittens.

105
00:05:57.548 --> 00:05:59.048
While conference calls may go astray,

106
00:05:59.048 --> 00:06:02.048
they are still the best way to get several people in remote

107
00:06:02.048 --> 00:06:05.215
offices and locations on the same page.

108
00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:10.548
Unlike emails, which could be easily misinterpreted in large audiences,

109
00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:13.748
conference calls force everyone to speak to and

110
00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.548
hear each other in a single space.

111
00:06:16.548 --> 00:06:17.811
Making a critical point.

112
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:21.601
Because you usually need to force someone to listen to you until

113
00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:24.087
they recognize the benefit of your discussion,

114
00:06:24.087 --> 00:06:27.548
phone calls are by far more effective than emails.

115
00:06:27.548 --> 00:06:29.666
An email, on the other hand,

116
00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:33.548
is likely to end up maybe in an unanswered spam folder.

117
00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:37.548
Okay, now next on the right are the don'ts about using the phone.

118
00:06:37.548 --> 00:06:40.405
Here's where you just don't want to use a phone,

119
00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:44.798
and I don't think it's very effective and could be dangerous for your project.

120
00:06:44.798 --> 00:06:48.548
Okay first, never use to introduce a new process.

121
00:06:48.548 --> 00:06:52.298
Phone calls are largely a verbal, unrecorded form of communication,

122
00:06:52.298 --> 00:06:54.881
so if you're explaining a step-by-step concept,

123
00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:55.548
for example,

124
00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:59.881
put it in an email first so that the reader can follow you

125
00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:02.548
along as you explain it on the phone.

126
00:07:02.548 --> 00:07:05.604
No point in taking time on the phone and just assuming

127
00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:07.548
that they are taking really good notes.

128
00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:08.381
On a cold call.

129
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:11.298
If you're putting in a call to your boss or a client and you

130
00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:13.625
have no clue about the other person's schedule,

131
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:19.548
that's not good, so start by scheduling a call via email.

132
00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:21.730
Phone calls are considered very disruptive

133
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.548
sometimes given their immediate nature.

134
00:07:23.548 --> 00:07:26.881
It's best to keep that level of interruption maybe for

135
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.548
emergencies and things like that, but if possible,

136
00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.856
try to pre-plan your phone calls.

137
00:07:31.856 --> 00:07:34.548
Never in a loud or public space.

138
00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:36.022
That is so distracting.

139
00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:39.338
Whether you're in a bathroom, or maybe the train,

140
00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:40.443
or a restaurant,

141
00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:44.048
be aware of background noise or other people when

142
00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:46.548
talking or making a business call.

143
00:07:46.548 --> 00:07:49.503
It can tell the other party a lot about how much importance and

144
00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:51.548
focus you're putting on what you have to say.

145
00:07:51.548 --> 00:07:56.028
Try to always be in an office or if you have to be in your car,

146
00:07:56.028 --> 00:07:58.548
maybe the doors are shut and it's more quiet.

147
00:07:58.548 --> 00:08:00.548
And again, it depends on your audience and who you're talking to.

148
00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:03.848
If it's a friend or a great relationship in a project,

149
00:08:03.848 --> 00:08:07.639
that's fine, but if you're calling someone really important or a stakeholder,

150
00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:10.548
give them the respect and attention they deserve.

151
00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:11.620
Conveying brief instructions.

152
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.548
When you need to quickly convey a succinct concept or instruction,

153
00:08:15.548 --> 00:08:17.948
the phone is usually not the best idea.

154
00:08:17.948 --> 00:08:19.748
Your action items won't be recorded,

155
00:08:19.748 --> 00:08:22.500
you won't know if the person missed what you said,

156
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.881
or maybe they were talking to someone else while you

157
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:26.548
were talking to them on the phone,

158
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:29.748
maybe there's some just some chitchat going on,

159
00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:32.548
so stick to emails for assigning tasks.

160
00:08:32.548 --> 00:08:34.948
Never for a 100-person conference call.

161
00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:37.348
Conference calls are great in concept,

162
00:08:37.348 --> 00:08:40.548
but there is a limit to their effectiveness.

163
00:08:40.548 --> 00:08:44.148
Having a group too large on the line will ensure that they'll

164
00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:46.548
become distracted by the end of the call.

165
00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:55.548
Alright, let's move on to more of a what I might call controversial methods.

166
00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:58.548
Here are some other methods I'd like to discuss,

167
00:08:58.548 --> 00:08:59.881
instant messaging, social media,

168
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:03.163
and texting in the context of project management.

169
00:09:03.163 --> 00:09:08.548
Instant messaging is a real-time text transmission over the internet,

170
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.548
such products as Microsoft Lync or IBM Lotus Sametime,

171
00:09:11.548 --> 00:09:11.881
Yahoo!

172
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:13.548
Messenger, and many, many others,

173
00:09:13.548 --> 00:09:17.730
they can be very handy in meetings to get real-time

174
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.548
updates of project information.

175
00:09:19.548 --> 00:09:23.437
Some companies may not want employees using personal IM applications,

176
00:09:23.437 --> 00:09:26.548
so find out what works in your company.

177
00:09:26.548 --> 00:09:32.548
Your IM app should be behind a firewall as well for content privacy.

178
00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:36.405
The ideal enterprise message should have a corporate identity,

179
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:39.173
an audit trail, administrative control, etc.

180
00:09:39.173 --> 00:09:41.673
over your IM implementation.

181
00:09:41.673 --> 00:09:48.548
Next is social media such as FaceTime, and Twitter, and LinkedIn.

182
00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:52.722
You know, I'm just not a fan of Facebook for this context.

183
00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:56.548
They do have groups and messages and maybe those might work.

184
00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:56.861
Twitter,

185
00:09:56.861 --> 00:10:00.298
well there are few companies who are using Twitter for internal

186
00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:01.548
communications behind protected accounts.

187
00:10:01.548 --> 00:10:02.783
And with LinkedIn,

188
00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:06.901
there's the groups feature where you can actually create your

189
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:10.648
own virtual internet for employees or partner.

190
00:10:10.648 --> 00:10:12.748
Next, just texting.

191
00:10:12.748 --> 00:10:15.548
Again, not a fan.

192
00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:18.489
I think it's best to use for just one-to-one communication,

193
00:10:18.489 --> 00:10:20.548
maybe minor types of communication, for example,

194
00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:25.548
hey, I'm late for a meeting, or here's the email address I promised you.

195
00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:28.917
Texts typically totally violate the five Cs completely.

196
00:10:28.917 --> 00:10:30.180
So in summary,

197
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.715
I am a fan of instant messaging and I believe it is

198
00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:39.090
very useful at times for projects, but in the social media and the texting side,

199
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.548
I'm just not a fan.

200
00:10:40.548 --> 00:10:42.653
Now I'm not trying to sway you certainly.

201
00:10:42.653 --> 00:10:45.548
Give anything a try and always think out of the box.

202
00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:53.000
I just haven't seen any useful applications of these two other methods for project management.
