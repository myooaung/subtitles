00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,595
Definition: what's a project manager?

2
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:06,452
Well, that's you.

3
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:14,500
Now let's see what your job is all about on the following slides.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:24,264
Project manager, 100% responsible for the processes used to manage the project.

5
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:25,264
Yep, 100%.

6
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:26,764
Tag, you're it.

7
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:29,764
In other words, I'm all in.

8
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:33,264
Or in your case, you're all in.

9
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:36,014
It's all on your shoulders, you are responsible, no one else.

10
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:41,579
It's a lot of work, a lot of challenge, but a lot of reward as well.

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,264
Okay, so let's drill down to more detail in the following slides.

12
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,264
What's a project manager?

13
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:54,264
Wears many hats, and juggles many balls in the air.

14
00:00:54,264 --> 00:01:00,146
Be prepared to leverage and use all of your skills.

15
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:04,264
Person with authority to manage a project.

16
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,127
Now the word authority sounds good as a descriptor,

17
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:11,264
but therein lies one of the main challenges of being a project manager.

18
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:13,889
You may typically have the responsibility,

19
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:17,826
yes it's on you, but not necessarily the authority,

20
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:24,930
since, for example, the team may not directly report to you.

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,264
Responsible for planning, control, execution, and closing of your project.

22
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:32,264
Yes, that is your job.

23
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:36,264
And we will have a module on each one, planning,

24
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:40,549
control, and execution in this course.

25
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,264
Central point of contact for all project communications.

26
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:51,527
As you will learn in the execution module on communications,

27
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:56,264
you, and only you, should manage all project communications.

28
00:01:56,264 --> 00:02:01,264
Champion and change agent for the project and the organization.

29
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:05,381
A change agent is someone in the organization who helps

30
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,028
an organization transform itself,

31
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:10,041
by focusing on critical business strategy improvements.

32
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:15,819
You as a PM will be leading projects that tie in to the

33
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:19,597
important business strategies of your organization.

34
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:24,264
Perform issue and risk identification and remediation.

35
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:28,764
A PM will look at everything as a risk or issue.

36
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:33,264
Okay, I might be a little cynical, or maybe just experienced?

37
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:37,764
Of course, this is just the short overview list.

38
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:43,264
We will get into the nitty gritty details throughout the course.

39
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:48,558
Now here's a little more on what's a project manager.

40
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:52,264
Responsible for accomplishing the stated project objectives.

41
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,110
Sure, that makes sense.

42
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,264
Sometimes this can be a balancing act, for sure.

43
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:02,764
Key project management responsibilities will include,

44
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:07,264
creating clear and attainable project objectives,

45
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:15,948
what is it this project is going to do and accomplish,

46
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:22,326
building the project requirements of the customer or client,

47
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:22,951
bridging the gap between the project team and the customer/client,

48
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:24,558
you're going to need your interpersonal skills,

49
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:31,675
leadership skills to bridge that gap between real end business user,

50
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:34,264
and your technical team.

51
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:41,264
And lastly, managing the constraints of cost, time, scope, and quality.

52
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,264
Managing these constraints, cost, time, scope,

53
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:50,264
and quality, this is where you'll likely spend most of your time.

54
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:53,264
Be careful, you have many other things to attend to,

55
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:56,264
as you'll learn in the other modules, but trust me,

56
00:03:56,264 --> 00:04:00,264
these are the elements you're going to spend a lot of time on.

57
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:05,264
Okay, let's segue to talk a moment about what is known as the iron triangle,

58
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:09,597
or what I call the project triangle dilemma,

59
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:14,264
on the next slide.

60
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:20,087
The project triangle dilemma is composed of the following.

61
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:25,264
Cost, scope, schedule, and in the middle, quality.

62
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:29,381
And in the middle lies the dilemma.

63
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:35,264
So as project managers, we are striving for user satisfaction.

64
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:38,969
User satisfaction is when the system meets the requirements,

65
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:42,264
the scope, at a reasonable cost, the estimate,

66
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:45,948
and is delivered when needed, that would be the schedule.

67
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:51,597
Now the three of these will generally always be at odds with each other,

68
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:56,264
and will affect the quality of the product and service.

69
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:57,930
When I think about it,

70
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,597
most of your time as a project manager will likely be

71
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:03,264
spent working on these elements.

72
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:07,053
Scope will change, cost will change, schedule will change,

73
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:11,514
but if one changes the other two must also change typically,

74
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:15,014
and that's why they're always at odds, that's why I call it the dilemma,

75
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:19,106
and that's where many of your hours will be spent in

76
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:21,474
terms of managing the quality.

77
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:25,264
Because of that, and the importance of this,

78
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:30,406
let's talk a little further about the project

79
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:34,264
triangle dilemma on the next slide.

80
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:39,264
Now let's drill down just a little bit more on the project triangle dilemma.

81
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:42,414
Scope, what the customers want the system to do.

82
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:47,264
Now you might want to check out another one of my Pluralsight courses,

83
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,764
Best Practices for Requirements Analysis,

84
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:55,764
which focuses on tools and techniques that help you determine quality,

85
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:58,264
scope, and requirement specifications.

86
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:03,028
Next, schedule, when your customers need their new system,

87
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:07,673
and typically the schedule is roughly around the corner,

88
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:12,991
it's usually hurry up and get it done, and that's a real challenge,

89
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,264
it will be a big challenge for you.

90
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:20,389
And sometimes, there may even be a hard date to make,

91
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,264
maybe just one big milestone.

92
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:25,579
So if possible, try and break up that date,

93
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:29,264
or that milestone, into more manageable progressive dates and milestones.

94
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,369
It'll therefore show incremental progress,

95
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:37,264
and build trust in you and your team, and to your customer as well.

96
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,576
Cost, estimate, budget,

97
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:44,264
what can they afford or are they willing to spend on the project?

98
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:45,053
Now here again,

99
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:48,211
you might want to check out another one of my Pluralsight courses,

100
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,725
Best Practices for Project Estimation,

101
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:55,264
which focuses on tools and techniques to help you determine quality estimates.

102
00:06:55,264 --> 00:07:00,000
Making estimates is very a challenging activity and takes some

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,264
practice and some tools to get good at it.

104
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:09,216
Your future customers and users will always ask you for a cost estimate,

105
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:20,000
so get prepared so you can give one. Now, let's look at more detail at your responsibilities on the next slide.
