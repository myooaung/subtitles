1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:07,004
The next project control planning element is change management.

2
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:10,129
That's the reviewing, approving, prioritizing,

3
00:00:10,129 --> 00:00:17,004
and implementing changes, also known as just plain ordinary change control.

4
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:23,601
This covers any changes whatsoever that might arise regarding the project,

5
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:28,833
such as requirements, scope, which is the most common,

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,667
budgets, schedule, resources, business changes,

7
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:36,405
etc, anything that wraps around those kinds of changes,

8
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:42,119
and so we need to then create our plan on how we

9
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,500
will implement and manage changes.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,000
So why do we want to do change control or change management?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, project changes will occur no matter what,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,130
and it's just part of project life,

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,000
and you'll want to be prepared on what to do and how to deal with them,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,818
so you'll want to have a good process and plan in place.

15
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:06,000
Now one of your main challenges will be scope creep.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,333
And again, scope is the features you're going to implement,

17
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,000
and creep means they just keep on growing.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,667
Or it might even mean that you had a poor or inadequate scope to start with and,

19
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:18,000
therefore,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,333
it didn't meet the requirements out the gate and you're

21
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,000
always playing catch up on the scope side.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,048
So how will deal or manage with that?

23
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:32,000
And there may be other factors that drive scope creep or drive changes,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,500
which would be milestone dates,

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
they may change or move; system performance issues,

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,200
maybe the hardware or software or the cloud services are insufficient to

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,000
meet the performance requirements; budget changes,

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,053
budgets don't always go up, they usually go down; acceptance criteria,

29
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:56,571
what does it mean to be done or acceptable by the user; roles and

30
00:01:56,571 --> 00:02:00,333
responsibilities of different people or players or stakeholders; and

31
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,000
technology might be a moving target as well.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So because of all these, we want to get a good handle on change control.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,842
In summary,

34
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:14,737
one of the most common reasons of failed projects is poor requirements or the

35
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:18,000
ability to gather those requirements in a methodical way,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so you might want to check out one of my companion courses,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,750
Best Practices for Requirements Gathering,

38
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,000
here on Pluralsight.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,750
Here's your change management or change control road map.

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,000
Plan for changes.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In other words, create a change control plan,

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and add it to your overall project plan.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Institute a change control or change management process, have a process.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Educate and train everyone as needed,

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
especially the stakeholders on what the process is.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,118
And, of course, follow your process.

47
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:58,000
Someone comes up with a change; don't just go implement it.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,450
Follow the process of your change control.

49
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,000
And a little tip here is just minimize scope creep as much as

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,500
possible unless it meets your change control process.

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,600
For example, change control process may in fact be your best friend.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
If you have a criteria,

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,000
say change is tied to the e-commerce module will be implemented in release one,

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,667
all other changes will not,

55
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:26,000
then that change simply goes into your back log to

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
be looked at or dealt with later.

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,200
This can be very helpful in educating your users on hey this

58
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,250
isn't quite as important based on our change control process

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,500
criteria; it moves to the backlog.

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Before you is an example of a change management process.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
First step is document.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,143
We want to document a change,

63
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:56,429
so a change request form will be implemented with a change number,

64
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,029
a date, who, what, when, value, etc.

65
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:04,000
You can make the form as simple or as complex as you'd like.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,267
Change comes in; you document the change.

67
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:11,000
Next step would be to evaluate the change.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,529
We look at it with a certain criteria, maybe a benefit,

69
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,000
cost, impact to budget, schedule, customers,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,533
stakeholders,

71
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:25,467
milestones like our previous example if it's tied to the e-commerce release one,

72
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:26,000
etc.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now the evaluation criteria can change over time based on priorities.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,895
You document, you evaluate the change,

75
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,737
and then you have a disposition of the change,

76
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:39,294
in other words what action are you going to take.

77
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:43,500
Stakeholders decide to agree or not agree to add to scope.

78
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,263
Okay, so document, evaluate, have a disposition,

79
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:49,816
and you put the stakeholders in control of the

80
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:52,059
process so they feel that ownership.

81
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:56,294
I recommend you use some sort of automated web-based or cloud based

82
00:04:56,294 --> 00:05:00,200
change management system to track and log all the changes.

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,000
That way team members or stakeholders or users can easily fill out

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,800
the form and propose the form for evaluation.

85
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,300
Maybe your team meets daily or weekly or monthly to

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,600
look at different changes to evaluate.

87
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
And then give it a disposition, either it goes in the backlog,

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,778
or it will be implemented and planned accordingly.

89
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:24,000
And lastly, a report out.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That should be done regularly as part of your normal reporting activity.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,778
For example,

92
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:33,056
maybe part of your status report will say that we have

93
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,778
received five new change requests, three are under evaluation,

94
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:41,667
and another two or three from a previous status cycle have

95
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:44,333
been approved and here's what they are,

96
00:05:44,333 --> 00:06:23,000
so you're going to constantly report out as well on terms of what's coming in and out of your change control process.
