00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.795
Let's see how to continuously improve our project definition document process.

2
00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:10.637
Remember this is just your starter list,

3
00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:13.795
so all those categories we talked about in the last several slides,

4
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:20.017
that's your starter list, always see if you can't improve with each new project,

5
00:00:20.017 --> 00:00:23.462
so continuously build up your document with each project,

6
00:00:23.462 --> 00:00:26.462
add more topics, either major topics or minor topics,

7
00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:29.319
just use the heading levels in Microsoft Word,

8
00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.985
make it very, very easy for you.

9
00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:36.495
As an example in legal and regulatory, we had an example before.

10
00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.645
Now maybe we add in addition to, you know,

11
00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.795
the ADA, we'll add HIPAA, and PCI, and SOX,

12
00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:46.295
Sarbanes-Oxley, and for each project, maybe ADA is none,

13
00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:50.159
HIPAA, maybe we have that as a particular regulatory requirement,

14
00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.795
maybe PCI we have, and maybe Sarbanes-Oxley we don't have.

15
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.250
So what I'm trying to explain to you is,

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
it's very important not only to say what's in a project,

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.573
but what's not in a project.

18
00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:05.573
So a very solid project definition document will enable

19
00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:11.431
you to quickly gather key requirements, and as always,

20
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:17.795
quality key requirements drive better project planning.

21
00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:18.695
So remember,

22
00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:22.745
the project definition document is the first high-level step

23
00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:26.795
that is a key part of our project planning.

24
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:31.795
Now, let's check our work.

25
00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:35.913
Before proceeding with the detailed planning portion of this module,

26
00:01:35.913 --> 00:01:42.009
let's check to be sure our project definition document is sufficiently robust.

27
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.795
Is it clear why this project is being undertaken?

28
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.340
So as you look over your document, is everything in there accounted for,

29
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.427
is it clear on why it's going to be undertaken,

30
00:01:54.427 --> 00:01:58.216
is the scope clear and concise,

31
00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:05.795
is what it is we're going to do clearly and concisely documented?

32
00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:07.739
And those project stakeholders we talked about,

33
00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.684
are they on board, are they focused,

34
00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:12.224
do they understand what the project is all about?

35
00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:12.795
If not,

36
00:02:12.795 --> 00:02:17.195
make sure you talk to them and explain to them what the project's all about,

37
00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:22.795
and how they will benefit from it, and what help you need from them.

38
00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:25.906
We talked about recommended approaches, of those approaches,

39
00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:29.795
maybe call out which one might be the best option.

40
00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:34.427
We have three options, I think option two is the best.

41
00:02:34.427 --> 00:02:38.184
Risks are always important to identify for senior management,

42
00:02:38.184 --> 00:02:42.462
are they clearly identified, and if so, for each particular risk,

43
00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:47.795
what would be the response or how you would react to that risk,

44
00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:50.795
that needs to be documented as well.

45
00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:54.163
Lastly, you want all those stakeholders to review,

46
00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:57.532
agree, and approve to move the project forward,

47
00:02:57.532 --> 00:03:01.315
if they do not, you will have many problems in a project,

48
00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:04.115
so get them in a room, not one by one,

49
00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:07.128
but in a room so they can hear each other's,

50
00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:09.795
you know, comments, good, or bad, or whatever,

51
00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:12.509
make sure they get reviewed, agreed, and approved,

52
00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.652
that's the best way to start.

53
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.795
So that's kind of our checklist.

54
00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:20.613
If we got all this in place, we got the PDD done,

55
00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:23.795
we're ready to move forward with more detailed project planning.

56
00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:35.000
So now that we know what we want to do in the project, let's talk about how we will do it in the next section of this module.
