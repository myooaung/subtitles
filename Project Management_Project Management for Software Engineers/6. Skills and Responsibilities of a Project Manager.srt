1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,256
The following are your typical responsibilities that you'll do as a PM.

2
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:12,923
You'll develop the project plan, you'll manage the project stakeholders,

3
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:16,145
those interested in getting the project complete,

4
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:18,367
on time, and on budget.

5
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:23,256
You'll manage communications, just how will you talk to your team,

6
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:27,319
how will you talk to your customers, how will you status your project,

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,256
and so forth.

8
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:32,256
You'll manage a project team, so you'll need some leadership skills.

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,609
You'll manage the project risk,

10
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:40,256
so you can avoid pitfalls that might actually really destroy your project.

11
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:43,256
You'll manage the project schedule, it's got to be done on time,

12
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:48,367
and it's got to be done on budget, so you'll be managing to costs as well,

13
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:52,256
and any particular project conflicts that come up among users,

14
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:54,564
team members, issues, budgets, problems,

15
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:58,256
customers, vendors, you name it, conflicts will happen.

16
00:00:58,256 --> 00:01:02,381
And lastly, the project delivery, how it actually really gets delivered,

17
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:05,197
installed, and supported when you complete it,

18
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:08,492
the rollout, the pilot, things like that.

19
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:12,668
So the previous activities generally require what I might

20
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:15,139
call hard skills versus soft skills.

21
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:18,845
I think it's important to kind of understand the

22
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:29,256
differences between those skill types, and let's explore those on the next slide.

23
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,923
Now let's take a quick moment to define and understand two

24
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:35,256
main categories of skills you will need.

25
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:39,256
On the left, hard skills, on the right, soft skills.

26
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:43,694
Hard skills are about a person's skill set and ability to

27
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:47,194
perform a certain type of task or activity.

28
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:50,256
And some examples are programming, database design,

29
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:53,256
maybe using Excel spreadsheet, create a project plan,

30
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:58,479
budgets, and schedules, etc., like those items I mentioned on the previous slide,

31
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,701
those would be hard skills.

32
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:05,590
Soft skills on the other hand are personal attributes that

33
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,256
enhance an individual's interactions, and job performance,

34
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:12,256
and career prospects.

35
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:15,433
These examples would be leadership, speaking,

36
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:21,256
people, being able to be around people, at ease with people,

37
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:24,056
and relate with people, interpersonal relationships,

38
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:24,523
etc.

39
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:29,256
And after many years of managing people and leading projects,

40
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:32,756
yes you need those hard skills, definitely,

41
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:37,656
but the most successful project managers I've seen are the ones

42
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:40,106
that really can leverage the soft skills.

43
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:43,256
So just take a moment to think about that,

44
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:46,256
and you might want even do some more research on your soft skills.

45
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:48,165
This class is primarily on hard skills,

46
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:51,165
but I really want to point out the soft skills side,

47
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:55,438
and I'm going to touch on communication skills and

48
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:59,256
leadership skills in the execution modules.

49
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:06,256
Okay, now let's see some examples of just what I mean.

50
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:09,204
Key hard skills of a project manager.

51
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,888
The first, is business.

52
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:16,006
You must have a fair knowledge of the industry you are in,

53
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:19,506
so that you are capable of understanding and

54
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:21,256
discussing the business requirements.

55
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:23,256
The second would be process.

56
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:28,056
You need to have the ability to adapt to the various internal

57
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:31,056
procedures of a company or organization,

58
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:35,256
or create new ones for the organization.

59
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,941
And of course, technical.

60
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,730
You must have a reasonable and general understanding of

61
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,256
the technical aspects of the project.

62
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,756
Remember though, if you feel weak in an area,

63
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:48,256
add a team member, so just an application architect,

64
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:52,213
for example, to shore up your skills.

65
00:03:52,213 --> 00:04:01,256
Okay, now let's take a deeper look at the soft skills side on the next slide.

66
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:04,256
The previous slide listed management activities or technical skills.

67
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:10,256
Here, the following are key soft skills that may make or break your project.

68
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:12,333
The first, communication.

69
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:19,256
You must have very good speaking, writing, and listening skills.

70
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:26,456
These are very important, but they are learnable.

71
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,256
Second, leadership/people.

72
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:32,631
You must have the ability to lead and manage people,

73
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,256
in any sort of organizational arrangement.

74
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:37,021
Third, customer service.

75
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:43,492
This is essential in ensuring that the key issues of scope,

76
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:48,471
cost, time, schedule, quality, that we discussed before,

77
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:54,256
and client satisfaction or user satisfaction can be realized.

78
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:54,856
In summary,

79
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:59,056
these are all the soft skills that will enable you to form close links

80
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:01,971
with the project stake holders or representatives,

81
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:08,256
which is so, so critical to the success of your project.

82
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:16,256
Now let's review some key project manager attributes on the next slide.

83
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:18,590
Key attributes of a project manager.

84
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,145
So what's an attribute?

85
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:23,256
An attribute is a characteristic of a person.

86
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,542
This is slightly different from the skills we

87
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,256
talked about on the previous slides.

88
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,347
The first, ownership.

89
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:31,984
It's when you have the attitude that this is mine,

90
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:36,971
and I will do the very best I can do, rather than,

91
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,685
not my problem.

92
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:43,256
As a PM, they are all your problems.

93
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:48,256
Integrity, the quality of being honest and having strong principles.

94
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:50,590
This is so important on building trust,

95
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:56,102
and trust is one of the key elements you will need to work through the

96
00:05:56,102 --> 00:06:02,026
project management issues that you will confront.

97
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:06,256
The third, is effective communicator.

98
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:10,074
Effective communication by business managers facilitates

99
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:13,256
information sharing between company employees,

100
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,923
team members, management, vendors,

101
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:21,256
and can substantially contribute to the project's success.

102
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,590
Next, are you a people person?

103
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:31,256
A person who enjoys or is particularly good at interacting with others.

104
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,949
This is another key attribute that's very essential

105
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,256
for a successful project manager.

106
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:39,333
Next, process oriented.

107
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:46,256
Process orientation places a priority on how things are done.

108
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:49,256
For example, how are meetings conducted?

109
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:51,256
How are requirements written?

110
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:52,730
How was software tested?

111
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,151
These elements and attention to detail for a process I think are

112
00:06:57,151 --> 00:07:00,888
very important as well for a project manager.

113
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:01,940
And lastly,

114
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:08,256
the ability to stay focused and not easily distracted from the objective.

115
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:14,256
Some people are easily distracted and even like being distracted and unfocused.

116
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:16,021
I call these types firefighters.

117
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,845
They would rather jump on little short activities,

118
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:21,590
rather than the longer more important projects.

119
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,145
Now, let's turn our attention to project teams,

120
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:36,000
because you will need a team of people to help you get your job done. We'll see this on the next slide.
