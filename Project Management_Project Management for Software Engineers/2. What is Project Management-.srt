00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,366
Definition: what's project management?

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:08,505
This section will cover definitions, and concepts,

3
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:12,054
defining just what project management is.

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:22,054
Okay, let's begin with definition of project management on the next slide.

5
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:23,179
Project management,

6
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:28,241
it's the planning and organization of a company's or

7
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:34,254
organization's resources in order to move a specific task,

8
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:39,054
event, service, or product toward completion.

9
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:45,054
Okay, the short version of that is, the process of managing projects.

10
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:49,498
So just what is the process of managing a project?

11
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:53,054
Well, let's find out on the next slide.

12
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:58,654
The project management process is your management,

13
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:05,054
technical, and leadership skills applied to the planning,

14
00:01:05,054 --> 00:01:07,701
organizing, controlling, implementing,

15
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:20,054
and leading all of the activities of a project to meet the project's goals.

16
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:24,387
I'd also like to point out that a project's goals should be tightly

17
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:26,443
linked to the organization's business strategies,

18
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:29,554
and in a good company, they typically are.

19
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:33,054
So basically, this is the class in a nutshell.

20
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:37,554
This module, and the modules following, will do just that.

21
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:46,000
And those modules will be called Planning, Control, and Execution. Okay, let's move on.
