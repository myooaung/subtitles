00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.500
In the Project Control module, we discussed procurement management.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.160
It is likely that your project will need products or

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.357
services provided by third party companies,

4
00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:14.265
and therefore your project will need some amount of procurement management.

5
00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.030
Now as I mentioned before,

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.089
your company may have a procurement or vendor management department that

7
00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.457
have certain roles and responsibilities that are not yours,

8
00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:26.247
but they will likely not have the detailed knowledge about what services or

9
00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:29.559
products you will need to procure to support your project.

10
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.500
So outsourcing and vendor management is becoming a larger and

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.714
larger portion of the contributions to IT projects,

12
00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:40.089
so be prepared to engage and manage your service providers.

13
00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.422
Project managers require management skills who can work with vendors,

14
00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:46.089
and that is not easy for some people.

15
00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.639
Each vendor may be a unique and special relationship and at many times

16
00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.689
you will be the one deciding or influencing the KPIs,

17
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:57.889
Key Performance Indicators, or the SLAs,

18
00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.089
Service Level Agreements, for each vendor.

19
00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.089
So ensure the vendor meets these performance metrics and hence you will

20
00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.012
expect from each vendor things like status reports,

21
00:01:08.012 --> 00:01:13.089
performance reviews, and all the things your stakeholders want from you.

22
00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:17.089
So in a way, you are now the customer or stakeholder of the vendor.

23
00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:20.822
Procuring goods and services from external suppliers can

24
00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:24.089
be a critical path for your projects.

25
00:01:24.089 --> 00:01:28.489
So often the performance of the supplier will reflect on the

26
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:32.089
performance of you and of the overall project team.

27
00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:35.289
It's therefore crucial that you manage your supplier's

28
00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.089
performance carefully to ensure that they produce

29
00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:45.089
deliverables which meet your expectations.

30
00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:48.247
So if you are going to do some procurement management,

31
00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:51.089
you may be doing some contract negotiation as well.

32
00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:55.089
So what are those drivers for the need to improve your negotiation skills?

33
00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:56.853
Well no man is an island.

34
00:01:56.853 --> 00:01:59.206
You're going to be outsourcing labor, outsourcing services,

35
00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:00.422
and with cloud-based services,

36
00:02:00.422 --> 00:02:04.089
you're going to be outsourcing much more than you ever imagined.

37
00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:08.324
So some of the negotiation skills that you will need will be

38
00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:10.089
certainly understanding of basic contracts,

39
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.789
maybe knowledge on how to write statements of work.

40
00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.089
What is it that needs to be done by that vendor?

41
00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:20.089
And also, you're going to have the skill to write KPIs and SLAs.

42
00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:25.089
Lastly, if you think it's important, man just you better put it in that contract.

43
00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:31.907
That way you can ensure that your vendor will provide what you need in a

44
00:02:31.907 --> 00:02:35.089
timely manner to meet your project's requirements.

45
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:39.935
In this entire section, whether working with external vendors,

46
00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:42.089
stakeholders, customers, your management,

47
00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.803
and your team members,

48
00:02:43.803 --> 00:02:48.089
getting to a win-win position is critical for your success.

49
00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:52.289
So what do I mean by win-win?

50
00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.289
Seek mutual benefit with others.

51
00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.089
It's a team.

52
00:02:57.089 --> 00:03:00.971
You want to make sure that all parties feel good about

53
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.089
the decisions that have been made.

54
00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.946
And lastly, it's not your way or my way,

55
00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:10.803
it's a better way, so keep these three elements,

56
00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:15.781
these three steps in mind when you're in a room talking,

57
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:16.704
sharing, negotiating.

58
00:03:16.704 --> 00:03:18.089
Seek mutual benefit.

59
00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:20.130
What is good for them and you?

60
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.755
And do we all feel good about these decisions,

61
00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:29.089
and if not, ask why not and come to a better decision.

62
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:35.000
Make sure everyone understands it's not their way or your way, it is a better way for your customers.
