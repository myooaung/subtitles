00:00:01,277 --> 00:00:08,336
In this section we'll be covering the key elements of project control,

2
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:11,277
but first a few definitions.

3
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:15,215
Before we go deeper into the project control activities,

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,277
let's touch on this definition, project performance.

5
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:23,435
No, this is not software performance or how fast your stored procedure will run,

6
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:27,095
but instead it's how well are you achieving the

7
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,913
project's critical success factors.

8
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:30,277
What's a CSF?

9
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:34,865
Well, these are items that you're going to track to enable the stakeholders,

10
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:39,645
and yourself of course, to easily see how your project is performing.

11
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:45,913
Just as an example, a critical success factor could be number of hours used,

12
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:50,277
dollars, schedules, key deliverables, and things like that.

13
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:54,177
These are the items that you're going to come up with to help

14
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:56,277
you measure the performance of your project.

15
00:00:56,277 --> 00:01:02,277
Now let's go a little deeper with one more definition.

16
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:05,777
Those critical success factors we just mentioned,

17
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:08,277
basically they're just performance metrics.

18
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,944
Those are the variables you monitor and measure in order to

19
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:16,325
determine your project's performance, in other words how well are you doing?

20
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:21,277
And as we stated, dollars, hours, features, dates, etc, those are your metrics.

21
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:26,277
Those metrics are also called critical success factors as well.

22
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:34,277
Okay, let's go on to the key project control activities.

23
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:39,277
I will be covering eight project control activities,

24
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:44,277
and here are the first four: Communications management,

25
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:48,848
change management, configuration management,

26
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:52,277
and requirements management.

27
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:55,101
Now let's drill in.

28
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:59,336
Remember in the last module planning.

29
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:05,014
The outcome of that were tasks, estimates, schedules, etc.

30
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:07,593
That was the core of our plan,

31
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:11,277
but these other elements are also part of our plan.

32
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:14,277
We need to know how to plan for communications.

33
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:17,277
How are we going to plan for change management?

34
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:19,277
How are we going to plan for configuration

35
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:20,277
management and requirements management?

36
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:24,234
How we're going to do those things are also part of our plan,

37
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:32,000
and we we're going to talk about how to include those and create those in the following slides.
