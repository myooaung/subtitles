1
00:00:01,757 --> 00:00:07,110
Project controls are the things you use to monitor and measure your project,

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,757
first monitoring the project variables, cost,

3
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:11,757
effort, scope, resources, etc.

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:16,157
against the project plan and the project performance baseline,

5
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:18,957
in other words where we should be.

6
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:23,757
We also want to measure the ongoing project activities, where are we?

7
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,357
We also want to identify corrective actions to address issues and risks

8
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:31,020
properly in terms of how do we get back on track again,

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,915
what do we have to correct.

10
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:36,848
And also what are the influencing factors that could circumvent your

11
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:41,757
change control so only approved changes can be implemented?

12
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,169
That's managing change control.

13
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:46,698
Now this is a high-level overview of monitoring and measuring,

14
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:50,834
and in this module we're going to go into detail in

15
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,757
terms of all these activities.

16
00:00:52,757 --> 00:00:57,557
So good project controls give you good project results,

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,757
and let's see what they are.

18
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:03,257
By using your project controls,

19
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:08,757
these are the results that you want for a good project.

20
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:09,695
Deliver on budget.

21
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,757
In other words, if your budget is a million dollars, you're under that.

22
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:14,862
Stay on schedule.

23
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:17,810
Maybe have a variety of milestones and dates,

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,757
but you're always going to exceed those dates,

25
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:24,507
in other words come in early or on time.

26
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:25,757
Provide consistent deliverables.

27
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:32,757
Is what you deliver have good quality and meets the customer's expectations?

28
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:36,957
Meet quality expectations, no bugs, it works.

29
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:38,757
Meet performance expectations.

30
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:40,857
Performance has a variety of definitions here.

31
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:45,169
One might be the speed of the system when you hit the Enter key,

32
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,875
and another might be all these other elements that

33
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,345
are called project performance, budget, schedule,

34
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:51,757
etc.

35
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:55,090
Articulate, remediate gaps or deviations,

36
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,757
issues or problems say with the requirements.

37
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:02,581
And also identify and correct issues and risks.

38
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,757
You're always going to have issues that come up,

39
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:09,357
and you're going to always have risks to overcome.

40
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:13,757
How well do you understand those, track those, and remediate those?

41
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:17,757
So your project controls will need to provide you the information to

42
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:20,125
deliver these results to your project sponsors,

43
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,704
customers, and your team members as well.

44
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:28,043
Let me tell you, if your project did these things the right way,

45
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:33,186
you'll be wildly successful as a project manager.

46
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,757
Trust me on this.

47
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:39,639
Now project control is certainly more than just the tools and

48
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,157
processes for controlling and managing your project,

49
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,957
it's also about these elements as well.

50
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,157
Leadership, how well can you lead a team,

51
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:53,875
how well do you get people to work for you and follow your direction?

52
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,345
Communication, how well do you communicate the project statistics,

53
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,875
how well do you communicate to the stakeholders about the project's status,

54
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:05,231
how well do you communicate to your team about what needs to be done?

55
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:08,224
The people skills, not so much the technical skills,

56
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:11,957
but the interpersonal skills that are required to

57
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:14,757
communicate and support users and customers.

58
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:18,757
And team management, how well do you manage your team and lead your team.

59
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:25,757
These are also very important elements of running the entire project.

60
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:29,757
So I just want to make sure you understand that it's just

61
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:36,000
more than project control and metrics. These other elements are also critical.
