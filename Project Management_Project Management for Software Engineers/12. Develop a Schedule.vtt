WEBVTT
1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.884
In this step, we're going to develop a schedule.

2
00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:10.011
Now the WBS by itself is not a schedule, it is merely a list of tasks.

3
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:10.284
Okay,

4
00:00:10.284 --> 00:00:13.830
so the project schedule will have a start and end date for each

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.473
and every task that you have on the plan,

6
00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:22.011
and when you have some prerequisites for this as well of course.

7
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:28.011
The WBS, of course, that's the list of all the tasks to complete the project.

8
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.234
Resources assigned, what are all the resources needed?

9
00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:32.178
Now these are usually people of course,

10
00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:36.611
but it could also be tools or other sort of physical artifacts.

11
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:41.011
We want the estimate for every task, the amount of time,

12
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.538
preferably in hours, I don't really like days,

13
00:00:43.538 --> 00:00:47.011
or weeks, or months, let's get more specific and use hours.

14
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:48.485
Next, the confidence factor,

15
00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.169
this'll help you keep your eye on the task that

16
00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:54.380
you're not quite that confident in,

17
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.064
in either the hours estimate or maybe some other factors.

18
00:00:58.064 --> 00:01:01.011
This'll help you later focus on improving the

19
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.364
elements about this particular task.

20
00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:06.188
And lastly, task relationships or dependencies,

21
00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:11.761
does task A have to be done before say task B?

22
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:17.261
Now Microsoft Project and other tools are very good at

23
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:20.011
defining and tracking task dependencies.

24
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:26.011
Okay, now let's take a look at an example.

25
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:27.761
Here is our familiar example.

26
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:29.861
I have removed, by the way,

27
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:33.011
the Confidence Factor column just to put a little

28
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:36.440
more space here on the example, but if you,

29
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.011
yourself of course, you would leave that on there as a column.

30
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.229
Okay, so you can see on the right that I've added two more columns on the end,

31
00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.678
the Start Date and the End Date for that particular task.

32
00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:51.011
The first one, the Start Date is the date that I believe the work can begin.

33
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:55.011
It should be on or after the date the resource is available.

34
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:59.611
Next, the column that I added is the expected completion or End Date,

35
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:03.611
and here's just an example that I've squared off here,

36
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:06.854
the start and end date for task 100.

37
00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:14.011
50 is April 14, and I believe it will end on April 28, very easy and simple.

38
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.658
You're doing this, say yourself or with your team,

39
00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:20.726
and you're looking at the different assignments and resources that you have,

40
00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:25.011
and you're laying out the schedule, not that complicated really.

41
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.875
Then at the very bottom in the lower right,

42
00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:32.011
I have the start date and the end date for the entire project.

43
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.801
I just took the earliest start date and the latest end date,

44
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.011
and that basically is my entire range.

45
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.761
Now of course other tools like Microsoft Project may come in

46
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.835
very handy or easier if your project is more complicated with

47
00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:48.776
dependencies that are even larger, but I found for projects maybe 2,

48
00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:51.511
3, 4 people, using a spreadsheet is just very,

49
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:55.011
very easy to come up with a very quick and actually quite accurate schedule

50
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.854
to share back with your customer or your stakeholders.

51
00:02:57.854 --> 00:03:07.011
Now let me share with you some scheduling tips to help you do your scheduling.

52
00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:07.364
Okay,

53
00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:10.188
I recommend strongly that your scheduling process must

54
00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:14.261
cover all of the work on the project, not just some of it.

55
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.261
A lot of the times things get left off like quality assurance,

56
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.636
or promoting software from DEV to QA to production,

57
00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:25.011
documentation, release notes, it's everything you could possibly think of,

58
00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:27.482
everything you can possibly think of, meetings,

59
00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:29.247
time to write status reports,

60
00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:33.511
etc., to cover everything to get a more accurate estimate.

61
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:38.011
Also be as realistic as possible, what is reality,

62
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:41.011
you know the people, you know their strengths.

63
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:44.272
A lot of times though, you do get a lot of pressure from senior management,

64
00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:46.011
I want this done by a certain date.

65
00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:49.396
You need to have the strength and the integrity to say,

66
00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:54.011
hey, this is what it's really going to take to go do for our team.

67
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:55.511
Also do a sanity check.

68
00:03:55.511 --> 00:04:00.011
You might think your schedule looks pretty good, but can you really get it done?

69
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:03.067
Make sure you've talked to the right people on your team,

70
00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:03.900
maybe stakeholders, customers,

71
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.011
or other mentors in your company to make sure that those

72
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:13.011
estimates and the scheduling dates are realistic.

73
00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:15.466
And also have buy in from the project team.

74
00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:18.193
If someone says there's no way I can do this,

75
00:04:18.193 --> 00:04:21.070
they will feel that way throughout the software development process,

76
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.011
and just won't be as much of a team player,

77
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:27.931
or won't have as much faith or respect in you as a project manager,

78
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:31.011
you really want to get the buy in of your team.

79
00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:34.011
And lastly of course, everything must be documented,

80
00:04:34.011 --> 00:04:36.636
communicated to the team on your project,

81
00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:38.956
stakeholders, and I think updated weekly,

82
00:04:38.956 --> 00:04:42.845
in other words, things change, the estimates might get higher,

83
00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:46.070
they might get lower, when the estimates change,

84
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.011
the schedule will change, so I revisit and update my project schedule,

85
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:51.726
and estimates,

86
00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:56.011
and tasks every single week on every single project to be accurate.

87
00:04:56.011 --> 00:05:04.011
Okay, here's one more element of scheduling that I'd like to cover next.

88
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:08.432
Now even though our schedule may of looked pretty good on the previous slides,

89
00:05:08.432 --> 00:05:12.154
there's still the issue of what I call resource loading,

90
00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:18.154
this is where I literally want to lay out week by week the schedule

91
00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:22.011
with the resources and using the resource start dates,

92
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:25.011
and see how it all plays out.

93
00:05:25.011 --> 00:05:28.511
Now again, Microsoft Project will help us do this,

94
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.011
but for less complicated schedules, Excel is just fine.

95
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:35.830
Now on the left, the first column, I have the Resources column,

96
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.011
so those are the resources identified on the previous slides.

97
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:42.011
I even included TBD of course because that's a valid resource,

98
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:45.811
I still have to get a real person or persons to do that,

99
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:51.011
but I still need some time there to complete the project under TBD.

100
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.239
The next column are the estimated hours,

101
00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:55.784
so I look back on the estimated tasks,

102
00:05:55.784 --> 00:05:59.535
and so all of the hours for MK were 26 hours,

103
00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:06.011
all the hours for JK were 50, etc., so all those hours add up to 411 hours,

104
00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:08.959
that's my entire estimate for this project.

105
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:14.011
Across the top there, I have the week numbers like April 1,

106
00:06:14.011 --> 00:06:17.830
April 8th, April 15th, etc., so I've laid out all the weeks.

107
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.048
Above that is the week number, I always like to know the week number,

108
00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.419
am I in week 1 or week 2, so by laying this out,

109
00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.643
I see that I have a 7 week project to actually,

110
00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:33.064
you know, perform the 411 hours required.

111
00:06:33.064 --> 00:06:41.678
Okay, for week 1, April 1, based on the start dates back on the other schedule,

112
00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:45.011
MK is going to put in 6 hours that week.

113
00:06:45.011 --> 00:06:50.011
Now on 4/8, no one was starting yet, so this project has a very slow start.

114
00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:54.011
The next week is 4/15, and I can see several more resources came on board.

115
00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:58.726
MK still had 20 hours, JK, JR, and PS added 20,

116
00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:03.011
40, and 20 hours, so they're starting the project up.

117
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:08.011
In the next week, I have 40 hours for PS, and I have 40 hours TBD.

118
00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:12.011
The next week some more work is being done.

119
00:07:12.011 --> 00:07:12.456
Again,

120
00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:16.456
I'm determining this all on the tasks before the task

121
00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:18.234
schedule before with those start and end dates,

122
00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:20.411
and then the estimates assigned to that particular task,

123
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:26.011
and I carried it through to 5/6, and I carried it through to 5/13.

124
00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:32.011
Now one of the rows at the bottom, TOTAL Hrs/Wk, so I just summed up the hours.

125
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:40.011
So for the first week it's 6 hours, second week 0, third week 100, etc.

126
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.284
And the bottom row is what I call the WKLY CUM hours,

127
00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:48.891
so the first week is 6 hours, second week was 0 so that kept the CUM at 6,

128
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:52.491
and all the way through, that way on week 7,

129
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:55.011
I see that I've accumulated 411 hours.

130
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:59.964
Since the project is 411 hours, now I've laid out this resource chart,

131
00:07:59.964 --> 00:08:04.345
so I can see another visual slice of my schedule and

132
00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:06.567
estimates basically together across time.

133
00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:11.011
This is very, very handy to do a resource load.

134
00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:14.648
Just because someone says they're going to start on a date and end on a date,

135
00:08:14.648 --> 00:08:16.611
well, are you doing that full- time, part-time,

136
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:19.611
what portion or percent are you actually doing the work,

137
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:22.830
and now you can see on the very last column,

138
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.875
I have % On Project.

139
00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:28.966
So MK over these 7 weeks is on about 10%,

140
00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:32.493
that'd be on average about 4 hours a week,

141
00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:39.900
and PS is on about 50%, so this gives me a feel of how much of their time I need,

142
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.261
so if they work for me that's great.

143
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:46.011
If they work for other managers, I could share this with them and say look,

144
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:51.211
I'm going to need about 20% of your person or of this resource,

145
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:52.011
50%, etc.

146
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:54.711
So this resource chart is very, very handy indeed.

147
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:55.011
Okay,

148
00:08:55.011 --> 00:09:04.000
now let's move on to the next section and talk about project planning elements for project control.
