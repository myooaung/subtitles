00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.728
Now let's talk about the process for creating a project definition document.

2
00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:07.641
Okay, first off,

3
00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:11.902
an executive or a senior management might have an idea for a new project,

4
00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:13.728
hey, I got a new project.

5
00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:16.676
Okay, so that's going to be version one,

6
00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:19.255
the first iteration of the project definition,

7
00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:20.728
I call PDD v1.

8
00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:25.728
So PDD is the abbreviation, Project Definition Document version 1.

9
00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.062
Your management gave you some direction,

10
00:00:28.062 --> 00:00:32.728
an idea, you did some research, and you produced your first version.

11
00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:33.992
Now you're going to report out.

12
00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:36.728
What I mean by that is, you're going to share with your management,

13
00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:43.728
here's what I've learned so far, and is the project going to be a go or a no go?

14
00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:45.902
At that point, they can decide go or no go,

15
00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.641
or hey, maybe do a little more research,

16
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:51.228
and it's very typical to do iterations of this document,

17
00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:56.728
iterations of analysis, iterations of research prior to the go/no go.

18
00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:59.109
So what I'm going to show here is version 2.

19
00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.434
You did a little more research, you filled out the document even better,

20
00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:06.670
maybe added some new categories, or went deeper in some existing categories,

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.637
and you reported out again for a go/no go.

22
00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:11.865
And what I'm saying here then is,

23
00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:15.465
take as many refined iterations as you need to have the

24
00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:18.781
right amount of information so that senior management can

25
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:21.728
then decide to go or not to go.

26
00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:25.928
So it is your job as a project manager to create a good document,

27
00:01:25.928 --> 00:01:29.395
to create a good executive presentation back to management on

28
00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:32.728
why it's important to move forward or not.

29
00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:35.456
Now, in the next few slides,

30
00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:40.001
we're going to actually go over all the details about

31
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.728
what's in a project definition document.

32
00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:48.506
Now let's talk about how easy it is to design and build your

33
00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:50.728
own project definition document template.

34
00:01:50.728 --> 00:01:52.228
Okay, here are some key topics.

35
00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:54.728
Now, I'm not going to read each one to you,

36
00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:55.728
in the following slides,

37
00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:58.395
we're going to go through each one in detail and make sure

38
00:01:58.395 --> 00:01:59.728
you understand exactly what they mean.

39
00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:01.637
So, this is just a starter list.

40
00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:05.183
I'm sure you can come up with a dozen more in 10 minutes,

41
00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:08.528
if so, you would add them into your document.

42
00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:13.728
With each and every project, you're adding more topics, and also more subtopics.

43
00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:16.791
For example, maybe under policies and standards,

44
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.728
your project has a requirement to be HIPAA compliant,

45
00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:24.928
or maybe on the next project, it must follow an ISO standard.

46
00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:27.728
As each project moves through the PDD process,

47
00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:30.395
you'll be building up new subtopics as well,

48
00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:33.395
always collecting and building up more and more topics

49
00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:36.886
that will be added to your document.

50
00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:43.728
Okay, now let's see how easy it is to just put one together.

51
00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:46.163
Now one of my philosophies in this course,

52
00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:48.294
as well as my other Pluralsight courses,

53
00:02:48.294 --> 00:02:50.728
is to keep things really easy and simple.

54
00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:55.006
We don't need to use complex tools or complex processes to

55
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.728
be very effective as a project manager.

56
00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:00.183
Okay, just take out MS Word, create a document,

57
00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:02.365
put on a title page, table of contents,

58
00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.728
and for each of those headings you just saw,

59
00:03:04.728 --> 00:03:07.478
put a heading one, heading two for each one of those,

60
00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:09.547
maybe some subheadings would be heading level three,

61
00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:12.819
something very simple that gets picked up by the table of contents,

62
00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.728
and so it's very easy to read.

63
00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:15.895
With each project,

64
00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:19.784
you're going to enhance and improve this template of yours

65
00:03:19.784 --> 00:03:21.728
with different topics and subtopics.

66
00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:25.022
And lastly, prepare a very simple summary presentation,

67
00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.258
say in PowerPoint,

68
00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:29.676
for management for each of the PDD deliverables and

69
00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.255
versions we talked about before,

70
00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:35.882
so that way they can look at your PowerPoint as a summary of your

71
00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.728
PDD document and decide whether to go or no go.

72
00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:44.728
Either start the project, or maybe do another analysis version.

73
00:03:44.728 --> 00:03:45.919
Okay, in the next slides,

74
00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.014
I'll be giving you specific examples about each one of these topics so

75
00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:58.000
you get a really good idea about what I'm looking for, for you to put into a project definition document.
