00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,973
Here is a simple checklist of items I would like you to

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:11,088
use to better ensure your communications are effective and

3
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:15,088
you get the message across.

4
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:18,288
Let's check them out.

5
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:21,561
For all the forms of communication you may do,

6
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:26,288
I would like you to think and plan your communications ahead of time.

7
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:30,078
So before you click send or save or print,

8
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:34,288
I'd like you to follow the following five Cs checklist.

9
00:00:34,288 --> 00:00:35,938
First, be clear.

10
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:37,038
That is,

11
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:41,988
be transparent and able to be easily comprehended in

12
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:45,288
what you write or speak about.

13
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:46,431
Be concise.

14
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:53,288
Use as few words as possible to get the necessary information or

15
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:57,288
compressed information in order to be brief.

16
00:00:57,288 --> 00:00:58,288
Be courteous.

17
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:05,288
Always be polite in a way that shows consideration of others and good manners.

18
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,406
Be consistent, that is,

19
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:12,700
able to maintain a particular standard or repeat a particular

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,053
activity or artifact with minimal variation.

21
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:17,229
Be compelling.

22
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:24,888
We want your readers or listeners to understand your message and be attracted

23
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:30,288
to your message and encourage strong interest and attention.

24
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:33,446
And lastly, we want your stakeholders or customers to think,

25
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:33,762
hey,

26
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:43,288
I just received an email from my project manager and I can't wait to open it.

27
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:44,955
Here is our simple checklist.

28
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:48,955
So maybe make a little Post-it note on your computer screen to

29
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:53,622
the side that you can easily glance over at to be sure you are

30
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:55,288
always following the five Cs.

31
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:56,551
That's what I do.

32
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,499
It's very simple.

33
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:00,341
You go through the checklist, maybe modify an email,

34
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:05,788
modify a status, modify a PowerPoint presentation to get it just right.

35
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, now let's explore several communication tools and for each, let's apply our five Cs.
