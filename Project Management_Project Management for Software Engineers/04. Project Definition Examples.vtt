1
00:00:02.028 --> 00:00:05.186
Now I'm going to give you examples of key elements

2
00:00:05.186 --> 00:00:08.028
of a project definition document, this is real important,

3
00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:12.028
so it'll make it much easier for you to put one together for yourself.

4
00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:13.675
Purpose, as an example,

5
00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:16.970
a purpose could be replace the current student

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.028
enrollment system to increase enrollments.

7
00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:24.628
It's a business purpose, everything that's going to be tied around business,

8
00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:26.028
not technology typically.

9
00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:30.473
Goals and objectives, for example, I replaced in that system,

10
00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:34.381
I will have goals, such as improve student services,

11
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:38.264
provide better financial management, avoid end of life of old hardware,

12
00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:41.228
you know, old hardware like Windows XP or something.

13
00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:43.628
You may have 3, you may have 13,

14
00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:47.895
whatever number of goals and objectives that you need to place in

15
00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:51.628
here that make this project important or sellable,

16
00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:53.028
put in here.

17
00:00:53.028 --> 00:00:56.457
Success criteria, as I mentioned before,

18
00:00:56.457 --> 00:01:05.028
how do you think you're doing, how do you know the project was a success?

19
00:01:05.028 --> 00:01:09.578
the new system with the old data, or maybe there's a certain deadline,

20
00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:16.028
December 1, the system must be done, that's the success criteria.

21
00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:21.028
Let's go onto the next.

22
00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:23.852
What's in or out of scope?

23
00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:27.617
Typically, project definitions cover everything that's in scope,

24
00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:31.923
but it's also very important at times to talk about what's not in scope.

25
00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:34.028
What is it we're not going to do?

26
00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:38.828
That usually takes some confusion or some ambiguity out of a project,

27
00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:40.028
which is good.

28
00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:42.239
For example, out of scope, sales, marketing,

29
00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:44.449
student grades, we don't care about that,

30
00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:46.591
but in scope is student enrollment, financial management,

31
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:47.528
say cashier and accounts receivable,

32
00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:50.314
so it makes it really clear what we're going to do

33
00:01:50.314 --> 00:01:53.314
and what we're not going to do.

34
00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:54.171
Next, assumptions,

35
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:58.695
is there anything we can assume or have as underpinnings of

36
00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:01.695
the project that we need to be aware about?

37
00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:04.376
For example, insufficient budget for adding IT staff,

38
00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:05.072
that's interesting,

39
00:02:05.072 --> 00:02:09.246
so whatever IT staff we have now is what we are only

40
00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:12.028
going to have when we do the project.

41
00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:13.362
No off-the-shelf solutions available.

42
00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:17.028
Okay, so we know we're going to probably build it ourselves,

43
00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:18.028
that's an assumption.

44
00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:21.278
Must migrate legacy data, that old data must be in the new system,

45
00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:24.028
so we're going to have to think about that as well.

46
00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:26.555
So it's very important to itemize all your assumptions of the project,

47
00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:28.806
and again, you're going to have more than 3,

48
00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:31.917
you might have 10-30, or whatever it is,

49
00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:35.028
to succinctly articulate the assumptions for the project.

50
00:02:35.028 --> 00:02:36.743
Recommended approach, for example,

51
00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:41.028
develop use cases and screen sketches about how you might

52
00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:42.923
satisfy the requirements of the system.

53
00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:45.765
You might talk about custom development in terms of,

54
00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:49.146
is it going to be a Java platform, or a.

55
00:02:49.146 --> 00:02:53.028
NET, or some different types of tools, what's the initial architecture?

56
00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:55.806
Well, we think it's going to be a web application.

57
00:02:55.806 --> 00:02:58.728
So recommended approach is just some very high-level ideas about

58
00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:01.178
how you would actually accomplish this project,

59
00:03:01.178 --> 00:03:05.660
what would you have to do, you might need to buy some hardware,

60
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.081
you might need to build some software, you might need to engage a vendor,

61
00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:14.528
so just maybe there's even two or three approaches as option one,

62
00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:16.084
option two, option three,

63
00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:20.473
again to give some indication to the senior management

64
00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:25.973
about what are the different approaches that would satisfy

65
00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:29.028
the requirements of the project.

66
00:03:29.028 --> 00:03:33.874
Next, is business drivers, for example in this case,

67
00:03:33.874 --> 00:03:36.028
unsupported hardware and infrastructure.

68
00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:38.870
Maybe you have some old hardware like HP 3000,

69
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.028
or MVS, or some old IBM things, things like that,

70
00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:46.903
in other words, that's old infrastructure that you need to get off of,

71
00:03:46.903 --> 00:03:48.028
end of life.

72
00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.278
Inadequate service of support to students in this case,

73
00:03:50.278 --> 00:03:54.087
in other words, maybe you have areas that you need to improve the service,

74
00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:59.028
so that's a big business driver, here's why we need to do this project.

75
00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:00.205
Inadequate access to financials,

76
00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.558
typically you need financial information to run a

77
00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:04.428
company or to run an organization,

78
00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:08.428
and it's holding back the information that might allow key

79
00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:12.028
decisions to be made for this organization or company.

80
00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:14.087
So these are some key business drivers,

81
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:17.028
these are usually high up in your project definition document,

82
00:04:17.028 --> 00:04:19.499
and less linked tightly to the business,

83
00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:23.028
and the business drivers, or the strategies of that company.

84
00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:26.911
These are the things that will resinate with the senior executives,

85
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:29.028
so try to get these right.

86
00:04:29.028 --> 00:04:31.841
Budget, that's real important too to these senior executives.

87
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.028
In this case, maybe as an example,

88
00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:37.205
there's a three year budget available and that's it.

89
00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:40.028
Okay, well how might we allocate that budget?

90
00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:43.376
Maybe we're going to go 25%, then 40 for year 2,

91
00:04:43.376 --> 00:04:47.483
then maybe 35% for year 3, so these again are just rough allocations,

92
00:04:47.483 --> 00:04:48.847
just an idea.

93
00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:52.028
Maybe the whole budget is $5 million.

94
00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:55.724
So for budget, you just want to get a rough idea of how much money there is,

95
00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:59.251
or maybe the money is spread over a number of years,

96
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:00.584
things like that.

97
00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:01.028
Schedule,

98
00:05:01.028 --> 00:05:05.028
it's another very important one near and dear to

99
00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:10.528
executives and senior management, must be done on this particular date,

100
00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:12.028
things like that.

101
00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:14.428
Now what I might suggest in a schedule,

102
00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:18.028
is do some sort of incremental delivery or some milestones so that,

103
00:05:18.028 --> 00:05:20.660
well, maybe we're going to do this by October 1,

104
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.028
then we'll do these other things by November 1,

105
00:05:23.028 --> 00:05:24.292
and maybe lastly, by December 1.

106
00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:27.600
It's very important to kind of lay things out maybe a little more incrementally,

107
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.028
and we're going to talk about that later in the project as well.

108
00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:41.028
Next, we have return on investment, and this can be done very simply.

109
00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:47.976
A $500, 000 investment will return $750, 000 in 6 months' time.

110
00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:52.951
That's pretty good, that's what called a 50% ROI,

111
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:58.028
or Return On Investment, net profit divided by investment x 100.

112
00:05:58.028 --> 00:06:01.550
So for those key executives or management that you

113
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.028
might report to for this project, they may want to know what's the return?

114
00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:11.028
Would you spend $1 million and only get $10 back, probably not.

115
00:06:11.028 --> 00:06:16.091
This information will help determine your go/no go decisions.

116
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:20.976
Constraints, for example, a project must begin by July 1,

117
00:06:20.976 --> 00:06:22.870
otherwise certain things may not happen,

118
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.341
or maybe a vendor may not be available that's going to support you,

119
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:28.653
things like that.

120
00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:32.153
Data migration must be performed during the summer,

121
00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:34.440
low-usage months, okay, that's a constraint.

122
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.322
So you could layout these constraints that'll help guide how you

123
00:06:38.322 --> 00:06:42.210
might ultimately end up implementing the project.

124
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.028
Risks, another very, very important one.

125
00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:49.628
If we don't do the project, what will happen?

126
00:06:49.628 --> 00:06:54.028
In this case, the old hardware may fail as an example.

127
00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:56.499
This will affect our business continuity,

128
00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.558
could we support the business,

129
00:06:58.558 --> 00:07:02.607
and maybe the budget is only available for this fiscal year.

130
00:07:02.607 --> 00:07:06.081
A lot of times budgets will fluctuate and vary fiscal year

131
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.528
over fiscal year or maybe quarter by quarter,

132
00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.928
so find out when is the money available,

133
00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:19.028
when isn't it available, that might be a risk as well to the project.

134
00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:20.567
Next, stakeholders.

135
00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:25.182
Now this typically is senior management,

136
00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:30.594
executives, people of importance, VIPs, and for an example,

137
00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:35.289
it could be the dean of the university, maybe IT operations director,

138
00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.028
or a CFO, a Chief Financial Officer.

139
00:07:38.028 --> 00:07:42.028
Stakeholders could be one person, could be a half a dozen people,

140
00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:45.695
so know who your stakeholders are, identify them in the document,

141
00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.695
they're the ones that need to understand your document

142
00:07:48.695 --> 00:07:50.502
or say your PowerPoint presentation,

143
00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:55.713
and they will be the ones that will typically say go,

144
00:07:55.713 --> 00:07:59.028
or no go, or do more analysis.

145
00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:02.818
Preliminary schedule, based on all the information you've gathered,

146
00:08:02.818 --> 00:08:07.028
try to come up with a very rough preliminary schedule.

147
00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:10.322
Maybe I'll start project planning on January 1,

148
00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:14.362
and maybe by February 1, I'll have some specifications developed,

149
00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:17.028
and maybe we'll release the system in April.

150
00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:20.028
You know, just given on what I know, requirements,

151
00:08:20.028 --> 00:08:24.028
resources available, maybe a very rough preliminary schedule,

152
00:08:24.028 --> 00:08:28.028
this'll help the stakeholders decide what to do.

153
00:08:28.028 --> 00:08:30.870
Also, you want to come up with preliminary estimates,

154
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.724
maybe I'm going to need to engage a consulting company for $100,

155
00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:35.072
000.

156
00:08:35.072 --> 00:08:38.898
00, I might need to buy some infrastructure for $150, 000.

157
00:08:38.898 --> 00:08:39.246
00,

158
00:08:39.246 --> 00:08:44.087
and then I need to maybe bring on some contractors or a consulting

159
00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:46.970
company to actually do the software development,

160
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.028
that might be $250, 000.

161
00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:56.028
So hey, here's what I think this project might take to go do.

162
00:08:56.028 --> 00:08:57.778
Next, policies and standards.

163
00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:03.028
Many times on a project, you must comply with policies and standards.

164
00:09:03.028 --> 00:09:07.028
They may be company policies and standards,

165
00:09:07.028 --> 00:09:11.028
or governmental, state, federal, you name it.

166
00:09:11.028 --> 00:09:15.306
So for an example, a security policy must be PCI compliant,

167
00:09:15.306 --> 00:09:18.028
and also maybe from a standard standpoint,

168
00:09:18.028 --> 00:09:20.695
must follow the university application lifecycle management standards,

169
00:09:20.695 --> 00:09:24.028
so you always want to include any policies and

170
00:09:24.028 --> 00:09:27.528
standards that it must be complied with,

171
00:09:27.528 --> 00:09:31.028
and if there are none, say none.

172
00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.528
So we don't like to leave categories out ever.

173
00:09:33.528 --> 00:09:34.917
All the categories, or subcategories,

174
00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:38.428
or all these key elements need to be included in your document,

175
00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:42.612
and of note then, if they do not apply for this particular project,

176
00:09:42.612 --> 00:09:49.028
say none, that way you know it was considered and documented.

177
00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:52.139
Legal and regulatory, it's another nice area.

178
00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:57.028
From a legal standpoint, maybe it needs to be ADA compliant,

179
00:09:57.028 --> 00:10:01.695
American with Disabilities, that particular compliancy may be very important,

180
00:10:01.695 --> 00:10:04.028
maybe for your user interface.

181
00:10:04.028 --> 00:10:06.278
Also, maybe there's some regulatory requirements.

182
00:10:06.278 --> 00:10:10.028
In this case, I said none as my example previous.

183
00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:14.917
You always want to keep your categories and subcategories in place,

184
00:10:14.917 --> 00:10:18.028
and if it doesn't apply, say none.

185
00:10:18.028 --> 00:10:22.403
Competitive drivers, many times your company might be running great,

186
00:10:22.403 --> 00:10:25.970
but run into some competitive issues, and therefore,

187
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.793
in this case as an example,

188
00:10:28.793 --> 00:10:33.028
other universities enable a much better student enrollment experience.

189
00:10:33.028 --> 00:10:37.028
Sometimes if things are hard to do, they call that friction in the business.

190
00:10:37.028 --> 00:10:41.550
If it's a lot of work or friction to enroll in your school,

191
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.028
they may choose to more easily enroll in another school.

192
00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:48.205
Greater competition among schools, a lot of competition today,

193
00:10:48.205 --> 00:10:52.028
a lot of courses being offered online in particular,

194
00:10:52.028 --> 00:11:00.000
so maybe we need to beef up our game and ask maybe one of the drivers for this project as well.
