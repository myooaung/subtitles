1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,003
Now I would like to discuss leadership qualities.

2
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:09,884
In other words, what are those qualities that make for a good leader?

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:13,484
The first, someone who can embrace and champion change.

4
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:17,884
Remember as a PM, you are in fact a change agent,

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,617
leading projects, completing your mission for the stakeholders,

6
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:24,884
that is the leaders of your company.

7
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:27,509
Next, earn credibility across the organization.

8
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:31,884
You may not have people that work directly for you,

9
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:36,305
but instead for other managers, and they are assigned to you for the project,

10
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:41,702
hence, giving you the ability to influence others towards a common goal.

11
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:43,884
This can be challenging.

12
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:46,463
A desire to lead projects and people.

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:51,413
Maybe PMs may be more comfortable running the project from a technical side,

14
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:54,590
making plans, writing status reports, etc,

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,884
but not that comfortable with the people side of things,

16
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:04,884
and that is the most important part of your leadership role as a PM.

17
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:06,684
Ability to build trust.

18
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:13,884
We focused on this in the last slide and how important trust is to your success.

19
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:16,384
Strong communication and marketing skills.

20
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:21,884
How are you going to lead if you can't communicate well?

21
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:27,134
The next section of this module will address improving

22
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,884
your communication effectiveness.

23
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:30,196
Strong negotiation skills.

24
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:34,571
How can you succeed as a project manager without negotiating

25
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:38,328
and balancing the needs of many interests?

26
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,162
Strategic planning skills.

27
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:46,884
As a leader, you are thinking strategically and not just tactically.

28
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:50,967
You understand the critical role of well-defined

29
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,884
processes and strongly support them.

30
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:57,702
Successful projects are not random happenings,

31
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:00,884
but typically follow defined processes.

32
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:03,354
Lastly, project and team management skills,

33
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:10,684
well certainly, you need these basic skills that we outlined in modules two,

34
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:14,884
three, and four.

35
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,793
Now we have come full circle.

36
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:21,884
What I asked at the beginning of the module, why should anyone be led by you?

37
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:22,234
Okay,

38
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:26,434
I'm going to talk about four different areas where people ranked very

39
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:30,296
high that if they had these types of attributes,

40
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:33,119
your team would follow.

41
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,648
First, by exposing some vulnerability,

42
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:40,884
you reveal your approachability and humanity.

43
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:44,576
So beyond creating trust and a collaborative atmosphere,

44
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:49,696
communicating a weakness also builds solidarity between followers and leaders.

45
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:54,759
Your ability to collect and interpret soft data helps

46
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,710
them know just when and how to act.

47
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,927
So as a leader,

48
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,884
if you can sniff out the signals in an environment and sense what's

49
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:06,634
going on without having anything spelled out for them,

50
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:07,884
that is good.

51
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:12,455
Indeed, great sensors can easily gauge unexpressed feelings.

52
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:17,828
They can very accurately judge whether relationships are working or not.

53
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:22,884
The process is complex, and as anyone who has ever encountered it knows,

54
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:24,357
the results are impressive.

55
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,200
So look into their eyes,

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,884
look at their body language to see those visual cues

57
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:33,384
about what may not be expressed verbally.

58
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:37,884
Real leaders emphasize fiercely with the people they lead.

59
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,328
They also care intensely about the work their employees do.

60
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:46,384
Another quality of good leaders is that they capitalize

61
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,884
on what's unique about themselves.

62
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:52,884
It may be your expertise, honesty, or integrity.

63
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:58,884
It even could be the way you dress, talk, or carry yourself when you walk.

64
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:01,584
It could be your smile or your eye contact.

65
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,984
It could be that you are incredibly smart,

66
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:08,884
work long hours, and always engage in small talk with team members to relax them.

67
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:15,884
These things may seem small or even silly, but they are very powerful indeed.

68
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:16,217
Lastly,

69
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:19,550
people do not commit to project managers who merely live

70
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,884
up to the obligations of their jobs.

71
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:24,884
They want more.

72
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:32,000
They want someone who cares passionately about the people and the work just as they do.
