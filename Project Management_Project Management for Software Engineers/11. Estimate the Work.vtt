00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.406
Now we are ready to estimate our work, but before we do,

2
00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:07.009
we're going to have a couple of prerequisites.

3
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.343
We want to make sure that the WBS is complete,

4
00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.676
and also all the resources are assigned,

5
00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:15.851
and a little tip, you know, when you assign your resources,

6
00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:19.343
it helps you better make the estimate, will it be a junior programmer,

7
00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:20.676
maybe a senior programmer,

8
00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:24.343
and many times those estimates to get the work done might

9
00:00:24.343 --> 00:00:27.237
be different based on the skill sets, the training,

10
00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:28.509
and items like that.

11
00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.009
Okay, so for each task that we have in the WBS,

12
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.120
we want to make an estimate of hours.

13
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.851
Next, if you've assigned a generic resource like software engineer or TBD,

14
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:41.115
that's certainly okay,

15
00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:45.325
go ahead and make a rough estimate anyway for like

16
00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:47.009
the generic software engineer.

17
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.009
So again, I always believe in keep it simple,

18
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:55.464
make it easy to create estimates, you may not have all the answers at one time,

19
00:00:55.464 --> 00:00:58.009
that's okay, start roughing out your estimate.

20
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.009
Also, please check out one of my other Pluralsight courses,

21
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.009
Best Practices for Project Estimation,

22
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.343
that course provides all the tools you need for creating an affective estimate,

23
00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:12.879
so here's a whole class, and all we have here of course is just two slides,

24
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.488
so obviously there's a lot of things you may learn

25
00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:20.009
if you look at the other class.

26
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.009
Okay, let's see some examples.

27
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.309
Now here's the same example we've been using throughout this module,

28
00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:31.086
and last time we added the Who and the When columns,

29
00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:37.009
this time we're going to add estimated hours and confidence factor.

30
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.295
So there's the list of our estimated hours,

31
00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:42.438
so for the first task, I put 4 hours, 2 hours,

32
00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:44.314
20 hours, and as I'm putting those hours,

33
00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:47.575
I'm looking across on who's going to do the work to give me a better

34
00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:50.093
idea of the skillsets and how long it might take to do,

35
00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:54.240
and you may also want to do this with that person and in a team setting,

36
00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.009
and the whole list of tasks adds up to 411 hours.

37
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.828
Now next I want to look over to the Confidence Factor column,

38
00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:08.676
and what this is saying is how confident am I that my

39
00:02:08.676 --> 00:02:10.676
estimates are pretty true and accurate.

40
00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:16.183
So for the first one there, I feel that 4 hours is right on the money,

41
00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:17.749
and I'm 100% confident.

42
00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:24.009
Now on this next one, I'm only 50% confident, and I said it's about 40 hours.

43
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.852
What's nice about having the confidence factor is it

44
00:02:26.852 --> 00:02:31.676
allows you to circle back around later, maybe do some more analysis on that task,

45
00:02:31.676 --> 00:02:35.009
have more discussions with your team, possibly with your customers,

46
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.282
and you want to get that bumped up as close as you can to 100.

47
00:02:39.282 --> 00:02:40.373
No estimate is perfect,

48
00:02:40.373 --> 00:02:45.120
but the confidence factor is a nice little feature to find out and to

49
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.000
understand where you are on each of those particular tasks. Okay, next let's move on to making a schedule.
