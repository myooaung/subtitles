00:00:01.832 --> 00:00:04.411
Let's go through a project closure checklist.

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.832
These simple items will really help you bring your project to closure.

3
00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:10.067
Secure stakeholder acceptance.

4
00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:15.832
You really can't close a project if your stakeholders don't think you are done.

5
00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:21.832
Make sure your stakeholders have verified and accepted the project deliverables.

6
00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:24.832
Transition results to the owner or operator.

7
00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:27.832
That is the deliverables of the project.

8
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:32.888
Follow the items on your WBS for properly handing off the project results

9
00:00:32.888 --> 00:00:36.610
to who or whatever organization that will support it.

10
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.610
Sometimes we will use the terms dev-ops to represent

11
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.832
the organizational structure of this.

12
00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.287
Capture those lessons learned.

13
00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:46.832
We are not looking to crucify anyone.

14
00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:51.773
You want real constructive inputs, likely to be more negative than positive,

15
00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:57.200
but don't forget about reinforcing all the good things the team has performed.

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.569
Gather up all the improvement ideas, document them,

17
00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.165
and plow them back into the next project.

18
00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.832
Conduct team performance evaluations.

19
00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:10.832
Now if you are responsible for providing performance

20
00:01:10.832 --> 00:01:13.832
evaluations for your team on an annual basis,

21
00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:18.832
it is better to collect your thoughts and take some notes so you don't forget.

22
00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:25.832
Always provide constructive and actionable feedback to your team members.

23
00:01:25.832 --> 00:01:27.388
Final project financial reports.

24
00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:32.443
What this is is you need to document and publish the final budget

25
00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:34.919
summary and variance analysis of the project.

26
00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:37.354
Now it may not all look pretty,

27
00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:41.610
but talk to the ups and downs of your charts with the

28
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.721
constructive business reasons why they are that way.

29
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:45.888
Like, for example,

30
00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:49.832
the expenses went up here because the stakeholder wanted

31
00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:52.832
more features and they were approved.

32
00:01:52.832 --> 00:01:55.779
And close out any contractual or business matters.

33
00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.990
If you used third party vendors,

34
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.165
make sure the work orders for your project are completed or closed.

35
00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:06.370
Also for any internal accounting or charge numbers and things like that,

36
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.217
they do need to be attended to as well.

37
00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:12.832
And lastly, celebrate.

38
00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.832
Remember from one of our first slides?

39
00:02:15.832 --> 00:02:18.832
Project management is hard work, so celebrate.

40
00:02:18.832 --> 00:02:22.895
Maybe an awards ceremony and make it fun or humorous or a luncheon,

41
00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:23.832
things like that.

42
00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:37.000
People love to be thanked for hard work. Okay, our project is now closed and let's summarize the entire course.
