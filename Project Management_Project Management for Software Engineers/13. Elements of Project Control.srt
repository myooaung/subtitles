1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,536
Now you might have thought at this time your project plan is complete,

2
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:07,932
but it is not.

3
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:10,155
There are other required elements of your plan,

4
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:14,075
and in particular I call these the elements for project control,

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:20,932
now let's see what they are.

6
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:26,266
At this point in the planning, you have created a project plan,

7
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,932
which included the WBS, acceptance criteria,

8
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:30,932
you assigned resources, made an estimate,

9
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:35,548
made a schedule, and maybe even did a resource loading plan as well,

10
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:42,932
but there are other supporting planning elements to include in your document.

11
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:50,877
Now these planning elements are more around the process of running the project,

12
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:53,932
AKA project control and execution.

13
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:57,226
For example, how would you do the following,

14
00:00:57,226 --> 00:01:00,932
how are you going to do project status reporting,

15
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:03,066
requirements management, issue management,

16
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:04,666
is there more?

17
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:10,361
Yes, there's absolutely more, and let's see what these are,

18
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:18,932
because these are very important elements of your project plan as well.

19
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:23,932
There are eight elements for project control, and here are the first four.

20
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:28,932
Reporting, how will you report on the progress and status of your project?

21
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:32,932
You will need a plan or an approach to be included in your project plan.

22
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:36,063
Change control, how will you mange change control?

23
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:41,932
Again, you will need a plan or approach to be included in your project plan.

24
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:43,932
Configuration management, how will you do that?

25
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:45,932
What's your plan or approach for that?

26
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:49,432
This also will be included in your plan.

27
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:53,332
Requirements management, another very key element of project control,

28
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:57,332
and you will need this in your plan as well.

29
00:01:57,332 --> 00:02:00,932
So what we covered before, the tasks, the estimates,

30
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:03,756
the schedule, the project definition document,

31
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:08,932
those are very common and typical elements of a project plan,

32
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:13,932
and most of the time, people stop there and start moving forward.

33
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:16,266
What I'm suggesting to you are,

34
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,377
these are additional elements that are extremely critical

35
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:28,932
as well to the success of your project, and let's look at four more.

36
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:33,932
And here are the next four project plan elements for project control.

37
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:35,511
Our first one is risk management,

38
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:38,932
how are you going handle risks that might come up in the project?

39
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:41,655
Issue management, how will you handle issues?

40
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:45,932
What are your plans again in order to do these items?

41
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,266
Procurement management.

42
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:51,932
And the last one is quality management.

43
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:56,038
Now all eight of these additional elements of your project plan will be

44
00:02:56,038 --> 00:03:05,000
discussed in detail in the next module on project control, so I'll see you there in a few moments.
