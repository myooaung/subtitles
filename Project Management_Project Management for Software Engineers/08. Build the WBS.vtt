00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.119
Step two is building the WBS, the Work Breakdown Structure.

2
00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:05.743
So first,

3
00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:11.037
we want to make sure that we understand everything that needs to be done,

4
00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:15.926
and itemize all the tasks, everything, not some of the items,

5
00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:19.426
make sure you itemize all of the items no matter how

6
00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:24.426
silly or obscure you think they are, and we're going to use the WBS,

7
00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:28.926
the Work Breakdown Approach to document all those items.

8
00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:33.204
And just to kind of give you a little definition here,

9
00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:37.260
it's a hierarchical and incremental decomposition of the projects into phases,

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.593
deliverables, and work packages.

11
00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:41.926
They can be simple, and they can be very complex.

12
00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:44.961
Maybe task 1 has below it task 1.

13
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:45.719
1., 1.

14
00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.478
2, 1.

15
00:00:46.478 --> 00:00:47.995
3, and maybe 1.

16
00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:49.133
3 has 1.

17
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.271
31 and 1.

18
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:54.017
32, so you can make it as detailed as you like,

19
00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:57.017
and in this class, we're going to keep it relatively simple,

20
00:00:57.017 --> 00:01:00.985
but it is a real nice way of decomposing tasks into subtasks,

21
00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:05.926
and that usually gives you a better handle on estimation and scheduling.

22
00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:08.974
Again, if a task was just too big,

23
00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:13.926
it's really hard to figure out how long it might take to do.

24
00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:19.164
So we're going to show each WBS task and subtask that

25
00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:23.926
if we execute all of these tasks, that will it,

26
00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:29.926
in fact, fulfill the project deliverables as outlined in our PDD.

27
00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:35.260
So, once you complete all the tasks, and you've listed them all out in the WBS,

28
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.926
subtasks, whatever, you want to stand back for a moment,

29
00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.926
pull the team together and say, if we do all this stuff,

30
00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:45.926
will we accomplish the project, so you're kind of validating again,

31
00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:50.926
okay, do I have everything here I need to have here?

32
00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:53.361
So it's that 100% rule that's real important,

33
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.926
if we finish all these tasks, will we in fact be complete with the project?

34
00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:01.242
It's a great little, little checklist to go through.

35
00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:04.926
If not, then you're going to be missing some tasks,

36
00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:09.926
and if yes, you're complete, so your WBS is complete and you can move on.

37
00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:17.926
Okay, well let me show you a very simple example on the next slide.

38
00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:21.274
Here is a very simple example of a work breakdown structure.

39
00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:26.972
So you can see at the top that I have a column for Item # and Description,

40
00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:32.699
item numbers, I have a 100 section and I have a 200 section below,

41
00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.426
so it's a very simple layout, and I'm trying to itemize all these tasks,

42
00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:40.641
so you and your team will come up with all of these tasks to itemize.

43
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:44.069
I want to call your attention to 100.

44
00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.326
40, this is just an add or modify additional tables and fields in the database,

45
00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:52.326
this is a particular task.

46
00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:56.326
Now, as an example, if the team asks several questions,

47
00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:01.126
like I am not sure I understand, can you tell me more,

48
00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:02.726
it's a little confusing,

49
00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:07.691
that is an indicator that you may need to decompose that

50
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.515
particular task and maybe this 100.

51
00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:12.426
40 turns into.

52
00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:16.926
41,. 42,. 43 with more granular subtasks under it.

53
00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:19.426
So that's always the indication,

54
00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:23.117
if you look at a task and everyone nods and goes,

55
00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:25.022
yep, that's what we're going to go do,

56
00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:28.482
then it's probably at the lowest level of decomposition that you need.

57
00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:31.593
So always remember this is a living document,

58
00:03:31.593 --> 00:03:34.226
and as we progress in this section,

59
00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:37.226
we're going to be adding more columns for each task.

60
00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:40.750
As you do with any project, you'll be also adding tasks,

61
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.044
maybe even removing some tasks, and some tasks,

62
00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:51.000
as we've talked about, will spawn subtasks. Okay, let's move on to step three.
