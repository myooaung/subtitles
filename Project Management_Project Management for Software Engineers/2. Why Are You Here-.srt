1
00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:03,218
Why are you here?

2
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:07,007
It is likely that since you are an avid user of Pluralsight,

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,773
that your responsibilities are likely software engineering,

4
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:12,955
or at a broader level, systems engineering.

5
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,955
And maybe your management has come to you and has asked,

6
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:18,955
or even told you, that you will need to stop maybe,

7
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:23,484
or slow down, or change slightly, on working on software development,

8
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:25,955
and maybe even start running projects.

9
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:26,955
Well now what?

10
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:28,288
You've probably had some,

11
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:31,288
or most of these feelings: are you afraid of

12
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,288
leadership or management responsibilities?

13
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:39,955
Are you confused on just how to develop project plans?

14
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:44,955
Have you been asked to be a leader, and maybe, not a doer as much?

15
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:47,240
Are you a software engineering expert,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,955
yet feel like a fish out of water when it comes to managing a project?

17
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,812
Do you need help augmenting,

18
00:00:55,812 --> 00:01:00,955
or transitioning your technical skills with project management skills?

19
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:06,155
Have you been asked to be a project manager on a new project?

20
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:08,955
Is your project over budget, missing milestones?

21
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:15,955
Well if so, then you've come to the right place.

22
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:19,844
Now let's cover who this course is best suited for.

23
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,955
This course in an introductory project management course,

24
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:25,355
a 101 course if you will.

25
00:01:25,355 --> 00:01:28,955
And it's well positioned for three categories or viewers.

26
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,262
First, technical professionals new to project management,

27
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:38,032
such as software or systems engineers, senior engineers,

28
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,186
or technical team leaders.

29
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:43,955
Second, business professionals new to project management,

30
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:46,955
such as project leaders or coordinators,

31
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:49,955
project managers, or even functional managers.

32
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:50,500
Lastly,

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,955
anyone interested in developing and improving their project management skills.

34
00:01:55,955 --> 00:02:00,896
So this course is primarily geared to technical people looking to begin

35
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:05,227
learning all about project management or looking to improve their

36
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:14,000
existing project management and leadership skills. Okay, now let's go over the course overview, and then the objectives.
