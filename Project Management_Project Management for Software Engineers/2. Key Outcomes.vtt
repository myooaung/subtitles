00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:06.651
The three key outcomes of project closure are the following.

2
00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:08.267
The first, meet.

3
00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:12.350
Did you meet your project's success criteria?

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.933
Transfer.

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.267
Did you transfer responsibility?

6
00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:20.267
And lastly, thank or thank everyone, acknowledge contributions.

7
00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:24.267
Let's go into each three of these in detail to be sure we understand those.

8
00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:25.190
The first,

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.267
did you meet the project's success criteria and meet customer's expectations?

10
00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.544
If not, you will have difficulty closing or ending the project.

11
00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:39.793
And secondly, is the project actually done if you have not done this?

12
00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:41.056
Next, transfer responsibility.

13
00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:46.867
Be sure you consider in your project plan who will own and be

14
00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:50.067
responsible and operate the project deliverables.

15
00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:53.267
And how will that transition happen?

16
00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:57.267
If you haven't thought of this, you may have difficulty again ending the project.

17
00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:03.267
Add items to your WBS back in project planning for the transfer of activities.

18
00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:06.933
Now if this transfer is really big or hard or complex,

19
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.267
then I would suggest adding another mini plan to your

20
00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:12.933
project control section of your overall plan.

21
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:19.029
I have seen cases where a ton of hard work went into a project only to

22
00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:23.219
be unappreciated or accepted by the customer or users when the

23
00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.267
transition either didn't happen on time or properly.

24
00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:27.156
Guess what?

25
00:01:27.156 --> 00:01:31.156
You are the PM and are responsible for this.

26
00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:32.044
And lastly,

27
00:01:32.044 --> 00:01:35.914
thank and acknowledge all contributions by all of the

28
00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:37.973
participants during the project closure.

29
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:43.267
And also close out the accounting, resource, legal, contract, and other items.

30
00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:48.767
And we're going to talk about more of those in our

31
00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.267
checklist slide coming up soon.

32
00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:53.517
Sometimes closing a project can be kind of tough.

33
00:01:53.517 --> 00:01:54.517
Before you know it,

34
00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:57.267
you get assigned to the next project before you've had

35
00:01:57.267 --> 00:01:59.933
time to close the one you were on.

36
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.267
Hang in there and push for closure.

37
00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:05.796
It will be good for your career and the customer.

38
00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:08.267
Now is this worth doing, project closure?

39
00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:12.117
Sometimes companies do not see this step as adding any value.

40
00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:15.667
If you are rated or evaluated by your project's performance,

41
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:21.267
you better do a project closure so you can complete and document your successes.

42
00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:23.846
You might be missing a transition plan.

43
00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.793
That WBS we talked about in project planning,

44
00:02:26.793 --> 00:02:30.044
that needs to include additional tasks that would

45
00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:32.267
account for transitioning your project.

46
00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:35.767
Now it may be as simple as moving the app,

47
00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.567
or system, etc., over to an operations team,

48
00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:39.267
but how?

49
00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:43.630
You will likely need documentation, training,

50
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.267
mentoring, maybe even additional staff.

51
00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:50.767
Lastly, lessons learned can be painful.

52
00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:54.267
Sometimes projects don't go very well.

53
00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:59.267
There are many people issues or things people basically goof up.

54
00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:04.319
This is where a strong leader like yourself or a quality executive

55
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.267
can lead and facilitate the closure process,

56
00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:11.267
so that you can learn and gain valuable lessons for future projects.

57
00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:13.267
And remember,

58
00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:20.000
the past is where you learn the lesson and the future is where you apply the lesson.
