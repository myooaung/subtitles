1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,072
There is more to managing your customer's expectations than just managing scope.

2
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:11,072
Now scope is, of course, very important and an interval part of your job.

3
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:14,197
Your goal is to have a common set of expectations

4
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:16,072
shared by all of the stakeholders.

5
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:19,930
You can achieve this common ground by designing and

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,072
building your project definition document,

7
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:23,144
your project plans,

8
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:27,072
and your project control activities that we covered in previous modules.

9
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,072
Your stakeholders will know what to expect if there is a change,

10
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,072
for example, since you have a change management process.

11
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:37,778
Critical success factors will be your project definition document,

12
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:41,072
your project plans, and your project control activities.

13
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,982
Next, project impacts.

14
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:48,072
Communicate a common vision of the project outcomes.

15
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:51,765
Help stakeholders prepare for the changes that will

16
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,072
affect them and their organizations.

17
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:59,072
And lastly, work products - the actual deliverables of your project.

18
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:05,072
Keep your stakeholders aware at all times on the deliverables, issues, etc.

19
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:09,072
And with good project control, you can certainly do that.

20
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:13,072
Lastly, how well would you be rated by your customer?

21
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:17,209
And lastly, I'll call your attention to the little chart on the left,

22
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:20,072
how well would you be rated by your customer?

23
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:23,447
Excellent, very good, good, average, poor?

24
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:29,072
You might consider asking them how well are you doing?

25
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:29,425
Face-to-face,

26
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:34,014
have meetings with your stakeholders that aren't just about the project per say,

27
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:37,739
but about your performance as a PM.

28
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:41,072
Seek their mentoring and guidance.

29
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:47,072
That builds more trust and that builds better relationships.

30
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,915
Managing customer expectations is challenging,

31
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:55,406
so here's a list of handy tips to use not just in the beginning of a project,

32
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,184
but throughout its lifecycle.

33
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,072
Acquire buy-in.

34
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:03,501
Invest time and energy to gain their trust and to make sure you

35
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,644
have genuine buy-in from the stakeholders.

36
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:07,072
Take care of business.

37
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:10,806
Yep, get the work done, set your baselines,

38
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:14,072
manage them, and communicate any variances promptly.

39
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:15,672
Communicate the vision.

40
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:19,939
Clearly sell the project's vision and expected outcomes

41
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,072
throughout the project lifecycle.

42
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:23,628
Be a good listener.

43
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:29,072
Look for cues and signals from the stakeholders that may imply things are amiss.

44
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:33,358
Then make it a priority to deal with them promptly.

45
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:35,072
Seek the customer's viewpoint.

46
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:40,072
This ties deeply into customer service and managing customer expectations.

47
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:44,072
Put yourself in their shoes to better understand their situation.

48
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:49,125
This can empower you to better manage and adapt your plans and

49
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,072
specifications to better meet the project's requirements.

50
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,149
Never, ever assume.

51
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:58,303
Constantly confirm understanding by asking questions,

52
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,982
repeating what was said, taking good notes,

53
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,527
and delivering quality communications.

54
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,072
Keep focused on priorities.

55
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:11,303
Now not every stakeholder is created equally.

56
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:14,072
Yes, address the collective stakeholder requirements,

57
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:24,000
but some stakeholders may have greater influence or political power. And be sure to also attend to them appropriately.
