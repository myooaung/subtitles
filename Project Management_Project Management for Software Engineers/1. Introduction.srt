Hello, I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:08,235
I will be presenting module 1, Course Overview,

3
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:13,333
in the course Project Management for Software Engineers.

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:20,000
Now let's cover what I'll be presenting in this course.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,111
Spoil alert!

6
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:23,889
Proceed at your own peril.

7
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:28,333
Project management is hard and very challenging work,

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:33,769
but can be very rewarding professionally and monetarily as well.

9
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you up for the job?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,200
Are you ready to embark on changing the way you think and

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,700
approach your career as you may consider evolving from a

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,800
software engineer to a project manager,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,000
or even developing in to a leader of your organization or company?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well if so,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
then this course will help you quickly master the basic skills of project management for the software engineer.
