00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.110
So what is a project plan?

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.294
It is the entire set of documents that'll be used

3
00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:12.886
for project execution and control.

4
00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:17.172
Now typically, it's going to be the list of tasks you have to go do,

5
00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:21.431
and an estimate, and a schedule, but it'll be a lot more than that,

6
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:25.886
and we're going to cover all the aspects of what a project plan is,

7
00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:30.386
and also the project the plan is not just the requirements

8
00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:34.068
or just a Microsoft project document, it is much,

9
00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:34.886
much more.

10
00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:41.886
Okay, now let's go build a plan.

11
00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:46.659
In this section, I'll be showing you how to build your plan step by step,

12
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:55.886
and first we'll be covering what I call the core elements.

13
00:00:55.886 --> 00:00:59.886
So here are the basic steps in building your plan,

14
00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:05.886
and I've divided into two areas, the first are what I call the core elements.

15
00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:11.271
Second are the implementation elements, and within the core elements,

16
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.886
we have three.

17
00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:20.254
We validate our PDD, we build a WBS, or Work Breakdown Structure of tasks,

18
00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:23.261
and we itemize the acceptance criteria,

19
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:28.886
and I'm going to go into each of these in detail in the following slides.

20
00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:31.833
The second part are the implementation elements,

21
00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:35.623
this is where we apply resources to our WBS,

22
00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:38.486
and we develop estimates for those tasks,

23
00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:40.486
and we develop a schedule,

24
00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:45.732
so this is the core element and what I call the implementation

25
00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:52.501
element of your basic plan for your project.

26
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.886
Okay, let's get started.

27
00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.750
Step one is to validate the project definition document.

28
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.239
So what you want to do basically is get a team in a room,

29
00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.709
you know, all the subject matter experts,

30
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.827
and maybe even some stakeholders, whoever,

31
00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:11.457
and start going through your plan, start looking at it in detail.

32
00:02:11.457 --> 00:02:14.886
So basically what you want to do is you want to validate

33
00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:17.219
the contents that are in your document,

34
00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.314
every one of those sections and subsections that we talked about before,

35
00:02:21.314 --> 00:02:26.886
we want to make sure it's still valid and relevant for the project,

36
00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:31.553
and as you go through each one, you might find that oh,

37
00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:34.553
we missed something, we need to update the plan,

38
00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:36.886
and believe me this usually does happen.

39
00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:40.553
You also may need to revisit the requirements with the stakeholders,

40
00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:43.286
have the requirements changed, is the scope bigger,

41
00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:44.686
is the scope smaller,

42
00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:48.886
has business changed in such a way that would affect the requirements?

43
00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:52.431
Also, how long has the PDD been done, maybe it's been a month,

44
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:57.046
what if it's been three months and you kind of have to blow the dust off of it?

45
00:02:57.046 --> 00:03:00.646
So if you've had a time lag then you may need to spend even a

46
00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:03.743
little more time going through and revisiting the different

47
00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:05.886
portions and sections of the document.

48
00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.664
Okay, so the document looks great, we've made some changes,

49
00:03:08.664 --> 00:03:11.194
we've updated it, maybe we have a new stakeholder,

50
00:03:11.194 --> 00:03:13.347
maybe some of the requirements have changed,

51
00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:14.886
maybe we've modified the budget.

52
00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:18.386
So basically it's been validated and revised,

53
00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:21.886
looks good, okay, good, step one, check,

54
00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:25.219
we're done, and now we can move to step two.

55
00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:30.356
The last thing you want to do is start a project in which the PDD is incorrect,

56
00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:33.180
or weak, or not relevant anymore,

57
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.000
your project would have a more likely chance of failing. Okay, let's move on to step two.
