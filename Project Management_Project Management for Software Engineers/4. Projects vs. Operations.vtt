00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.154
Projects versus operations.

2
00:00:03.154 --> 00:00:06.616
I'll list some attributes about projects on the left,

3
00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:09.309
and attributes about operations on the right.

4
00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.309
But first, let me ask this question: what does management really care about?

5
00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.309
I will suggest to you, it's mostly about projects,

6
00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:22.309
not operations that management tends to really care about.

7
00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:24.662
Okay, let's get started.

8
00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:28.779
Projects tend to propel a company forward,

9
00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.309
new ideas, new features, new products.

10
00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.617
That's why management has the focus on those,

11
00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:39.309
because they're leading the company.

12
00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.934
May drive new revenues, new services, new cost containment,

13
00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:49.309
and maybe even drive improved customer service.

14
00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.309
These are all very critical things that management

15
00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.309
and executives tend to focus on.

16
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.427
On the other side are operations.

17
00:00:58.427 --> 00:00:59.838
And as I mentioned,

18
00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:04.642
these are activities involved in the day-to-day functions of the business,

19
00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:09.309
conducted for the purpose of running the business.

20
00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:12.945
You might think of it as keeping the lights on,

21
00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:17.309
or maybe even like a utility, who cares if all is well?

22
00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:21.434
Think about yourself for a moment, are you on any projects?

23
00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:23.309
Or are you strictly operations?

24
00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:25.161
Maybe you are not sure.

25
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:29.605
If you are not sure if you are on projects or not,

26
00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:33.309
don't fret, it may have nothing to do with you.

27
00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:37.414
It may be that you have a management or leadership issue in your

28
00:01:37.414 --> 00:01:40.009
company from the standpoint of effective communication,

29
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.309
or possibly a weak project management structure or process.

30
00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:48.759
I think there should be a very,

31
00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.909
very clear delineation of project work from operations work,

32
00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.309
so you can in fact focus on the right work.

33
00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:01.309
This will enable the attention required to get stuff done.

34
00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:09.309
So let me share with you this great quote on the next slide.

35
00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:17.074
Okay, so to bring this point home, here is a good quote.

36
00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:20.309
Operations keeps the lights one,

37
00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:25.309
strategy provides a light at the end of the tunnel,

38
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:31.309
but project management is the train engine that moves the organization forward.

39
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.031
So if you are looking for excitement,

40
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:38.309
being in the spotlight of driving a company or organization forward,

41
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:47.309
then project management is where you want to be.

42
00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.737
When is an activity a project?

43
00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:59.309
So when should an activity, the things you do every day, be called a project?

44
00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.603
Each company or organization will have different thresholds,

45
00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:07.036
criteria, as to what is a project versus an activity,

46
00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:09.945
say an operations activity.

47
00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:14.309
So here are some threshold examples.

48
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.386
If a major activity has, say, a lot of dollars,

49
00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:22.309
or a lot of hours, a lot of time, it may be considered then a project.

50
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:26.809
Rather than just a few hours, maybe to fix a screen,

51
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:31.309
or add a column to a database table, things like that,

52
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:32.976
adding mobile to a web app,

53
00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:35.753
that might be a significant amount of dollars and time,

54
00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:36.309
and therefore,

55
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:44.309
a company may call that a project because it exceeds an agreed upon threshold.

56
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.993
Another threshold may be criticality or focus to the business.

57
00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:51.309
It may not be so much a size issue,

58
00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.309
but so critically important that management wants to keep

59
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.309
a really keen focus on that activity, and therefore,

60
00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:01.400
that activity becomes a project.

61
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.309
There's also the project request process.

62
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:14.309
This process is a way in which project ideas and proposals can be put forward.

63
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:16.309
Also, a project review process.

64
00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.909
This is usually a key manager, a review board,

65
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:24.746
or a team, that will review each project request,

66
00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:30.434
then, determine its viability, approve or disapprove,

67
00:04:30.434 --> 00:04:35.309
and if approve, begin the project.

68
00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:39.159
So this review process is basically vetting,

69
00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:46.309
and then approving or disapproving a particular project that may be a candidate.

70
00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.242
For context,

71
00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:50.509
this course focuses on the project management

72
00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.309
process after the project is approved.

73
00:04:53.309 --> 00:05:00.191
In summary, a project is a significant level of effort involving a team,

74
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.309
and consuming significant resources that management

75
00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:07.309
typically approves on a case by case basis.

76
00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.809
And,

77
00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:12.309
each company organization will have different thresholds as to

78
00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:25.000
an activity is deemed to be a project or not. Now let's focus on you, the project manager, in the next few slides.
