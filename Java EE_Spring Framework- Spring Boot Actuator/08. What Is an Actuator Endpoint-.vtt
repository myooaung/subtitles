Alright, now that we've seen the demo, let's get into actuator endpoints.

2
00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:08.571
Actuator endpoints are at the heart of Spring Boot Actuator.

3
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.438
They would allow us to monitor and interact with our application.

4
00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:13.646
So as we previously discussed,

5
00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:18.338
there is a number of included endpoints that come with Spring Boot Actuator,

6
00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:23.348
by default, and those actuators provide a lot of useful features.

7
00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:24.624
Rather than me listing them out here,

8
00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:27.755
let's take a look at the documentation and I can show you where to

9
00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:31.260
find a list of the ones that included by default.

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.788
That way,

11
00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:34.679
if any new endpoints come out between the time of this

12
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:39.000
recording and the time that you're watching this, you'll know about those too.
