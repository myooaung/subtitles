00:00:01.157 --> 00:00:06.816
Go ahead and fire up your browser and search for Spring Boot documentation.

2
00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.933
Find the result that says Spring Boot Reference Documentation,

3
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:13.490
click that, and it'll load the docs.

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.055
Locate the left panel in the documentation and look for Spring

5
00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.812
Boot Actuator production-ready features.

6
00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:25.607
Click that and it'll expand out into all of the actuator endpoint features.

7
00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:30.039
Then choose 5.2 or the one that says Endpoints.

8
00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.476
This will bring up all of the Spring Boot Actuator

9
00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:35.295
endpoints that are included by default.

10
00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:37.924
Take a minute and scroll down and read through each

11
00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:39.801
one of these actuator endpoints.

12
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:50.000
I'll think you'll be surprised to find that there's a lot of functionality there and it actually covers a wide array of different features.
