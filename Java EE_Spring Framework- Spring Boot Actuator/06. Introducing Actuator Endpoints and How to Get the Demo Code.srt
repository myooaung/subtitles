00:00:01,353 --> 00:00:02,017
In this section,

2
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:05,994
we'll briefly cover what an actuator endpoint is and then go into a bit

3
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:08,238
more detail about several of the built-in actuators,

4
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:12,014
as well as see them in action with some short demos.

5
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:14,132
Since we'll be doing a number of different demos with

6
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,851
actuator endpoints in this section,

7
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:18,979
now is a good time to introduce you to the demo.

8
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:24,556
The demo is located on my GitHub page at github.comdustinschultz /todo-

9
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:29,210
app.git and you've got two different choices here.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,446
You can choose to fork and clone the repo or you can just clone it,

11
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:35,654
it's up to you.

12
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:43,000
You've already seen a sneak peak of the demo at the beginning of the course, but let's take a closer look at the app and what it does.
