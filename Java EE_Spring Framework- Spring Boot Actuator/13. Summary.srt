00:00:00,994 --> 00:00:03,711
We've reached the end of this module and the end of this course,

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:05,473
let's quickly recap what we learned.

3
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:10,848
We learned how to enable, disable, expose, and secure actuator endpoints.

4
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:13,377
We also learned that enabling an endpoint and exposing

5
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:15,559
an endpoint are two different things.

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,253
Enabling an endpoint controls whether it's created and exposing an

7
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,320
endpoint controls whether or not it can be consumed.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,185
We also saw that we can easily secure our actuator endpoints by including the

9
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:30,096
Spring security library with some optional configuration.

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,999
Then we covered how to modify or customize some of the built-in endpoints.

11
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:36,238
We learned how to add our own custom health checks,

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,358
add custom data to the info endpoint, and lastly,

13
00:00:39,358 --> 00:00:41,809
how to add our own custom metrics.

14
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:45,248
We finished out the module with a section on writing our

15
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:49,328
very own custom actuator endpoints using the @endpoint

16
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:53,311
annotation along with the @Read, @Write,

17
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:57,978
and @DeleteOperation annotations to control whether we

18
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:00,807
returned information or performed some action.

19
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,126
It's been a pleasure teaching you about Spring Boot Actuator,

20
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:06,339
and I hope you learned a lot and were able to take away some

21
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:09,497
useful information that you can either apply to your work

22
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:15,000
projects or your personal projects. Thank you, and good luck.
