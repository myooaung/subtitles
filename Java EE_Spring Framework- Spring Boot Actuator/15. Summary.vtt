00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:04.425
We've come to the end of this module, so let's do a quick recap.

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:04.646
First,

3
00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:09.294
we learned about what Spring Boot Actuator is and a little bit behind its name.

4
00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:12.827
We also learned that actuators are components that are

5
00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:15.343
responsible for controlling a system.

6
00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:18.577
They receive a signal and they generate some output.

7
00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:18.839
Next,

8
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.901
we actually got started with Spring Boot Actuator

9
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:22.857
and how to add it to our projects.

10
00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:27.298
We saw how to do it with Maven, with Gradle, and with Spring Initializr.

11
00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:31.260
Then we really started diving in and learning what actuator endpoints are

12
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.416
and what Spring Boot Actuator provides out of the box.

13
00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:38.111
We saw that it provides things like health checks and metrics

14
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:40.997
and information about a running environment.

15
00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:45.404
We also saw that we can send it signals and instruct it to modify the system,

16
00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:48.330
for instance, to change the log level.

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.345
We finished out the module with a deep dive on some of the more

18
00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.233
important or more commonly-used endpoints.

19
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.463
Specifically, we looked at two different endpoints,

20
00:00:56.463 --> 00:00:59.450
the health endpoint and the metrics endpoint.

21
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.740
We saw how the health endpoint is a lot more than what it looks

22
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.789
like on the surface and can actually be used to generate a

23
00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.686
pretty comprehensive health check.

24
00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:10.398
We also saw that the metrics endpoint supports a

25
00:01:10.398 --> 00:01:14.638
wide array of monitoring systems, provides useful metrics by default,

26
00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:18.137
and allows us to do easy customizations.

27
00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:21.703
In the next module, we'll cover the important topic of security,

28
00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:31.000
how to actually create those custom health checks and custom metrics, along with how to develop completely custom actuator endpoints.
