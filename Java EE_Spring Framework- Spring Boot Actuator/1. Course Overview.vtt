Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02.337 --> 00:00:11.534
My name is Dustin Schultz, and welcome to my course on Spring Boot Actuator.

3
00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:13.520
I'm a software engineer at heart and have been

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.483
developing with Spring for almost 15 years.

5
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:21.712
I use it on a daily basis to build applications, APIs, and microservices.

6
00:00:21.712 --> 00:00:24.476
Spring Boot Actuator is a module in Spring Boot that

7
00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:27.043
provides built-in features to help you run,

8
00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:31.189
monitor, and manage your Spring Boot applications in production.

9
00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.700
In this course,

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.220
we'll cover the most important parts of Spring Boot

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.997
Actuator so you can get up to speed quickly.

12
00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:41.238
Some of the major topics we'll cover include what is Spring Boot Actuator,

13
00:00:41.238 --> 00:00:43.179
what is an actuator endpoint,

14
00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.525
what product ready endpoints are built in by default,

15
00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:50.173
and what do they provide, what endpoints can be customized,

16
00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:53.574
and how are custom actuator endpoints created.

17
00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:54.642
By the end of this course,

18
00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:57.314
you'll have an expert understanding of Spring Boot Actuator and

19
00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:59.625
how you can apply it to your own projects.

20
00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.233
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn Spring Boot Actuator with

21
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:12.000
the Spring Frameworks: Spring Boot Actuator course, at Pluralsight.
