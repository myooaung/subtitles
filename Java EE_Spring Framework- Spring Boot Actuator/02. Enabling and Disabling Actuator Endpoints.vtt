00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:04.633
Let's cover how to enable or disable endpoints and learn what

2
00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:07.910
endpoints are and aren't enabled by default.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.506
Each endpoint can be individually controlled to be enabled or disabled.

4
00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:15.534
Enabling or disabling an endpoint controls whether or not

5
00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:18.358
it's created and registered by Spring Boot and not whether

6
00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:20.141
or not it can be accessed.

7
00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:21.460
As we'll learn shortly,

8
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.436
enabling an endpoint is only one of the steps needed to be able to access it.

9
00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:29.580
It's important to note that by default all actuator endpoints are enabled

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.472
and the only exception to this is the shutdown endpoint,

11
00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:36.629
which for security reasons, must be explicitly enabled.

12
00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.799
Within the application.properties or the application.yml,

13
00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.882
you can control whether or not an endpoint is enabled or

14
00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:45.370
disabled by a configuration property.

15
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.177
The property follows this standard scheme,

16
00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:52.438
management.endpoint .name, we'll talk about what this name means very shortly,

17
00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:56.304
followed by another dot and then enabled and set to true or false

18
00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:59.767
to enable or disable the endpoint respectively.

19
00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:02.966
The name part of the configuration property is the name of the endpoint,

20
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.735
or more formally,

21
00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:07.068
it's ID and you can find the IDs of each standard

22
00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:09.049
built-in endpoints in the Spring docs.

23
00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.383
I've included a link to the specific part of the documentation where you

24
00:01:13.383 --> 00:01:15.793
can find these IDs and we've actually already seen this part of the

25
00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:17.922
documentation several times throughout the course,

26
00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:19.677
so I'll go ahead and pull it up quickly,

27
00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:22.315
but we're not going to go into any detail.

28
00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.585
I've loaded up the documentation, and as you can see,

29
00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:28.598
there is a list of all of the actuator endpoints included in Spring Boot

30
00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:33.159
Actuator and the first column is labeled ID and this is the ID that you

31
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.859
would use within the configuration property.

32
00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.757
Previously I'd mentioned that all endpoints,

33
00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:41.225
except shutdown are enabled by default and this default behavior

34
00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:45.707
can be changed to disabling all endpoints by default and

35
00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:48.534
individually enabling specific endpoints.

36
00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:50.592
Since there is over 10 different built-in endpoints,

37
00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:54.186
this is helpful when you want to enable only a few endpoints.

38
00:01:54.186 --> 00:02:02.000
Rather than list out every endpoint that must be disabled, you can tell Spring Boot Actuator just the ones that you want enabled.
