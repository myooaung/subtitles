00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.767
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.684
My name is Dustin Schultz,

3
00:00:02.684 --> 00:00:07.052
and welcome to the next module on my course on Spring Boot Actuator.

4
00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:07.699
In this module,

5
00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:13.081
we'll cover a wide array of topics centered around security and customizations.

6
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.802
We'll start off with understanding how to enable, disable, and expose endpoints.

7
00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:19.866
Then we'll cover a short section on the difference

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.839
between enabling and exposing endpoints.

9
00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.691
It's a very common mistake to confuse the two when first

10
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.540
learning about Spring Boot Actuator.

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.820
Once we got that out of the way, we'll dive into securing your endpoints.

12
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.070
This is very important section since many of the actuator

13
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.602
endpoints contain sensitive information.

14
00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:39.962
After that, we'll learn how to customize some of the built-in endpoints.

15
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:40.758
So for example,

16
00:00:40.758 --> 00:00:44.534
we'll add our own custom health check to the health endpoint and

17
00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:51.000
we'll finish out the module with a section on implementing our own custom actuators from scratch.
