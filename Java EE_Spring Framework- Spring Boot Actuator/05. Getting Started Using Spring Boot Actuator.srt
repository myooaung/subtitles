00:00:01,312 --> 00:00:04,508
It's really, really easy to get started using Spring Boot Actuator.

2
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:08,596
Literally, all you need to do is add it to your project as a dependency,

3
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:12,252
and just by doing that without any configuration on your part,

4
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:14,559
you'll get a lot of the built-in features.

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,319
You can, of course,

6
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:18,043
take it further and provide additional configuration and

7
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:21,337
customizations which we'll explore throughout the course,

8
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:24,499
but seriously, if you learn anything from this course,

9
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:27,832
just adding Spring Boot Actuator as a dependency to your

10
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:30,769
project provides you with a ton of benefits.

11
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,422
We'll briefly cover the three most common methods for adding

12
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:36,688
Spring Boot Actuator to your project using Maven,

13
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:39,465
using Gradle, and using Spring Initializer,

14
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:42,225
or start.spring .io.

15
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:42,994
If you're using Maven,

16
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:47,717
all you need to do is add a dependency on Spring Boot Starter

17
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:52,295
Actuator in your pom.xml in the Dependency section.

18
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:53,279
If you're using Gradle,

19
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:56,818
you add a compile dependency on Spring Boot Starter

20
00:00:56,818 --> 00:00:59,511
Actuator in the dependencies block.

21
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:01,544
Alternatively, if you're starting a new project,

22
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:07,426
Spring Initializr makes it really easy to add Spring Boot Actuator to a project.

23
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:11,282
Open up a browser and visit start.spring .io.

24
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:16,156
Then you simply scroll down to the Dependency section and start typing actuator.

25
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:18,609
It should pop-up on a list of dependencies,

26
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:24,000
you can choose it by clicking it or hit Enter, and it's now part of your project.
