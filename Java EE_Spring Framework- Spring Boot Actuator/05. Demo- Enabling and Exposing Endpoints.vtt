00:00:01.427 --> 00:00:03.734
Let's apply some of the concepts we learned to enable,

2
00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:08.991
disable, and expose one or more endpoints in our demo app.

3
00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:11.743
In this demo, we'll practice what we learned about enabling,

4
00:00:11.743 --> 00:00:14.149
disabling, and exposing endpoints.

5
00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:15.907
Go ahead and navigate to the src, main,

6
00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:19.381
resources and open up the application.properties.

7
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.292
The property which controls which endpoints are exposed is

8
00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:25.644
currently set to an asterisk from our previous demo.

9
00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:26.237
Now remember,

10
00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:30.232
this means that we're exposing all endpoints and also remember

11
00:00:30.232 --> 00:00:33.591
that this isn't a recommended practice and we only did this to

12
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.172
make things easier in our demo.

13
00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:38.274
Let's go ahead and tidy things up a bit and only

14
00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:39.957
expose a small set of endpoints.

15
00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:43.317
Go ahead and delete the asterisks and change the value to a

16
00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:47.014
comma-separated list of IDs that we want to expose.

17
00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:56.009
So we'll change that to beans, metrics, info, health, loggers.

18
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:57.944
Now even though we've exposed the loggers endpoint,

19
00:00:57.944 --> 00:01:02.153
let's go ahead and disable it for demonstration purposes to see that the

20
00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:06.304
endpoint must be both enabled and exposed to be consumable.

21
00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:11.862
Return to a new line and set the property management.endpoint and

22
00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:14.822
make sure this is singular and doesn't contain an S,

23
00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:21.023
it's not endpoints, .loggers .enabled and then equals false.

24
00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:22.809
Alright, that's all the configuration we've got.

25
00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:25.400
Let's start up the application and check things out.

26
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.350
Go ahead and navigate to the main application class,

27
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.492
right-click on it, and go to Run.

28
00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:32.632
Once the application is started,

29
00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:39.793
fire up a browser and visit localhost:8080/actuator/beans.

30
00:01:39.793 --> 00:01:40.050
Great.

31
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.915
We've got a response with all the information about the beans

32
00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:45.580
that are running in the application context.

33
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.335
Now remember, all endpoints, except shutdown, are enabled by default.

34
00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:55.545
So by exposing the already enabled endpoint, we met the criteria to consume it.

35
00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:58.467
That is, it was enabled and exposed.

36
00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.856
Let's try another one of the built-in endpoints that's enabled by default,

37
00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:05.536
but was not in our list of exposed endpoints.

38
00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:11.132
In the address bar, change the beans to configprops and hit Enter.

39
00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:11.716
As expected,

40
00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:16.785
we get back a 404 not found response since even though the endpoint was enabled,

41
00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:18.677
it wasn't exposed.

42
00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:20.726
Lastly, let's try the loggers endpoint.

43
00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:25.261
Remember that we exposed the loggers endpoint, but we explicitly disabled it.

44
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:37.000
In the address bar, change configprops to loggers and hit Enter. As expected, we also get a 404 since the endpoint was exposed, but not enabled.
