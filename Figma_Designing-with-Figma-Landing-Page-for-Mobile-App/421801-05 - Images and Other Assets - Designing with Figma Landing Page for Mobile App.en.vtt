00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.945
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:10.170
In this lesson, we're going to get familiar with

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.850
the images and the icons we'll be using for this design.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.030
It's always a good idea to prepare these before you start the actual design process,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.805
because it's just going to make things easier for you.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.940
Of course, you might change them later,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.795
but at least you have a starting point.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:35.330
So I'm going to show you what images and icons we'll be using.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.910
Also I'm going to share a couple of resources you can

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.770
use to facilitate this whole process. Let's begin.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.560
All right, for the images, as I showed you,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.940
we have the logos, the brand logos.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.705
You can find a link in the resources PDF file to this exact logo,

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:06.615
and you can download it.

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:10.184
Now, for the placeholder images,

00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:15.585
I got these images from a UI Kit,

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:18.195
a Finance UI Kit.

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:22.295
Let me just make this a little bit smaller so you can see them better.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:26.900
Because we're working with a dummy project,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.610
we don't have screenshots or images from the actual product.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.450
So we're just going to use these demo images,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.530
and actually let me just show you where you can get that.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.145
This is called a Free Finance UI Kit.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.555
You can find it on Behance,

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:49.250
and this is where it can also download it.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.295
Now, I believe this was a sketch, yeah.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:55.440
So it's a sketch file.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.280
Just in case you don't have sketch installed,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.520
I went ahead and exported these JPEG images for you,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.535
so you can use them right away in your design.

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:11.705
Now on top of these, we also have these device renders.

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:14.065
This is for an iPad Pro,

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:17.680
and this is for an iPhone 7,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.680
and we'll also be using these in our designs.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.610
These are PNG files and I exported them

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.440
from the Photoshop files that can be downloaded from here.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.820
These are also linked in the PDF file by the way.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.685
These are free resources from Pixeden.

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:40.180
This is a Psd iPhone 7 Pro Mockup,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.310
and this is an iPhone 7 Mockup.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.830
These are all vectors, they're in Photoshop,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.460
and they have this smart object as the screen.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.730
You can just double-click that and put

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.740
whatever screenshot or image you want, just like I did.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.810
Notice, I have one of these other images

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.375
inside the phone screen and the same goes for this iPad.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:17.990
So these are the placeholder images that we're going to be using.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.880
Now, if you're just looking for some placeholder images,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.330
one resource that I use all the time is Unsplash.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.954
You just search for a photo,

00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:32.655
like for example iPhone.

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:37.100
That gives you a list of images matching that search criteria.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.915
These are free images you can use them anywhere, great resource.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:47.815
Now, when it comes to icons,

00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:52.985
there are so many websites out there,

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:59.135
that allow you to download loads and loads of sets of icons.

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:03.425
One option that I go to all the time is Iconfinder.

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:09.830
You can find premium free icon sets and you can download individual icons as well.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.245
Here you simply search for home,

00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:19.175
and you can search by style.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.100
You can find free icons only and you

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.185
can click on any one of these and download it as a PNG,

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:27.970
SVG or other formats,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.265
it depends on the icon set.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:34.775
So you can get icon sets from here.

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:39.185
But for this particular demo,

00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:44.585
we're going to be using some icons from this icon set.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.500
It's called micons.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.920
This is by a fellow Romanian called Cosmic Negoita.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.120
This is a great icons that I use it in a lot of my projects.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.685
Another icon set that we'll be using is called Ionicons.

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:09.060
This is again, I really love this icon set.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.780
I use it all the time,

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.870
I really like it and I can strongly recommend it to you as well.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.120
Now, with any of these sets,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.960
you can simply download them.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.044
It's going to give you an archive,

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:31.190
and you have probably SVG and PNG files.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.320
But what I like to do,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.360
is use an app called Iconset.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.525
This is a free app,

00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:46.065
it's cross-platform and it works on both Mac OS and Windows;

00:05:46.065 --> 00:05:48.790
It looks something like this.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.650
You can create icon sets here,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.345
and import them from your hard drive.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:06:00.455
As you can see, I have the two sets that we're going to be using loaded here.

00:06:00.455 --> 00:06:02.130
You can see all the icons,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.940
you can search for a specific icon,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.860
and once you find it, it's really simple.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.745
Just right-click, you can copy it,

00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:15.000
and then you can go to Figma or

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.435
whatever design software you're using and simply paste that in.

00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:29.880
Or you can click and drag,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.135
that's going to do exactly the same thing.

00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:38.585
So these are the tools that I recommend you get.

00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:43.925
But if you don't want to install anything else on your computer, that's totally fine.

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:47.890
Lets say we want to download this ionicon set.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.845
It's going to download an archive,

00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:53.765
and once you unpack that,

00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:57.260
it just gives you this list of SVG files.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.555
You can just grab the file that you want and drag and drop into Figma,

00:07:03.555 --> 00:07:07.030
and you're good to go.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.450
At this point you should have the images and icons all ready to go.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.125
Because we're working for a fictional product,

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:31.930
we're obviously using some placeholder images.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.020
But remember that on a real project you would

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.455
use images that are relevant to that specific product.

00:07:40.455 --> 00:07:45.370
Feel free to use the images that I provided or download your own.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:55.755
If you think you could find images or icons that work better for your design,

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:57.840
by all means, go ahead and do that.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:05.060
I would love to see different results in the project's gallery.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.530
Now, assuming you have everything set up and that includes color,

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:15.490
typography and imagery, we're ready to move on to the actual page design.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.225
This learning pages are divided in several sections,

00:08:20.225 --> 00:08:27.165
and we'll tackle one section at a time in the remainder of this class.

00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:29.420
We'll begin with the hero section,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.940
and that's coming up in the next lesson. See you there.
