00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.585
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:12.360
In this lesson, we'll design the third and final section for features.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.220
If you remember what I said in the previous lessons about designing features,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.555
it's always a good idea to mix it up.

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:22.530
So to stay true to that,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.720
for this third batch we'll use a different layout,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.145
and we'll also add some illustrations.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:35.740
So if you're ready, let's begin.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.210
Let's take a quick look at the wireframe,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.255
and as you can see,

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:49.745
these are the two sections that we need to create.

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:53.150
So here's how we'll do that.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:01.065
We're going to go back to our main design and we're going to copy this.

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:06.605
Let's actually make this frame a little bit bigger.

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:09.080
We're going to paste these in here.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.945
We're going to bring up the grid and we're going to align this nicely to the grid.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:21.185
I'm going to leave about 240 pixels

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:26.810
of distance between this element and the call to action.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.970
Let's actually see if that's enough,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.830
we'll just quickly glance at it and I think we might need a little bit more than that.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.370
So let's go with like 320, something like that.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.455
So now visually, this looks balanced.

00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:53.090
This call to action looks about halfway between this element and this element.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.070
As I was saying in a previous lesson,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.625
you don't always need to rely on exact measurements.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:02.810
Like for example, between this and this,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.865
I have a 120 pixels.

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:08.510
So normally you would be inclined to say, okay, well,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.355
let's keep these distances equal,

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:15.800
and so I'm going to place this at a 120 pixels.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.940
But when you look at it from a bird's-eye perspective,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.300
you'll see that visually it doesn't look balanced,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.270
and in that case,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.950
you just have to go with what feels best.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.530
In my case, about this much looks okay to me.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.890
For the content of this section,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:48.155
we can grab the text from our wireframes and we'll do the same here.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:53.270
But instead of security being the main title we'll actually switch it up a little bit.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.855
We're going to use security as the subtitle here and as for the main title,

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:04.710
we are going to say your data is secure.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.220
It just makes more sense like this.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.130
Then we're going to grab two subsections.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:24.755
Also, I want to make sure that this element spans on six columns and not five,

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:28.700
just like that, because I want to put two of

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.690
these smaller sections which span on three columns each.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.655
Let's position this at 64 pixels from the element above it.

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.500
Let's get rid of the icon,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.045
we don't need that and for the text, we have what?

00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:52.170
Online banking, let's copy this text here.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.005
Now, here's a quick tip for you.

00:03:57.005 --> 00:04:01.610
If you're going to copy a piece of text from

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.275
figma and you're going to paste it in here like so.

00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:10.435
You'll notice that the style is not preserved.

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:14.450
So the original style of the copy text is used instead.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.905
To get around that you need to go to Edit,

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:23.145
paste and match style, like so.

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:29.390
Cool. So let's duplicate this alignment with the grid and let's

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.990
copy the other piece of text and that is for data encryption.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.565
Let's go ahead again,

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:39.860
edit, paste and match style.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.775
Cool. So we're almost done here.

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:47.610
The last thing we need to do is add an illustration.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.860
So we'll do a classic layout for a feature where we

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.900
have an image on the side and content on the other side.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.030
Now for the illustration,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:06.230
and you can find links to everything that I'm using and that resources, that PDF file.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.740
I'm going to be using an illustration that I

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.700
got from volatile elements, let's it's bringing it up.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.370
I'm going to align the top of the elements,

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.260
so the top of the image,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.515
I'm going to align it with the top of this element,

00:05:23.515 --> 00:05:27.830
and I'm going to position this image so that it goes outside of the grid.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.725
That's totally fine but instead,

00:05:30.725 --> 00:05:36.755
I'm going to align this left edge, with the grid.

00:05:36.755 --> 00:05:45.905
To keep the same spacing that we used in other parts of our design,

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:50.610
I'm going to leave this one column blank.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.460
So that is one section.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.350
Let's command yet to create a group and now we're going to duplicate it.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.680
We're going to move it down.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:14.630
Let's say to 120 pixel distance between the two and we're going to do the exact opposite.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.675
So I'm going to delete this image,

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:20.735
I'm going to move this to the other side.

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:26.635
Again, this is a classic way of displaying features.

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:30.410
You do the image and the content and

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.670
then on the next row you flip the image and the content.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.060
Here we're going to grab the second illustration.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:47.255
Again, I'm going to align it with this column here to leave this column blank,

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:51.660
align it with the top and that's it.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.535
Now the last thing to do is to update the copy on the text.

00:06:58.535 --> 00:07:01.910
So here we have support.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.065
So let's say support there.

00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:07.230
As for the main title,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.750
we're going to say great support for great products.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:23.320
Here, edit, paste and match style and the two subsections are the following;

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:31.380
24/7 online support and we also have a link there at the bottom.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:38.045
So 24/7 online support based on match style.

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:42.875
This one is called free educational classes.

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:50.085
So paste that in like so and it was called free educational classes,

00:07:50.085 --> 00:07:53.255
I forgot. All right.

00:07:53.255 --> 00:08:00.690
Now, the final thing to do here is to quickly create these two links.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.165
So the first one,

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:09.060
and I'm actually going to duplicate that support text there.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.910
But instead of using this red color,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.280
I'm going to use the blue color because this is a link

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.240
and this blue is currently my primary color.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.510
I'm also going to grab this arrow paste it in.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.470
Select these two, shift A to create auto-layout.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.350
Change the orientation to horizontal.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.300
Make sure both of these items are aligned in

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:44.735
the middle and set the distance between them to 8 pixels,

00:08:44.735 --> 00:08:55.260
like so and now we can delete this line of text and update this to say, submit ticket.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.380
One other thing we can do here is we can re-size

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.750
this arrow instead of 24 we'll make it 16 pixels.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:13.120
Just a little smaller because it's attached to this tiny link there.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.810
So now we can copy this.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.790
I can paste it in.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:23.760
We can say, visit channel,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.410
and we can delete this bit.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.230
Finally, let's select everything.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.770
Command G to group or control G if you're on

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:43.605
a Windows machine and we're going to call this features 3.

00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:47.780
Awesome. Now, before we wrap things up,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:53.975
I told you that these illustrations are taken or are downloaded from Envato elements.

00:09:53.975 --> 00:09:56.255
That's a paid service.

00:09:56.255 --> 00:09:58.640
But if you want some free illustrations,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.875
let me quickly show you that right now,

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:05.340
you can go to onDraw.co click Browse

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:12.720
now and here you can find a bunch of SUP illustrations.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.100
There are a lot of them,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.235
you can even search for a specific keyword and what's cool about it,

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:26.140
you can change the accent color on them real easily.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.410
Once you find one that works for you,

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.180
you just click on it and you can download a PNG or

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.310
an SVG it really depends on what you want to do with it.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:48.620
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and this is a vector format,

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.575
which means you can resize

00:10:51.575 --> 00:10:57.080
that image as much as you want and it's not going to lose quality.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.230
A PNG is a raster format,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:05.930
which means if you resize it and you make it bigger than its original size,

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.035
it's going to look pixelated.

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:11.405
So it really depends on your application, but yeah,

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:20.850
onDraw.co/illustrations, great resource for getting free SVG illustrations.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.355
All right, with the final section for features done,

00:11:36.355 --> 00:11:41.140
we're well past the halfway point in designing this learning page.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.355
If you've come this far,

00:11:42.355 --> 00:11:44.590
let me just say, great job.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.420
Now, as per usual,

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:54.485
your task for this lesson is to create this third and final section for features.

00:11:54.485 --> 00:11:57.655
Just like I've been saying so far,

00:11:57.655 --> 00:11:59.200
put your own spin on things.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.919
Don't necessarily do exactly what I do,

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:07.375
although that's totally okay you can learn a lot by doing that.

00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:11.680
But it's also a good idea to do things your own

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.295
way and experiment and see what the results are.

00:12:16.295 --> 00:12:21.200
Now, if you've done that already and you're ready to move on,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.260
then I guess we should get going right.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.270
The next section on our list is the Screenshot Gallery.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.080
That's coming up in the next lesson.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.190
So I'll see you there.
