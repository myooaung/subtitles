00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
Did you ever want to design a web page but didn't know where to start?,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.260
or maybe you did get started,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.970
but you got stuck at some point because you didn't know how to pick the right colors,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.345
typefaces, or how to create a good layout.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.310
Well, this is what you'll learn in this class.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.640
But hey, if we're just meeting,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.615
my name is " ADI PURDILA" and I'm a web designer from Romania.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.900
I'd been working in this field for over ten years now,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.005
and I've also been teaching for a couple of years.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.170
Web design takes up most of my time,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.885
but I do love to just get away from it every now and then and work in a garden,

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:42.825
with my family, or do some woodworking.

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:45.845
What I do like, the keyboard and mouse,

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.280
I'm also a pretty hands-on kind of guy.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.460
Now, together, we're going to design a landing page for a budgeting app.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.010
We will start from a project brief and a Wire frame.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.500
In each lesson I will show you how to tackle a different step of this process.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.950
Will start by defining colors, Typography, and Imagery.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.840
Then we'll design in one section of the page at a time.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.675
So at the finish line will end up with

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:19.190
this landing page complete with sections for features,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.665
gallery, testimonials, and pricing.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.390
For this class we'll be using F-I-G-M-A.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.620
This is free and cross-platform,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.175
so you can use it on Windows and Mac OS.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:34.740
And you can open it directly in your browser.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.665
Now, by taking this class,

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.630
I guarantee two things.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.685
Number one, you'll learn how to work in F-I-G-M-A, and number two,

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:50.405
you will learn an efficient process of designing a web page based on a client request.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:53.420
This class is for complete beginners,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.035
you don't need any prior design experience,

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.990
and I'll walk you through every step of the way.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.910
So let's get started.
