00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.780
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.630
In this lesson, we'll be creating the color scheme for our learning page.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.740
Now this is a crucial step in any design process,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.140
so we need to pay close attention to it.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.770
There are also a couple of tools that I use all the time

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.455
to simplify this part and I'm going to show you those tools as well.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.150
Ready? Let's go.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:44.040
Let's begin by opening our starter kit in Figma and going to the colors tab, colors page.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.175
Right here, you can see that I've created for you four frames.

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:51.410
If you don't know what frames are,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.295
well, this is a frame basically.

00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:58.535
It's a way of organizing content on the Canvas.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:03.785
But we'll talk about frames in just a little bit right now let's focus on the colors.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:07.550
Whenever you're starting a project like this.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.755
I recommend you divide your colors in these four categories,

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:18.110
primary, secondary, tertiary, and grays.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.580
The primary colors will be the ones that you use the most,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.855
and usually you would use them for buttons or links.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:33.320
Secondary colors are usually for certain acts and pieces,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.355
and they should work harmoniously with the primary colors.

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:42.650
Tertiary colors are those that are not very prominent.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.990
You'd use them maybe once in a page or in

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.410
certain situations like contextual coloring for an input state,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.535
error, success, information, things like that.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:04.235
In our case, we'll be using the tertiary colors, mostly for icons.

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:10.065
Then finally, grays are mostly used on text.

00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:13.460
But you can use them on other elements in your page as well.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.830
Like maybe some icons,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.390
dividers, and so on.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:29.950
What I have here is a collection of 10 of these squares in each category,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.825
and each one is lighter by 10 percent than the one before it.

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:42.200
Essentially, we have the main color and nine tints.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.700
If you don't know what a tint is, well it's very simple.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.000
When you mix a color with white,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.170
you get a tint of that color.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.445
When you mix a color with black,

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.920
you get a shade of that color.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.940
A shade is therefore a darker version of a color,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.460
a tint is a lighter version of the color.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.590
I always recommend when defining a color scheme that you create these tints.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.815
You can also create shades if you want,

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:17.770
but I usually just create tints because it gives me options.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.615
When I am choosing a color for our design,

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:22.800
I might look at the main color and say,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.340
okay that's a little bit too intense for me maybe I'm going to use a tint of it.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.435
Maybe somewhere from this area or this area.

00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:40.655
But the idea is, I can see them and I can decide which one works best at that point.

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.890
How do we pick the colors?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.875
Well, usually it all starts with the branding.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:52.460
What colors does the brand you're designing for use?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.145
In our case, under brand assets,

00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:57.940
we can find this colored logo.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.300
This makes it really easy for us because I can define two primary colors from here.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.640
I can define as blue and I can define as purple.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.970
What I'm going to do is I'm going to bring in

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.330
this SVG file into Figma simply by dragging and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.825
dropping and you can see that by selecting any of these components,

00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:26.190
under fill, we will find a linear gradient.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.570
Click that, and that will give us our two colors.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.700
Let's click on this one let's copy it's hex value.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.215
This is one representation of that color and,

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:43.055
let's select this entire frame,

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:50.560
this entire group of elements and where it says selection colors, click and paste.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.255
This is one of the more awesome features of Figma.

00:04:56.255 --> 00:05:03.620
Instead of selecting each element individually and changing its color,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.395
when you're selecting more than one element,

00:05:06.395 --> 00:05:10.525
it activates this section called selection colors.

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.505
You can change colors individually there,

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:18.595
or in my case, because I was using the same color, black before,

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:22.925
my selection just showed me that black color and by changing that,

00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:28.130
it changed the color of every single element in this group.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.170
Don't worry if this seems a bit weird,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:39.340
I'm going to tell you more about this as we're progressing in this class.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.850
Right now you can see that we've defined the first primary color,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.260
which is this blue.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.690
Let's define the second one.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.420
Let's go back to Linear,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.899
let's select this element,

00:05:52.899 --> 00:06:02.030
copy and then we'll select this frame that you can see here.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.890
We can do one of two things,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.330
we can duplicate it by hitting command or

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.810
control D. Command D if you're on a Mac

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.385
or control D if you're on Windows and that's going to duplicate it,

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:18.155
it's going to make a copy of it.

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:26.145
Alternatively, you can select it and go to the Figma menum edit, duplicate.

00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:28.805
It's going to do exactly the same thing.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:33.725
Or you can simply copy and paste just like you would normally.

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:38.305
Let's actually make a bit of room here.

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:42.770
Then I'm going to select this group and I'm going to paste

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.315
then the other color and now I can get rid of this logo.

00:06:48.315 --> 00:06:50.930
Pretty cool and just like that,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.870
we've defined the two primary colors that we'll be using.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.935
Now what about the secondary colors.

00:06:58.935 --> 00:07:00.755
Let's move this up a little bit.

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:02.210
For the secondary colors,

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.895
here's what I usually do.

00:07:03.895 --> 00:07:08.580
I select or I copy the value of my primary color,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.965
and then I go to Adobe Color.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:19.360
This is a tool that I use all the time and Adobe Color is a free tool,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.580
and it gives me the option to create a color scheme based on a color.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:35.665
Under thecreate tab, go ahead and paste in that value and then from the left side,

00:07:35.665 --> 00:07:37.585
apply a Harmony Rule.

00:07:37.585 --> 00:07:46.215
This is analog, this is monochromatic, triad, and complimentary.

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:53.240
Usually, I use complementary color schemes because just like the name says,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.340
the colors in this pellet complement each other, they create harmony.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.350
In this case, the first secondary color that I'll be using is,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.470
this mustard looking color.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.560
I'm going to go ahead and copy that.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.565
I'm going to go back here, select my frame,

00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:17.855
paste them that color and if I don't like the way it looks,

00:08:17.855 --> 00:08:22.250
that's totally fine I don't have to use this exact same color.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:27.335
I can use that as a guide and then just use the slider to

00:08:27.335 --> 00:08:34.410
create my own color and just choose one that I think looks better.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:39.810
In my case, I'm going to use this one FFC700.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.940
Now I also want an additional secondary color,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.570
so I'm going to duplicate this bit and for this color,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.480
I'm going to choose F25C63.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.705
Now let's move on to my tertiary colors.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.235
Let's move this up a little bit.

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:06.305
Let's make some room because we're going to create a lot of tertiary colors.

00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:07.520
To be more exact,

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.545
we are going to create seven of them.

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:15.560
Let's duplicate this 2,3,4,5,6,7

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.595
using the same keyboard shortcut command D because I'm on a Mac and now,

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:28.085
I'm just going to fill these in with the colors that I chose.

00:09:28.085 --> 00:09:32.915
The first one is 00DAA7.

00:09:32.915 --> 00:09:36.780
The next one is 37c2cc.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:43.320
Next is 3a96e8.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:50.695
The fourth one is 64C9FF.

00:09:50.695 --> 00:09:57.550
The fifth one will be 9E76FE.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:03.020
Then number 6 is going to be CC37BD.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:10.360
And then the last one will be FFCA64.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.060
All right. These are the tertiary colors that we're going to be using.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.160
Now, you might ask me,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.545
where did you get all these colors?

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:25.885
Well, it's just a matter of opening up the color picker

00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:31.975
and using the sliders here to determine what color I like.

00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:36.745
And I just went through all of these and I just picked one that

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:42.610
I thought would work best for this project.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:48.670
Alternatively, here's another tool that I use and I think it's very helpful.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.070
It's called Dribbble Color.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.165
And I'm sure you're well aware of Dribbble,

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:58.990
the website where you can find design inspiration.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.010
Well, you can now search for colors, right?

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.850
You can pick from one of these predefined colors,

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.585
or you can simply just enter your own value.

00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:16.075
And it's going to give you a list of results that are using that color.

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:19.300
And when you open one of these Dribbble shots,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:25.210
you can also find the color palette that was used.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:31.449
I usually go here and get inspiration for colors.

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:38.620
Or I go to the Adobe Color website and I just hit explore

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:46.615
and I look at the color palettes from this website or I just pick them by hand.

00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:49.960
Now, the reason that I went for

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:56.695
so many colors is something that I read in the project brief.

00:11:56.695 --> 00:11:59.770
The client, right at the end,

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:06.535
under design considerations, told us that we should make it colorful.

00:12:06.535 --> 00:12:10.450
And also, the main color scheme should be centered

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.850
around the color blue because it conveys confidence and professionalism.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.835
And they also gave us another option here,

00:12:17.835 --> 00:12:20.310
grass green for freshness and novelty.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:27.520
But the main idea is to center the color scheme around blue and also make it colorful.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:35.620
That's the reason we went for so many tertiary colors because we want options.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:42.355
Finally, the last step we need to tackle here is to define the grays.

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:47.350
And these will mostly be used for text.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:54.670
And this is where having multiple tints of the main gray color is

00:12:54.670 --> 00:13:01.720
very useful because you might use this bit for the main headings.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.255
And you might use this bit which is 70 percent,

00:13:07.255 --> 00:13:11.245
or this which is 80 percent for the main text.

00:13:11.245 --> 00:13:14.470
Now, when choosing a gray color,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.065
here's my very simple process.

00:13:17.065 --> 00:13:22.855
I just create this shape here,

00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:27.070
and I choose my main brand color.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:35.155
I paste that in, and then I duplicate this shape and I fill it with black.

00:13:35.155 --> 00:13:41.290
And then I just lower the opacity on that black color to let's say 90 percent.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.375
And I'm not sure if you see it,

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:46.105
but now it's not totally black.

00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:49.795
Some of that blue color from underneath comes through.

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:55.030
Now what I do is I just create another shape.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:14:00.295
And I use the color picker to sample that color.

00:14:00.295 --> 00:14:03.745
And that gives me my main gray.

00:14:03.745 --> 00:14:05.845
And if I don't like the way it looks,

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.215
I can go back,

00:14:08.215 --> 00:14:11.795
change the opacity of the black.

00:14:11.795 --> 00:14:15.615
And that's a bit too much, maybe 88 percent,

00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:19.965
or maybe I wanted to be a little bit darker, maybe 95 percent.

00:14:19.965 --> 00:14:25.335
And then I can go ahead and I can sample that again and choose my gray color.

00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:29.520
Now, I usually spend a little bit of time on this process until I

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.255
get the exact color that I want.

00:14:34.255 --> 00:14:38.110
In my case, it would be somewhere around,

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.955
I guess this area.

00:14:39.955 --> 00:14:46.970
The final gray color that we're going to use is 030F1A.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:53.980
Now we can delete this and we can paste in our color right here.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:02.350
And that just gave us the main gray and the nine tints that we can now use in our design.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.700
Alternatively, if you're looking to create tints and shades,

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.440
the easy way, let me show you a very nice tool to do that.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.770
It's called Tint and Shade Generator.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.955
We can find it at maketintsandshades.com.

00:15:18.955 --> 00:15:21.190
And what you do basically,

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.665
let's give this as an example,

00:15:23.665 --> 00:15:25.660
you select your main color,

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.650
you paste that in and you hit make tints and shades.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:35.965
And this gives you the shades on the top and the tints at the bottom,

00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:40.240
along with the hex code for each value.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.650
And at any point you can hover on one of them.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.060
Copy.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:51.325
And that value is now copied to your clipboard and you can use it wherever you want.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:55.390
Or if you have a setup like this,

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:04.915
you just set a different opacity on each layer and you'll get relatively the same result.

00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:09.710
And with that, the color scheme is complete.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.755
All right. Now it's your turn to get busy.

00:16:35.755 --> 00:16:38.800
If you've followed along and worked alongside me,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.205
then your color scheme is complete.

00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:46.390
Great. If not, go ahead and do that right now.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.740
Use the templates I gave you in Figma and also the

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.185
tools that I showed you to create your own color scheme.

00:16:56.185 --> 00:17:00.520
You don't have to use the exact same values that I did.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.244
Go ahead and experiment.

00:17:02.244 --> 00:17:05.125
That's the best way to learn.

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:10.345
Use whatever colors you feel look best.

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:13.045
Now, once you do that,

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:15.895
you're ready to move on to the next lesson,

00:17:15.895 --> 00:17:18.325
which is about typography.

00:17:18.325 --> 00:17:23.155
This is yet another crucial step in the design process.

00:17:23.155 --> 00:17:25.975
And we're going to tackle that in the next lesson.

00:17:25.975 --> 00:17:28.010
I'll see you there.
