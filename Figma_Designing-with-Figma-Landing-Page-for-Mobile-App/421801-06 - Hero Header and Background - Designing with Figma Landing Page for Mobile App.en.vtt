00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.500
Welcome back to the class. In this lesson,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.530
we're starting the actual page design.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.590
So far we've been preparing,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.205
getting everything ready including colors, typography imagery.

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:21.345
Now we're ready to lay down the first pixels.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:24.270
Now we'll start with the hero section.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.990
This is quite complex and we'll split it up in two parts.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.090
In this part, we're going to be adding the logo navigation

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.620
and we'll also create a nice-looking background for it.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.070
If you're ready to go, let's begin.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:54.210
Back in figma, we'll switch to the main design page and we'll start by creating a frame.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.050
To do that, we can use the shortcut F for frame and this

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.650
activates this right sidebar where you can choose a predefined frame size.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.990
This comes in various formats ranging from desktop sizes to tablet and phone sizes.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.920
You can see the size in pixels right here on the right side.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.930
It can also choose between some common paper sizes and social media sizes.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.590
Or if you want a custom size,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.174
you can simply click and drag to create the frame to your desired size.

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:42.595
If you want to change the size afterwards,

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:49.675
all you got to do is select the frame either from the canvas or from the layer list

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:57.255
and change the width and height properties on this right-hand side inspector.

00:01:57.255 --> 00:02:03.725
In my case, I'm going to make this 1600 pixels wide and about 2000 pixels high.

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:07.590
Ultimately, it's going to end much bigger and higher than this.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.405
But as a starting point,

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:12.610
this is more than enough.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.070
We can double-click here or we can double-click here to rename this.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.355
I'm going to say Desktop.

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:24.905
Now let's define a column grid.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:34.130
If you're not very familiar with using grids in web design, it's very simple.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.340
A column grid is basically a list of vertical columns that you can use

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.295
to align elements or size elements.

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:52.145
So if you're thinking about a three column layout,

00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:58.815
it's about aligning content to three equal columns in that page.

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:00.405
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:04.130
In figma, it's really easy to add a column grid.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.160
Simply select the frame that you want,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.345
and go in the inspector and choose Layout grid.

00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:15.770
Simply click on it or simply click on the plus sign.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.975
It does exactly the same thing.

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:22.775
From this list where it says layout grid settings,

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:26.810
you can choose between grid which is this,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.765
Columns which is what we need or Rows which is the same thing but horizontal.

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:41.820
So we're going to choose Columns and usually you would go for 12 columns.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:51.055
This is a standard number because 12 is easily divisible by 2,3,4 and 6.

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:54.880
Next you would set a color for this grid.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.355
You can go with any color you want,

00:03:57.355 --> 00:04:01.210
but make it a color that will let you

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.150
know that this is actually a grid and it's not part of the actual design.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.615
It can also change its opacity here.

00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:15.280
Under Type, we would choose Center and then we would define the width of each column,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.800
in my case, I'm going to go with 72.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.620
Under Gutter, we're going to choose 32.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.695
The gutter is basically the distance between these columns.

00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:33.290
Now obviously feel free to use any kind of grid properties you want.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.930
In my case, this is what I'm going to be using.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.895
Now if at some point you want to hide the grid,

00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:46.655
you can click this eye icon here or if you want to remove it completely,

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:51.530
we can click the Minus sign.There is also a keyboard shortcut for it,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.060
its Control G. You can toggle that on and off,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.890
but you can easily find the correct keyboard shortcut if you go

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.435
to the figma menu, View, Layout Grids.

00:05:07.435 --> 00:05:12.240
It can obviously toggle it from here on and off.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.690
So lay-out grid or column grid is now created. Let's move on.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.265
To know what exactly to put in this hero area,let's refer back to our Wireframe.

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:30.785
We can switch to that page.

00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:34.565
By the way, there's a quicker way of doing that.

00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:38.180
You can press Page Up or Page Down on your keyboard

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.170
if you have those keys to swap between pages.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.760
This works in Windows and on Mac OS.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.745
It's the exact same keyboard shortcut.

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:51.649
So if we go to the Wireframe,

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:53.270
we can see that the hero area,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.620
which is this one here has our header which contains the logo and navigation.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.305
Then it has the hero content,

00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:08.885
which is comprised of this media object and title,

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:11.150
subtitle and call to action.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.360
Now this bit we'll tackle in the next lesson.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.270
So let's not worry about that right now.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.505
But in this lesson,

00:06:19.505 --> 00:06:24.020
we're going to add our logo navigation and also will

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.425
create a nice looking background for this hero area.

00:06:29.425 --> 00:06:31.430
So here's how we do that.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.605
Let's start with that background.

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:39.140
Let's go a head and hide this grid because we don't need it right now.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.140
Let's start with a rectangular shape for that press

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.590
"R" or you can choose from this list of tools right

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.610
here and we'll simply

00:06:53.610 --> 00:07:00.830
click on the canvas or we can click and drag and create one of a custom size.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.000
So let's make one that's the same width as our canvas.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.825
Let's push it up and under Fill,

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:14.390
let's choose a linear gradient.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.915
Now to get the correct color values,

00:07:17.915 --> 00:07:22.070
I'm going to refer back to the Color tab.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.910
So I'm going to grab my primary color and place it here.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.355
Let's see which one is it, it's this one.

00:07:29.355 --> 00:07:36.145
Then for the other color I'm going to choose my second primary color which is this.

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:42.165
This actually needs to be 100 percent opacity.

00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:47.600
Now if you're not entirely happy with how the gradient looks like,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:57.530
you can actually use these sliders to move the color stops up and down, left or right.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.005
It really depends on your view here.

00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:02.330
So if you want more of this purple,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.295
you would just move like this.

00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:06.080
If you want more of the blue,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.475
you would move it like this.

00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:13.880
If you want to create like an angle,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.430
you can click on these individual handles and it can

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.810
move them around until you get to where you want.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.370
So in my case, I think I'm just going to do something like this.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.090
That should be plenty strong for now.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.160
Now what I'm going to do is,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.365
I'm going to select this rectangle and I'm going to rotate it.

00:08:40.365 --> 00:08:45.885
To do that, you can enter a new value in the rotation field here.

00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:48.105
Let's go with 16 degrees.

00:08:48.105 --> 00:08:49.635
All right, that's pretty good.

00:08:49.635 --> 00:08:56.925
Now I'm going to resize this so that it fills my page completely, like so.

00:08:56.925 --> 00:08:59.970
I'm also going to round off the corners.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.529
I'm going to add a big border-radius of 64 pixels.

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:07.290
Now, how you get these values,

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.240
it doesn't really matter.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.420
In my case, I'm using the eight-point system.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.900
16, 64, these are all multiples of eight.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.355
It doesn't matter for the vertical rhythm,

00:09:20.355 --> 00:09:23.760
but it just makes it easier for me to remember.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.580
Now you can move this left and right,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.640
up and down until we find a suitable position for it.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:37.390
You can also activate the layout grid and align it to the grid, if you want.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.225
So in my case, I'm just going to leave it about there. Now.

00:09:42.225 --> 00:09:46.755
Something else I'm going to do is add a drop shadow to this.

00:09:46.755 --> 00:09:49.410
For that select it, go to effects,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.240
click, select drop shadow and select this sun icon.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.550
To open the settings.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.700
For the settings, I'm going to select 30 for blur,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.150
zero x 20 for y.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.279
As for the color,

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:08.550
well I'm going to use my main gray color.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.800
Copy it from here.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.100
Paste that in here and for a opacity,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.320
I'm going to choose 20 percent.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.315
Now, here's a pro tip.

00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:21.630
Whenever you're using these effects,

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.050
it can actually create templates for them.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.860
So with the element selected,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.510
where you had the effect,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:39.120
click on this style button and click on the Plus sign and just type in a name.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.790
In my case, I'm going to say drop shadow, create style.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.395
So what this does is,

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.740
if I have another element for example,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.190
and I want to add the exact same drop shadow.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.585
I can select that,

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:59.595
go to effects and select drop shadow.

00:10:59.595 --> 00:11:02.430
Now it has the exact same one.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.455
Now, if I want to change the drop shadow on both of these,

00:11:07.455 --> 00:11:14.970
I can click on the or outside of any element and that's going to select my canvas.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.255
I can find local styles here.

00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:21.195
I can select drop shadow,

00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:25.410
edit style and I can change its properties here.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.590
Maybe I want a different color.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.070
See how it changes on both elements?.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:37.620
That's the power of working with local styles like these.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.750
It makes reusable styles very effective.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.875
Now you can do the same with gradients, for example.

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:48.375
Where it says fill,

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.570
maybe I want to save this gradient for later use.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.690
I can click on the same color or

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:59.310
the same button where it says style and under color styles,

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.360
I'm going to hit plus.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.535
I'm going to type main gradient.

00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:12.465
Now, let's add a little bit of more visual interest to this section.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:16.080
I'm going to select this, Command D, to duplicate it.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.355
I'm going to change its rotation to 12 degrees.

00:12:20.355 --> 00:12:26.970
I'm going to right-click and select send to back.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.605
This is going to put it behind my main layer.

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:35.550
I'm just going to adjust its positioning a little bit.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:42.360
Something like that. Maybe push it down a little bit as well.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.105
I'm going to change its overall capacity to 30 percent.

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:52.815
Now, I want to show you some cool tricks here.

00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:55.185
When you have an element selected,

00:12:55.185 --> 00:13:01.830
you can press any number between one and zero to change its opacity.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.450
So if I press one,

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:11.640
it's setting its opacity of 10 percent to 20 percent,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:19.815
3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and zero changes it to a 100 percent.

00:13:19.815 --> 00:13:23.700
Now if you do these numbers in rapid succession,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.725
for example, three four.

00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:29.385
This changes the capacity to 34.

00:13:29.385 --> 00:13:37.170
Here's another example, 12, 76, 32.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.905
If I do, three and two,

00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:45.420
it changes its opacity to 30 percent and then 20 percent.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.675
So in my case, let's leave this at 30 percent.

00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:50.475
Now, let's do this again.

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:52.395
Let's duplicate.

00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:54.329
This main section.

00:13:54.329 --> 00:13:57.750
Let's change its rotation to 26 degrees.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.095
We're going to put this all the way in the back.

00:14:01.095 --> 00:14:08.470
To do that, you can right-click and select send backwards.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.500
Then again, right-click send backwards.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.815
Or it can do it all at once by selecting send to back.

00:14:19.815 --> 00:14:23.055
That's going to put it all the way in the back.

00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:30.900
Alternatively, you can simply click and drag the rectangle from the Layers panel.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.760
For this bit, I'm going to change its opacity to 10 percent.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.545
I'm just going to move it to the left and to the right,

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:44.370
until I find a suitable position for it.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.155
I think that looks pretty good.

00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:48.210
Now here's another tip.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.905
It can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move elements.

00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:58.290
Up, down, moves that element one pixel at a time.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.680
Left, right, does the same thing.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.290
But if you hold down shift while doing that,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.610
it's going to move it 10 pixels at a time.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:14.415
This is a very quick way of moving objects

00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:20.595
on your canvas without using the mouse.

00:15:20.595 --> 00:15:23.265
That looks pretty good.

00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:27.870
Now, to finish this off, let's do this.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.005
Let's duplicate this one more time.

00:15:31.005 --> 00:15:34.065
Let's change this rotation to 26.

00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:37.140
But this time let's move it inside,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.570
to somewhere like this.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.595
I think that looks pretty good.

00:15:41.595 --> 00:15:48.030
Now under fill, I'm going to remove my main gradients and I'm going to

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:54.675
add a linear fill from white to transparent.

00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:58.980
So this, is actually white,

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:05.650
zero percent and let's actually swap these.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.040
> So we go from solid to white to transparent White,

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.420
and I'm going to change its opacity to five percent.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:22.495
By doing that, I just get this very nice looking effect,

00:16:22.495 --> 00:16:28.170
where I start with white here and it just fades off as it goes up.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.520
I can even make this smaller, like so.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.620
With that, we can select all of

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:42.865
these command G or control G if you're on a PC to group all of these together,

00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:45.910
and let's call it the background.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.195
With that, the hero background is done.

00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:53.920
Let's go ahead and add the logo and navigation for that.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.990
Let's bring up the layout grid and,

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.485
let's open up our brand assets.

00:17:02.485 --> 00:17:05.440
We're going to grab our white logo.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.765
Simply click and drag.

00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:12.160
Let's position it somewhere in our page.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.340
Now, the logo, We're going to make it 48 pixels in height.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.290
This little button here will constrain as proportions.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.160
Meaning when you change one value,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.630
either width or height,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.495
the other value will resize accordingly.

00:17:31.495 --> 00:17:33.355
If you uncheck this,

00:17:33.355 --> 00:17:36.730
you can change these values individually.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.635
But in my case,

00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:43.915
I want to make my logo 48 pixels in height, why 48,

00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:46.870
because I'm using the eight point grid system,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:54.400
so any element should have a height that's a multiple of eight.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.120
Now I'm going to take my logo and I'm going to position

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.550
it so that it's 64 pixels from this edge.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:09.130
To do that, I'm going to hold down Option on Mac,

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.775
but it can hold down Alt on a PC.

00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:14.995
So on Windows.

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:21.620
I'm going to move my mouse cursor until I can reference the edges that I want.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.865
So notice where it says 71 pixels here.

00:18:25.865 --> 00:18:28.210
That means the logo is,

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.685
71 pixels from that edge.

00:18:30.685 --> 00:18:34.990
I can use my arrow keys now on

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:40.285
my keyboard to just nudge it in place so that it's 64 pixels now,

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.760
from that left edge.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.215
I'm also going to place it 64 pixels from the top.

00:18:47.215 --> 00:18:51.070
So to do that and make it easier for myself,

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.525
I can use the down key two times.

00:18:55.525 --> 00:19:02.890
Now I'm going to hold down shift and use the up key three times.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.870
Because if you remember holding down the Shift key while nudging,

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.355
an element will do that in increments of ten pixels instead of one.

00:19:12.355 --> 00:19:16.735
So now my logo is perfectly positioned,

00:19:16.735 --> 00:19:18.760
exactly where I want it.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.870
Now let's do the navigation for that.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.610
Lets start with the text element.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.990
You can press T on your keyboard or click this little button here.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.645
I'm going to type in the first menu item.

00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:36.775
According to our wire-frame.

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:39.730
We have four menu items: features,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.265
screenshots, testimonials, and pricing.

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:49.885
So actually one thing you can do is you can grab these links individually,

00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:52.224
copy them from the wire-frame,

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:54.880
and paste them here.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.085
How cool is that? Now, for the color,

00:20:00.085 --> 00:20:04.315
we're going to be using, white, 90 percent.

00:20:04.315 --> 00:20:07.255
For the text, we'll use Brandon grotesque,

00:20:07.255 --> 00:20:09.685
which is the typeface for our headings.

00:20:09.685 --> 00:20:16.000
18 pixels regular. 24 pixels line height.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.690
Then we need to position these at equal distance from one another.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:28.340
We could do this manually by selecting each one.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.720
Okay, this is a 24 pixels.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.630
Maybe I wanted to be a 32 pixels.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:40.750
I can do that. Then you will need to do the same with the rest.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.150
Usually this works.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:49.780
But there's a much easier way of doing things and that's by using auto layout.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.605
This is probably my favorite feature in Figma.

00:20:54.605 --> 00:21:00.840
Auto layout allows you to group a set of elements and

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:07.055
set equal distance between them or around them.

00:21:07.055 --> 00:21:12.370
It's the same as using margin and padding in CSS.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:17.270
So to do that, you would select all the elements that you want to add.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:28.015
You can click on auto layout or you can press shift A on both Mac and Windows.

00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:35.080
Or it can right-click and select, Add auto layout.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:41.575
So this is going to create the new frame that contains all of your elements.

00:21:41.575 --> 00:21:47.350
Then by default, it looks at how your elements are positioned.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.780
Mine are one after the other,

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.119
so it shows horizontal,

00:21:52.119 --> 00:21:56.360
but I can change this to vertical if I want to.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.790
This is the cool part here.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.530
I can set horizontal padding.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:08.635
So this will add space on the right and on the left.

00:22:08.635 --> 00:22:10.630
I can add vertical padding,

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.270
which will add space on the top and bottom,

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.630
and I can specify spacing between items.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.880
This is the one that we're interested in right now.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.635
So let me undo,

00:22:20.635 --> 00:22:23.455
and I'm going to specify 24 pixels.

00:22:23.455 --> 00:22:29.695
So now my elements are perfectly spaced apart.

00:22:29.695 --> 00:22:33.790
This is one feature that I highly recommend you

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.530
use all the time because it just makes your job so much easier.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:48.145
So with that, we're going to grab our main menu and we're going to position it.

00:22:48.145 --> 00:22:51.550
We're going to align it to the grid.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.640
I'm not sure if you can see it here properly.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.380
But now it's aligned to the grid and Figma is actually very smart about this.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.575
It automatically snaps it into place.

00:23:02.575 --> 00:23:08.290
Then I can select my menu and my logo.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:16.705
I can go here to the alignment panel and I can set a line vertical centers. Easy as pie.

00:23:16.705 --> 00:23:22.840
With that, the first part of our hero is complete.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.060
We have the logo,

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.960
the navigation, and the background.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:43.270
[inaudible]

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.230
The first part

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.020
of the hero section is now complete.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.320
If you didn't follow along and worked alongside me,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.685
go ahead and create it,

00:23:51.685 --> 00:23:54.700
right now so you're ready for the next step.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:01.270
As usual, feel free to bring your own flair or your own vision to this design.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:05.035
I would love to see these results in the project gallery.

00:24:05.035 --> 00:24:11.215
Now, assuming you successfully designed in this first part of the hero area,

00:24:11.215 --> 00:24:13.090
I think it's time to finish it.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.770
We'll deal with in the next lesson,

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.800
where we're going to add the hero content.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.270
So I'll see you there.
