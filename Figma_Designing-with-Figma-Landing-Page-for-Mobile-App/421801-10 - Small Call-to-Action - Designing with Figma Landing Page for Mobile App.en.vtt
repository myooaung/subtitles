00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.555
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:09.930
In this lesson, we'll once again play with shapes and

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.680
colors to create the small call to action that sits between,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.405
the second and third feature sections.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:23.260
We're pretty much all set so let's begin.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.240
If we take a look at the wire frame,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.030
we can see what we need to do here.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.655
So we basically have a title,

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:37.485
small description and then the actual call to action button.

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:41.715
So let's go ahead and copy these,

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:45.275
and actually I'm just going to copy the text.

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:53.510
I'm going to paste that in here and I am actually going to use these styles.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.235
So copy, paste and copy and paste.

00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:02.140
And that's going to save us a bunch of time.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.350
We're going to align these to the center,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.070
and then we're going to grab this button.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.810
I'm going to paste it right here.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.120
And that's going to say download for free.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.665
That's fine. And let's go ahead and select all of these.

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:22.925
Shift a to add auto-layout.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:25.220
Make sure to uncheck this.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.060
We're going to add 32 pixels spacing between items.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.475
And then here's what we'll do,

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:39.135
we'll add a fill color in the form of our main gradient.

00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:43.695
And then we're going to add eight pixels, border radius.

00:01:43.695 --> 00:01:52.200
And then we're going to add 64 pixels lateral padding, 64 vertical padding.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.970
And then the only thing left to change is the text color.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.250
So let's swap these with white and we should be good to go on this end.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.960
Now I'm also going to make sure that this spans on about,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.130
let's say six columns.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.020
And we're nearly there.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.920
We just have to adjust this a little bit like so.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.590
And finally, let's add our saved drop shadow to it.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.035
And we're pretty much good to go, right?

00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:38.120
Well, I don't think we should leave it like this because it's pretty simple, right?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.610
It kind of just sits there,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.500
a stand alone box.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.800
And I think we can integrate it better with everything that's around it.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.370
And to do that, we're going to play around with

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.060
some shapes and lots and lots and lots of gradients.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:05.540
So grab the rectangle tool and draw a rectangle that's 320 by

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:15.575
64 and 100 to the radius and add our saved drop shadow.

00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:22.220
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to duplicate this, move it like so,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.130
and push it in, 10, 20,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.755
30, 40, 50, 60,

00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:34.695
one, two, three, four.

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:38.030
So 64 pixels, you can even stop at 60.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:46.130
The idea is you want to hide this seam right here so you can even do it manually,

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.525
but I find that using a certain number allows me to be very precise.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.265
So again, one, two, three,

00:03:55.265 --> 00:03:57.940
four, five, six, one, two, three, four.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.070
Now I'm going to duplicate it and repeat the process.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.770
One, two, three, four, five, six, one, two,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.715
three, four. And again.

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:20.015
Now let's select these and duplicate them and move them down like so.

00:04:20.015 --> 00:04:23.645
And duplicate that again and move them down.

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:29.810
So now I'm going to take the middle row and I'm going to push it to the right, 10,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.575
20, 30, or anything maybe a bit more,

00:04:33.575 --> 00:04:37.250
40, 50, 60, one, two, three, four.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.700
All right. So now I'm going to group these,

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.670
so Command G or Control G if you're on Windows.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.210
And I'm going to open up my gradients plug-in.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.520
And I'm going to start doing this,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.695
just select an element,

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:57.080
choose a gradient, select an element,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.385
click a gradient, and so on and so forth,

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:06.870
and do the same for the rest.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.540
Now, how you decide to dress this up,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.670
is really up to you.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.210
But this is how you do it.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.460
So now that that's done,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.490
select everything and let's create a component.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.735
And let's set 16 degrees rotation.

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:37.640
Now, I'm going to align this in the middle of my page.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.830
And I'm also going to position it somewhere around this area,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.640
I think 120 from the elements above.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.930
Again, this doesn't have to be exact.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.865
You can eyeball it. Whatever looks good, use it.

00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:08.360
So now I'm simply going to move this below my little box here.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.910
And we can go ahead and align them to the center vertically.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.400
And if it looks a little bit flat, you can go in.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.960
And you can move these groups

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.410
around so that the shadow from the group above is cast on the group below it.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.350
Was that hard to do? Not really.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.480
You saw just how easy it is to work with shapes and

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.960
gradients and create very interesting elements.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.805
And with this, we can now command G to group it up.

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:53.220
And I'm going to call it Small CTA for call to action.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.530
All right, call to action done.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.035
Now I want to see your unique perspective on this.

00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:15.820
Play around with those colors,

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.270
those gradients, or maybe don't use gradients at all.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.400
I showed you one way of doing it,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.205
but obviously that's not the only way.

00:07:27.205 --> 00:07:29.875
So play around and get creative.

00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:34.165
And I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with.

00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:37.464
Once you complete this section,

00:07:37.464 --> 00:07:40.690
you're ready to move on to the next one.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.970
And the next one is the third and final section for features.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.905
And as per usual,

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:54.560
we're going to use a different layout to display this third set.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.590
That's happening in the next lesson so I'll see you there.
