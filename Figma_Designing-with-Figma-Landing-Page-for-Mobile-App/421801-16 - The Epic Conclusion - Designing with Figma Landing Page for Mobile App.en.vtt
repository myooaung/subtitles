00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.610
Well, congratulations for finishing this class.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.875
I really hoped it lived up to your expectations and you learned something valuable,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.415
something that will help you in your career.

00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:28.540
Now, please take a moment and write down the key takeaways from this class.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.370
As I was saying in the previous lessons,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.430
I strongly encourage you to create your own version of this landing page.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.630
Once you do that, go ahead and post it in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.110
the Project Gallery because l will give you feedback there if you want.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.230
I'm sure other students will give you feedback as well.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.115
Also if you have any questions or comments,

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:05.375
if you would like to see more content like this on Skillshare,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:10.230
make sure to leave your comments in the discussion tab.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.375
I would just love to hear from you.

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.480
Now, before we wrap things up,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.825
I just want to make this quick note.

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:24.560
This class, or this was the first class of a series called Designing with Figma.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.045
I plan on making more classes like this.

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:32.075
If you want to see more content like this,

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.090
make sure to follow me.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.880
With that said, thank you very much for watching and I really

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.245
hope to see you again soon in the next class.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:45.150
Much love and respect, take care.
