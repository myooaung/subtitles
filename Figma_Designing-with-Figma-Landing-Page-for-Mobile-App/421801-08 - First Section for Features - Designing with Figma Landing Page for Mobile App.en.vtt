00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.765
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:12.270
In this lesson, we're going to design the first section for features.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.150
This is where we will be using the majority of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.365
the icons and will also play with colors a lot.

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:23.290
This should be fun so let's get started.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.190
Let's begin by taking a look at the wire frame so

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.030
that we know exactly what we need to do.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
So this is the section that we need to design.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.235
As you can see, we start with the category title,

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:50.490
then a little description and then each feature is presented like this.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.250
It has a title and it has a description.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.410
Some of the features are only available in the Pro version,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.245
so we need to design some kind of badge for that.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:04.365
We'll also add some icons.

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:08.300
If I remember correctly from the project briefing,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.590
each one of these feature category has some kind of subtitles.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.710
So if we open up the project brief,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.155
and we look at the features,

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:26.510
there is a feature category,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.520
and here's another feature category,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.835
the one that we need right now "Budgeting made simple".

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:33.590
We do have a subtitle,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.660
it's called "Envelope budgeting".

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.830
So we need to make sure we add that somewhere as well.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.280
So actually let's go ahead and grab that.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.605
Let's copy it and let's go over here, let's paste it.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:58.340
Let's also get pretty much all the content that we have here.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.205
We'll worry about styling it in just a little bit.

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:11.700
One other thing that I would like to do is increase the height of this frame.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.440
Now let's start from the top, Shall we?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.325
With this, let's call it subtitle.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:23.965
Now because this needs to be very low-key,

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:27.165
so it doesn't need to pop out as much.

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.750
We're going to go back to our typography,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.630
and we're going to be using the small styles.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.620
So go ahead and copy the properties from this and paste them in here.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.835
Also, we're going to change its color.

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:50.555
I'm thinking we should use this secondary kind of coral red color.

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.820
So go ahead and copy that,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.475
paste that in, and we should be good to go.

00:02:56.475 --> 00:03:00.315
Now, let's bring up the grid.

00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:06.930
Let's actually align this to the grid and let's position it compared

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.855
to this element at about 120 pixels.

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:18.530
It doesn't have to be perfect.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.730
In some of the cases,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.540
it's more important that the whole layout looks

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.214
properly rather than adhering to that strict set of rules.

00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:39.065
So right now I positioned it at 120 pixels from this element here.

00:03:39.065 --> 00:03:40.865
But if it doesn't look right,

00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:44.795
I might just push it down a little bit.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:48.965
It doesn't have to be pixel perfect.

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:52.265
Now let's move on to the next elements.

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:56.515
First actually, let's select this, lets ungroup everything.

00:03:56.515 --> 00:04:02.540
Now this heading, let's see what style we should use for it.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.110
I'm thinking maybe heading three or heading four,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.120
but heading three seems more appropriate,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:16.400
so let's copy that and let's paste it and let's also use the proper color for it.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.590
So we'll go to our gray,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.475
I'll grab this and we'll paste it in here.

00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:25.315
We're going to use gray 100.

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:29.050
By the way, when I'm saying gray 100,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.265
it means gray 100% opacity.

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:35.779
If I say gray 40,

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.795
it means this value,

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:42.460
this color right here, gray 40% opacity.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.700
So just keep that in mind.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.870
Let's align this properly here as well.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.930
Let's actually push this up and leave

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.220
about 32 pixels of distance between these two elements.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.675
Next step is this element right here,

00:04:59.675 --> 00:05:06.700
that should also be placed 32 pixels from the main title.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.970
Actually, I'm going to resize it first.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.440
I want this to occupy about five grid columns.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.345
So we're going to resize it up to here.

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:21.740
Now for the actual style,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.890
let's go back to typography

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:33.465
and I'm thinking of using heading five.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:35.940
Heading five should do the trick.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:44.660
But we'll actually remove this medium weight because it's a little bit too much.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.925
Now if I think about this,

00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:51.710
we actually used the same style here,

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.570
right? 25,32 for line-height.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.065
So let's be consistent.

00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:05.925
Regular and we'll use this color.

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:12.375
But I think we're going to use a tint of that gray.

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.930
So let's see, maybe this one,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.870
this is 50 or 60.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.065
Yeah, I think this one looks fine.

00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:25.170
So let's do gray 60.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.970
Cool. So now what I can do is simply select all of these,

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.165
shift A to add auto-layout.

00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:39.185
Now whenever I change this text,

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:42.170
the elements surrounding it will be affected as well.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.520
This is a very efficient way of working in Figma.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.115
Now let's turn our attention to the actual features.

00:06:53.115 --> 00:06:56.495
First thing I'm going to do is change the color

00:06:56.495 --> 00:07:00.590
and the font family and all the text information.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.710
So for these titles,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.425
we need to use the heading typeface,

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:10.970
but for the text we need to use the body typeface and right

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.230
now these are like one text element,

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.364
is just the title,

00:07:19.364 --> 00:07:23.265
enter, and then the text itself.

00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:25.125
We need to split that up,

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:31.060
so what I'm going to do is remove that from there, duplicate.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.450
I'm basically putting the title in its own text element.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.690
I'm going to set Auto Width to it.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.750
Then I'm going to group it up with this and select shift A.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.040
For the spacing between items,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.690
I'm going to select 16 pixels.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.990
We don't need any padding here.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.535
Now I'm going to align this with my grid,

00:07:59.535 --> 00:08:02.310
and the text is going to be

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:11.444
three columns wide or 280 pixels.

00:08:11.444 --> 00:08:15.190
Let's change the color.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.800
For this bit, I'm going to use Heading five.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:30.225
Copy the properties from here and paste the properties,

00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:35.805
and again just make sure we update the text color.

00:08:35.805 --> 00:08:42.210
For the text, we're going to be using the paragraph style.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.620
Copy the properties from that, paste them here,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:52.155
and make sure to update the color as well.

00:08:52.155 --> 00:08:55.185
For the paragraphs, Tisa Sans Pro,

00:08:55.185 --> 00:09:01.125
18 pixels, font size and 24 line height.

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:03.630
One other thing that I want to do,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.070
is lower the opacity on these a little bit.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.110
I'm going to use 80%.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.705
Let me show you how that looks like.

00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:21.730
80% on the title and 60% on the text.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:27.855
We basically have to do the same thing to the rest of the items.

00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:34.365
I'm going to do one of these items again so you can see the process,

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:38.830
and then I'm going to fast forward for the other ones.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:47.590
First things first, we need to separate the title from the description.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:56.675
Then we need to make the title Auto Width.

00:09:56.675 --> 00:09:59.380
Select the title and description.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.615
Shift A to create Auto Layout.

00:10:03.615 --> 00:10:07.485
Set the spacing to 16,

00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:15.615
and then copy the properties for the text, paste them.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:20.650
Copy the properties for the title,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.170
and paste them. That's it.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:32.350
So now let's fast forward until I make the rest of the changes.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.630
Now that everything is properly set up here,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.110
let's go ahead and group these up.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:11.760
We have payees, categories and we can put in scheduled transactions here.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.360
Let's also align these to the grid.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.405
So the way I want this to happen is,

00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:24.765
I want the actual text elements to span three columns,

00:11:24.765 --> 00:11:28.170
then I'm going to leave one column blank.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.555
Then the next group will start at the next column,

00:11:33.555 --> 00:11:35.295
and so on and so forth.

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:38.280
Actually one last thing I need to do here,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:47.205
is to resize all of these text elements to 280 pixels. There we go.

00:11:47.205 --> 00:11:53.980
So I should go relatively, simply like this.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.390
We're going to select all of them,

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.865
are going to align them to the top,

00:11:58.865 --> 00:12:01.070
then select them again,

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.980
Command or Control G to create a group.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.900
Next is going to be,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.320
let's say Multiple budgets,

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.175
then maybe Goal tracking and Sync between devices.

00:12:14.175 --> 00:12:20.475
Finally, we'll have reports and sync with your bank like that.

00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:29.880
Now select these, align them to the top command G. Select these,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.515
align them to the top command G to group.

00:12:34.515 --> 00:12:36.585
Now here's what I want.

00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:42.570
I want 64 pixels spacing between each one of these groups.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:47.850
I mean vertical spacing, like this.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:54.195
Also 64 pixels between these and this group here.

00:12:54.195 --> 00:12:58.260
That's really easy to do with auto layout.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.865
So select all of them.

00:12:59.865 --> 00:13:05.130
Shift A, 64 pixels here,

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:11.850
and then make sure everything is aligned to the left, like so.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:18.915
I'm good to go.

00:13:18.915 --> 00:13:25.545
The last thing we need to do here is to add the icons.

00:13:25.545 --> 00:13:30.780
Add a Pro badge instead of these pieces of text here,

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.265
where it says Pro.

00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:36.765
Let's actually go ahead and create that Pro badge,

00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:43.410
and for that, I'm going to choose the Rectangle tool or press R on the keyboard.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.550
Or actually, let's do this with auto layout again.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.890
So T for Text tool,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.605
I'm going to say Pro, for the typeface,

00:13:55.605 --> 00:14:00.030
I'm going to use Brandon Grotesque, bold,

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:06.675
14 pixels and also 5% letter spacing.

00:14:06.675 --> 00:14:08.580
Here's a pro tip,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:16.620
When you're working with uppercase letters or uppercase words,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.475
with a low font size;

00:14:20.475 --> 00:14:26.760
to improve readability, you should always increase the letter spacing.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.220
Just to give you an example,

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:34.155
here is without letter spacing and here is with letter spacing.

00:14:34.155 --> 00:14:40.650
See how you can read this bit more easily than this bit.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:49.080
That's why, we also added letter spacing to this style here or to this text elements.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.090
Now with the selected,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.790
shift A to create a frame around it.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.460
Let's add a fill.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:01.290
The fill is going to be our primary color,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:08.909
then 100 for the border radious

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:15.045
Let's add maybe eight pixels horizontal padding,

00:15:15.045 --> 00:15:20.250
and maybe four pixels on vertical padding.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.475
We don't need any spacing here.

00:15:23.475 --> 00:15:27.240
The text itself we're going to make white.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.300
I think we should be good to go.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.450
What we can do here, we can decrease

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:39.030
the font size even more and with the letter spacing as well.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.360
We're going to each use 16 pixels for the letter spacing.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.390
I think that looks just a little bit better.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:51.510
So with this, because we're going to use it in multiple places,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.940
it's always a good idea to create a component.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:00.810
So select it and go to create component or use the keyboard shortcut.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.595
So now, i'm going to hit Command X, to cut it,

00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:08.440
and i'm going to start inserting it,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:13.455
instead of this piece of text.

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:18.980
So multiple budgets, Command V and

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:26.445
then to create an auto layout with only these two elements,

00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:28.830
i'm going to select them and hit

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.615
Shift A and then i'm going to select the mode to horizontal.

00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:37.840
I'm going to make sure to uncheck clip content.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.595
I'm going to align this badge to the center

00:16:41.595 --> 00:16:44.760
and make sure this is aligned to the center as well.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.745
As for the spacing,

00:16:47.745 --> 00:16:50.715
16 pixels is plenty.

00:16:50.715 --> 00:16:56.440
So now, I'm going to go ahead and do the same for the rest.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.130
All right. Cool beans.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:09.240
So now that we have pretty much everything in place,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.660
all we need to do now is add the icons.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.475
So, to do that,

00:17:14.475 --> 00:17:18.630
we can start in our icon set up.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.650
I'm going to be using the ionicons set.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.755
So let's search for people.

00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:29.070
I'm going to be using, People Outline,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:35.920
Copy that, Paste it in and i'm going to re-size it.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.460
Now, here is a situation that you might run into

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.280
when you're using figma on certain SVG elements.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:56.160
When importing into figma and resized the normal way with the Move Tool selected.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:04.245
You'll see that the shapes in there or the strokes of the shapes get very thick.

00:18:04.245 --> 00:18:06.645
That's not something you want to do.

00:18:06.645 --> 00:18:17.475
Instead, you need to go up here and select scale or K. If you do that,

00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:22.500
you'll see the element is now resized correctly.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.070
So we're going to resize this,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:31.020
to 24 pixels in height.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.880
Something like this.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.170
So now I'm going to align this to the left.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:42.780
You can also press the left keyboard Arrow and i'm also going to move it up,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.330
by pushing the up Arrow on the keyboard.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.815
All that's left now to do is to find a nice color for it.

00:18:52.815 --> 00:18:59.385
For that, we're going to go to our trusty tertiary colors.

00:18:59.385 --> 00:19:01.710
This is one of the reasons we're using them.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:04.860
So, it's actually take them in order.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.500
I'm going to Copy that color,

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:12.480
Paste that in here and, we're good to go.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.210
So now all that's left to do,

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:22.110
is fill in the rest of the elements with icons.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.140
I'm going to be using exactly the same procedure.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.160
I'm going to do one more and then i'm going to fast forward.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:36.120
So for categories, maybe we're looking for some grid.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.175
Let's see if we can find.

00:19:38.175 --> 00:19:39.720
I'm going to use Grid outline.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.715
So Copy that.

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:51.270
Select the text or the element where I want to Paste in my other element.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:20:01.150
Command V and then K to resize this to 24 pixels in height, like so.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:06.750
Move it up and let's pick a nice color for it.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:11.160
Maybe I don't know, this purple.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.785
It doesn't really matter. You just pick the colors that you think look best.

00:20:16.785 --> 00:20:24.100
All right. So now let me fast forward and fill in the rest of the icons.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:05.985
All right. That wasn't too bad. Was it?

00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:12.630
Pretty fast process, especially when you are watching it on fast-forward.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.445
But all joking aside,

00:21:14.445 --> 00:21:17.310
it's a really simple once you get the hang of it,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.395
once you create one or two elements,

00:21:19.395 --> 00:21:24.030
is just rinse and repeat to make the rest.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:37.710
[MUSIC]

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.850
All right, at the first feature section is now complete.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.260
Now it's your turn. If you haven't done it already,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.360
go ahead and create it, right now.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.700
I used a three column approach here,

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.530
but you could do things differently.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:00.345
Why not use two columns or four columns?

00:22:00.345 --> 00:22:03.675
Try it out. See how the layout changes,

00:22:03.675 --> 00:22:08.610
when you're arranging these elements differently.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.580
So now, once you do that,

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.885
you are of course ready to move on to the next lesson.

00:22:15.885 --> 00:22:20.715
In the next lesson, we're going to create yet another section for features,

00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:23.415
but this time in a different way.

00:22:23.415 --> 00:22:26.800
So I'm looking forward to seeing you there.
