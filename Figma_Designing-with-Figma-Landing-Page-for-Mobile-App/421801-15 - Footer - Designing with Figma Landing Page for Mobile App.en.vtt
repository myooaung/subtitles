00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.750
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.210
In this lesson, we'll design the final section of this landing page, the footer.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.520
It's a pretty straightforward task,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.230
so let's get started.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.880
Now, taking a look at the wireframe,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.460
we can see the composition of the footer.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.710
We have the logo here,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.800
a little side menu on the right side here,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.729
some information about the company,

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:37.129
the typical copyright information,

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.790
and a list of links for social media.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.230
Let's get started.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.140
I'm going to start by bringing in the logo,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.360
and since we have it here,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.390
I'm just going to copy this one, paste it here.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.225
I'm also going to bring in the grid,

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:02.090
so that we can properly align the elements here.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.885
Then let's create that side menu that you saw up here.

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:11.550
Let's actually copy that, paste it here.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.215
Let's do a Shift A to create an auto layout,

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:22.814
horizontal, let's do 32 pixels between items.

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:25.745
As for the style, well,

00:01:25.745 --> 00:01:30.605
we're going to use a style that we've used previously,

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:31.865
which is this one here,

00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:35.640
so Copy Properties,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.170
Paste Properties, nice.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.320
Let's take these two and align vertical centers.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.545
Now let's take this and align it to the right edge of our grid.

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:08.974
Now, next, let's add a separator here.

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:15.230
To do that, we'll actually turn to these elements right here.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.190
I'm going to grab one of them,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.910
and I'm going to move down here paste that in.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.550
Just move it into place,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.570
and let's resize it until it expands the entire width of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.030
my grid and let's bring its height back to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.305
48 pixels because I accidentally resized it there.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:46.080
Let's position this, right now it's at 48 pixels,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.255
let's do maybe 64.

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:52.579
That should do the trick nicely.

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.790
But I think however,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.440
it might be a little bit too much,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.270
so let's go back to 48 actually, like so.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.380
I think that looks a little bit better.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.985
Next up, we need to add the company information.

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:19.875
Let's copy that, paste that in here.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:22.810
We're going to use the paragraph style for this,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.890
so let's copy the properties from this,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.295
paste them in, align everything to the left.

00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:38.320
Also what I want to do here is to make

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.260
these bold and to use the primary color.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.915
Because these are links.

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:51.410
Actually, I'm going to use regular.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.055
I don't think bold looks that well here.

00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:59.765
Bold we're going to keep for these types of links,

00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:03.845
but for these, we're going to use the regular weight.

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:07.325
Let's bring this up a little bit,

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:12.795
to match the spacing, like so.

00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:21.195
We have 48 from text to separator and then 48 from separator to logo.

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:26.820
Finally, let's add the copyright information.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.120
Let's do Edit, Paste and Match Style.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:41.040
Let's also position that 48 pixels from the element above it. What else?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.255
Well, we need to do the links for social media,

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:53.460
but instead of just playing links, let's do icons.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.450
That's should be super simple.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:03.470
I'm going to use icons from the set that we've used this entire class.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.535
Let's search for Twitter.

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:13.380
Let's copy that, paste it in,K to resize it,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.990
and we're going to resize these to,

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.305
I think 24 pixels, it's a bit tricky.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:23.225
Let's also add the proper color to them.

00:05:23.225 --> 00:05:24.770
What else do we have?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.440
Facebook, I think, I add Instagram.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.770
Let's grab Facebook, same drill K for scale,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.270
and then resize it to 24 pixels.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:47.830
Let's paste it inside my main frame here,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.540
and Instagram, copy that,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:07.315
paste it in, and resize it to 24 pixels.

00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:09.265
Now, bring it all together,

00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:13.345
select these Shift A to add auto-layout.

00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:16.865
Let's do 32 pixels between them.

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:22.600
Let's make sure everything is aligned in the middle.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.695
Let's use the proper color on all of these.

00:06:27.695 --> 00:06:29.995
I'll select both of these,

00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:34.790
align vertical centers, and I'm

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.350
going to bring in the list of icons right to the edge of my grid here.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.490
Then grab these two,

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.785
command G to group them up.

00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:51.695
Now what I can do is make sure my measurements are correct.

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:57.465
48 there, 48, and 48, select everything,

00:06:57.465 --> 00:07:06.660
command G, and group it up as footer.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.070
Now, the only thing left to do is

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.060
to figure out what kind of spacing we need at the bottom.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.875
A good way to do that is to look what spacing you used at the top,

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:22.170
and in my case, it's,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.635
I believe 64 pixels.

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:28.870
There are a lot of elements here.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.045
It's 64 pixels.

00:07:32.045 --> 00:07:35.070
Let's do that.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.345
Let's select my Desktop,

00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:48.815
and let's resize it accordingly.

00:07:48.815 --> 00:07:54.775
Save, and that right there,

00:07:54.775 --> 00:08:00.675
ladies and gentleman is our finished landing page.

00:08:00.675 --> 00:08:05.425
Let's take a last final look at it.

00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:10.290
I'm going to go ahead and hide the UI here,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.675
so we can see it better.

00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:18.080
It all started with the hero section.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.844
First, we created this logo, navigation, and background,

00:08:24.844 --> 00:08:32.775
and then we added the text content and the collage of images.

00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:37.070
Next, we have the first section for features,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.830
followed by a second section for features,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.875
using of course a different layout.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:46.595
Then we add a small called action area.

00:08:46.595 --> 00:08:50.515
Instead of doing a simple box,

00:08:50.515 --> 00:09:00.230
we added this background to it using simple shapes, shadows, and gradients.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:05.420
This is followed by the third and final feature section.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.105
Again, with a different but slightly more classic layout.

00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:15.440
Then we followed that up with the screenshot gallery,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.635
which we made it look like a Carousel complete with navigation,

00:09:20.635 --> 00:09:24.559
buttons, and also page in the carriers.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:29.410
Following that up is a simple section for testimonials,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.800
with a simple slider.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.780
Then probably the most important section on the page,

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.670
the main call to action,

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.350
which also includes the pricing table.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.430
Finally, in this lesson,

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.535
we created the final section on the page,

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:49.320
which is the footer.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.675
Now it's your turn to finish designing the landing page.

00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:08.425
Go ahead and create the footer.

00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:12.050
After you do, I want to congratulate you because you just

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.740
passed this class with flying colors.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.070
Please join me in the next lesson for the conclusion.
