00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.525
Welcome back to the class.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:10.665
In this lesson, we'll design the screenshot gallery.

00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:14.530
That's pretty easy to do so let's get started.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.680
If we take a look back at the wire-frame,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.610
we can see that I originally mocked up the screenshot gallery as a simple grid of images,

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.970
and while this is a perfectly viable solution,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.690
I think we can do something a little bit more interesting than that

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
and we're going to do a carousel of images.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.020
A carousel is basically when you can see one row of images and you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.590
have controls left and right to move that row of images.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.990
As you move it left and right other images are being revealed.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:04.265
So, let's jump to the main design portion and I'll show you what I mean by that.

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:07.820
Now for this, I'm going to be using some of

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.430
the placeholder images that are provided in these [inaudible].

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.320
and let's see.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.945
I am going to grab main open savings,

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:24.250
maybe this one, this one,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.550
this one and the main.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:37.685
So with these simply click and drag and Figure.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:42.400
Okay, and that loaded a bunch of images.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:51.430
Now, we want our images to be sized according to the grid that we're using.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.480
So I am going to bring up the grid and we're going to make it so that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.514
each image occupies four grid columns.

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:04.960
So, let's go ahead and resize this like so,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.915
and the size we're looking for is 384 pixels.

00:02:13.915 --> 00:02:18.020
So now I'm going to do the same for the other ones.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.220
So with 384,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.940
and now I'm going to start bringing them in one at a time.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.730
So let's bring in statistics,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.320
This I am actually going to move.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.230
So statistics go here and this image I am going to

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.210
position it at 32 pixels from the other one. What else?

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.470
Let's bring in the main image and don't worry about this image being way taller,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.530
we'll fix that in just a little bit.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.930
What else do we have?

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.010
We have these, and I actually think we have enough images here.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.710
So, let's position these properly like that.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.685
Now let's hide the grid and let's select each one of these images and add

00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:38.090
a nice drop shadow and also eight pixels border radius.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.080
Now what do we do with this large image?

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.835
We want it to be the exact same height as the other ones, which is 683.

00:03:49.835 --> 00:03:52.520
Well, we can do that.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.480
No problem. Simply uncheck constrained proportions,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.550
enter 683 and double-click it.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.690
Right now it's set to fill but if we want to move it around,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.990
we can set it to crop.Then we can choose which part of the image we want to display.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.865
Pretty cool.

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:28.530
So, let's move it down, just a touch.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.654
Let's make sure that it's right where it should be.

00:04:37.654 --> 00:04:44.010
I think somewhere like here should be just fine. Let's see.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:58.155
Just a tad, one pixel up should do the trick nicely.

00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:00.430
Okay.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.280
So now here is what we can do to add a little bit of a visual interest.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.310
We are going to stagger these images,

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.985
meaning every other image will be positioned 64 pixels lower than the previous one.

00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:24.590
So we select this and this and we'll say 1-2-3-4-5-6,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.220
that's 60, and then 1-2-3-4, that's 64.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.940
Cool.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.090
Now, let's select these command G to group them up.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.580
Let's move them further down.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.010
What I want to do, to be consistent in

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:53.459
the design is I want to grab these two angle stripes,

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:56.130
and use them as a background,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.515
and that will tie in nicely with the whole angle motif we are using to have angles here,

00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:05.890
here and also here.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.030
Okay?

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.485
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:13.580
Let's paste these.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.565
Let's bring them under our group.

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:20.890
Now I can select both of them.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:29.864
Let's do this individually and then I can make them bigger or smaller,

00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:35.265
depends on what kind of effect I am looking for,

00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:39.685
something like that and let's grab the other one.

00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:45.475
Let's make that a little bit bigger, something like that.

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:53.565
So they kind of intersect one another and let's move this further on like this.

00:06:53.565 --> 00:07:01.660
You can play around with these two shapes and once you do that,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:09.964
you can open up the gradients and you can give them different colors.

00:07:09.964 --> 00:07:13.950
Something like this or something like that.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:24.460
It can even change their order depending on which gradient you want to show first.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.235
Now we also need some sort of navigation here, right?

00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:35.815
How will we move this carousel?

00:07:35.815 --> 00:07:39.640
Well, let's go ahead and do that then.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.110
Let's start by grabbing the Rectangle tool or

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:51.565
R. And let's create a rectangle that's 320 by 320.

00:07:51.565 --> 00:07:53.950
Let's add 64 pixels,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.345
border-radius and let's do

00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:05.155
a angle or rotation of 26 degrees.

00:08:05.155 --> 00:08:08.320
I'm going to add the nice drop shadow.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.530
I'm going to set its fill to white and I'm going to set its capacity to 95 percent.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.940
So this will stay on top of these items,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:28.525
like so and we can even bring in the grid so that we have some kind of measurement.

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:37.390
What I'm going to do is align into the grid and then push it to the right 10,1,2,3,4,5,6,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.565
16 pixels something like that.

00:08:39.565 --> 00:08:49.330
I'm also going to align it in the center with my screenshots,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:58.250
so now I'm going to grab the arrow

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:09.320
and I'm going to paste it in here and let's bring it inside this group.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:19.570
Command G to group it up and let's change its height to 32,

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.375
so make it just a little bit bigger.

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:29.660
Now you can simply position this arrow to your heart's content.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.770
I'm going to do something like this,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.960
1, 2, so 20, 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.285
24 and I think actually we need to make it a little bit bigger.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:52.390
Let's try 48 yeah 1,

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.250
2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.730
Yeah, something like this.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.730
You need to play around with it until you get it just right,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.140
just the way I like it,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.895
but for me right now,

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:06.055
this looks pretty good.

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:13.360
What I'm going to do is duplicate this bit and I'm just going to move

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.710
it to the other side, like so.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.585
Let me first align it in the middle and again,

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:29.815
I'm going to align it with the grid and then push it to the left,

00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:31.360
10, 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.685
5, 6, 16 pixels.

00:10:33.685 --> 00:10:43.630
Then I'm just going to position the arrow in relatively similar position.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:49.629
You can achieve a much higher level of precision when you're coding this with CSS.

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:53.005
So don't worry too much about it right now.

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:56.425
The last thing to do is just flip it horizontally,

00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:59.590
which will turn it the other way.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:07.090
Now we have the buttons for moving the carousel, forward and backward.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:13.270
The last thing that I would like to add to this is

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:19.690
some kind of indicator to let us know on which page of the carousel we're on,

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.160
so for that, here's what we'll do.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.490
We'll grab the rectangle tool again.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:34.585
We'll draw simple rectangle and we'll make this 32 pixels wide,

00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:41.379
4 pixels high, and the radius 16 pixels.

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:46.345
So now we have a small shape that looks something like this.

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:56.620
For the color, I want to use the same primary color like so,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.499
but am going to do 10 percent capacity.

00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:05.905
This is a representation of a carousel page that's not currently active.

00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:08.335
Lets repeat the process.

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:10.165
We're going to duplicate it,

00:12:10.165 --> 00:12:14.740
let's select both "Shift A" to add an auto layout.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:22.940
Let's set 16 pixels distance between the two and now let's create the active state.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.775
For that duplicated once more but this time,

00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:31.210
let's make it like 80 pixels in width.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:38.470
We're going to use a 100 percent the primary color and then

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:42.130
just add a few more to represent

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:48.700
other inactive pages and I think that should do the trick.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.490
Now we're going to select this,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:59.870
align it in the middle of the page and let's bring it up a little bit.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:10.870
Let's actually align it with

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:20.320
the bottom edge of this shape and that's the screenshot gallery.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.525
Now let's select everything.

00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:28.570
Command G to group it up and let's call it screenshot gallery.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:37.780
Finally, let's move it up or actually let's move it

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.940
down and leave about 240 pixel distance

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.595
between the gallery and the section above it.

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:52.130
Now if we do a bird's eye view,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:14:00.440
we can see that we have a pretty good balance of white space.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.470
All right, as usual,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:20.185
now it's time to take action and create your version of the screenshot gallery.

00:14:20.185 --> 00:14:26.530
I went for a slider slash carousel approach but you can stay

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.770
true to the wire frame and just do a simple group

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.385
of images or you can create some other layout.

00:14:33.385 --> 00:14:35.710
It's really entirely up to you.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.065
I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with.

00:14:39.065 --> 00:14:41.615
Now with that said,

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:42.860
it's time to move on.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.980
The next item on our list is

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:53.150
the testimonial section and there I'm actually going to keep things very simple.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.570
Let me show you my take on it in the next lesson. See you there.
