1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:08,860
Now of course the look and feel of your editor and your IDE is one thing but it doesn't stop there.

2
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,450
Once you start writing code, there are also other things that really matter,

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,380
for example that you are aware of some key shortcuts.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,570
Now again, here in Visual Studio Code, you can find many shortcuts by just going into the different sections

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,580
here that allow you to edit your code

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,450
and there, you always find the shortcut that would allow you to do the same thing.

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,640
These are simple things like undoing or redoing which you'll use a lot or copy and pasting which you

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,950
probably know

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,230
but then we also got things, like here toggling the comments which I did already in an earlier module

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,800
which allows you to quickly comment a line in or out. And the shortcuts you're seeing here might not

11
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,400
be the same ones I have here because you can re-bind these shortcuts and I'll come back to that in

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,870
a second.

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:58,260
Also important are the selection shortcuts you find here or the selection modes you find here.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,210
This allows you to quickly select similar values for example with the add next occurrence shortcut if

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:11,080
you want. There I could mark log entries and if I now hit the shortcut for this or I choose the option

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,410
here of course but using the shortcut is simply faster,

17
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:21,490
so if I do this, then it selects the next occurrence of this same word if you will in my code.

18
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:27,010
So now I have this selected and this selected and that's great for renaming for example, if I want to

19
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,470
rename this, I can just hit the shortcut until I have all occurrences selected,

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,210
I also get a hint here on the right in the scroll bar where all these occurrences are and then I can

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,590
give this a new name

22
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,800
and now it's renamed in all the places where I did use it.

23
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:48,940
So that allows you to change and refactor things much faster and this is also a crucial shortcut

24
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,880
and all these selection shortcuts can be really helpful, for example for moving something up a line or

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,700
down a line, that makes restructuring your code which you will ultimately do a lot in development.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,410
way easier. Now not all shortcuts might work for you, maybe you want to change one and you can do that

27
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:15,270
under code preferences and then there, keyboard shortcuts. If you click on that, you find all the shortcuts

28
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,100
which are built in and there are a lot of shortcuts but the good thing is it's really great to search

29
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,620
this,

30
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,100
for example if you're not happy with that add next occurence shortcut here and you want to use a different

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,670
one,

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,200
well you can type add next and it's actually this one here,

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,590
you can also search for a key binding. If you can't find a shortcut otherwise, you can search for this

34
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:44,430
here on Mac by just typing command D and now it shows you all shortcuts that include the command key

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,090
and the D key, of course also the control or the shift key is supported, same for space and so on. So you

36
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,590
can also search for keys and find the actions that are bound to these keys.

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,240
So that gives you a lot of power to really find all the different commands you might need

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,510
and then of course it's needless to say that you can change them by just right clicking on this and

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,000
then change key binding.

40
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,100
So really make sure that you adjust these shortcuts to your requirements and that you simply have a

41
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,890
look at the menu up there, the menus up here, to find some actions that might look useful to you and bind

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
these to shortcuts which you can reach

43
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,980
and as you work and as you grow as a developer, you'll find more and more shortcuts to work with.

44
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:34,990
So the goal is not to stop developing for two days now and just explore all possible shortcuts,

45
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,750
you can do that if you like but my recommendation would be that you just have a brief look at the options

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,210
you find here in the menu and experiment with these options and then as you continue with development

47
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:52,170
and as you write code, you will automatically reach situations where you think that would be really nice

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,320
if I could fix it with a shortcut and then you can go to this shortcut changing menu, to the keyboard

49
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,750
shortcuts menu here and simply search for the action you want to do and see which shortcut this has

50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,570
and if it doesn't have a shortcut yet, you can assign one.

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,690
So using shortcuts really is something which I would recommend.
