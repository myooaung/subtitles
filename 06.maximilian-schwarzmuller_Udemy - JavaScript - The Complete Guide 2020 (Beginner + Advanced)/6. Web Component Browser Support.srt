1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:08,930
So now did we learned about these different specifications and we will learn what they do and how we

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,550
use them in detailed step by step.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:18,230
No Worries Now did we learn that though it's also important to recognize that not all browsers to support

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,170
all these specifications and especially older browsers like Internet Explorer eleven.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,990
While support even less.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,170
Now let's have a look at browser support today.

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:37,080
For now the easiest way of finding the browser support is by simply googling for web components.

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,720
And then you can wizard web components dot org.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:49,070
This page there and on this page if you scroll down you will find this browser support table here and

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,610
there you see all major browsers and how they're supporting the different web component specifications.

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,760
As a side note here you all the CDC as modules specification that is something which I didn't mention

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,450
on the slide.

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:10,200
It's not directly a part of the web components specification set this in the end is related to how we

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,730
can import javascript falls into jobs good files and we will find a solution for that later in the course

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,500
to the first three rows mentioned the parts you saw in my slides though the custom elements D H2 out

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,010
templates in the shadow Dom.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,420
And as you can see right now browsers support is already very decent.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,940
It's getting added to edge too.

19
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,450
At the point of time your view and of course this might already have changed.

20
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,460
And until then we can use a poly fill.

21
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,480
So third party package that basically gets the browser to support this and therefore we can use what

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:53,460
you learn in this cause in all major browsers if you want to get a more detailed list of which browser

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,550
supports which feature you can google for it can I use and then for example custom elements and you

24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:08,770
could also use Chateau dom or H2 Mal templates there and you will then find the Can I use page here.

25
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,500
There you take that custom elements have one link

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,490
and on this page you can see browsers support for this feature and this looks a bit worse than the prior

27
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,640
page because there is more red on it but this is the more helpful page because you will see that for

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,370
example and hasn't implemented this yet again you can make it work with poli filters though but you

29
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,380
can see that for development you should really use a modern version of Firefox or Chrome and then later

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,220
you will learn how to make your web components work in more browsers.
