00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:10.520
So now that we got this open button working here we got our basic our very basic modal functionality

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.750
in place.

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:20.050
Now a next step that would be great is if we could customize the content of this model a bit more.

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.020
Right now we can pass in our own body our own main content.

5
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.400
But what about the title would be nice if we could pass in the title to and first setting the title.

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.180
There are of course two possible routes we could take.

7
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.890
One option would be to have like modal title attributes here which we can set.

8
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.830
We could certainly do that and we could set this attribute here.

9
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.350
And then in modal jazz in the Connected callback which we don't have yet because we don't need it we

10
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.250
could edit of course we could extract the dad attribute and we could then initialize our age one tag

11
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.560
content here with the title we set up in our attribute and of course we could then all of a listen to

12
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.660
changes in that title.

13
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.570
So in that modal title attribute and possibly updated in the modal when that changes there would be

14
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.470
nothing wrong with that but I actually want to show you how to use multiple slots because maybe we also

15
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.430
have a modal where we don't want to force the user into using h1 tag here.

16
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.640
Instead we want to let the user pass in any header the user wants and it could for example also be a

17
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.330
h1 tag with an H2 tag below it.

18
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.370
So to have a title and subtitle and for that I want to use a slot here in my component to the problem

19
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.360
now of causes.

20
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.970
I now got two slots right.

21
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.950
They got one in the header and I got one in the main section.

22
00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:01.310
Now if we do that and we then go into the modal and we have let's say our H1 take here please confirm

23
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.050
if I do it like this and I reload this page and open the modal then it might look right at first but

24
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.650
if we inspect us we actually see this is not really working out the way we wanted to work if we have

25
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.580
a look at our model then in the header.

26
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.930
Well both is inserted the paragraph A.H. one tag and the main section there the slot basically is empty

27
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.580
because what essentially happens here is that the first slot catches all the content we pass into the

28
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.130
car component and that makes a lot of sense because how would javascript know.

29
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.390
Which part here should end up in which of our slots.

30
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.310
What we need is some kind of identification for each slot.

31
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.180
Some I.D. we assign to a slot which we then can use when we pass in some content to target a specific

32
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.390
slot and we can actually do that.

33
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.040
We can give our slots names and that is totally optional but something we can do.

34
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.320
And here I will give my slot a name by adding the name attribute.

35
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.930
This is how you do assigned names two slots and I'll name this title and down there.

36
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.910
We now could give us a name of main or we leave it unnamed and then any content which we pass in which

37
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.990
does not target a specific name will automatically go in here.

38
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.680
Now let me show you how this works.

39
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.610
So we get this slot named title here.

40
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.840
Now back in the next age team I'll file the content which should go into my name slot will receive an

41
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.000
extra slot attribute and there I simply point at the name.

42
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.020
So in my case title so I use title here on the slot attribute off the content that should go into that

43
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.130
title slot because I have title as a name here.

44
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.940
The second slot has no name and therefore the content which has no slot attribute automatically goes

45
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.030
into debt default slot.

46
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.610
I can show this to you if I now reload this page here.

47
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.440
If we now inspect this we see the header slot has the h1 tag and if I go into the main section this

48
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.180
slot has the paragraph tag and now we got a modal with more options for us to customize it because now

49
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.710
we got multiple slots where we can pass in content.

50
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.890
And of course we can also still assign a default value here.

51
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.850
So for example for this name slot just as we can do it for the unnamed slot I will add a default content

52
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:46.030
of please confirm payment in case we would not pass in content for this slot.

53
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.370
Now in our case we do.

54
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.560
So when I reload we should still see please confirm instead of my default content of please confirm

55
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.900
payment and indeed we do.

56
00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.700
And now all the things you already learned apply so we can now style this content which we do passing

57
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.870
from inside our main app.

58
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.160
So to save from our main document we can style that here in the light dom or in our model with the slot

59
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.290
it special selector.

60
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.780
So here this stop in particular has no effect anymore because we can't target the h1 tag that's passed

61
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.090
into the shadow Dom from outside.

62
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.820
If we would want to target anything that gets passed in we would have to use the slotted attribute like

63
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.650
this.

64
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:36.810
So now here I simply add my conditions I want to styles slotted H ones and now if I reload this we have

65
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.380
that smaller text here.

66
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.350
So this is something we can still do.

67
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.170
Basically what you already learn about slots.
