00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,320
Enough about numbers,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,450
let's have a look at strings.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,030
Now for one, I want to point your attention to something which you already know actually, strings of course

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,190
can be created in three different ways - 

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:21,080
double quotes, single quotes and back ticks, back ticks create a string with that template

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,470
literal notation where you can dynamically inject dynamic values like this

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,950
and on any string no matter how it was created, you also get a couple of properties and methods,

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:36,980
for example the length property to find out how many characters the string has but then also many useful

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,500
methods, for example to uppercase to transform a string to be all upper case characters,

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,290
of course the same exists for to lowercase and various other methods for combining strings, for extracting

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:55,640
substrings, for checking if a string for example starts with a certain sequence, like in this case and

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,750
so on.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,940
A great place to learn about all available methods is of course MDN, there if you search for

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,370
MDN string you'll find this article and on the left, you find all the methods on this prototype which

15
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,950
is in the end attached to each string you're creating and there, you can find out which methods exist

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,640
and what you can do with them and how they are supported in different browsers.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,150
Now this can be really useful to work with strings, to remove excess whitespace for example with the trim

18
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,490
method, to convert it to all uppercase as you just saw or to do many other interesting things with it.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,960
Now that's strings and that's the uninteresting part because the more interesting part is actually what

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,600
you can do with template literals, there

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,820
we only scratched the surface yet.
