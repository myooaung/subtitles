00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.200
Now before we dive into the problems this can bring,

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.490
let's first dive into an alternative methods syntax which you can also use.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.620
This is one way of defining a method, a shorter way is to remove the function keyword, remove the colon

4
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.240
and add the parentheses right after this property name. So you no longer have a traditional key-value

5
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.660
pair here with a colon

6
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.870
but instead you have this syntax.

7
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.910
Side note, if you would use an arrow function here, well then you need to remove that arrow as well.

8
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.510
So this is now just a different shorthand for adding a method to an object. Behind the scenes, it's actually

9
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.370
not exactly the same as this here but for the moment, we can ignore this, I will come back to this in

10
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.250
a later module because it's a bit more advanced and it simply doesn't matter for the moment.

11
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.620
So this is now a method and it behaves just as before,

12
00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.010
if we save that and reload and quickly enter Javascript level 5 or whatever you want, you see that

13
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.730
works.

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.820
So that's a shorter method syntax which I will now use.
