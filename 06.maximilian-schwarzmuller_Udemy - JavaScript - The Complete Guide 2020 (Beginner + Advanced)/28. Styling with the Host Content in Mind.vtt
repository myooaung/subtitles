00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.970
Now to conclude the special selectors will learn about.

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.220
There's one other special selector that is worth pointing out and that is the host context selector.

3
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.670
Now let's say and that is actually the case here.

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.200
We only want to apply a certain style to our custom element when it is inside of a paragraph.

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.120
As our first tooltip is right here our first tooltip is inside of a paragraph.

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.850
The second one is not.

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.630
So in this case we might want to set a certain style.

8
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.990
And for that there is no special selector colon host dash context.

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.990
This also has this function for him with parentheses after the selector and in the function arguments

10
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.350
here.

11
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.700
So we the parentheses you specify the surrounding conditions you want to have around your element.

12
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.680
So in this case we could add the p selector.

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.340
So the tax selector for a paragraph element but you could also have something like it should be a paragraph

14
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:11.480
with the hello clause like this or a paragraph with a nested element of Hello which surrounds our custom

15
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.570
element all as possible.

16
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.440
Here I'll just go for P and if that is the case let's say then we want to have a fund wait that is bold

17
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.460
so we want to have bold text and if we do that and we reload.

18
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.730
We see for the first web component we have bold text for the second we don't we have that because of

19
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.690
this rule which kicks in due to our paragraph around our custom element and for the second Web component

20
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.940
for our second tooltip does rule that's simply not apply because there is no paragraph around it.

21
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.580
And if we would nest is inside of a paragraph.

22
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.800
So if it would move it here and you can drag it into developer tools.

23
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.610
So if I drag it here into my paragraph you see this gets bowled too because it's now all the inside

24
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.350
of a paragraph and hence.

25
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.810
Now this host context here also applies to move it out of there again.

26
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.480
Then again it's not bold anymore.

27
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.600
So this is really really cool.

28
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.510
Gives us a lot of flexibility here and with host hosts in combination with this function forum to set

29
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.070
conditions host context and slot it.

30
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.130
You have a lot of powerful tools to style the content in your web components in exactly the way you

31
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.520
want.
