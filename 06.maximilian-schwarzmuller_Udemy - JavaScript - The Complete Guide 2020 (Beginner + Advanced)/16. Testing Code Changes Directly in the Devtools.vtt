00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.290
So now that we're able to find the error, let's fix it and let's say we think we know what the problem is

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.670
but we're not sure yet.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.360
Of course we can always go back to our code and change it here and reload the page and try it again

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.590
but you can also change your code here in the sources tab.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.330
There we have the suspicion that fetching our user input is the problem,

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.930
so that this is a string instead of a number.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.100
So we could add parseInt here,

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.290
like this to see what whether that does the trick.

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.950
Now you just have to save this by pressing command or control save so that the star disappears up there

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.880
and you get a warning that this only was saved locally,

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.290
so only here in the browser, not to your filesystem,

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.870
so the code we have here still is untouched. If you go to get user number input here, you'll see that's untouched.

13
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.580
So you don't change your local code but you change it here in the browser so that you can test changes

14
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.480
here in the browser without facing the danger of changing your real code and maybe breaking things there.

15
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.190
So now if I add five again,

16
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.180
now this is looking better because now you see this is not getting concatenated but instead, this really

17
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.040
changes here at the end,

18
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.090
it really adds five as a number.

19
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.330
So now that we validated this fix, we can just take it and bring it to our real code and then apply it

20
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.750
here, save and now reload

21
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.350
and now we have the code we wrote and now we see this is now really working the way it should.

22
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.030
So this is how we can work with the debugging tools.

23
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.910
Now you've got more tabs up there,

24
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.390
we'll explore them later in the course, for example the elements tab once we work more with the DOM and the

25
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.870
performance and memory tab,

26
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.110
these are tabs I'll dive in later once we optimize performance and memory usage of our application.

27
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.270
For now, the sources tab, breakpoints and the console here,

28
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.920
these are your bread and butter tools for finding and fixing errors.
