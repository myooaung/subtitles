00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.720
So that was a lot of talking about browser support.

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.310
Now Javascript is a hosted language,

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.130
it does not just work in browsers but also in other runtimes like with Node.js.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.180
How is the situation there? Now

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.560
with Node.js and all the other environments,

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.690
the important thing is that you control which version of Javascript you use or which version of Node.js

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.750
you use which then in turn supports certain features.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.970
So you have direct control over the environment where your code will run

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.010
and that's the huge difference to browser side Javascript, to web application, there

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.720
you don't have control over that.

11
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.180
If a feature is available, you can use it in a controlled environment, in an uncontrolled environment,

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.750
this is simply beyond your control.

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.010
Therefore we have to build applications with the tools you learned about in this module to make sure

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.710
they work in all the environments for all the users we want to target with our web application.
