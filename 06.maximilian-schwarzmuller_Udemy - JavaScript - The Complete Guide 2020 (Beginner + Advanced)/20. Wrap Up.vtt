00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.500
So we implemented drag and drop in this module and in general, you learned a lot about events, event

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.950
listeners, how you can add and remove event listeners, about the event object, how to get data out of it

3
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.070
and that the data you can get out of it differs based on which kind of event you're listening to.

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.630
You learned about prevent default which can be super important and about the capturing and bubble phase

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.710
which you can control with stop propagation.

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.650
You learned a lot about patterns like event delegation which can be useful and in general, you hopefully

7
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.920
now have a good understanding of events, how they work, that they are important and what you can do with

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.520
them.

9
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.880
All these examples of course were related to events in the browser but the idea of listening to events,

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.000
even if the syntax is a bit different, is the same in a lot of programming languages

11
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.560
and I did mention it earlier,

12
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.700
I will say it again at this point,

13
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.740
you also should later check out the Node.js module to get an idea of how that works

14
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.880
and there you will also see how you listen to an event or how that works in a Node.js example.

15
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.730
And with that, we got that out of the way,

16
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.630
let's now move on.
