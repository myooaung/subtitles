00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.600
Now last but not least, many modern IDEs and editors allow you to install extensions. Here in Visual

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.170
Studio Code,

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.410
you reach that extensions section by going to view and then extensions, the default view which we're

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.030
currently in as is the explorer by the way.

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:26.270
Now if we go to extensions, what we see here is a list of enabled extensions I got installed, got a couple

6
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.940
of Angular extensions here because I work with Angular and then a special theme which I installed, Dart

7
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.460
because I did some Flutter and Dart development and a couple of other extensions as well.

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.510
Now, you can of course always search for extensions by typing up here or by scrolling through the recommended

9
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.670
ones

10
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.470
and for example what you could do here is you could search for prettier.

11
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.730
It's one extension which we got installed already,

12
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.700
we installed that in module one.

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.220
Prettier is an extension that helps you with auto formatting and in my case as I said, I already have

14
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.780
it installed

15
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.080
but if you don't have it installed yet, you can install from here.

16
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.280
Now you can always learn more about extension on this page, you learned how it works, how to use it, how

17
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.980
to configure it, which settings you can adjust

18
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.410
and this therefore allows you to tweak the development experience to your requirements and maybe even

19
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.030
add brand new features to your development environment,

20
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.380
so definitely also utilize this.

21
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.710
My recommendation just would be that you don't install too many extensions because it's easy to add

22
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.470
more and more add more extensions

23
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.130
and at some point of time, your editor might become slow because of all these extensions or you get strange

24
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.310
behaviors, maybe strange auto formatting which you didn't expect because you've got multiple extensions

25
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.680
clashing with each other or extension A changing some configuration of extension B. So don't overdo it

26
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.680
but of course have a look at potential extensions that might help you. With that,

27
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.660
let me go back to the explorer.
