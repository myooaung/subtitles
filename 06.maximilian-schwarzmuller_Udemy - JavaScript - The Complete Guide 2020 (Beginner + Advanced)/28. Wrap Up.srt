1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,090
And with that, we're done with this objects module.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:12,380
Now the next modules will actually also talk about objects and about different ways of creating objects

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,780
for example and dive into more advanced topics that are related to objects because it turns out you

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,250
can use them for so much more than for the already a bit advanced data storage we're doing here

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,990
but again we're just scratching the surface here.

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,730
Nonetheless, these are super important concepts because you will also work with objects in exactly that

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,480
way a lot,

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,010
what you're going to learn in the next module will not render this knowledge here obsolete,

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,380
instead it will add onto this knowledge and give you different tools for different jobs

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:49,910
and knowing this syntax, how objects behave, knowing about this and how this behaves, knowing about

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,620
arrow functions and this, about bind, call, apply and knowing all these things about object destructuring,

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,890
the spread operator and how properties and methods are related, what they do in objects is super important,

13
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:10,070
that's the bread and butter of Javascript I would say. The next modules will add onto that, they will

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,400
add very important, additional pieces of information which allow you to write even more powerful applications

15
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:23,450
with more reusable code and really awesome features related to objects but you need to understand these

16
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,180
basics here in order to understand the next modules. So really make sure that these concepts here and

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,550
these ideas about objects are set.
