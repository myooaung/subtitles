The tools built into Chrome which help you with performance can be really daunting,

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.950
they can be very complex and therefore it's important to know where you can learn more.

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.520
Now attached, you find two important pages which I can only recommend - 

4
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.090
one is from the Chrome web site in the end, here

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.830
a deep dive into the performance analysis tools in the browser dev tools.

6
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.890
Here you'll learn everything about these tools, what you can do there, what everything means, how you can

7
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.510
configure it, how you can save and load snapshots and so on,

8
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.450
so this is really useful and absolutely a resource I would recommend that you dive in

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.180
if you want to learn everything about these tools and you want to be able to analyze everything. Also

10
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.580
check out the other resources here, like this article about optimizing web site speed which is about

11
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.080
more than just Javascript,

12
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.270
it's also about optimizing images and so on and all the other articles here about performance and Javascript.

13
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.430
You can also learn more about the browser dev tools in general on this page.

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.650
Also interesting is this other page which you find attached,

15
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.360
it's about web performance optimization in a browser context.

16
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.380
Some concepts here can also help you with Node.js but most concepts here are targeting the browser,

17
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.460
just as this first article by the way and this is really the part where performance optimization is

18
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.760
most important or where you have many opportunities of messing up stuff. So the second article here

19
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.920
also gives you more insights on how to measure performance and then it also gives you this loading, this

20
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.690
startup performance and how you can measure that and what you can do there and the runtime, the rendering

21
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.970
performance with some ideas on what you could do here, what you can keep in mind,

22
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:58.040
also outside of Javascript when it comes to optimizing animations which are controlled by Javascript

23
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.220
and CSS for example. So these can be additional resources that are helpful

24
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.160
but with that, let's now dive into our application,

25
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.480
let's test it under production circumstances and have a look at some things we could optimize there.
