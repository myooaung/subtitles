00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.290
So this is it with this module.

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:11.070
We learned a lot about Node.js, that it uses regular Javascript syntax but adds its own APIs, like

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.640
the filesystem, its own packages we can use and does of course not support the browser default APIs

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.090
like the DOM or browser storage because it doesn't run in the browser but that instead we run Javascript

5
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.620
in a different environment, on our machine or on any machine where Node.js is installed.

6
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.250
We can also not just use Node.js to run utility scripts like this one, we can use it to set up a HTTP

7
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.990
server, either by doing everything on our own or by tapping into the rich ecosystem that exists

8
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.170
around Node.js, where we have packages and frameworks like Express and other packages together with

9
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.720
Express.js, that allow us to focus on our core business logic and where we don't have to worry about

10
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.180
parsing data and so on.

11
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.820
And there you learned how you can set up a server which returns some server side rendered HTML files

12
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.440
or how you can create a so-called REST API, where you have various endpoints, various URLs you

13
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.270
support on that server that do different tasks depending on the HTTP method path combination that reaches

14
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.380
your server.

15
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.370
You even learned how to store data in a database and get it from there

16
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.750
and with that you should have a good idea of which problem Node.js solves, how it generally works, that

17
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.480
it's just Javascript in the end but with a totally different purpose or giving you totally different

18
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.680
options of what you can do with it

19
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.630
and therefore now you really have a broad overview of Javascript and what you can do with it and where

20
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.750
you can run it and what that means for your applications.
