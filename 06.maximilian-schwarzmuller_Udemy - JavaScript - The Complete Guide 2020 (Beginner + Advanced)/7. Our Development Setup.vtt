00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.180
Enough of the talking let's dive into learning more about custom elements for now.

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:13.010
So about the core part of web components and let's write some code.

3
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.820
First of all it's important to differentiate that for custom elements.

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.980
We actually got two different ways of creating them.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.570
For one you can create so-called autonomous elements.

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.810
These are basically your own custom elements that don't depend on anything that are totally independent

7
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.310
of existing age HTML elements that are built into the browser.

8
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.030
Alternatively you can also create your own custom elements by extending built in elements though like

9
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.300
extending the built in button word build in paragraph and dad also can be a way of creating custom elements

10
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.350
in this course will mostly build autonomous elements but actually will show you both ways of creating

11
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.130
your own custom elements your own web components and it will use to name custom element at web component

12
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.380
interchangeably here.

13
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.840
So you can build custom H2 alt tax in both ways and I will show you both ways and both are fine to use

14
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.570
depending on what you're building.

15
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.370
Often you want to have your totally separate custom element though.

16
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.320
So this autonomous way is probably the more common way.

17
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.870
But how do you build your own web components in that way then for that.

18
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.500
I created a new folder anywhere on your computer you can create it.

19
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.370
It's totally empty as you can tell.

20
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.910
And I'll open it or I open it with visuals to you code.

21
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.730
Now in here I did one important thing.

22
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:48.010
If you had control shift P or on Mac command shift P you'll open this command menu here and here.

23
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.700
If you type theme then you'll find this preference preferences color feeds option and there.

24
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.250
I switched to dark plus which is the theme which because we just started.

25
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.010
Look you can of course all use our themes here and I'd add one other thing.

26
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:11.220
If you go into these extensions part by clicking on view extensions here there if you search for material

27
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.400
icon you'll find that material icon theme which I also installed this is totally optional.

28
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.230
It just changes some of my file icons.

29
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.600
Once we start adding files to the project.

30
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.920
So if you want to get that same file I can look I have you have to install and enabled that material.

31
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.180
I can theme thereafter you can go back to your explorer view here.

32
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.510
OK.

33
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.820
So this is now the view in which will work.

34
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.040
And there I will add two files.

35
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.630
The first one is an index H outfall.

36
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.450
Theoretically you can name it anything you want.

37
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.250
And this will be the dummy page we use for hosting and running our own custom elements there.

38
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.560
I'll just type h t email and now in visual pseudocode I get this all a completion where I can pick that

39
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.850
H Tim l five template and if I now hit enter I get a basic h t mail five skeleton a year out of the

40
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.540
box I'll give it a title of web components and now here in the body we can start playing around with

41
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.780
our own web components the code for the web components will be written in a different file and here

42
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.210
I will add a tooltip Todd Charles file because I want to start by writing a tooltip component.

43
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.320
So this is now the file where I will write the code the javascript code to create my own custom element

44
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.590
and therefore I will add one more thing here in the Unix H to mail file I'll add a script tag and the

45
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.640
head section where I simply import that tooltip at tooltip J as fall and thereafter this will automatically

46
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.300
run any code we add in that tooltip file and we will add some code here to define our own custom element

47
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.270
and that is exactly what we do in the next lecture.
