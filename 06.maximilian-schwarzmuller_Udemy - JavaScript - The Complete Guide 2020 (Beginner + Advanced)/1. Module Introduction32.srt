1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:11,330
In this module we'll also have a look at a couple of new features or to put it in better versions, new behaviors

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,200
I should say but we'll not introduce that many new features as in the previous modules.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,020
This however is a very important module because we'll have a look behind the scenes of Javascript, we'll

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,740
understand more how it works, what the browser does with our code, how it executes our code.

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,250
We'll also have a look at a couple of weird parts in Javascript and how it evolved over time and we'll

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,220
have a look and that's related to the involvement process.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,310
We'll have a look at ES5 and ES6 and what that is and how that differs.

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,040
Now to be precise, we'll actually start with that ES5 versus ES6 thing and I'll explain what

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,320
that is and how the syntax changed in these different versions of Javascript which it effectively is.

10
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,540
We'll have a closer look at how some of the syntax, especially when it comes to creating variables, changed

11
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,090
over time and what a key difference is between how we create variables now, which is how you learned

12
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,550
it in this course thus far and how we did it in the past.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,100
We'll then have a look at how Javascript works,

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,840
so what the browser actually does with our code, how it parses and interprets this and then also how

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,110
it executes the code, so once it interpreted it or once it started interpreting it what it's doing with

16
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,160
the code. We'll have a look at a couple of weird parts with Javascript that can be confusing but that

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,750
actually aren't that confusing, you just need to be aware of them and I'll dive into all these important

18
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,310
things in this module.
