00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.310
So this was a module about asynchronous code and you learned all the theory about that, how Javascript

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:15.450
offloads certain tasks and how the event loop and how the message queue then is used to get that back

3
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.630
into the stack and executed there

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.790
and that's of course very important theory because that really is a core part of Javascript and explains how

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.430
your code executes and then you learned about callback functions which you use everywhere and how you

6
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.230
can optimize them a bit more by introducing promises, where you can write your own promises,

7
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.780
there also are certain APIs which uses promises from the ground up which we'll also see later in the course,

8
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.770
which can help you write more readable and more structured code, either with

9
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.790
then and catch blocks or with async await

10
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.240
and there are some differences or some things to be aware of,

11
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.080
most importantly that this does not magically change Javascript but just transforms some code and you

12
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.060
will also learn about promise race

13
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.500
all and all settled

14
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.730
which also can help you orchestrate your code in your promises

15
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.370
and this is something very important, this was a very important module.

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.340
Definitely make sure you understood it,

17
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.460
it's relatively late in the course because it's also advanced but it's a significant and important part

18
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.300
of Javascript and even if you skipped other modules, this is a core module which you absolutely have to

19
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.930
understand.
