00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.630
Now that's all nice.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.940
What we're doing here.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.750
But what if I want to style my overall custom element.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.060
Thus far I'm styling the slotted content.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.940
And we could of course also style our question mark here.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.830
So in the tooltip we could of course also assign some styles to this span here.

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.010
We could give us a class of let's say I can here and then obviously no one is stopping us from giving

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:40.440
guy can some styling here let's say a background color of black a text color of white some padding here

9
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.510
daughter to 5 rem for example text align center.

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.620
Anything like that and if I reload we would have dad style here.

11
00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:03.990
Let's maybe also give it a border radius of 50 percent and we would have that style we can maybe now

12
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.950
also get rid of that whitespace at the beginning and the parentheses.

13
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.000
So do we have this more iconic look here.

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:23.540
Let's increase the padding to left and right 2.5 rem maybe and shrink that to 1 5 something like that

15
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.810
and then we would have this I can look here.

16
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.140
Now this is something we can do but what does it want to style the overall component from outside my

17
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.340
element.

18
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.050
So from the light Dom I can simply use my tag selector or any clause I add on to my or I.D. I add onto

19
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.440
my element because that is really important to understand.

20
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.990
You can use your custom element just as you use the built in elements so you can add an idea you can

21
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.160
add classes or as I just said you can use its tag name here as a selector just as you can do it with

22
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.820
a death we can add the U.S. tooltip here in our styling.

23
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.150
And of course there we could give this some style.

24
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.670
Now Which style do we want to assign here.

25
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.140
Let's take one that we can clearly see.

26
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:22.740
I will give it a border of one pixel solid and blue and maybe padding of 0 dot 1 5 rem if we now go

27
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.450
back and we reload.

28
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.570
We see that we do have that styling for all our tool tip ish components here.

29
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.880
Now we're probably not going to win a style price here but it is important to understand that this is

30
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.420
something you can do.

31
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.740
Now I will at this point by the way also comment out my background color for the highlight so that it

32
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.990
looks a bit less messy.

33
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.990
And now we just have that blue border around our overall component.

34
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.320
And this of course is something you could definitely want that you style your custom element as a whole.

35
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.380
Now sometimes just as we've slotted content you don't want to do that from outside.

36
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.490
So from our lights Dom styling but you want to set up a default styling for your element inside your

37
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.680
custom element.

38
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.810
And just as we've slotted content the light Dom will always overwrite debt but still in cases where

39
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.730
you don't set up a default style in the light on you want to do that from inside the shadow Dom from

40
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.540
inside your element.

41
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.770
So let's switch to our tooltip here and there.

42
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.320
Let's make sure we can style our element.

43
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:39.010
The problem just is in here we can't use the selector because this style well simply styles our shadow

44
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.670
Dom template and then that template we got a slot and a span but we certainly don't have our own tag

45
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:55.060
in there instead in here we have a special selector to Colon one colon only by the way host selector

46
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.790
and does host selector.

47
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.530
Now allows you to style your element here.

48
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:10.130
For example here we could now gift as a background of a light gray if I now go back and I reload here

49
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.660
we see that background on all our elements here.

50
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.230
And again we have a look at this in our developer tools we see this is the style we just added and it

51
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.130
would be overridden by any clashing styles we have in a light on.

52
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.780
So just as we've slotted content the light on wins but with host we can set up default styling for our

53
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.970
custom elements from inside them.

54
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.920
And that of course is a use case.

55
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.130
You typically also have a lot when creating your own web components.
