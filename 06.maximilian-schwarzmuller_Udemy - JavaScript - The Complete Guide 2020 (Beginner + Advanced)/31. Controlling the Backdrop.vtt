00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.060
So to implement this, we first of all need to get access to this backdrop,

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.620
right? Now it has an ID of backdrop, so it should be fairly easy to select

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
of course, we can add a constant here, maybe name it backdrop

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
and just one other note about the naming, you can always of course also name these things

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.950
something el or element to make it clear that you are pointing at an element in the DOM here.

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.390
I will really leave that up to you,

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.330
there is no best or common practice regarding that, you will find different styles,

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.010
you just should find and pick your style and then be consistent and not switch it too often, at least not

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.750
in one and the same project

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.470
and here to keep names shorter, I'll go with these names here

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
but as I mentioned if you preferred it, you could add el or element here to make it really clear that these

12
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.020
constants hold pointers at elements on the DOM or in the DOM.

13
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.590
So here you could name this backdrop element but since I don't use the element annotation on the other elements,

14
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.440
I'll just name it backdrop here as well

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.250
and with that, I went to select it and since it has an ID of backdrop, of course we can just say

16
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.730
document.getElementById backdrop,

17
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.220
that's the probably the best way of selecting it to be honest. An alternative, since it is the first

18
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.500
element in our body

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.260
and this also is unlikely to change to be honest because it is such a crucial background, not always

20
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.490
visible element which we probably won't add much above it,

21
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:38.250
we could of course alternatively also select it by saying backdrop is equal to document body first child,

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.350
a first element child because the first element child in our body of course is that backdrop.

23
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.350
So that would also work and it's also unlikely to change,

24
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.180
so the HTML structure is unlikely to change regarding this relation of this div to the body and

25
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.780
therefore this might actually always be valid but I'll go for the ID which won't break for sure

26
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.030
unless we change the ID on the element of course.

27
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.820
So with that, we got access to the backdrop and now as I mentioned, we could use it here and use class

28
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.230
list toggle visible here as well but I don't want to tie it to this function because later I will also

29
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.020
need the backdrop in other places.

30
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.030
So instead I'll add a new function here, toggle backdrop,

31
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.910
again I will use an arrow function here, also to be consistent,

32
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.320
you could create this in any way

33
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.610
and I will move that backdrop visible class toggling code into that toggle backdrop function and then

34
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.430
just call that function from inside toggle movie modal

35
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.520
and this allows us to then later also call that function from inside other places so that we haven't

36
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.400
strictly tied this backdrop visibility to toggle movie modal. Well and with that if we save that and

37
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.960
we go back, reload, click add movie,

38
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.980
now we have that background. Now it would be nice if we also could click this background or this cancel

39
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.510
button to then dismiss the modal and the background because right now, since this backdrop actually even

40
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.060
overlays the add movie button, we get absolutely no way of dismissing this and the expected behavior of

41
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.100
an application like that would be that

42
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.950
well of course the cancel button closes this but also that clicking on the backdrop closes this. Now as so often,

43
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.770
great practice for you but of course, we'll also do it together. So let's make sure we canclick the backdrop

44
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.440
and we can click this cancel button to basically call toggleMovieModal and toggle backdrop again,

45
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.880
well toggle backdrop will automatically be called when we call toggleMovieModal because inside of

46
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.490
toggle movie modal, we call toggle backdrop.

47
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.710
That's a lot of talking I guess.

48
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.410
So, how do we get access to the backdrop and to the button?

49
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.760
Well we actually already have access to the backdrop,

50
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.780
all we need to do there is we need to add a new listener to it so that we can react to clicks on the

51
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.010
backdrop.

52
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.120
So here we can add an event listener, a click listener

53
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.770
and now here important, I don't always want to call toggleMovieModal, so I don't want to tie this to

54
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.190
the backdrop because whilst here in the current app state, of course I want to execute this function

55
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.100
and close the modal. Later as I said, we'll also use the backdrop in other places and then I don't want

56
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.010
to toggle the movie modal but do something else when we click the backdrop.

57
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:28.600
So therefore, I will actually add a brand new function here which I'll name backdrop click handler and

58
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.990
this function will then actually do everything that should be done when the backdrop is clicked,

59
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:44.170
so here I will call toggleMovieModal and therefore connect this here so that at the moment, we still close

60
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.460
that

61
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.190
but we got more flexibility to also do other things when this is clicked. Now with this change already

62
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.490
of course if we reload, click here, click the backdrop, this closes, we can repeat this process as often as

63
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.660
we want.

64
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.730
So that's great,

65
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.000
now of course it would also be nice if we could click this cancel button to close this and

66
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.340
for that

67
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.460
let's have a look at the HTML code again.

68
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.790
It's this cancel button

69
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.640
I'm talking about, it doesn't have an ID and still we'll need a way of selecting it

70
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.880
and now here of course, you can be very creative.

71
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.000
Now you could think about getting access to the modal actions div here but we'll also have this in

72
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.530
another place later. SInce

73
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.540
this is the first occurrence of this, we could actually use it and select it with query selector and then

74
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.390
select the first element child which is this cancel button and here, this relation is also unlikely

75
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.930
to change,

76
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.260
so using a DOM traversal technique like first element child should work here or we could also try to

77
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.730
select it by selecting to add modal here and then select the first button which we find in there or a

78
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.530
button with these classes here, with the button passive class because this is the only button with the

79
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.000
button passive class in the add modal div here.

80
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.190
So that would be different ways of selecting it,

81
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.800
now you can certainly make arguments for the different approaches. Here,

82
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:11.220
I'll add a constant and name this cancel add movie button because it's the button that cancels this add

83
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.420
movie process

84
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.840
and now as I said, there are different ways of selecting this.

85
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.370
Now actually, we already have access to the add movie modal here, so we can use that and then run a query

86
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.220
on that.

87
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.550
So we don't have to do it on the entire document, since I'm searching for a button inside of that modal,

88
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.530
we can just use add movie modal and then run a query here with query selector and then here, I could

89
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.980
run a query for the first element that has the button passive,

90
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.740
so this class here because this is the first and only button in this add movie modal and it's the button

91
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.120
I'm interested here, with the class I mean, it's the first and only button with that class.

92
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:54.290
So now this gives us access to this cancel movie button here,  cancel add movie button and now we can add

93
00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:01.240
it here, event listener click and now I want to execute a function of course when we click this, maybe

94
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:12.660
add it here, cancel add movie, you can of course pick any name you want here and when this gets triggered,

95
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.790
when this function gets executed, I want to call toggle movie modal because I want to close that

96
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.840
movie modal.

97
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.520
So here we can point at cancel add movie on our event listener

98
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.910
and with that done, if we save everything and we reload here and I click cancel, this also closes it.

99
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.950
So now we get different ways of interacting with that,

100
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.540
now I would say it's time to make sure that we can also click add here and then have a look at all

101
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.900
these input fields here, check what has been entered there, maybe even add a short check to see whether

102
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.100
something valid was entered or not,

103
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:55.110
so if it's empty you're not basically and then take that information and add a new movie as a Javascript

104
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:01.860
object here in our script at first but then later, also as an element which we add here on our screen.
