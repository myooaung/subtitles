1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,690
So we're adding our log entries to the log entries array which is great,

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:13,250
now let's say for some reason, maybe in another part of your code or maybe here, you need some data from

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,180
your log entry.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:19,380
You don't need the full object but you need the operation and here

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,160
let's just say we want to log it.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,740
Of course, that's kind of redundant here because we know what operation we added here but it's just so

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,090
that I can show you how you can access data on objects and you do this with a notation which we already

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:42,380
saw. You use the name of the object, log entry here and then you use the dot notation, you add a dot here

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,680
and a dot tells Javascript that on the object in front of the dot,

10
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:54,460
so log entry here, you want to access one of the properties as it's also called,

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,230
so one of the data pieces that belongs to this object

12
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,440
and here you see my IDE already gives me this autocompletion,

13
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,660
you can also get this by pressing control and space and I can get access operation for example and by

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,230
outputting log entry.operation,

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,770
if I now reload this here and I add a five here, you see add gets printed here and that's just that data

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,240
piece I'm accessing here with this line of code.

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,730
So the dot notation allows you to access data in objects.

18
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,130
These key-value pairs here or the keys here are also named properties,

19
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,830
so you access a property here with the dot notation and then the name of the property or name of the

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,770
key, whatever you want to name it and of course that's also something we saw before.

21
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,970
It's also what we in the end he was down there when we call add event listener on our buttons. There,

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,480
we also use the dot notation and then the only interesting thing is that here, I'm not accessing a property

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:02,100
which contains some data I can read but that I actually access some function because you can also have

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:08,910
functions in objects but that's something we'll dive into in the objects module where we dive way deeper

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:15,060
into objects. For now, let's just think about them as groups of data, of key-value pairs where your values

26
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,470
can be strings, numbers, arrays, other objects and so on, where you can either hardcode data like I'm

27
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,590
doing it here or point at variables and then the value of that variable will be stored here as a value

28
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,010
for this key and that's it for now. Objects are really powerful and we'll see them many times throughout

29
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,180
this course, there's so much you can do with them,

30
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,410
for now let's just use it like this though and let's now also make sure that we actually are able to

31
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,870
add log entries, not just when we add two numbers but also when we subtract and so on.
