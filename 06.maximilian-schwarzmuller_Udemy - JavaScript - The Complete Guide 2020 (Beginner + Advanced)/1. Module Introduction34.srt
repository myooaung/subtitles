00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,850
With all the basic knowledge we gathered, it's now finally time to also work with the HTML document

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,950
our script is running on on our own because thus far in all the tiny projects we worked on, I always

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:24,370
gave you that vendor.js file, that black box code which in the end established connections to certain

4
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,590
elements in the HTML code.

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,290
Now it's time to fully understand how we can establish such a connection because there's more than one

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,280
way of doing so

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,990
and how you can in general work with the HTML page that was rendered, manipulated and so on.

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:46,750
Specifically in this module, we'll have a look at the HTML code, how it's loaded, something which

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:52,280
is called the DOM and what this means and how Javascript fits into the equation.

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,430
We'll have a look at nodes and elements which are two important types of objects

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:03,250
if you want to call it like that with which we're working if we're working with the HTML content through

12
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:11,170
Javascript. We'll have a look at how we can query DOM nodes, so how we can get access to parts of the

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,070
rendered HTML code and how we can move around there in Javascript to select different elements and

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:24,260
do stuff with these elements because we'll also have a look at how we can read and manipulate the DOM,

15
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,210
so how we can for example change the style of an element or anything like that

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:35,650
and of course we'll also have a look at how we can add brand new elements to the rendered HTML page

17
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,290
or how we can remove such DOM nodes which will turn out to be HTML elements.

18
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,430
So a lot of content in this module, let's not lose any time and jump right in.
