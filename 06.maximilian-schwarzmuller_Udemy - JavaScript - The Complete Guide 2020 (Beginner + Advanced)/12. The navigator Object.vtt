00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.910
Now besides location and history, there also is the navigator object,

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.420
also quite interesting. This allows you to interact with the browser and the operating system of your

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.190
user so to say, of course only in a limited way,

4
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.920
not unlimited access.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.020
If we expand this, we can find some information about the browser the user used for example

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.260
and here, you might see something strange.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.350
This here says something about Mozilla

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.970
even though I am using Chrome here,

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.360
even more interesting is a specific property which is often used to check which browser the user is using,

10
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.490
the user agent property.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.400
If we access this property, navigator.userAgent, you might expect information about the browser

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.390
the user uses,

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.350
though if I use it we see information about Mozilla there, AppleWebKit and then yes, also something about

14
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.970
Chrome but also about safari.

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.900
Now what's up with this?

16
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.670
This actually looks the way it does look for historic reasons,

17
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.870
browser vendors in the past used to fake this to make sure that their browsers could have access to

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.630
all features website might be using in their scripts because in the past, browser support was pretty

19
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.520
different for different web features and hence, some programmers working on websites used user agent

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.760
to find out if the user is using let's say Internet Explorer and therefore they wouldn't run a certain

21
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.410
script

22
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.370
if that browser was used. Now as browsers evolved and maybe Internet Explorer 7 included a feature which

23
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.790
version 6 didn't include, that script that prevented Internet Explorer from getting access to certain

24
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.410
features of the website would still block access even though support might now have been added to

25
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.380
the browser.

26
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.860
Therefore browser vendors started to put basically all browser names into this user agent string because

27
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.920
this is set by the browser, so the people building the browsers of course can influence what shows up

28
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.920
in there and hence, browsers basically faked to be another browser so that they could get full access to whatever

29
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.780
the script wanted to do, so that the users of that browser had no limited or restricted user experience.

30
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.460
Hence this is not really that useful.

31
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.180
Now attached you find a link, how you can still parse this, a certain way of reading this that should still

32
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.870
give you mostly reliable information about which browser your user is using but if you really need to

33
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.930
know which browser your user is using, you should not rely on this string in the end but instead check

34
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.710
if a couple of features are available because by checking for feature availability, you can narrow down

35
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.680
which browsers users are using in a better way and you should also check out the browser support module

36
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.320
in this course where I also dive into techniques that allow you to write scripts which work in a broad

37
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.950
variety of browsers or that fall back to some behavior if a certain feature is not supported.

38
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.870
So I just wanted to show this because I find it kind of amusing to understand how this evolved over

39
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.830
time,

40
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.560
as I said with the attached link you can parse it but do it with care. Now navigator also exposes many other

41
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.310
features,

42
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.780
for example it also exposes access to the clipboard API which allows you to add something to the clipboard

43
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.290
or paste something into some input field for example.

44
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.910
It gives you access to geolocation which allows you to locate your user with get current position which

45
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.030
allows you to get the user position, you would do that by then passing in a function which executes once

46
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.570
the position was fetched and in there, you can console log the data which you will get automatically

47
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.230
as an argument,

48
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.090
so this function will be called for you by the browser once the location was fetched and then here if

49
00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.060
you enter this, you have to allow that the browser fetches your location and eventually, you'll get that

50
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.760
position object with your coords object in there where you can find out which coordinates the user has

51
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.310
and there's more in navigator.

52
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.420
Now it's impossible to cover all features in a course, so as always, I strongly recommend also using MDN

53
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.330
and just playing around with these features to learn more about what you can do there,

54
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.970
we'll also see some of these features being used throughout the course, so that will also be a nice way

55
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.450
of learning about what you can do there.

56
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.800
And with that we had a look at location and history which allow you to move your user around and find

57
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.070
out where the user is on and so on and navigator which allows you to interact with the machine, with the

58
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.120
browser itself

59
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.110
so to say, for example to get the position or to get some vague information about which browser the user

60
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.680
is using.
