00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.490
This is it for this module,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.040
this was a crucial module where you learned a lot about the basics of Javascript.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.930
You learned about the variables and constants which you create with let and const, about the differences

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.050
between declaring a variable or constant with let or const and initializing by assigning a value of

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.400
the equal sign.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.430
You learned about all operators like the equal sign to assign a value to a variable or the plus and minus

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.340
operator, multiplication,

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.080
these shorthand operators and also the increment and decrement operators if you remember. You learned

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.290
about functions which allow you to define code that can execute multiple times whenever you call the function

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.430
or also as we're doing it here,

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.760
whenever you click somewhere or whenever some event occurs for example which is something we'll also

12
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.120
dive way deeper into later throughout this course because we'll work a lot with the webpage and events

13
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.620
and so on there. You learned about how to manage data in general, how to pass data into functions, how

14
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.800
to work with parameters you receive in functions, how to write proper code, how to use the right syntax,

15
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.520
how to work with numbers and strings, how to work with objects and how to work with arrays which are

16
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.300
lists of data.

17
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.410
You also learned how to import your scripts properly which is of course important because you want to

18
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.210
optimize such things as well to ship the best possible experience to your users

19
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.660
and with all of that, you have a solid foundation for the next chapters in this course.

20
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.760
We're still only getting started,

21
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.980
there's so much more we can learn but it's super important that these basics are set.

22
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.270
So really make sure that all these concepts are clear,

23
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.160
also use the additional resources you find in this section, the attached resources, the attached lectures where

24
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.850
I also clarify and summarize the things, where you can also come back to if something is unclear at a

25
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.670
later point of time or if you forget something.

26
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.100
And with that, let's move on and dive deeper into some core features which you need in pretty much

27
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.010
any Javascript application you're going to build.
