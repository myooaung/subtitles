00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,060
So let's get started with this course and with everything you need to know about Javascript by diving

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,960
into this important question, what is Javascript?

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,420
Let's have a look at a couple of definitions.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,110
Javascript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,280
It can be executed as part of a web page in a browser or directly on any machine in a so-called host

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,000
environment.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,780
Okay, not entirely clear yet,

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,130
let's have a look at an additional definition.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,260
Javascript was created to make web pages more dynamic,

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:44,260
that's kind of the idea why Javascript was invented in the past you could say, more about the history

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,110
of Javascript in a second by the way.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:53,010
So it was invented to change the content on a page directly from inside the browser

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:59,500
and originally, it was called LiveScript but due to the popularity of Java back at the time, it was renamed

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,940
to Javascript to resemble Java by its name.

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,520
Javascript however is totally independent from Java,

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,180
that's important to understand and has nothing in common,

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,840
it really was just named Javascript because Java was popular and people who invented Javascript

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,490
wanted Javascript to be a thing I guess but I'm not sure, are these definitions really clear?

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,680
Do you now know what Javascript is?

20
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,900
Does dynamic, weakly typed compiled at runtime make web pages more dynamic?

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,060
Does this tell you something?

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,380
Well let's take a step back maybe,

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:45,040
how do web pages work? You are the user visiting a web page and when you do visit a web page, you use

24
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:51,740
browser for that. You use your client, your machine, your laptop, your computer, where you have a browser

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,940
installed on it,

26
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,140
you enter a URL or click on a search result on Google and the web page gets loaded,

27
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,480
To be precise when you initially visit a web page, a request is sent to the server,

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:12,560
so to a computer in the Internet where that web page, where the HTML file is hosted and that server

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:21,040
then loads that web page and sends it back to your browser in a so-called response and the most basic

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,580
form of response we know or we typically see and use when we work with the Internet,

31
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:35,080
when we visit a page is simply an HTML page which is sent back by the server to the client.

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,180
Now let's say on that loaded web page, let's say it's an online shop,

33
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,570
doesn't really matter,

34
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:47,310
the user clicks a button to submit a form, for example to order some products.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,520
Now this will then trigger a new request which is sent by the browser to the server to send this form

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,340
submission to the server and the server will handle the incoming request,

37
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:08,110
maybe store some order data in a database and once it's done, it will reply back with a new response,

38
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:15,610
with a new web page, a new HTML document which is sent back to the client, maybe the order confirmation

39
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,780
page. So this is how we interact with the web,

40
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,020
this is how web pages traditionally work.

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,610
Now Javascript helps us make this more reactive,

42
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:36,790
it helps us make a web page more reactive and skip that second request response flow in some circumstances

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,650
to instead change the already loaded page and do something there.
