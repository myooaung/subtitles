00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.320
So now that we're able to listen to changes in the attributes we of course can also adjust the content

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.660
we display in our tooltip text does is something we were not able to do before.

3
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.590
Well now we can.

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.020
Now let's keep in mind Dead show tooltip is responsible for showing some text here and we do actually

5
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:30.190
show the tooltip text the tooltip text on the other hand is a property which we set in a connected callback.

6
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:37.240
So now all we have to do is we have to update the tooltip text here when our attribute changes.

7
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:45.010
So I will first of all check if the old value is equal to the new value because that means it's kind

8
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.110
of triggered.

9
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.910
But maybe you entered a new value but it is exactly equal to the old value.

10
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.060
And in this case I'll just return I'll not execute any other code because I don't want to waste any

11
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.980
performance here.

12
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.970
I don't want to run any error code that would be redundant here because if the new value is equal to

13
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.270
the old value there is nothing that could have changed if this is not equal we'll make it into the next

14
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.840
step because now something changed and we want to update this.

15
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.080
And then here I'll check if the name of the attribute is equal to text.

16
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.540
We simply have to add our own logic here.

17
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.870
We have to be aware of which attributes could be changing and which matter for us and what do we want

18
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.610
to do when they change.

19
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.210
So here I know if the text attributes changed and yes we are only listening to changes in the text attribute

20
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.120
here but we could have more attributes we're listening to.

21
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.990
So it's a good practice to check this and if we know OK the text attribute changed then I know I want

22
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:53.800
to set my tooltip text here equal to the new value and of course logic you add here depends on what

23
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.820
your attribute does and what a change to it means for you.

24
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.970
You could also be required to add a new element to the shadow Dom here here.

25
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:11.530
I just need to change my tool to text because with that changed if I reload as a second time here I'd

26
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.450
see my default text of course and now I can add this as the adjusted text here and if I hit enter and

27
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.420
I hover over this question mark again we see the adjusted text here too because in our web component

28
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.810
we simply adjust our tool to text here when this text attribute changes.
