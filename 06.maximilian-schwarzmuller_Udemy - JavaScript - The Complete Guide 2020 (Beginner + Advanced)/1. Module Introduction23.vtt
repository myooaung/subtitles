00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.460
Now with our first steps taken and with some core basics out of the way which we need in any Javascript

2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.170
program, before we dive deeper into more basic features and more syntax and language features you need

3
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.990
to know,

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.780
let's have a look at debugging your code and at ensuring that you're able to efficiently work on your

5
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.750
code, that you're efficiently developing because that is important. When you're writing code,

6
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.650
you will encounter errors and therefore in this module, we'll have a look at how you find errors, how you

7
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.480
fix them, which different tools you have and which different kinds of errors

8
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.300
you might be encountering. Now in addition to that, it's of course also important that even if you're not

9
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.460
facing errors, you're productive and that means that you leverage the IDE or the editor you're working

10
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.100
with and that you're getting a lot out of it, that you're feeling comfortable writing code with the tools

11
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.670
you're working with and that overall, you have a smooth workflow and you're able to progress and to write

12
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.380
good code

13
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.780
and that also includes and that's the last thing we'll also have a look at in this module,

14
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.370
it also includes the you're able to find help and to know resources where you can dive deeper, where

15
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.270
you can learn more.

16
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.600
So these will be the blocks we'll have a look at this module.
