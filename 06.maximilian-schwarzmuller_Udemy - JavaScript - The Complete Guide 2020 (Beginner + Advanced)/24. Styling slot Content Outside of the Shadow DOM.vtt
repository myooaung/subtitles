00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.130
Now let's work a bit on the styling and the thing which I explained in the last lecture.

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.460
The fact that our slotted content is not actually part of the shadow Dom has one important implication.

3
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.210
If we go back to our old code I'm talking about these Web components texture of course.

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.560
It's not part of the shadow Dom as I now mentioned multiple times.

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.550
This means that I can styled is fruit delight Dom so fruit is styles set up in the light Dom and I want

6
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.150
to do exactly that right now just form it is a little bit.

7
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.250
And now you're you make it really clear that I can't style it from outside.

8
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.510
I'll wrap this in a span simply so that I have a tag a selector which I can use in my light Dom CSX

9
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.870
and I will give as a class of let's say highlight let's say this is a class we have in our default page

10
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.790
styles.

11
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.330
In this case here I have my highlight class selector and again really important to recognize that this

12
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.610
is now all happening in the light Dom.

13
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.660
This is not the scoped styling in the web component.

14
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.060
It's our normal styling in our normal page and that could of course all to be done in an external C

15
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.970
as as file and let's say for the highlight style here.

16
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.750
I typically assign a background color of yellow maybe not this yellow but maybe like a light lime yellow

17
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.170
here like this or actually so that you can see that it better.

18
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.680
Let me go with a light orange I get I guess that's a bit easier to see now when I save that and I reload

19
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.690
this page you see that this is getting this light orange background and again this is not some styling

20
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.060
set up in the web component it is general styling setup in my H female page.

21
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.150
And again this could also be in an external style file.

22
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.880
So my styles here still apply because this span here which holds my text is part of the light Dom not

23
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.210
the shadow Dom and I can make this even clearer if I dive into my tool tip and they are into the styling

24
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.630
for the shadow Dom and there.

25
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.300
Let me also add a highlight class selector now in the styles of the shadow Dom and let me give this

26
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.000
a background of red.

27
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.310
So here I have a background color so let's make this equal even though it would make a different.

28
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.090
But now a background color of does light orange in the light Dom in a background color of red in the

29
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.230
shadow Dom.

30
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.080
And please be aware or see that this is the exact same see us as selector.

31
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.190
So we have a class selector here too.

32
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.410
In the shadow Dom.

33
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.110
And now if I reload my page here we still have to Orange style.

34
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.880
And if we inspect this span here and we have a look at how the styling gets applied we see there also

35
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.520
is no other styling getting applied except for this orange background color.

36
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.190
So it's not like this would be overwriting the shadow Dom styles the shadow Dom style simply don't matter

37
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.220
here because it is not part of the shadow Dom and I'm just emphasizing this because this is so important

38
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.580
that has an important implication for styling.

39
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.870
Now of course though you could have the use case that you do want to style your slotted content from

40
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.350
inside the shadow Dom because your might be creating a web component that should very well set up some

41
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.500
default styling for the projected content.

42
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.360
So for the content that's passed into slots and how could you solve that then.
