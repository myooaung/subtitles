00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.370
Let's have a closer look at numbers and strings in this module.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.400
Now obviously we worked with both a lot throughout this course and we'll not start from scratch,

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.090
instead we'll have a tiny look behind the scenes and dive into some advanced features or features we

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.290
simply haven't really worked with thus far. To be precise in this module, we'll have a look at numbers,

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.120
how they are actually represented internally and why we sometimes end up with strange results in certain

6
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.570
calculations.

7
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.830
We'll have a look at the global number and math objects or constructor functions and what we can do with

8
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.430
those and we'll also dive into strings again and there, also revisit template literals because it

9
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.150
turns out with those we can do more than what we did thus far.
