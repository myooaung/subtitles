00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:10,320
Speaking of built-in types, there also is a global object type or a class and you can use that to create

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,060
objects,

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,740
indeed you can do new object like this.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:23,080
Now when you do that, object here in the end is just an empty object,

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:31,150
indeed new object like this is pretty much the same as doing this here, creating an object with an empty

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,760
object literal.

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:39,010
Now this here, the object literal is actually preferred because this is a little bit slower, both to type

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,020
and regarding the performance

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,090
and it doesn't yield an advantage here.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,320
It's just a built-in base class which will become a little bit more important in the next module,

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,860
typically you don't use it like that though. You might also remember that we did new array to create

12
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,070
a new array or that we could do that at least

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,920
but there also the literal notation is preferred and you got a couple of other built-in classes and

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,690
we'll see them from time to time throughout the course,

15
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,290
no worries.
