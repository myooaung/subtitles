00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:09,280
So what are web components web components really are just your own custom.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,160
H Tim L. elements HCM all elements that are not built into the browser but that are created by you as

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,100
a developer or by some other developer and you are now using them in your project.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,860
And what could be easier to dive into them than to just use such a custom Web component.

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,210
So let's have a quick look here.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,660
I have a simple index H html file and I opened it in visuals do you code.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,960
The idea I'm using in this course you can do this in your normal system text editor that really does

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,770
not matter.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,730
It's a normal HD him L5 skeleton we have here.

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,520
You'll find this exact file attached to this video in case you want to start with that too.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,120
But there is nothing special about this file.

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,170
Now in that file let's say we're creating an application where we want to show a modal so that info

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,550
box pop over overlay thing you see on many pages.

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,050
Now obviously we can create one from scratch.

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,660
We can add a dev here add some styling to the div and then write some javascript to conditionally show

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,280
and hide that div and also add a number div that can act as a backdrop.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,370
So this gray area behind the modal that blocks access to the rest of the page we can write all of that

18
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,050
but we can also create our own Web component for that or use a web component someone else created.

19
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,270
And here I created one for you.

20
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,760
And you also find data attached to this video.

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,920
There you will find this modal jazz file which you can just download and drag and drop into the same

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,470
folder as DHL file you created or you downloaded.

23
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,060
Now you can go through this file in the end.

24
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,440
Here we create or I created a so-called Web component a custom H html element and we will do this together

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,340
in this course.

26
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,050
This is taken directly from the course we will build this component later in the course.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,180
So I won't go through that right now.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,300
There is a lot of stuff in there we don't know yet.

29
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,770
And this video is not about understanding all of that.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,280
This video is about seeing what custom elements do or what such custom Web components do.

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,860
This web component the model here is in the end registered as a custom element with do you see modal

32
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,340
tag.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,560
That is what I can tell you right now about this code.

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,180
This creates a new age team attack that we can use in any file that imports this modal jazz file.

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,840
So let's do that.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,720
Let's add a script import here and the head section so that it gets loaded early and let's point at

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,190
that modal jazz file and for that it needs to be in the same folder.

38
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,430
As I just mentioned now with that imported we can use the U.S. modal element as if it were a normal

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,700
HDD him Al element.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,440
And of course this is not a built in element normally using this tag would do absolutely nothing because

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,400
the browser doesn't recognize that.

42
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,770
But it now does as my JavaScript file registers a custom element under this tack.

43
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,120
Now this modal happens to work in a way where we need to pass in some information between the opening

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,380
and closing tag.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,970
For example age 1 tag the modal title where we set the title of the modal and there we use a feature

46
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,760
called slots which you learn in detail throughout the course which tells that web component where to

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,930
position that content inside of the component.

48
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,480
So here I can say slot equals title because this is one of the reserved slots I have in this component.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,160
And now we also need some content that is shown below the title there I'll add a paragraph.

50
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:47,630
This is our first web component with this added If we now double click this index aged hymnal file you

51
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,940
will not see anything because the modal isn't opened right now.

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,040
You can open it by adding a special attribute to does using modal tag and Dad's all logic we added or

53
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,070
we will add in this modal jazz file so that is why this will work.

54
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,990
You can add the opened attribute.

55
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,190
Make sure to spell it right after you did this.

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,010
If you reload.

57
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,350
Hey here is a modal and you can even close that by clicking one of the buttons or clicking the backdrop

58
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,590
and you see we have a nice animation there too.

59
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,220
And this again is all stuff we will build throughout this course.

60
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,860
Now of course we can also open doors programmatically if we wanted to.

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:31,190
So instead of hard coding open in there we could add other scripts so other javascript code which is

62
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,260
not related to the web component which could be our normal application code for this web app we're creating

63
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,550
and there the cool thing is we can interact with our own custom elements just as with native HD him

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,640
elements.

65
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,090
So here I'm getting access to my mobile and I'll stored it isn't a constant named modal by the way I

66
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,070
will have a javascript refresher where I explain what concept is in case you don't know that.

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,620
And now I can use the normal Dom operations like document query selector to get access to an element

68
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,130
with a CSA as selector.

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,350
And here I will use U.S. modal my own tag as a selector and with that let's say we add a timeout here

70
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:16,160
and after three seconds I want to open the modal for Dad all add an anonymous function here an arrow

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,900
function in this case and there I can access my modal and call it open method and does open method all

72
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,260
the exists because I edit the logic for this method in this web component and we will do this together

73
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,030
later in the course.

74
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:35,690
So now with that if we reload there is nothing there but after three seconds you will see that modal

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,000
opening and you can still closed with the buttons and so on.

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,470
So this is how a web component works and what a web component is it is your own HDD him out element

77
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,100
which you can configure in the way you want behind the scenes.

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,670
Such a web component all the just uses native elements like divs or a header as you can see and we will

79
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,460
learn all of that step by step in the course but we can group that together add additional logic like

80
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,700
here.

81
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:08,420
The open method the open attribute and so on add special styling and add for example and animation and

82
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:16,910
hide that all under an HDMI old hack that we can dump into any project which imports this web component.

83
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,070
That is what web components are in a nutshell and that is what makes them awesome.

84
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:27,200
But now let's have a closer look at what makes up the web components specification and why we might

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,950
want to use them.
