00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,540
Let's dive into browser support.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,990
I talked about this a couple of times in the course already when we used one feature or another, I sometimes

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,120
mentioned that

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,380
this has better browser support,

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,890
this only works in modern browsers.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,970
Now in this module, I'll dive deeper into this,

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,320
I'll explain what exactly browser support is all about and why it matters and how you can ensure that

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,810
your code, your scripts work everywhere you want them to work. In detail,

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:39,140
we'll have a look at what exactly browser support means, what that is, how you can find out which kind

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,900
of browser support you need, which browsers you want to support in your application and how you can of

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,920
course also find out which features are supported in which browser.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,760
Now of course we'll not just find out which features work where but we'll also explore what you can do

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:03,770
to write an application, to write code that works in a broad variety of browsers or in all the browsers you

14
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,730
want to support and there, we'll dive into of things like feature detection and fallback code,

15
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,230
we'll have a look at polyfill, so what that is and

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:18,950
how that can help us and we'll have a look at code transpilation, which allows us to write modern

17
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,840
code and ship older code which works in older browsers as well.

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,950
So a lot of things to cover,

19
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,130
let's not waste any time and dive right in.
