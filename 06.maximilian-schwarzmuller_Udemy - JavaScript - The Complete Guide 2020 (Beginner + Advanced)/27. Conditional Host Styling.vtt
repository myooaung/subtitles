00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.420
Now let's take what we learned in the last lectures one step further What if we want to apply a default

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:19.870
style from inside our component but only if some condition is true on our custom element.

3
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.320
Let me give you an example let's say on this first tooltip here we added a class we might have done

4
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.910
this right from the start when you wrote our HMO document or maybe we did this programmatically when

5
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.290
our app runs a user clicks a button and we add a class to this element as we can do it with any HD him

6
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.580
element.

7
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.310
The class here is maybe important.

8
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.580
The name does not matter.

9
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.360
Let's say we added the important CSX class to our custom element.

10
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.710
Now we only want to set a background color on our custom element.

11
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.770
If that important class was set now what you can't do is you can't say colon host dot important.

12
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.450
This might be something you would think that we're X because that is how you'd normally combine multiple

13
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.830
selectors together in one rule if they all have to match simultaneously.

14
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.720
But here if we reload does actually has no effect.

15
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.750
As you can see on our custom element we now don't have any styling from inside our web component.

16
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.480
So this does not work.

17
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.300
Instead colon host is also used as a function.

18
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.910
If you have some condition for it so you then simply wrap your condition so the other C S S selectors.

19
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.020
That should be matching on your host element.

20
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.840
So on your custom tag and you add all these required selectors to the required conditions in parentheses

21
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.180
here and you can't have anything in there you can't have an attribute selector endure a class selector

22
00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.360
as we have it here an I.D. selector any kind of combinations.

23
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.820
Now with this syntax with host with the condition of also having the important class.

24
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.480
Now with that we get back this great background but only on the first web component here not on our

25
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.080
second one because we now required the presence of this important class and this is simply not the case

26
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.650
on this second component on the first one it is.

27
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.790
And in this style inspector here we indeed see this is responsible for setting this great background

28
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.200
and this is our host rule with the condition of also having the important C assess class on our custom

29
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.960
element.

30
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.780
So that is another very important very end of host that allows us to style things with way more flexibility.
