00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:08.380
Let's build up on our newly gained knowledge about asynchronous Javascript code execution and let's

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:16.110
dive into network requests and that means let's understand how we can utilize Javascript to send HttpRequests

3
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.680
kind of behind the scenes.

4
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.960
So in this module, we'll have a look at what exactly I mean by that and why we would do that

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.090
and of course also how we do that.

6
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.810
We'll then have a look at the two main ways we have for sending such requests, which would be using the

7
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.220
XMLHttpRequest object and the fetch API which is built into modern Javascript.

8
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.130
We'll have a look at how we transfer data between our clients, so between our browser side and the server

9
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.130
side and which different data formats we can use there, namely JSON data and FormData and we'll see

10
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.780
examples for how we can get data with get requests and post data with post requests

11
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.660
and in case it's not clear what get and post means, I'll also explain that in this module.
