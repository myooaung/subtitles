00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.740
Now before we actually start to work with any HTML elements, let's have a look at that document

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.820
and that window object.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.480
Now for that, attached you find a very basic starting project, essentially an empty HTML file and an

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.180
empty app.js file which is imported into that HTML file here

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.160
and if you open up that HTML file and you open up your browser developer tools and go to the console

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.620
there which allows you to also run some Javascript commands as you learned, then here you can simply

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.500
write document

8
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.600
and this gives you access to this document object.

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.270
Now by default, you'll see you get this strange representation which looks like HTML code here,

10
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.630
that's a little feature by the chrome dev tools,

11
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.060
this is actually a Javascript object but since it's tied to the loaded document, to that loaded HTML

12
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.050
code, it gives you this presentation where you can even select different parts if you hover over them

13
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.390
but to get a feeling or get a look into the real Javascript object, you can type console.dir document

14
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.850
and you can use console.dir in any cases where console.log gives you this strange output

15
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.410
in the dev tools

16
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.750
and now you get access to the real Javascript object with all the properties that are in there and you

17
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.110
see, there are a lot of properties in there.

18
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.670
Now most of them might never matter to you but for example, the body property here if you expose that

19
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.010
gives you access to entire new object which in the end reflects your document body and everything that's

20
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.280
attached to that

21
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.840
and this will also allow us to get access to all the HTML content rendered in there.

22
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.200
There are other properties which you can dive in, for example document element here is basically your

23
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.760
entire HTML content,

24
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.850
so the body gives you access to everything that was rendered in that body part age, HTML holds everything

25
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.530
that was rendered or set up for your entire HTML code which was rendered,

26
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160
so that's also another important property.

27
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.020
We also have a couple of other important properties, head for example unsurprisingly gives you access

28
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.290
to everything that was rendered as part of this head,

29
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.910
so together they kind of make up that entire HTML code as well of course and so on.

30
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.690
So there are a bunch of interesting things in there and we'll work with a couple of them

31
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.890
but there also are a lot of them which you will never really need but of course feel free to browse

32
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.440
through all of that in that document here,

33
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.320
this in the end is one of this important topmost objects which are made available to you by the browser

34
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.430
to allow you to interact with your loaded HTML document.

35
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.740
Now let's clear the console and let's also output window here, so you can type window here and you get

36
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.640
access to the window object.

37
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.740
Now this is that real topmost object and this gives you access to all the core APIs that the browser

38
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.130
wants to expose to you

39
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.340
and for example here you also find alert, a function which we already used a couple of times in this

40
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.590
course to throw such an alert.

41
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.260
The important thing is that with window, you by default if in your Javascript code, if you're running,

42
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.030
if you're typing some code here, you by default have access to everything in window which is why you

43
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.270
can just type alert like this. Totally correct would be window.alert as you see because window is this

44
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.570
topmost global object which is exposed to you by the browser and there, you have the alert functionality

45
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.280
but actually browsers always parse your Javascript code such that window.. is automatically added

46
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.900
in front of some function if that function can't be found anywhere else,

47
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.600
so the browser always looks in the window object if you're calling or accessing something, which is why

48
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.770
alert works just as well as window.alert would work here,

49
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.580
so that's really great.

50
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.060
So that window object is a really important global object giving you access to all these browser APIs

51
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.520
like alert, a bunch of other things which we haven't worked with yet and which we'll see later and also

52
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.730
the documents here.

53
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.640
This is the document I just output a second ago,

54
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.980
it's part of that window as I mentioned now

55
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.880
but as I also just mentioned, if you enter something just like this, the browser automatically looks in

56
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:16.350
the window, which is why we could use console.dir in the dev tools and we could also use it here

57
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.930
because that will automatically look in window.document. So you could use window.document but you

58
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.010
don't need to, the same for the alert.

59
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.560
So that's document which we have in here, a couple of other nice features which we'll see throughout the course

60
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.900
here to store data in the browser and so on, a couple of events which are exclusive to the window though

61
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.370
which fire when certain things happen in the window and these on something events here

62
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.890
by the way are just alternatives to using add event listener, something I'll dive deeper in the events

63
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.820
module of this course where we learn all about events and how to work with them and so on.

64
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.930
So there are a bunch of interesting things, here for example with outer height and outer width,

65
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.250
you see that this gives you certain dimensions about the window in which your app is running, your script

66
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.770
is running and also always keep in mind that the window does not really give you access to the

67
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.020
real window but also just to the tab in which your script is running, so you won't be able to use window

68
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.260
to interact with a totally different web page loaded in a different tab

69
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.350
because that would be a huge security issue if you could start reading information from another tab

70
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.970
on your web page here,

71
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.440
that would not be something you would want to do because you could fetch important information from

72
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.310
other tabs.

73
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.950
So whilst it's called window, it really just means the currently loaded tab but also the dimensions of

74
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.290
the general window and so on,

75
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.660
that's how you can think of it. So that's window and that's document

76
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.320
and no worries, we'll work with more of these things throughout the course to also see how we can get the size

77
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.120
of the web page and so on.

78
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.490
For now it's just important to keep in mind that you have these two global objects or that document

79
00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.310
actually is a part of the window but that you can access it with just document due to the way how window

80
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.140
works and that this will help us interact with the web page and with the loaded HTML code. And

81
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.750
with that,

82
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.040
let's dive deeper into that DOM thing and understand how the browser really translates the HTML code

83
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.430
to something and how we can then interact with that.
