1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:03,858
So now before we dive into the next module where
NOTE Confidence: 0.9216

2

00:00:03,938  -->  00:00:06,510
we dive right into the language.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9216

3

00:00:06,510  -->  00:00:09,460
Let me dive a bit deeper into the history.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9219

4

00:00:09,460  -->  00:00:13,100
Of JavaScript and where it's coming from and there.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9219

5

00:00:13,100  -->  00:00:16,050
Let's also have a look at that comparison between JavaScript.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9092

6

00:00:16,050  -->  00:00:20,095
Java again. Now Java and JavaScript are 2 totally independent
NOTE Confidence: 0.9092

7

00:00:20,161  -->  00:00:21,620
programming languages.
NOTE Confidence: 0.938

8

00:00:21,620  -->  00:00:25,743
That's really important, they have a totally different syntax different
NOTE Confidence: 0.938

9

00:00:25,801  -->  00:00:26,440
principles.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9382

10

00:00:26,440  -->  00:00:29,802
They have almost nothing in common besides the name I
NOTE Confidence: 0.9382

11

00:00:29,866  -->  00:00:30,500
would say,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9382

12

00:00:30,500  -->  00:00:35,150
although JavaScript runs in the browser and.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9094

13

00:00:35,150  -->  00:00:37,090
As learned all zinnober environments.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9094

14

00:00:37,090  -->  00:00:39,920
Java does not run in the browser.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9094

15

00:00:39,920  -->  00:00:41,940
You can use it on the server side.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9135

16

00:00:41,940  -->  00:00:45,264
To render HTML dynamically there and send it back to
NOTE Confidence: 0.9135

17

00:00:45,328  -->  00:00:47,757
users you can also use it in a non web
NOTE Confidence: 0.9135

18

00:00:47,821  -->  00:00:49,100
development context.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9381

19

00:00:49,100  -->  00:00:51,690
But it is not supported directly in the browser.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9381

20

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:54,837
You can't use it for the same things as you
NOTE Confidence: 0.9381

21

00:00:54,910  -->  00:00:56,300
can use JavaScript.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9143

22

00:00:56,300  -->  00:00:58,480
You also as I mentioned have different principles,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9143

23

00:00:58,480  -->  00:01:04,375
Java for example, is strictly object oriented and strongly typed
NOTE Confidence: 0.9143

24

00:01:04,467  -->  00:01:05,020
there.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9143

25

00:01:05,020  -->  00:01:07,582
You need to define which kind of data you're about
NOTE Confidence: 0.9143

26

00:01:07,634  -->  00:01:09,120
to store in a data container.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9058

27

00:01:09,120  -->  00:01:12,300
Where is JavaScript is really flexibel you don't have to
NOTE Confidence: 0.9058

28

00:01:12,357  -->  00:01:15,480
work with objects only there and will dive into object?
NOTE Confidence: 0.8446

29

00:01:15,480  -->  00:01:18,104
Orientation and what that means for out the course no
NOTE Confidence: 0.8446

30

00:01:18,154  -->  00:01:18,550
worries.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8598

31

00:01:18,550  -->  00:01:21,270
And it's also weakly typed as you learn.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8647

32

00:01:21,270  -->  00:01:23,880
Now JavaScript was named JavaScript to Yeah,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8647

33

00:01:23,880  -->  00:01:27,008
Well, you sound cool. You could say Becausw Java was
NOTE Confidence: 0.8647

34

00:01:27,068  -->  00:01:28,030
a big thing and.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9207

35

00:01:28,030  -->  00:01:30,910
JavaScript kind of was inspired by it,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9207

36

00:01:30,910  -->  00:01:34,110
but it's totally different than in the end and well.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9051

37

00:01:34,110  -->  00:01:38,011
People just wanted to. Have other people use JavaScript I
NOTE Confidence: 0.9051

38

00:01:38,079  -->  00:01:38,490
guess.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8998

39

00:01:38,490  -->  00:01:40,840
Java does not run the browser answer mentioned,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8998

40

00:01:40,840  -->  00:01:42,700
though, that's really important to keep in mind,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9275

41

00:01:42,700  -->  00:01:47,290
JavaScript does. And speaking about that differentiation between client side
NOTE Confidence: 0.9275

42

00:01:47,350  -->  00:01:51,276
and server side JavaScript clientside means in the browser server
NOTE Confidence: 0.9275

43

00:01:51,336  -->  00:01:53,510
side with the help of node JS means.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9278

44

00:01:53,510  -->  00:01:55,630
On a machine that is connected to the Internet,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9278

45

00:01:55,630  -->  00:01:57,530
which might be serving webpages,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9278

46

00:01:57,530  -->  00:01:58,980
but which doesn't run code.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9145

47

00:01:58,980  -->  00:02:02,079
Directly on the machines of the end users and the
NOTE Confidence: 0.9145

48

00:02:02,142  -->  00:02:05,430
client side part is really the origin of JavaScript.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9269

49

00:02:05,430  -->  00:02:09,545
And as you learn different browser vendors so different companies
NOTE Confidence: 0.9269

50

00:02:09,608  -->  00:02:14,610
developing browsers provide their own JavaScript execution engines for example,
NOTE Confidence: 0.8784

51

00:02:14,610  -->  00:02:18,688
DV8. Engin that's the name of the JavaScript engine Chrome
NOTE Confidence: 0.8784

52

00:02:18,758  -->  00:02:19,180
users.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9482

53

00:02:19,180  -->  00:02:21,640
And the important thing there is that in the browser.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9482

54

00:02:21,640  -->  00:02:24,430
You are able to interact with the web page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9273

55

00:02:24,430  -->  00:02:28,460
From inside JavaScript you can manipulate the loaded web page.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9273

56

00:02:28,460  -->  00:02:31,640
You can also use certain browser features so called.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9112

57

00:02:31,640  -->  00:02:35,070
APIs for example, to get the user location on the
NOTE Confidence: 0.9112

58

00:02:35,140  -->  00:02:35,980
server side.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9112

59

00:02:35,980  -->  00:02:37,240
The idea was to well,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9112

60

00:02:37,240  -->  00:02:39,350
extract the engine out of the browser.
NOTE Confidence: 0.913

61

00:02:39,350  -->  00:02:42,150
And allow you to run it outside of the browser.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9193

62

00:02:42,150  -->  00:02:44,370
So that you can reuse your JavaScript knowledge,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9193

63

00:02:44,370  -->  00:02:47,090
but now use JavaScript for different tasks.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9006

64

00:02:47,090  -->  00:02:50,314
And you can now run JavaScript anywhere with no chance
NOTE Confidence: 0.9006

65

00:02:50,374  -->  00:02:51,090
for example,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9006

66

00:02:51,090  -->  00:02:52,630
in a server side and there,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9006

67

00:02:52,630  -->  00:02:54,320
you have special our features.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9066

68

00:02:54,320  -->  00:02:57,340
Our APIs you can tap in for example,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9066

69

00:02:57,340  -->  00:03:01,232
to work with the file system or handle incoming HTTP
NOTE Confidence: 0.9066

70

00:03:01,306  -->  00:03:01,980
requests.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9138

71

00:03:01,980  -->  00:03:06,303
Now the syntax concepts, and core features are exactly the
NOTE Confidence: 0.9138

72

00:03:06,377  -->  00:03:06,750
same,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9138

73

00:03:06,750  -->  00:03:09,340
though there for what you learn in this course.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8965

74

00:03:09,340  -->  00:03:13,440
Where we primarily focus on the browser side since simply
NOTE Confidence: 0.8965

75

00:03:13,512  -->  00:03:16,030
also easier and more visual to use?
NOTE Confidence: 0.9081

76

00:03:16,030  -->  00:03:19,395
Are the same would you learn in the browser applies
NOTE Confidence: 0.9081

77

00:03:19,461  -->  00:03:22,430
to node JS in our environments as well as you
NOTE Confidence: 0.9081

78

00:03:22,496  -->  00:03:23,420
will also see?
NOTE Confidence: 0.8976

79

00:03:23,420  -->  00:03:26,080
In the node JS section so that's why we start
NOTE Confidence: 0.8976

80

00:03:26,139  -->  00:03:27,440
with the browser side.
NOTE Confidence: 0.8976

81

00:03:27,440  -->  00:03:31,390
It's JavaScript origene. There are no alternatives to JavaScript.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9372

82

00:03:31,390  -->  00:03:34,793
Browser so you might not be interested in using JavaScript
NOTE Confidence: 0.9372

83

00:03:34,852  -->  00:03:37,610
on a server if you are interested in front end.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9156

84

00:03:37,610  -->  00:03:41,096
Browser side web development, though you have to learn JavaScript
NOTE Confidence: 0.9156

85

00:03:41,150  -->  00:03:43,510
cause that is the only programming language,
NOTE Confidence: 0.9156

86

00:03:43,510  -->  00:03:45,390
you can use there in the end.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9091

87

00:03:45,390  -->  00:03:49,079
You can then transfer your knowledge becaus node JS uses
NOTE Confidence: 0.9091

88

00:03:49,145  -->  00:03:52,372
the same syntax so you easily learn node JS after
NOTE Confidence: 0.9091

89

00:03:52,438  -->  00:03:54,480
learning JavaScript in general.
NOTE Confidence: 0.9257

90

00:03:54,480  -->  00:03:57,225
Or in the browser. And it's more fun to learn
NOTE Confidence: 0.9257

91

00:03:57,286  -->  00:03:59,970
JavaScript if you see something on the page.
