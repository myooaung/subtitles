00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:09.370
Now with the life cycle methods all your elements explained it should be clear why append child causes

2
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.940
an error here in the constructor the element has been created but it has not been added to the DOM yet

3
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:24.030
and therefore trying to append a child which tries to append it to the real Dom will fail.

4
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.880
Instead you should add D connected callback method here and make sure you spelled is right because the

5
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.450
browser will look for exactly that method spelled exactly like that.

6
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.830
It is case sensitive so make sure you have a capital C in there but a lowercase c at the beginning.

7
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.160
And now we can grab all that code here.

8
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.630
Well we want to append a child to where we create the child.

9
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.990
We can move that into the connected callback but with that no ever changes.

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.630
If I now save dead it then reload this page.

11
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.200
Now you see we get no error and we see our question mark be rendered here at the beginning.

12
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.940
Now obviously it's added in front of our web components text and not offer it and that is not the place

13
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.250
where we want to have it.

14
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.220
I'll come back to how it ends up there later but at least you can see we can now render something without

15
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.090
errors and the key takeaway which already shows a little bit of the use.

16
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.010
Custom components give us is that this question mark is not part of our H2 Matlab markup here but it's

17
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:43.660
really something that is controlled by our web component and again will add more usefulness to that

18
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.660
and more features over the next lectures.

19
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.430
But this is now a crucial first step and it's all important to understand that we are using the connected

20
00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.790
callback here because we are accessing the Dom and our element has only been mounted onto the real Dom.

21
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.950
When this method gets called.
