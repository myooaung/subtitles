00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,260
In this module we'll have a look at programming paradigms,

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,270
what this means and most importantly, three important programming paradigms

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:18,080
you could use when writing Javascript code. We'll have a look at procedural, functional and object oriented

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,970
programming

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,550
and what that means for you and how code would look like if you followed one of these paradigms. Specifically

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,270
as I said, we'll first clarify what exactly programming paradigms are

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,070
before we then have a closer look at procedural, functional and last but not least, object oriented programming.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,170
You already learned the basics you need for all these paradigms throughout this course,

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,520
now we'll have a look at what exactly such a paradigm is and when you use which.
