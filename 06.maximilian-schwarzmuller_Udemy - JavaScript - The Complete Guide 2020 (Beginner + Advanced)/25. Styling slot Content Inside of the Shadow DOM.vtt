00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.800
Well if you want to style slotted content there is a special selector you can use inside your web component.

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:19.860
So inside your shadow Dom styling and that is a special pseudo selector colon colon slot it dismal select

3
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:28.250
all slotted content and the way it works is that you call this like a function here is the CSX and could

4
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.890
you pass the selector off the slot content.

5
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.630
So now you could say I want to select all slotted content that has the highlight class or all slotted

6
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.030
content that is a span or an anchor tag so anything like that.

7
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.200
Important though you can only select the slotted content itself.

8
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.580
So if for example in my slot at content here in this span I also had an anchor tag in there.

9
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:03.770
Then what you could not do you could not select slot it and then the spandex would still work because

10
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.310
the slot of content is the span but you can select a child element in the top level slot that content.

11
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.990
So this would not style the anchor tag in your slot at span because you can only select the topmost

12
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.260
element for styling.

13
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.370
This is an important restriction you have here.

14
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.300
So if you have nested content you can't select this but you can select a span or since this is also

15
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.170
directly on the slotted content in our case here.

16
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:38.540
Do you highlight class and then here what we could do is we could give us a border bottom of one pixel

17
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.260
dotted and read for example save that and go back and reload this page and you will see this slight

18
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.270
red border here.

19
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.340
And if I inspect this again.

20
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.210
You see here is our style and getting applied.

21
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.610
The border bottom is having effect here.

22
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.270
Still important to highlight the order of the styles here.

23
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.290
The styling you set up in the light Dom will overwrite your slotted styling use setup in the shadow

24
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.650
Dom.

25
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.560
And the idea here simply is that you always want to give the user the final say on how things should

26
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.820
look like but you can set up some default styling you want to have as we do it here.

27
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.850
But if we were to set a broader bottom in the light Dom too.

28
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.310
So in our case for the highlight clause if I had a broader bottom of let's say two pixels solid and

29
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.700
blue here then you would see that if we reload this page we see that border instead of our red dotted

30
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.400
border because whilst this rules still gets applied it gets overwritten here.

31
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:51.020
So this passivity in see us s is such that light Dom styling overrides shadow Dom styling for projected

32
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.210
or slotted content.

33
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.070
This is just one thing to be aware of.

34
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.960
I will comment this out here in the light on because I don't want to override this.

35
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.880
I want to have my red dotted border but it is something you would definitely have to be aware of.

36
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.710
This can be overwritten from inside the light.

37
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.060
Don.
