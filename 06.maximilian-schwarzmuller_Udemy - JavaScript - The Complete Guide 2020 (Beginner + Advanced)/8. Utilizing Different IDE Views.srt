1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,070
Now last but not least, in Visual Studio Code, under view,

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,460
you also got these different modes here.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,100
I showed you the extensions view which allows you browse extensions,

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,020
explorer is that view you see here which is the view you typically work in the most,

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,740
it allows you to see your files here on the left.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,410
Search can also be very helpful though, search allows you to search through all your files and you can

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,780
change how it searches

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:34,130
for example if it searches in a case sensitive way here and there, I could search for write to log and

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,010
if I do that,

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,930
it shows me that it found this write to log thing in five places all in app.js

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,550
and if I click on there, it highlights it here,

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,250
it also highlights all the results here in the scroll bar on the right.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,040
So this can also be very helpful.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,380
Now under view, you also have the scm view,

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,410
now that helps you with source control,

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,800
so when you're using Git, then you see what you've changed since your last commit

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,730
and you can inspect what you changed here and commit that and so on.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:13,060
So if you want to have a graphical user interface for source control, you can use this and debug is a

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,390
mode

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,270
I'll come back to later in this module once we dive into debugging our code.

21
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:23,530
This can be really helpful with understanding our code, how it executes and can help us find and fix

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,820
errors.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,990
So that's Visual Studio Code and working with the IDE and I hope it gave you a general idea of what

24
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:38,080
you can configure there, what you might want to think about and what you might want to explore to work

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,790
with your code effectively.
