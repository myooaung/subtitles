00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.520
And that's it for React for now.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.380
I could dive in way deeper but as I said, this is no React course and it shouldn't become one.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.810
You can definitely learn React in way greater detail with my course, with my standalone React

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.030
course and if that way of building applications is interesting to you,

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.810
you definitely should.

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.620
The huge advantages that you can focus on the what and on your business logic and not on the how,

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.310
you don't need to do that detailed access to change something in the DOM,

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.370
you don't need to manually take care that you got all the code set up correctly for interacting with

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.240
the DOM,

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.230
instead you define the end result and your different pieces of state and data that are used there and

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.740
then it's React's job to update this DOM correctly

12
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.910
and the same logic is used in Angular and Vue by the way.

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.630
They have a different syntax,

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.650
they have some additional features and a totally different way of implementing this you could say

15
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.520
but the general idea of having this declarative approach where you define the result you want to have

16
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.950
and not the way to get there is the same.

17
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.130
So definitely check out these frameworks for bigger Javascript projects where a large chunk of your

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.210
UI or maybe all of it should be managed with Javascript, such frameworks really take a lot of

19
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.720
work off you and give you way more time and power to focus on what matters to your users instead of

20
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.820
focusing on these nitty-gritty details.
