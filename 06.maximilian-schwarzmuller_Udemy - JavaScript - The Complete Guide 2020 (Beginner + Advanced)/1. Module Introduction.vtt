00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.190
Now that we did have a close look at objects,

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.020
it's time to dive even deeper into objects and not so much into that object literal notation with which

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.740
we worked and into different syntax features like destructuring which we already had a look at but

4
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.890
instead we'll dive into a brand new feature, into a brand new syntax which is related to a general programming

5
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.070
concept that is called Object Oriented Programming.

6
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.510
Now in this module, we'll of course have a look at what object oriented programming is and why we would

7
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.140
want to use it and how we can use it in a Javascript application of course and to use it or to build

8
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.780
an application with this OOP approach but also in general, to have a nicer time when working with objects,

9
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.540
we'll have a look at so-called classes and then instances

10
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.410
and of course I'll explain what both things are and how we work with them.

11
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.200
Now related to that, we'll revisit the idea behind properties,

12
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.790
we'll learn about fields which are not that new as you will see and we'll of course also revist

13
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.010
methods because classes as you will learn will help us with creating objects and therefore we'll have

14
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.360
to have a look at properties and methods again to understand how we work with these things in classes.

15
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.460
Now we'll also dive into a concept called inheritance later in this module then because that also as

16
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.750
you will see can be very useful when you're building more complex applications with Javascript.

17
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.670
Now we'll have a look at all these things in a little demo application so that it's easier to grasp

18
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.500
why we use these things or why we use these concepts and how we apply them to real problems and with

19
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.820
that, let's dive right in.
