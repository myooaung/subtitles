00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:09.270
Now for that, we need a basic website where we can use Javascript and I'm using a website here

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.940
and I'm not running Javascript on the server as I also mentioned in the first course module because

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.700
I find it more interesting to learn Javascript if you can see something visual on the screen and a website

4
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.260
is something visual

5
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.820
which is why I'll use that. Now for that, for this basic website, attached you'll find a starting project,

6
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.360
the starting code which you should download and extract and then pull into a folder which you then open

7
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.380
with your favorite IDE or a code editor,

8
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.370
in my case I'm using Visual Studio Code which is the tool I explained in the first course module set up

9
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.630
as I explained there,

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.070
so I'm just using the set up and that tool I explained in the first course module.

11
00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.620
So open the extracted attachment with that tool here by going to file open and you should then find

12
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.370
a folder structure that looks like this.

13
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.360
Now one important note, the .vscode folder might not be there in your setup,

14
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.780
this is just a folder created by my IDE, by Visual Studio Code to manage some settings, in this case

15
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.090
the zoom level which I set so that you can clearly see all the code I write, so that's not something you

16
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.290
have typically and gitignore,

17
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.450
I have this because I am also working with Git

18
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.640
which is a source control management system and you don't need to use that, you don't even need to know

19
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.330
what that is to follow along, it has nothing to do with Javascript,

20
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.700
after this lecture you find a basic introduction to it but you can also skip this for now and come back

21
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.530
to it later,

22
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.990
it's not required, not directly related to Javascript.

23
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.440
So what you should have in here is this index.html file with a basic HTML skeleton,

24
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.120
nothing too fancy in there,

25
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.790
I'm pulling in some fonts linking to the stylesheet which you'll find in the assets folder in the style

26
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.230
subfolder and then we have this basic skeleton down there and in the script section, you find one starting

27
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:14.620
script. You can look into it and there's a bunch of code which probably won't tell you much, which I provide

28
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.460
to you because this script actually includes some features which we don't really know yet, which we also

29
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.700
won't fully understand by the end of this module which is why I provide it instead of writing it together

30
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.250
with you but which we'll of course be able to understand later in the course but we need that to get

31
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.230
something out on the screen and see something on the screen and not just have a boring application where

32
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.330
nothing changes.

33
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.200
Hence I provide this to you, for the moment you can just ignore this. take it for granted and this will

34
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.720
all make sense a bit more by the end of this module and ultimately way more later down into the course

35
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.750
but of course we'll learn more than just that,

36
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.970
this is just some starting script which we need.

37
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.420
So that's what we got,

38
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.400
now you can double click that file here, not in the IDE though but instead in your normal windows explorer

39
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.970
or Mac finder. So there, simply double click that index.html file and it will open up a brand new

40
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.730
window in the browser which should actually yield this interface.

41
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.830
Now, this is a basic calculator which will work a bit different than most calculators you're used to

42
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.100
but nonetheless which we'll work on throughout this module.

43
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.130
Now for the moment, you can type and hit what enter you want,

44
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.660
nothing happens here because we'll write this logic together and by writing this logic or whilst writing

45
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:46.310
it, we'll dive into the basic Javascript features. So that is what we'll build, this calculator here and

46
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.770
now to build it,

47
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.070
let's start writing some Javascript code because we need some logic that runs here with that page being

48
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.070
loaded in the background so to say to interact when the user presses one of the buttons and to update

49
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.780
the result which we see down there and so on and that's what we need Javascript for

50
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.090
because with just HTML

51
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.290
and CSS,

52
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.520
we can't add this in the browser dynamic logic.

53
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.610
As you learned in the first course module, you need Javascript for dynamic features or for dynamic actions

54
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.940
like this and that's exactly what we'll dive into in this module

55
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.390
therefore.
