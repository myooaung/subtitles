00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,150
I already outlined it in the introduction video,

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,230
there are effectively three parts

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,300
that we'll have a look at in this course module.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,020
The first part I want to have a look at is how you can write code efficiently

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:24,410
and with that, I don't really or don't necessarily mean that you can write code as quickly as possible

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:30,080
but I mean that you are able to really get a lot out of the tools you're working with,

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,510
that you know how to write code without too much copy pasting or manual work.

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:44,510
Now the next block we'll then have a look at is how you can find help because in programming, even if

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:51,830
you took many courses, even if you've been a developer for many years, you'll always encounter scenarios

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:59,780
or use cases where you're not sure how to solve something or where you know there was a feature in Javascript,

11
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,500
some built-in function that allows me to do that but I can't remember that function,

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,820
I don't recall how it worked in detail and that's totally normal.

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:18,490
When becoming a developer, the goal is not to learn all features and all the commands by heart,

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,040
that will be impossible not only because there are a lot of commands to learn but also because programming

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,200
languages evolve and new features are being added. So don't take this course or any other resource as a

16
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:39,860
I have to learn it by heart to resource, rather learn how a language generally works and how you have

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,230
to think about writing code and then also know where to find help and where to dive deeper if you need

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:52,260
a specific feature or a specific command and that's also something I'll explore with you in this module.

19
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:58,460
And the last block is that you need to be able to debug your code, you will encounter errors and therefore

20
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,180
it is important for you to be able to find and fix these errors.

21
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,720
So if we talk about writing code efficiently, what exactly does that mean?

22
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,430
It means that you should work in a productive environment, now

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,510
with that, I'm talking about the environment on your machine, not the environment you're working in.

24
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,820
Of course that should also be productive but that's something you'll have to figure out, where you work,

25
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,590
in which office and you might also not be able to control this if you for example are employed.

26
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:32,340
So I'm talking about the IDE, the editor and about configuring it such that you like working with it.

27
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,590
That also includes that you use the editor or the IDE to its fullest potential, that you're able to

28
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,990
auto format your code so that you don't manually have to indent things and so on,

29
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,730
that you use important shortcuts.

30
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,080
It also of course means that you take advantage of the auto completion,

31
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,100
the hints many editors and IDEs give you, Visual Studio Code

32
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,840
the IDE I recommend for this course certainly does so.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,400
And of course it also means that you keep your eyes open for editor extensions and for the settings you

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
can tweak there to really adjust everything in the way you like to have it.

35
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,720
So let's have a look at that and let's explore some of the things I would recommend that you look into

36
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,610
and that you get started with.
