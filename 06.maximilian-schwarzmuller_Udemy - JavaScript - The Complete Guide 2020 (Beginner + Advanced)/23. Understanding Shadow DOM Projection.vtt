00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.020
Before we dive into anything you let me come back to the project award the examples we worked on and

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.490
there specifically I want to have a look at our tooltip again.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.960
Now keep in mind this year is an example for our tooltip here.

4
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.860
There's web components thing.

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.210
And of course here indeed developer tools to Google Chrome developer tools and the elements tab we can

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.640
see our own custom element here.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.960
We see the text attribute.

8
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.120
We see the style we assign directly to it.

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.420
And that is also something we'll change a little bit the way we do that.

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.550
And we see our shadow roots here and conveniently the chrome DAF tools also highlight all the shadow

11
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.760
Dom with this light gray background.

12
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.900
Now one interesting thing to see here and I am not sure if you noticed that before is the fact that

13
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.370
web components.

14
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.600
So this part which actually gets pulled into this slot.

15
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.890
Right.

16
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.520
Because web components occurs before our question mark.

17
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.060
So technically it gets pulled into that slot even though it gets pulled in there.

18
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.360
We see it's not part of the shadow on right.

19
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.250
Web components here in the dorm tree as part of the light dorm.

20
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.350
It's a sibling of the shadow root and that is something crucial I want you to understand with slots

21
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.760
you can project content into your shadow dom.

22
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.160
So you got an entry point into your shadow Dom from the light dom.

23
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.640
So to say but you don't technically move the element into the shadow Dom the browser justice plays it

24
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.260
as if it were part of it but actually it's rendered differently in the DOM and you can see that here

25
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.700
by the fact or you can tell by the fact that we still have our slot element here.

26
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.750
You see our default which is not actually getting redder because we passed our own text here and we

27
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.230
see that it points at some other content in this case it points at some text and you click on reveal

28
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.220
here by the way you also jump 2D content that gets displayed in that place.

29
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.610
But technically it's not moved in there.

30
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.590
The Dom note is not moved into the shadow Dom and that is one crucial thing I want you to understand

31
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.440
and I want you to be aware of because that really is important to get right and to be aware of.
