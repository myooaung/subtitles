00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.340
So that's it for this tiny application,

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.140
quite some code which we wrote, also of course verbose code because I wanted to practice what we learned

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.970
in this module, show you different alternatives of doing certain things as we will through this course,

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.610
there certainly are some things we can solve in a more elegant way but that's certainly not to mean

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.580
that what you learned here is not something you would use. Indeed, what you learned here is the bread

6
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.130
and butter of working with Javascript, being able to select elements in different ways, being able to

7
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.510
traverse the DOM, select child elements, change styles, assign classes, remove and add elements, swap elements,

8
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.710
these are all things which you will need in almost any real Javascript application you're going to build.

9
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.620
So this here is super important and shows you many ways of adding elements, of working with elements

10
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.760
in the DOM.

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.970
Now throughout this entire module, you learned about many ways of selecting elements, of deleting and

12
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.750
adding them, of manipulating them,

13
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.260
you learned about different types of nodes, you learned about the difference of attributes and properties

14
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.750
and many more important things.

15
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.180
Now I would definitely encourage you that you practice these things, that you simply play around with

16
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.770
the different techniques,

17
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.300
create a simple HTML file and start selecting elements in different ways,

18
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.840
start manipulating them. Dive into MDN to find out what you can do with the HTML elements you

19
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.970
got, what you can do with a button, what you can do with a div and get a feeling for how you work with

20
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.810
the DOM.

21
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.480
We'll also dive into that again later to dive deeper into more advanced concepts,

22
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.650
for example where we dive into how to find out which size an element has and to move it around

23
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.850
but we already covered all the crucial fundamentals which you need to work with elements and manipulate

24
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.190
a page whilst it's running in the browser.
