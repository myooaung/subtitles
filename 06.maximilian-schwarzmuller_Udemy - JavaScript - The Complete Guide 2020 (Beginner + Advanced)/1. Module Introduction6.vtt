00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.830
As part of this course, we already worked with events, for example the click event which we listened to

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.360
on buttons.

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.630
Now there are more events we can listen to and events in general are an important thing in Javascript,

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.870
not just when working with Javascript in the browser but in Javascript in general, though in this module,

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.220
again I will focus on the browser side Javascript,

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820
you'll get an idea for how we listen to events

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.050
in Node.js for example, in the Node.js module later down in the course and I will show you to which

8
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.800
kind of events you can listen,

9
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.400
which data you will get there and how to work with that data and also how to control the behavior of

10
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.240
events.

11
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.900
We'll also finish this module by going back to our projects project where we switched projects

12
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.620
between these two lists which we worked on in an earlier module and we'll implement drag and drop there.

13
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.720
So specifically in this module, we'll have a look at events, what they are, how they work, which data

14
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.950
they yield to us,

15
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.660
we'll then also as I mentioned have a look at how we can control their behavior, specifically how we

16
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.580
can control what they do and how they propagate and what event propagation actually means

17
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.740
and as I also mentioned, we'll implement an example with drag and drop which is a nice user interface

18
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.580
pattern that you might need in many applications

19
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.320
and it is all powered by events which are built into the browser or which are exposed by the browser.
