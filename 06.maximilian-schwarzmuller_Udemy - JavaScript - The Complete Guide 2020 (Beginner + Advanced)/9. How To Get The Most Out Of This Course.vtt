00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.490
I also want to make sure that you get the most out of this course though and for that, of course you

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.450
should watch the videos. Watch them at your speed, use the playback controls, the speed controls in the

3
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.620
video player to speed me up if I'm going too slow for your taste in a certain video or on a certain concept

4
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.310
but also slow me down if you need more time,

5
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.060
also pause and rewind

6
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.000
if a certain concept is not clear yet. It's a video on-demand course

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.560
so take advantage of that, 

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.350
you can watch a video more than once, this is absolutely fine.

9
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.050
Also code along, pause and rewind as I said

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.110
if I'm going too fast and also pause regularly to try implementing what I'm about to implement

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.660
on your own first,

12
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.160
this is the best way of practicing.

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.100
I also got tons of quizzes in this course which you can use because practicing of course is important,

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.330
so do the assignments you find,

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.410
follow along in the practice projects we dive into and do the quizzes to check your knowledge and make

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.440
sure that we're all on the same page.

17
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.400
Also of course if you're facing errors, if something does not work as expected, use the knowledge you

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.880
gained in the development and debugging section and debug your code, search for errors and also search

19
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.270
for solutions. You can use the attached code snippets which you find attached to multiple lectures per

20
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.120
module and always to the last lecture of each module, to compare your code to mine.

21
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.130
If something is not working as shown in the video, chances are that there is a difference in code and

22
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.380
comparing code is what you should do in that case to find and fix the error.

23
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.920
You can also replace your code step-by-step with mine temporarily to narrow down the issue but also

24
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.180
google error messages if you find them and use the search built into the Udemy course player, that allows

25
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.080
you to also find many common issues and fix them on your own.

26
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.760
But of course if you're stuck or if some concept is unclear and you're not able to proceed on your own,

27
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.470
also ask and answer. You have a Q & A section this course and there, you can ask questions and I will

28
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.710
read and reply there regularly but also use it to help others because you will learn the most if

29
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.460
you don't just ask but if you solve problems on your own

30
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.450
and if you also help others solve problems because that forces you to think about an issue and find

31
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.190
a solution

32
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.740
and that ultimately is always how you learn the most.
