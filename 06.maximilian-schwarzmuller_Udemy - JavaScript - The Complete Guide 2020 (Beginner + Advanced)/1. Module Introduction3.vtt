00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.230
We had a look at classes and object oriented programming in the last module, in this module, we'll have

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:16.150
a look behind the scenes of that because it turns out that this class feature, this class keyword is

3
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.430
relatively new in Javascript,

4
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.420
the idea of working with objects and of having blueprints for these objects as well as having dependencies

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.810
with inheritance is not new however.

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.480
So in this module, we'll have a look at how we did that in the past because as you will see, it will also

7
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.720
help us understand the present and some of the pitfalls

8
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.110
there a bit better, to be precise in this module, we'll have a look at behind the scenes of classes

9
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.740
and objects

10
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.840
as I mentioned, we'll explore constructor functions which is a way of building objects based on blueprints

11
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.210
without classes,

12
00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.720
it actually is what classes do behind the scenes and we'll have a look at prototypes and a concept called

13
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.210
prototypical inheritance which is what the extends keyword when you use inheritance with classes does

14
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.530
behind the scenes basically.

15
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.500
It's super important to understand the concepts taught in this module because they are a core of Javascript,

16
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.250
will be subject of many Javascript interviews and every Javascript developers should understand these

17
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.120
concepts

18
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.000
since they are such an important part of the language and of the behind the scenes stuff that happens

19
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.690
in the language.
