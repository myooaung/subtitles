00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.480
Now we added a lot of cool things to our a little bit more complex component here.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.430
Now let's wrap this all up by changing the styling a little bit by making sure that we all can close

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.310
the model when we click the backdrop.

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.640
And by also animating the model a little bit when it comes in and goes away no Definitely feel free

5
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.300
to do some of these things on your own past a video tried on your own at this point.

6
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.250
Otherwise we'll do it together of course.

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.870
So where are you successful.

8
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.460
Let's give this a try.

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.870
Let's start with a click listener on the backdrop which closes the model.

10
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.810
Now this shouldn't be too hard right in our modal component.

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.850
The backdrop in the end is this element with the IED backdrop.

12
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.790
So all we have to do is selected and then added event listener.

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:02.610
So here I will select my backdrop with this shadow root queries selector and then hashtag backdrop because

14
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.950
again we have that I.D. backdrop on that death and now I just need to add an event listener and I'll

15
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.450
do that here next to my button event listeners.

16
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.200
They're all X as my backdrop.

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.410
And add an event listener add a click listener of course and in the end here I want to do the same which

18
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.470
I do when I click to cancel button because in the end we cancel the model when we click the backdrop.

19
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.300
So we'll use this cancel method here as an event handler bind this.

20
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.670
So we'll do exactly the same as I do for the cancel button.

21
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.840
And with this change it should already work.

22
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.300
Fine I'll go back openness click somewhere on the backdrop and it closes this nice.

23
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.100
Now I want to work a little bit on the styling one to decrease the amount of whitespace we have up there.

24
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.540
Maybe add a line below our header.

25
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.250
So for that I'll go into my styling here.

26
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.980
Now for the line I'll add a border bottom here on my header which wraps my well header content at the

27
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.640
end.

28
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.940
And that should be one pixel solid and CCC.

29
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.430
So this is a light gray.

30
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.840
It's the same light gray I have as a border top.

31
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:22.000
On the actions end to reduce the amount of whitespace for a slot at age 1 content which brings extra

32
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.960
margins.

33
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:32.210
I'll set the margins of that age one tag to zero and now if that the reload does looks much nicer.

34
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.900
So this is now the look I want to have last but not least let's add a tiny animation CSX transition

35
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.260
to be precise.

36
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.170
And for that the modal itself should be animated when it comes in.

37
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:54.330
So to do that I want to have it slide in from the top and go from opacity 0 to opacity 1 over let's

38
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:03.570
say 300 milliseconds so actually reduce the top distance here to 10 VH instead of 15 which I had before.

39
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.240
Opacity already is set to Sierra initially.

40
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.300
And then when we show it which of course is the case here I want to estimate that now for that I will

41
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.110
actually add an extra rule here forward.

42
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.730
You opened a state or my model where I also set top to 15 the age.

43
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.290
I can't do this and this combined rule because the backdrop should not be moved down.

44
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.790
So here does this basically the end state opacity one point prevents all.

45
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.200
And then for the modal also in addition top set to 15 VH.

46
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.560
So it is pushed down further than it is initially when it is invisible and now so that we can see that

47
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.400
change.

48
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.000
I'll add.

49
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.690
De transition property to the motel and they're all set.

50
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.570
I'll transition everything so all properties should be watched and animated over dot free seconds with

51
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.730
an ease out timing function.

52
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.910
And if CSX transitions are something you're not familiar with attached you find some helpful resources

53
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.940
and might see as asked a complete guide here on udemy all of course is a great resource to learn more

54
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.450
about that.

55
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:28.650
So now if that if I reload this page you'll see it slide in and also automatically slide out the same

56
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.360
is the case when I click these buttons.

57
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.890
So now we have to a nice little animation here for our model.

58
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.300
And with that we built a pretty nice component which you can of course always enhance more you can style

59
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.910
these buttons differently whatever you want but I'm very happy with that and I think we learned a lot

60
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.200
of cool things in this module.
