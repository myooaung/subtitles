1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,080
And this is it for this module.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,670
We learned a lot about numbers and how Javascript works with them internally,

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,830
why we sometimes get strange results when working with floating point numbers and what we can do about

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,690
that.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:21,160
We learned about the number and math object and had a look at how we can generate random numbers in

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,170
a certain interval for example

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,440
and now at the end, we had to look at strings and there specifically, at template literals with the tagged

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,470
templates syntax here where you have this strange combination of function and template literal

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:42,700
to have a function which Javascript with calls for you with certain arguments, which then allows you to change

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:50,050
your string, update it, run more complex logic to transform it or return even something totally different

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,480
than a string.

12
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:57,730
Now that might not be something you need every day but occasionally, it can be quite interesting to work

13
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,070
with that especially if you want to transform a certain value,

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,200
let's say you do have a price but you don't want to print the price

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,760
but such a category, the more categories you have, the more cumbersome it can get to do this all with

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,770
a ternary expression down there and then such a tagged template like we have it here can be a great alternative.
