00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.210
Of course seeing the examples of JQuery and Lodash raises the question, how do I know which libraries

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.810
exist,

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.150
is there a page where all libraries are listed?

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.230
That's not really the case.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.930
There is a page, npmjs.com which is basically a repository of Javascript packages

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.520
but it's not really a page where you would just go and browse around,

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.750
that's not the core idea,

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.230
this is more like a lookup resource if you already know a certain library, like Lodash and you then

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.890
want to get more information about it

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.600
and it's especially useful if you want include it in a more complex Javascript project which you're managing

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.060
differently, something we'll cover in the tooling section

12
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.780
but what we're not doing right now.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.100
So this is not really a page where you would go and actively search for new interesting Javascript

14
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.930
libraries,

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.580
instead it typically works such that you have a certain problem which you want to solve and you just

16
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.750
google for the problem,

17
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.390
for example Javascript sendHttpRequest.

18
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.370
We want to send a Javascript HttpRequest and we don't know how that works or we know that it works

19
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:20.540
with XMLHttpRequest which is also what we find here but we're not too sure how that worked.

20
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.870
Well typically if you then browse around and for example you go to Stack Overflow which is a great forum

21
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:33.850
for discussing programming questions, we might get some ideas on how we can send a request and at some

22
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.290
point of time, somewhere you'll find some alternatives to the native APIs,

23
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.440
for example here JQuery is mentioned. Now turns out JQuery is not just there to help you work with

24
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.130
the DOM,

25
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.450
indeed it also makes sending HttpRequests a bit easier

26
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.510
but if you search around a bit more and maybe you read this blog post and programming is a lot about

27
00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.840
reading and searching, you will learn about another library and that would be Axios

28
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.800
and that indeed is a really popular library for sending HttpRequests. So your next step then should be

29
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.420
to search for something like axios.js

30
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.370
and here you find the Axios Github page. Github is a page, a platform where open source projects can be

31
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.730
managed, so where other people can share their projects and their code and you can actually collaborate

32
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.030
there and work together on a project,

33
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:38.320
a really great page. Now most popular libraries or basically all libraries also do have a Github repository

34
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.080
so you can even look into the code of these projects

35
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.160
if you wanted to.

36
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.680
More importantly than that, at least if you are getting started, you can also find further resources there

37
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.900
on the starting page.

38
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.240
Here for example, you learned how you can install Axios, how you use it and a rough overview of what it

39
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.990
is

40
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.330
and here for example, you find a CDN link that would allow you to include Axios and then you could

41
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.270
use it to send HttpRequests

42
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.800
and this is how you discover new libraries and how you can learn more about them.

43
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.130
There isn't a single page but it really is like a lot in programming,

44
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.740
a lot about googling, reading and Github, Github is really a great resource to learn more about projects

45
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.470
and especially to learn more about Javascript libraries.
