00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.330
Now besides the date object, there's also one other built-in object which I want to show you because

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.770
it can be important and

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.640
that's the error object built into Javascript.

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.750
You have to use new with it because that's a constructor function actually to create a new error.

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.430
To this error

6
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.350
object, to this error constructor function I should say, you can pass a string which will be your error

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.230
message,

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.980
something went wrong and when you created such an error object, you can throw it with the throw keyword.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.540
Now you might recall that we saw this earlier in the course when we had a first look at error handling

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.480
and at try catch. There

11
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.170
I actually didn't throw this or such an error object,

12
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.290
I threw a normal object which you can also do, you can throw anything as an error, you can throw an object,

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.780
you can throw a string like an error and that will cause an error with

14
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.340
that information but you might want to consider throwing an error object using this dedicated error

15
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.060
constructor function.

16
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.320
When you do so, you don't just get your message which is automatically put into a message property

17
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.930
of the created object,

18
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.620
you also get a stack trace which basically tells you where this error was thrown,

19
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.900
in this case in the console which is why we see anonymous here

20
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.550
but if we would do this in a file, we would get the file name and the file numbers and so on.

21
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.570
So besides just passing some error message, this can give you more information,

22
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.050
also since it's an object, you can add stuff to it.

23
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:48.050
You can create your error object with new error here and put in your message, like something went wrong

24
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.390
by passing it to the constructor but then of course, you can go to this object and you can add other

25
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.510
properties as well. You see by default you got this message property and the stack property because this

26
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.150
error constructor function creates an object which has these properties and that's of course nice to

27
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.670
have, you also got a name here and you can change that of course if you want to but you can add anything

28
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.250
else, like an error code if you wish to.

29
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.340
That's all possible and you can always console dir, not lohgbecause that will always just give you the

30
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.170
error message but console dir that custom error to get a full view at the object which was created under

31
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.560
the hood with my code

32
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.840
property here, with the message property and the stack property.

33
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.350
So that's the error constructor function,

34
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.510
it creates an object, what you pass to the constructor function is automatically stored in the message, when

35
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.720
you console log your error object, it will automatically give you that message,

36
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.150
so console log will directly access to message property but if you console dir it, you get full access

37
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.000
and you can always of course access all these properties with that dot notation as you can do it on

38
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.380
any other object because it is like any other object

39
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.560
basically, the only special thing about it is that you can throw it particularly well because it gives

40
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.630
you extra error information, like the message or this stack trace.

41
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.280
So the error object can be really important for custom error handling.
