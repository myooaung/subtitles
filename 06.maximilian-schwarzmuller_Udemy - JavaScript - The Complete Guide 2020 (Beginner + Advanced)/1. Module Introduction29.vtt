00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.150
In this kind of bonus module we'll dive into web components and web components will turn out to be an

2
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.100
exciting set of technologies actually that allow us to build our own custom HD Himmel elements.

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.380
Yes you heard this right.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.450
The idea really is that you can build your own age team all elements with help of certain javascript

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.470
technologies.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.250
Now in this module we'll therefore have a look at what exactly web components are which technologies

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.690
make up this term.

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.770
Web components will have a look at the basics at the core concepts we need to understand what it means

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.470
to build web components and how we build them and we'll of course also see all of that in practice by

10
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.960
building some example components.

11
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.550
Now one important note this module here actually contains content from my web components and Stansell

12
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.470
J.S. course which I released here on udemy.

13
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.450
Now it does not include the entire course of course because I do have a standalone core stair and discourse

14
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.200
has everything you need if you want to learn all about web components and especially also dive into

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.600
a tool stencil jazz which makes writing web components much easier.

16
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.390
In this module here will effectively have a look at the basics.

17
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.180
We'll have a look at the basics of web components will dive a bit deeper and we'll dive into debt more

18
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.980
complex web components module of that our course will not have a look at the other parts Stancil which

19
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.840
is a third party library that makes building web components easier because that would really take it

20
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.840
too far away from well what the focus of this causes and that of course is javascript and what we can

21
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.780
do with it.

22
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.040
Hence in this module we'll have to have that very thorough introduction to web components based on the

23
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.380
content off that course and by the end of this module you will therefore be able to build your own well

24
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.430
web components.
