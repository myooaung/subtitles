1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,590
Now as I mentioned, extensions can be installed and also can be configured

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,630
and in general dive into your settings, here in Visual Studio Code,

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,470
you do this with code preferences settings.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,630
There is a lot you can configure,

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:23,690
for example if I search for a tab width here, I can configure how much whitespace is entered

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:30,110
when I hit the tab key. Here you see what prettier, the extension I installed, will use for indentation and

7
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,230
that are two blanks which I want to use in this course

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:39,650
but you see that for example my editor by default would use four, so I'll change this to two here as well

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,090
and if you do that you can always choose whether you want to save this for your user

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,180
which means that will be the setting in all projects you opened with Visual Studio Code or in your workspace,

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,890
which would only be this project. If you choose workspace,

12
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,720
so if I change this here and you save that, that will actually be written to this settings.json

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,990
file which you find in the .vscode folder which is then automatically created.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,190
There you find your project exclusive settings whereas your general settings which you set up for the

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:16,710
entire user are not stored in this project but unsurprisingly, are stored in a global place on your machine

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,870
so that Visual Studio Code uses them no matter which project you're working in.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,820
Now here, you also got a bunch of settings, there are so many settings you could scroll through to configure

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,020
the text editor exactly to your requirements, to change the font you use there, the font size, the way

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,110
it looks, the way it behaves, there is so much you can do here. Now attached you find some resources that

20
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,230
help you dive deeper into Visual Studio Code if you're using that and in general, feel free to just browse

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,540
through that. Normally the default should be pretty good but if there is something you want to change,

22
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,060
something you detect what you would like to behave or look differently, then there's a good chance that

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,150
you can change it here in the settings. Under extensions, you also can change the settings of the extensions

24
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,580
you installed, for example of prettier.

25
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,950
So if you've got an extension and it doesn't behave the way you want it to behave, maybe you can adjust

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,300
that in the settings here as well,

27
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,650
so also explore that.
