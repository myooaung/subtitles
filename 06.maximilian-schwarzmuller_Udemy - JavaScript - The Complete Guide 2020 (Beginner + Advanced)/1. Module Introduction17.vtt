00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.830
It is again time for a practice project,

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.720
a project where we can practice a lot of the things you learned throughout this entire course and of course

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:18.190
especially throughout the previous modules and therefore in this module here, we'll again build a complete

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.150
web page, a basic web page,

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.580
this time a web page where we will also work with a third-party library,

6
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.170
Google Maps, to allow users to get a current location of a user or to enter an address and then get

7
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.680
the location of that address and display it on a map and to then share that place with other users.

8
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.600
This is what we're going to build and throughout this module, we'll therefore encounter a couple of the concepts

9
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.080
we learned in the last modules or in this entire course

10
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.830
and of course in general, this will be a great practice to work with Javascript.
