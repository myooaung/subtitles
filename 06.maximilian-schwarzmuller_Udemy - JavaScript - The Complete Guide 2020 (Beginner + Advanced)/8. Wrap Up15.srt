00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,200
So this is it for IndexedDB and for browser storage in general.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,070
Now you can dive deeper into all of these methods,

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,450
I just wanted to introduce you to these concepts and give you an overview. Browser storage can be really

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,420
useful for some pieces of data, you should just always be aware that users can view and edit it, so it's

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,280
not secure at all

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,710
and then of course users can also delete it or the browser might delete it if it's running out of space.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,480
Therefore this is great for data that can be used to enhance the user experience,

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,700
if you are building a rich client side application that needs to manage quite a lot of data, then having

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,760
something like IndexedDB is really great but it does not replace a server side database and storing

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,960
data on a server.
