1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,710
So that's it for this module.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,520
We had a look at element, positions and sizes and what you can do there.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,460
We had a look at scrolling, how you can scroll the user and how you can find out how far a user scrolled

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,790
inside of an element or on the entire page.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,760
You also learned about some other nice browser features, like dynamic script additions and templates

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,500
tags. You learned about timers which you can set and intervals

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,180
and now at the end, we had a look at location and history and navigator,

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,800
some other nice objects that allow you to interact with the browser and hopefully provide a good user

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,740
experience in which ever Javascript driven application you're building.
