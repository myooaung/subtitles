1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,720
So we're done with this module, was a large module with a lot of content about arrays, different ways

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,630
of creating and accessing arrays, different ways of manipulating arrays,

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:20,360
all these amazing array methods which help you transform arrays, sort them, add data, remove data,

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,070
splice which was a really convenient method to manipulate an array. You also learned about the spread

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:35,330
operator and array destructuring and we had a look at sets and maps which arguably are niche features

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,990
which you don't need every day but which every Javascript developer should know and you might encounter

7
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,240
situations and applications where you can actually improve your code, improve your performance, improve

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,030
your memory usage by using set, map or weak set and weak map even to improve your application.

9
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,690
So overall, a lot of key concepts covered here,

10
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,430
of course the array things, the array methods we had a look at and so on,

11
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,470
these are the most important things we worked with and these are the things we'll of course also as

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,140
always encounter throughout many modules in this course and which you will encounter throughout your

13
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,100
entire career as a Javascript developer because arrays are just such a crucial data structure and being

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,630
able to work with them, to manipulate them and so on is super important therefore.
