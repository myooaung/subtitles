00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.580
Let's get back into the core Javascript features and there, let's dive deeper into functions.

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.910
We used functions quite a lot already,

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.830
they're everywhere,

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.540
they're a super important concept or construct. In Javascript and basically in any programming language

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.070
but there's more we can do or more different ways of configuring and using functions than what we covered

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.840
thus far. To be precise in this module, after a very brief refresher of what we already know about functions,

7
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.240
we'll dive into different ways of creating functions because there is more than the one single way we

8
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.630
know thus far.

9
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.160
We'll have a closer look at anonymous functions,

10
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.720
something I briefly touched on in the behind the scenes module but I didn't really explain what that

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.630
is and why we might want to use that and we'll do all of that in this module of course.

12
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.390
We'll have a look at callback functions and functions in functions,

13
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.550
yes that's possible, you can define a function inside of a function

14
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.170
and here we'll have a look at how that works and we'll have a look at default arguments and the so-called

15
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.650
Rest

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.770
operator, what that is and why we might want to use it.

17
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.850
And last but not least, there is a special built-in function you could say, a couple of built-in functions

18
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.470
actually, the bind function and some related functions and I'll touch on those and explain what they do

19
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.290
and why we could need them.

20
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.410
So with that, that's the content,

21
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.470
let's dive right in.
