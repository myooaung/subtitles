00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.980
Thus far in this course you obviously learned a lot about Javascript and we did dive into Javascript

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.960
in the context of the browser.

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.180
In this module, we'll now have a look at a different environment where Javascript code can be used

4
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.210
and that's Node.js, a Javascript environment that allows us to run Javascript outside of the browser.

5
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.230
Now

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.510
really important to understand here is that what you learned thus far is of course not obsolete,

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.960
it's the same language, the same syntax, the same keywords,

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.390
functions are defined in the same way, variables are defined in the same way,

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.920
the difference of course is that we won't have access to all these browser APIs, to the DOM and

10
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.180
so on but I will dive into that in more detail in this module.

11
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.150
Well to be precise in this module, we'll have a look at what exactly Node.js is and how it differs

12
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.820
from the browser as a Javascript environment.

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.900
We'll then of course learn how to write Node.js code, how to write basic Node.js scripts and applications,

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.540
how to host a server with Node.js but also how to do something totally different with Node.js and

15
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.960
we'll also explore Express.js which is a framework for Node.js that makes building more complex

16
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.610
Node.js applications, specifically web servers, much easier.

17
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.930
Last but not least, we'll also have a look at how we can talk to a database and store data, not just in

18
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.100
memory of Javascript and not in the browser storage which every user can see but instead how to store data

19
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.640
on a separate database server.

20
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.510
That's what we'll have a look at in this module and therefore let's not waste any time and dive right

21
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.690
in.
