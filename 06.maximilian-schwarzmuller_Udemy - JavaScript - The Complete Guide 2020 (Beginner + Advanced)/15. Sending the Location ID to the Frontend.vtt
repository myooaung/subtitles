00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.230
Now let's make sure the other route now also works.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.820
My goal is that users now actually get a link here which does not include all this information but just

3
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.760
the ID which we generate on the server and then we output this link here with the ID and when we

4
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.520
click the link or when we use the link, we reach that other route

5
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.130
we defined here, this get route to then load this data for the ID.

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.260
Now two things we need to do for that,

7
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.870
for one we should send back the ID to the client so that on the client, we can encode it in the URL.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.630
So here I'll generate my ID here and store it in a constant and then refer to this ID constant here

9
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.490
and also send it back, maybe in a location or log ID field here in our response,

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.310
that's important

11
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.290
otherwise on the client, we can't generate a link with the ID in it.

12
00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.490
Then back to the client, we should take all this code which disables the button and so on into this then

13
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.520
block so that this only happens once the data was sent to the server and we got a response

14
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.790
and now here from data we need to get that ID, the location ID we get this from data.locId,

15
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.810
why locId?

16
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.430
Well because on the response, we're sending this locId field,

17
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.610
that's part of our JSON response, on the client

18
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.940
we're parsing this JSON data, so we get an object which will have this locId field and now the location

19
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.400
ID should be part of that

20
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.190
URL.

21
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.930
So we replace this part here with locId or location equals

22
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.820
and now we inject the location ID here, so that now the link contains the ID instead of the full

23
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.850
address data.

24
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.120
So with that, we should restart our server side server so that we take our changes here into account

25
00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.290
and then go to the running frontend application, maybe search for a 6th avenue again, find that place

26
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.000
and now you'll see we got this link with our location ID here.

27
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.080
Now let's make sure we also fetch that location by that ID

28
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.950
with this URL, with this path on our backend server.
