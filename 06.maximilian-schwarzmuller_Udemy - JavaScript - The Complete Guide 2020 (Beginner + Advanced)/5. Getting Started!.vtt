00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.720
So let's dive into the basics about web components then how they generally work how we create our own

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.550
web components and for this we will use vanilla javascript.

3
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:22.320
This means no third party libraries no other packages just JavaScript as it natively runs in the browser.

4
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.170
But first of all let me come back to the question what web components are obviously we already learned

5
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.350
that web components are basically our own H2 Mal tax like my tooltip here which is not attack built

6
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.700
into the web or dribbled into the browser and that these are basically H2 Mal tax which we define in

7
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.070
JavaScript code and which we then can use on our page so web components are really as we use them custom

8
00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:01.520
H2 male elements but they are made up of three theoretically four but three important parts.

9
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.770
The first and the core part that makes up web components the web components specification set is that

10
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.890
custom Tim Al element specification and essence we in the end built custom H2 male elements.

11
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.750
This is the core part.

12
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.710
This is essentially a bunch of JavaScript functionalities that allow us to define our own age HTML tags

13
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.450
and the logic behind them.

14
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.180
So this is a crucial part.

15
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.690
Now you might wonder OK what else could be important if we are talking about creating our own custom

16
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.430
H2 male elements.

17
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.950
Well there are two other pieces which are also very important and which are used in that javascript

18
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:55.850
logic we write behind our custom H html element and the first additional set of functions or a features

19
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.720
offered in javascript that is important related to creating custom elements is the shadow Dom specification

20
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.660
the shadow Dom specification is all about giving us some features to create our own DOM tree our own

21
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.520
elements behind dead elements you could say that are hidden away from the main Dom and I will come back

22
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.370
to that in more detail later where this will become clearer so which is in the end just allowing us

23
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.720
to define our own age team old tags which are then grouped together behind our custom aged him old hack

24
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.060
and which are separated from our main our normal Dom and this is especially helpful when we talk about

25
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.580
CSR as styling because the shadow Dom will allow us to define see us as styles that only affect our

26
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:58.490
custom element and even if we style our h1 tag in our custom element we would not affect our age 1 tax

27
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.910
on the page and this will become all clearer once we actually use it and dive deeper into it.

28
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.470
So it's another crucial part when it comes to separating our logic from the rest of the page you could

29
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:18.350
say the third important specification is about templates and slots and this is all something we will

30
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:26.210
use in great detail which in the end allows us to define our own HCM ELD structure which is hidden behind

31
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:34.400
our custom element and which allows us to add some flexible entry points these so-called slots that

32
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.820
we can then actually populate with information from outside when we use our custom element.

33
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.440
And again this is something which will become clearer later.

34
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.230
So I know that this is all very confusing right now because I'm throwing a lot of interesting words

35
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.440
around a lot of specifications without explaining in detail what they do because it makes more sense

36
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.590
to gradually build up the knowledge and we will actually start with custom H table elements before we

37
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.320
add these other features before we add the shadow Dom and the templates.

38
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.580
Now I also mentioned that there are four specifications that make up the web components spec and the

39
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.290
last specification is about h Tim L. imports.

40
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:28.220
The idea here was that we can actually import H2 Mal files into H2 Val files just as we can import CSX

41
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.490
and script files but this is actually not a continued specification because as you will learn in this

42
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:44.630
course there is a more elegant way of importing Euro components and of importing D.H. to Al inside of

43
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.800
your components.

44
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.040
So we will not need this and indeed it's not continuous it's not added to all browsers and there are

45
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.480
no plans to do so.
