1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,620
That was it for functions here,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,300
now you really are a function expert.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,050
You know about its scope or the lexical environment as we called it in this module, you learned about

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:19,350
factory functions, you learned about pure impure functions, about side effects and you also learned about

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,760
recursion which is a powerful tool

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,770
every developer needs to know, not just Javascript developers and with all of that,

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,790
there is little more that you could need to know about functions, Javascript functions as you can probably

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,050
tell by now are a powerful tool, many things you can do with them.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,720
Now don't worry, you don't always need to do everything with them, it's just good to be aware of the different

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,690
capabilities and different functionalities

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,570
and with that, you're well-prepared for any kind of application you could dive into or you might want

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:59,610
to write because you now know how functions behave, how they work internally and if you ever encounter

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,370
some tricky behavior of a function,

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,500
well you might want to recall what you learned here, for example regarding how they work with scopes

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,730
or regarding recursion where a function can call itself.
