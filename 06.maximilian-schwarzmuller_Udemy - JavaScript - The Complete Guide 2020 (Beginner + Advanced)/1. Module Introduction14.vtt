00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:09.380
We've ventured pretty far into Javascript land and the more and more we learn about Javascript, the more

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.400
and more we see that projects, browser side projects using Javascript can get complex.

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.730
For example in the last module, we learned about Javascript modules which basically means splitting our

4
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.220
code across multiple Javascript files, where the files then import each other.

5
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.580
Now there we could already see a huge advantage of this approach,

6
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.480
it makes our code more manageable but we also saw a disadvantage there,

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.470
we had a lot of HttpRequests because all these separate files had to be downloaded one-by-one and

8
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.670
the bigger your project grows, the more this might become a problem.

9
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.760
Therefore in this module here, we'll have a look at Javascript tooling which essentially is all about

10
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.690
managing our project with certain tools that automatically optimize our code, combine our code and get

11
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.640
out of our way

12
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.920
when we are writing our code so that we can write our code in the best possible way and still get an

13
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.640
optimized and better output than we're currently doing it.

14
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.680
So in this module, we'll have a look at what exactly we do there and why we do that,

15
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.980
which tools we use and which tools we can use, which tools are popular

16
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.150
and I will also walk you through an example setup where you will see how to work with these tools to

17
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.510
get this optimized project.

18
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.180
Now for that, I am back in the Javascript project we already worked on in the last module where we introduced

19
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.010
these multiple files.

20
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.670
It's the good old project manager where we can drag and drop projects with our different files here

21
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.290
and therefore

22
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.750
as I explained, one issue we have especially if this would be a bigger project is that we have multiple

23
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.280
HttpRequests here

24
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.190
and the more files we add, the more requests we have

25
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.310
and since every request comes with a little bit of overhead even if the file is pretty small, it can

26
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.340
still be annoying and slow down our application if we have to download thousands of files, so we might

27
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.690
want to avoid that

28
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.210
and that's exactly where tooling can help us.

29
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.750
Actually, we are already using one tool, this development server here which we had to use in order to

30
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.100
get certain features to work. Now

31
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.530
that's pretty cool,

32
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.970
this already shows us one example of an extra tool we need to build proper applications with Javascript.

33
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.240
We needed this development server to have a more realistic testing environment, where we actually serve

34
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.100
our web page as if it were served by a web server somewhere on the Internet.

35
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.210
Previously we just double clicked on our index.html file and that therefore did use the file

36
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.190
protocol.

37
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.500
Good enough for many things but with certain limitations as we saw when we started to use Javascript

38
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.430
modules where all of a sudden for security reasons, the file protocol was not supported and we needed

39
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.870
a real web server environment. With that development server,

40
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.900
we have that.

41
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.350
So this is already one example of an extra tool we can use to have a more realistic development environment

42
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.410
and to fully use all the things we can use with Javascript,

43
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.440
it's of course not the only tool though.
