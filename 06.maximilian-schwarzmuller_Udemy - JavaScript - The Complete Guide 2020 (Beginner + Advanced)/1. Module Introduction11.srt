00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,080
Let's explore third-party libraries in this module, a concept which makes sure that we don't reinvent

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
the wheel because reinventing anything typically is not the best idea.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,180
So this module, we'll have a look at what third-party libraries are and why you might want to use them

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,330
in Javascript but actually in programming in general. We'll have a look at a couple of example libraries

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,890
and specifically, I'll also show you how third-party libraries or one specific third-party library can

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,770
make working with HttpRequests easier.

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,860
Now we covered HttpRequests in great detail in the HTTP module and it's important to know all of

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,980
that and using a library is not a must do.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,340
Nonetheless in this module, I'll show you an alternative and you'll see why you might prefer this over

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,000
manually implementing all the HTTP things you learned about.
