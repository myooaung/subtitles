00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.930
We worked on our application,

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.210
we tested it thoroughly, we're happy with the web page we created and with the Javascript code that runs

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.930
on it, no matter if we just wrote some client side Javascript or if we built a whole server side application

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.380
with Node.js.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.230
Now the goal is to deploy that application,

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.110
you want to make sure it does not just run locally on your machine where you're test it but you want

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.140
to put it on some server, on some computer in the web which has its own domain connected to it, its own

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.150
IP address which is reachable by anyone which your local machine thankfully isn't,

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.110
so that all users that are interested can start using your web application.

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.640
This is ultimately the goal

11
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.470
once you're done with development right and this is exactly what we'll have a look at in this module.

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.240
We'll have a look at deploying both a web page which only consists of HTML, Javascript and CSS, so which

13
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.870
has no server side code attached and we'll also have a look at how you would deploy a Node.js application

14
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.550
where you of course have Javascript code that needs to run on a server.
