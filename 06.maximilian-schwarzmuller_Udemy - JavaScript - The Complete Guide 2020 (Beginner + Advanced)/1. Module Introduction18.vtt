00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.090
Earlier in this course, we had a look at Javascript libraries,

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.150
we had a look at axios, Lodash, JQuery as some examples.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.330
Now in this module, we'll explore Javascript frameworks, these in the end are like bigger libraries you could

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.810
say but we'll have a look at what exactly a framework is, how it helps you focus on what matters and

5
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.240
how it simplifies the project building or app building work

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.510
and we'll also see an example.

7
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.520
Now to be precise, I'll first of all dive into what exactly a framework is and what the difference to

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.830
a library is and we'll then have a look at React.js which ironically is a library but a pretty important

9
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.570
and huge one

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.350
and if we then add a couple of other things from the React ecosystem, it actually gets more framework-ish.

11
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.480
So we'll have a look at that and see why that matters,

12
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.260
what's great about React, what alternatives to React are and how that can help us in our projects.
