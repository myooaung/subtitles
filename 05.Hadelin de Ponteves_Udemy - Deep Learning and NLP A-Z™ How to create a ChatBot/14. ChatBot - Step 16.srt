00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,690
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,390
So in this one we're going to translate all the questions and all the answers separately into integers.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,310
What does that mean.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,640
Well let's take our clean questions for example the clean questions list here in this list you can see

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,230
that we have all the questions that are into text so can we make this quick rucks and Corinne and Andrew

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:33,260
Bart are having these are into text and we want to translate that into the unique integers that were

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:33,820
mapped.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,600
Thanks to our previous dictionary that we created.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,180
So basically we just need to translate all this into this new language of integers according to how

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,080
our previous dictionary was made.

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,340
And therefore we're going to have to make some for loops to loop not only over all the questions here

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:59,360
and then all the answers and then for each of these questions here we will loop over again all the words

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:07,130
of the question and applying the previous dictionary to translate each of these words into their unique

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,530
associated integers.

15
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,900
All right so let's do this.

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,980
And by the way now that you understand what we have to do.

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:20,750
Well again I recommend to try doing it yourself before watching this tutorial and the other important

18
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,920
thing is to understand why we're doing this.

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,000
We're only doing this because then we want to sort all the questions and all the answers by their length

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,270
and to sort that well these two lists of questions and answers translated into integers will be very

21
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,270
helpful.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,900
And why do we want to sort the questions and answers by the length that I remind is to optimize the

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,580
training performance.

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:51,040
All right so let's make our two lists of questions and answers translated into integers and also while

25
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:57,080
making that list we're going to replace all the words that were filtered out by our token out.

26
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:04,400
So at some point in the loop we will need to add an if condition to check if the word was filtered out

27
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,150
and if that's the case will replace this word by the token out.

28
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,760
So let's do this now you understand what you have to do.

29
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,440
Try to do it before me but I'm going to start now.

30
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:21,570
So to start we have to understand that we're about to make a new list and this will be the list of the

31
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:29,760
questions translated into integers and I'm going to call that list questions on this court to underscore

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:37,470
and because we're translating the questions into integers so questions to end and then a pair of square

33
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,670
brackets because it is a list.

34
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,770
And now we are ready to start to fill up.

35
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,560
So as we said we have to do two four loops.

36
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,540
First we need to loop over all the questions here.

37
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,650
That's the first for loop.

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,820
And then the second for loop for each of the question we will loop over all the words of the questions.

39
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:09,570
So let's do this first for loop over the questions in clean questions to huge clean questions list of

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,360
all the questions and text.

41
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,510
So for all the questions and clean questions what do we want to do.

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,250
Well we want to translate all the words of the question into their associated words based on the previous

43
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,330
dictionaries.

44
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,210
So we need to make another for loop but we are going to create a new list for each question and the

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,950
question we're dealing with right now.

46
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:38,250
So since we're making a new list we need to introduce a new one and we're going to call it it's because

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,090
this will be the list of integers each of the integers will be the associated integer to the word in

48
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,260
that question.

49
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,860
So it's equals.

50
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,610
We initialize it as an empty list and there goes the second for loop and then the second for loop we

51
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,180
will loop over the words in the question.

52
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:07,680
So in question then don't forget we need to add that split to get these words separately and then colon

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
and then there we go.

54
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,950
Time for the if condition.

55
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,520
Because that's where we need to check if the word was filtered out or not.

56
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,750
If it was filtered out we will replace it by the token out if it was not filtered out who will just

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,570
translate it into the integer.

58
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,970
So let's do this let's make this if condition so we're first going to check if this word was filtered

59
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,180
out.

60
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,640
That is if this word is not in our dictionary.

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,900
Questions words too.

62
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,520
And remember that's the dictionary that maps each word of the question to an integer.

63
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,340
So that's exactly what we need right now.

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,000
If this word is not in this questions words do in dictionary.

65
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,590
Well what do we do.

66
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:06,960
We want to replace that word by the token out and more specifically we want to replace that word by

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,380
the integer that encodes the token out.

68
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,160
Remember that in this code section here there is three tutorials to go.

69
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,310
We also attributed a unique integer to each of the tokens here.

70
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,380
One of them is out and therefore out also has its unique integer and now not only we want to replace

71
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,440
this word by Alice but more specifically we want to attribute for this word the unique integer that

72
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,570
is associated to the token out.

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,730
And therefore I'm going to do now as I'm going to take my ENC list to which I'm going to append this

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,470
unique integer associated to the token out.

75
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,570
And how do we get it.

76
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:57,960
Well we simply need to take our dictionary questions words to it and from this dictionary we're going

77
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,020
to get the key to tokin out which is this way.

78
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:10,920
So going out is the key that will allow us to get from these questions words to in dictionary the unique

79
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,090
integer that was associated out.

80
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,540
And this is what will be returned here.

81
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,730
So this is exactly what we want.

82
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,390
Great.

83
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:26,790
So now other case if the word is in question were two in there if the were wasn't filtered out which

84
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,280
we can express here by else because this is complimentary.

85
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,260
Well in that case what do we want to do.

86
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:42,150
Well we simply want to add to our list of the encoded integers the unique integer that was associated

87
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,250
to this word we were dealing with right now and that was not filtered out.

88
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,240
So we're going to do that same thing.

89
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,050
I'm going to copy this Bazan here.

90
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:01,890
But instead of taking out here we of course need to take the word because the word is now the key identifier

91
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:09,060
which when we apply the questions word in dictionary will get us the unique integer associated to that

92
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,740
word which is exactly what we want.

93
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,750
So now that we have the question translated into integers we simply need to append this translated question

94
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,150
into integers to our questions to int.

95
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:28,150
HUGE list of all these translated questions and therefore what we simply do here is take.

96
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,500
We can this.

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:37,600
We take our questions to int list to which we append the question translated into integers and that

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,390
is contained in this list.

99
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,490
So in the append function I'm just adding It's all right and that's it.

100
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,300
That does the job for the questions.

101
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,560
Now we're going to do the same for the answers but as usual it's very easy.

102
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,510
We simply need to copy paste this whole section because this is going to be the same logic.

103
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,330
So paste and here we just need to replace all the questions by the answers.

104
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,630
So let's do this answers.

105
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,190
All right good.

106
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,400
So we did it.

107
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,080
If it's more clear for you we can even add questions into integers so that it is clear that this is

108
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:23,950
the translation of questions text into integers so just replacing that year.

109
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,050
All right.

110
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,180
And so now let's have a look at what we just made.

111
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,250
I'm going to select all this section and execute.

112
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,900
There we go.

113
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,500
I hope it's going to work.

114
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,240
Hope no error was made.

115
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,170
Apparently not.

116
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,220
Let's have a look.

117
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,460
So questions.

118
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,930
First let's have a look.

119
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,210
It must be right here.

120
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,320
Questions.

121
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,150
Yes and perfect this is exactly what we wanted.

122
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:59,650
Each of the question of the clean questions list was translated into the unique integers according to

123
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,550
our questions words to any dictionary.

124
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,470
And so perfect so let's quickly check.

125
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:12,360
Also the answers to int list but there should be the same.

126
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,450
Yeah there we go.

127
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,020
Perfect.

128
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:22,020
All the answers in the clean answers list where translated into their unique integers based on that

129
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,320
answer is words to any dictionary that we made great so.

130
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,900
Wow.

131
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,700
Now I'm getting super excited because we're getting two parts to building the sick sick model.

132
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:37,710
We only have one tutorial left to take care of but that's very important because that's the one where

133
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,700
we'll sort the questions and the answers by their length.

134
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,230
And to do that we will use what we did here.

135
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,270
That is these questions and answers and two lists that we will leverage to sort these questions and

136
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,580
answers by the length.

137
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,180
So let's do that in the next tutorial.

138
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,130
And until then enjoy typing on the.
