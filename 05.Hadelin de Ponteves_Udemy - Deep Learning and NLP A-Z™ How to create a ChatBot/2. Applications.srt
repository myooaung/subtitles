00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,410
Hello and welcome actually of course a deep natural language processing in today's tutorial we're going

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,950
to talk about the applications of what you will learn.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,420
So we'll discuss some of the areas where you can apply your new skills and I think it's an important

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,870
hurtle because not only can you use these skills to build CHUGG we will be in deep focus which I Butson

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,270
this course but at the same time we can use the same skills methods and models in order to create many

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,210
many more things.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:35,760
And that's why in this story we're going to broaden our horizons and see what is possible.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
All right so let's have a look.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,890
First one is speech recognition.

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:50,520
So I've got to put them in order of importance in order of how volume must application is how many how

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,220
often how impactful it is for a lot of lives how Look world changing these applications.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,500
So speech transcription is a huge one.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:09,240
Whenever you talk into your phone and try it out as text that is specious scription so taking in audio

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,520
form and putting it into text.

15
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,460
But not only does it stop there.

16
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,820
Remember previously on the Get excited story we talked about some of the chat boards that are or that

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,770
are like Siri or town or Alexa that are voice based.

18
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,510
Well that same technology goes in there to understand the wave forms and some of the sound we can apply

19
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:37,500
a deep natural language processing and then Reiji put in that second part which is the chat board in

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,010
order to understand what to do with that text what to do with those instructions.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,810
So speech transcription as it can that is it's already very important is going to become more and more

22
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,930
and more important in the years to come.

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,280
And this can happen.

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,050
This can be done with deep language processing and how we actually have a case study down further down

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,910
the course.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,610
Then comes Nature or now your own machine translation or NMT.

27
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,770
So a lot of us have used google translate most of us have to use google translate at least once in our

28
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,430
lives.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,660
Well you see Google Translate used phrase based translation algorithms.

30
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,250
Now they have switched to your old machine translation which is powered by exactly the same models as

31
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,740
you'll see inside the scores.

32
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,740
Then we've got the boards which will be talking about in depth in the course and we create one ourselves.

33
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,410
Then we've got the Q&amp;A type obligation.

34
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,170
It's kind of like simle Joe childbed but it's not as intense not as in-depth.

35
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,030
For example you have a model which has access to us and resource our instance the Harry Potter books

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,260
and you can ask a question like What is the name of Harry Potter's mother and it'll spit out an answer.

37
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,390
So question answer question answer is no conversation going on.

38
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:04,020
But you can get very quickly information from volume volumes sources such as books or other sources

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,530
on the Internet like GPDA for instance you can get information very quickly.

40
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:18,120
Next one is text summarization another publication similar to both a Q&amp;A but less interactive has more

41
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,130
to do with like if you have a lot of text and you need to create a summary for instance you have a book

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,860
and you just create a summary of the book or if you have lots of medical documents and journals and

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,750
you need to write a synopsis for them then you can use text intercession as well.

44
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,960
But the concept is the same again we need to use the models that we've been discussing in order to assess

45
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,170
all of the input text and come on come up with an on actual image captioning.

46
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:54,510
And that is a bit trickier to like to see how the models were going to be creating or scutching can

47
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:02,400
be used in image capturing but it boils down to looking at an image and observing the dependencies in

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,960
the image to create a caption.

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,480
For instance you have like a dog jumping over a fence and it's like a black dog on the floor or a white

50
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,270
fence.

51
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,850
So the model needs to understand is remember that there's a dog it's a black dog is a fence and then

52
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,160
put all together the dogs above the fences jumping over the fence.

53
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,450
So again we'll talk about this a bit more of the course.

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:35,310
But basically what happens is the the model is able to assess what's going on in the image and then

55
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,530
spit out a text transcription or caption.

56
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,060
And finally we have video captioning so it's very similar to the image of him and takes it to the next

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,160
level and here.

58
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:53,220
Not only do you have information interrelations inside each frame like in an image you actually have

59
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:01,430
certain certain information that you need to look at through all of the movies installations through

60
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,330
time so you need to see how the part is progressing.

61
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,990
What's happening with the characters and so on.

62
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:12,880
So that's video captioning you need to kind of understand the conversation between characters that are

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,260
conveyed properly.

64
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,990
You need to understand what was going on in the previous friends.

65
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,200
And that's they are models to the next level.

66
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,500
So there we go that's a 7 applications all the things that will be discussing and learning in this course.

67
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:32,150
And as we go along we will actually mention the application here and there to put it into perspective.

68
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,920
So our goal is not only to show you how to create chat boards and what models go into into them what's

69
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:47,000
intuition behind them but also to help you come up with other ideas of where you can put to use your

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,270
newly applies fields.

71
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,610
And I hope this gets even more excited about this course.

72
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,740
And let's dive into it and I'll see the next intro.
