00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,490
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,150
After making the clean text function we were going to apply it on all the questions and all the answers

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,380
to effectively clean their attacks.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,700
So we're going to start as you can see with the questions in the first code section and then we'll take

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,350
care of the answers in the next section.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,770
So let's start with the questions.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,880
So it's actually going to be very easy.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,600
We're going to make a new list that will contain all the clean questions and therefore I'm going to

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,230
introduce here this new variable that I'm going to call clean on those core questions and that will

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,180
be this new list of all the questions that will be cleaned by the can in text function.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,130
So we're going to initialize it as an empty list with the pair of square brackets.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,230
And then of course comes naturally a for loop.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:58,230
So for now try to guess what I'm going to type try to make Actually the whole story without me.

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,370
So well we just want to get our questions and clean them.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,240
So naturally the loop variable is going to be question that arbitrary for you to choose but we're going

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,990
to take the questions in the loop and we're going to get them from our questions list that we created

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,630
2 tutorials ago.

18
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,810
So we take our questions list that contains the non cleaned version and we're going to take each of

19
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,520
the questions inside these questions and clean them one by one.

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,990
And so now we were ready to answer the for loop and inside.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:43,450
Well simply what we're going to do is apply to clean text function that we made in the previous Statoil.

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,240
We're going to clean the question that we're dealing with right now.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,850
The loop and then almost over we're going to append this clean question because this is what is returned

24
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,780
by the clean text function.

25
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:10,230
We're going to append this clean question to naturally our clean questions list and then we go for all

26
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,350
the question in the non cleaned questions of the questions list.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,640
We're going to clean these questions and we're going to append them one by one to our clean questions

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,120
list containing the clean questions.

29
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,070
All right and that's it.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,820
Well that's basically over.

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,590
We get our list of clean questions.

32
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,630
And now we're going to do the same for the answers.

33
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,640
And the good news is that it's going to be almost the same we will basically need to replace questions

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,770
by answers.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,300
So I'm pasting that here.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:51,620
I'm going to introduce a new name for the list of answers which will be clean answers naturally.

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:05,530
And so for all the answer in answers I'm going to clean these answers first and I'm going to send them

38
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,210
to my clean answers list.

39
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,680
All right.

40
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,890
Perfect So we're done with our two four loops to create the two new lists of clean questions and clean

41
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,090
answers.

42
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,440
All right so now let's have a look.

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,490
We're going to execute these two code sections here.

44
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,460
Make sure to execute the clean text function before if it wasn't done.

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,180
And now let's execute this.

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,800
There we go.

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,700
It takes a little time because it has to make this for loop over all the questions and all the answers.

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,590
But here we go.

49
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,880
Now they're ready and so let's have a look.

50
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,640
So we get our questions answered questions and answers.

51
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,340
So as you can see can we make this quick.

52
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,220
First the capital C is now a lower case.

53
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,650
Can we make this quick.

54
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,790
The question mark was removed and same.

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,320
Everything in lower cases then as you can see the dashers are gone here.

56
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:10,520
And let's have a look at the answers we'd start we would start then the dashes are gone dashes are gone.

57
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:17,160
And if you scroll down you will actually see even more changes like.

58
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,610
OK dash dash.

59
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,600
You're going to.

60
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,460
OK.

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,290
No dash.

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,400
You are going to.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,420
Well as you can see they were cleaned properly.

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,010
We can clean them even more for example.

65
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:34,840
We can even replace the apostrophe as by I guess but I wouldn't do this because let's go.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,530
I think it's fine to leave it as.

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Let's go.

68
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:44,290
We could also remove the exclamation mark but maybe that helps with the sentiment analysis.

69
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:50,930
I didn't want to remove it but feel free to experiment you know natural language processing is a lot

70
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,270
of experimenting.

71
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,130
We are going to train our Jedward several times we're going to tweak the parameters we're going to try

72
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,200
to improve it.

73
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:05,750
And in the end I will actually give you several chat but with some pre-trained morals and some saved

74
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,800
waits for the neurons so that you can get the best one if you need it for your business or your personal

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,560
project.

76
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,260
But anyway the data processing phase is also an artist's job.

77
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,980
All right so that's it.

78
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,840
Our questions are clean our answers are clean.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,810
Now we're going to move onto the next step which will be to remove the none important words that is

80
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,580
the non frequent words you know that each word is going to have its own color Culham its own encoding

81
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,690
and therefore if we keep all the words of the corpus there are going to be hundreds of thousands of

82
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:48,310
them and it will be very difficult for the training to take place in a reasonable amount of time.

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,180
So that's why we have to do it and we'll do this from the next tutorial.

84
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,050
Until then Id been I'll be.
