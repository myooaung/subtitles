00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.200
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial and welcome back to the training.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.530
All right.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:10.260
So we made some good progress here and the next step is to apply some decay to the learning rates and

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.180
that will be thanks to our learning okay and therefore to do that.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.700
I'm taking my learning rate and since the decay consists of multiplying the learning rate by doing red

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.690
decay to reduce it by the decay rate.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:33.740
Well I'm going to multiply this learning rate by our learning rate DK and so now remember that we want

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.560
to have a minimum learning rate and therefore to make sure that we're going to add here that if condition

9
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:51.680
to check if our learning rate that was reduced by the K is lower than this minimum learning rates and

10
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.980
if that's the case if it was decayed reduced too much.

11
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.710
Well we want to set this learning rate equal to this minimum learning rates.

12
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.420
All right.

13
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.490
And that was given in the hyper parameters.

14
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.040
Good so that's a good thing checked.

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.570
Now we have to take care of early stopping.

16
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.360
So to take care of this we're going to get first our list of validation less errors and to this list

17
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.980
we're going to spend the last average validation last error that we just got.

18
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:44.660
All right and then we're going to check if this average validation last error is lower than the minimum

19
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.020
of all old validation plus errors that we append in the list and basically that means that if we manage

20
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.390
to get an average validation error that is lower than all the ones in the list that means that there

21
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.670
is improvement.

22
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.230
And therefore if that's the case we are going to print in quotes.

23
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.210
The first thing the childbirth is going to say like a human.

24
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.460
He's going to say I speak better now because he improved his ability to talk.

25
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.350
Right.

26
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.080
So I think better now he's excited and still if that's the case if we manage to reduce the validation

27
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:31.380
as air well we will reset the early stopping check variable to zero because we increment it only when

28
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.300
there is no improvement of the validation error and we reset it to zero whenever we find an improvement.

29
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.870
And still if we find a lower validation error.

30
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.630
Well we want to save tomorrow and to save them all we are going to get first a saver object.

31
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.870
Is going to be an object of the saver class taken from the train module taken from the tens of library.

32
00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.510
So TFT are trained that Savir here with some parenthesis that creates my object and then I'm going to

33
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.860
take the Savir object again Savir and then use the same method that is going to take two arguments first

34
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.020
session and second are checkpoints which contains the weights.

35
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.610
Perfect.

36
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.400
So that's all we need to do when we find a validation last error that is lower than all the validation

37
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400
plus errors that we've got so far.

38
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.040
But then if that doesn't happen which we have to include in an else I'm going to scroll down here a

39
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.850
little bit.

40
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.400
So if that doesn't happen meaning if we don't find a validation last area that is lower than all the

41
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.150
ones we've collected so far.

42
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:46.950
Well in that case our Chad is going to have to say sorry I do not speak better because I did not improve

43
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.680
my ability to speak English and we were going to make our Chad but ambitious he's going to say I need

44
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.920
to practice more.

45
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.290
He's going to practice more because early stopping has not stopped everything yet.

46
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.210
All right then speaking of early stopping since we were not able to find a validation last error lower

47
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.000
than all the ones we've collected so far well we have to increment the early stopping check variable

48
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:25.880
and therefore I'm taking my early stopping check my goal and I incremented buy one and now that's where

49
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.790
we need to check if this early stuff in check viable has reached the final stop that is to early stopping

50
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.380
start variable which we said equal to 1000.

51
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:43.380
And that's why I'm going to make a condition here a new one checking if this early stop in check by

52
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.450
vote has reached the early stopping start volleyball equal to 1000.

53
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.760
And if that's the case that's where we have to break everything.

54
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.110
And we even need to stop the main flu.

55
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.090
And therefore we need to repeat that again this if condition.

56
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.580
So we have to paste it here.

57
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.480
Make sure you're at the right level.

58
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.390
So if that's the case what we're going to do is first we're going to print something new.

59
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.280
And we're not only going to make our children ambitious but we're going to make it polite.

60
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.210
He's going to say my apologies.

61
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.130
I cannot speak better.

62
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:35.870
And the more this is the best I can do.

63
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.460
So we have a very nice chat but we don't want to be too harsh with him.

64
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.750
So this is the best I can do.

65
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.680
And then we're going to break the whole thing by adding a new break here and eventually we will print

66
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.400
game over.

67
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.200
And congratulation guys you have completed part three training the checkbook.

68
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.860
So let's go back up to see if we manage to see the whole thing.

69
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.700
No we can't.

70
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.530
That was huge.

71
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.390
As I told you.

72
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.020
That's OK you can open it in the text there and I highly recommend to take a step back and see all the

73
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.340
flow of the logic of what we did here and now.

74
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:20.230
Eventually the moment we've all been waiting for we are going to select this whole section to make this

75
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.490
powerful brain that we made in part two.

76
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.310
We're going to make it smart right now.

77
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.090
There we go.

78
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.290
The training is.

79
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.520
Let's fingers crossed it's going to work.

80
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.210
I'm pretty excited that the same time pretty nervous.

81
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.210
But there we go.

82
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.320
It is working.

83
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.160
Welcome guys to the first book with the first batch.

84
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.460
And so there we are.

85
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.380
The training is on its way.

86
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.230
I'm super relieved that this huge followup was executed without any issues I was pretty nervous.

87
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.000
There we go now.

88
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.070
It is happening.

89
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.120
It is on its way.

90
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.110
However the bad news is that it's going to take a huge amount of time.

91
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:59.770
We're talking several days here at least on my computer so I'm going to leave that during Christmas

92
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.380
because actually right now it's almost Christmas at the time I'm speaking.

93
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.920
We are December 22nd so I'm going to leave that during Christmas.

94
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.300
But no worries have some good news for you.

95
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.180
Until we wait for the results so let's let this run and I'll see you in the next tutorial in part for

96
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.990
testing the chat but to implement the code that will test the chad but how you know we're going to interact

97
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.800
with it speak with it in the console.

98
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.550
But then there's going to be another surprise.

99
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.340
I'm going to give you one of the best shot but implemented in the world.

100
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.150
Until then and Jaideep and I'll be.
