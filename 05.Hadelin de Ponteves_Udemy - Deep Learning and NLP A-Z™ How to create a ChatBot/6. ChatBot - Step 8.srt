1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,900
Highs and welcome to this new tutorial and this one we're going to get separately the questions and

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,670
answers.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,520
So as we explained in the previews to all these are going to be respectively the input and the target

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,050
of the new one that work there is the questions will be the inputs and the answers will be the target.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,050
And so we're going to get them separately before cleaning all of them all the questions and all the

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,720
answers.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,210
So that's the last step before starting all the cleaning process to make the data set as simple as possible.

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,840
All right so let's do this.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,230
And before we start.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,820
Well it's important to understand where we're going to get separately these questions and these answer

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,630
and how are we going to put them together.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,600
Because what we want to get is two separate huge lists.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:55,290
One for the questions and one for the answers but of the same size because for each index I have these

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,210
lists.

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:04,200
Well the answer of index I should be the answer to the question of index I therefore it should be well

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,940
aligned and to make sure this is well aligned.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,300
What we need to understand here is that in our conversations IDs huge list that we just made in the

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,310
proof that Tauriel well in each conversation.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,450
The first element will be the question.

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,810
The first question the second element will be the answer.

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,820
So basically the key identifier of the answer is the next key identifier of the question just before.

22
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,010
So that's what we need to make clear.

23
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:40,060
And if that's the case we'll it will be easy for you to understand how we get these questions and answers.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,200
So let's do this since we're going to make two separate lists one for the question and one for the answers.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,800
We're going to introduce here to lists that we're going to initialize an empty list.

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,440
And of course we're going to call them very simply questions and answers.

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,530
And so as we just said we are going to initialize them as empty list which like before is with a pair

28
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,790
of square brackets.

29
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,860
All right so our Toolis are now initialized.

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,880
And now we're going to make them with of course a for loop so for.

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,070
And now according to you on which object on which list are we going to iterate on.

32
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,470
Well that's of course what I've just showed you the conversations IDs because the conversation is not

33
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:33,270
only contains all the conversations but mostly it contains two key identifiers of each line of the conversation.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,140
So we will get the key identifiers in each conversation and using our dictionary that we made before

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,520
we will get the text of the line because we no longer want to get the key.

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,190
Now we want to get the real text because this will be the input and the target of the neural network

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,810
so we want to get the real text and therefore we have to use a dictionary to map the key identifiers

38
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:02,460
to these text but to make sure we get well aligned by taking the answer as the next key identifier of

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,120
the question we need to use.

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,120
Does this conversation IDs list because this is where we get the conversations.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,540
Therefore we're going to iterate on these conversations IDs list let's do it and therefore we need to

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,810
choose a name for the loop variable we're going to call it.

43
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:27,570
Well conversation this is still a conversation only just contains the lines IDs for conversation.

44
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,600
And as we said conversations underscore IDs right.

45
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,990
CULLEN And let's start the loop.

46
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,060
Ok so now according to you and actually I recommend you to do that.

47
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,180
Well during the course is to guess what I'm going to type.

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,300
You know what we want to get.

49
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,680
We want to get separately the questions and the answers.

50
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:55,110
So try sometime to make pause on the tutorial and try to guess what I'm going to type next.

51
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:02,730
So right now we want to get separately the questions and the answers then first we know that in conversations

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:09,630
IDs the key identify of the answer comes right after the one of the question and besides we have this

53
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:18,050
idea to line dictionary that can map these key identifiers to the real text of the questions and answers.

54
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,610
So we need to use them both.

55
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,110
And therefore what do we need to do.

56
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,090
Well not only do we need to iterate again on each of these conversations because right now we're dealing

57
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,660
with a specific conversation in all the conversations IDs so we need to iterate through all the key

58
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,860
identifiers of this conversation and then once that is done we will map these key identifiers to the

59
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,740
real text.

60
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,850
And therefore what we need to do now is a second follow up.

61
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,770
We need to iterate on the key identifiers of the conversation we're dealing with right now and therefore

62
00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:00,050
the second loop is going to be for I in range of.

63
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,750
Well basically we need to put the number of elements of that conversation.

64
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,540
We're dealing with right now and this we can get it with the length that we can get with the len function

65
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,210
of this conversation we're dealing with right now.

66
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,620
Len conversation however since we're also going to get the answer in the second loop Well we are going

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:27,400
to add here a minus one because you know we'll take the index plus when we will take the I plus one

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,000
here and therefore it shouldn't go beyond the upper bound of the range therefore the minus one here.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,520
All right so with this second loop we iterate on all the elements of the compositions that is all the

70
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,920
key identifiers one after the other and so call and again.

71
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,510
And now let's enter this second loop.

72
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,450
And the good news is that right now we are ready to get our questions and our answers and of course

73
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,520
since we already initialized them an empty list.

74
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,970
Well we simply need to use the append function to append what we have to happen in respectively the

75
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,440
questions and the answers.

76
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,920
So let's start with the questions questions that are banned and now try to guess what we need to append.

77
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,820
Exactly.

78
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,120
Well remember we want the text this time.

79
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,210
We're getting closer and closer to the neural network so we have to get the some day.

80
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,590
And so you know what to do we need to use our dictionary I need to learn because this is the one that

81
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,830
maps these key identifiers that we're about to get to the text of the lines.

82
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:38,170
And so here we go let's take our dictionary into line and in square brackets we need to put the key

83
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:47,680
identifier of the line which is going to be well conversation of index i because i is a loop variable

84
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,220
that goes through all the elements of the conversation here which is one of the conversation in the

85
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,330
whole list of all the conversations.

86
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,990
Perfect.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,120
So by doing this we just append it and you question and now we have to append the answer corresponding

88
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,270
to that question and therefore.

89
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:13,740
Well let's maybe take this copy and paste it here because it's going to be almost the same.

90
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,760
We're going to take care of the answers now.

91
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,460
So I'm taking my answers list and now it's going to be the same.

92
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,970
We have to append the answer to.

93
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,610
The answer is this.

94
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,620
But remember that everything has to be aligned at a specific index.

95
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,160
The answer of that index should be the answer to the question of that same index.

96
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,530
And as we just explained the answer has the next index after the one of the question.

97
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,980
This index corresponds to the index of this first element here.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,120
That's zero for example and therefore the index of the answer that we want to get that we want to append

99
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,930
now and that should be aligned with our previous question.

100
00:07:53,090 --> 00:08:00,110
Must be the next index that is index here and therefore it should be I plus 1 and so the only thing

101
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,160
that we need to replace here is just this.

102
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,410
I by I plus one and that's it.

103
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,100
We just happened that the proper answer to our previous question.

104
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,750
So now we're going to have a look.

105
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,920
We're going to check if everything's OK.

106
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:19,270
We're going to be able to check that by checking the relevance of the questions and answers.

107
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,740
So let's do this let's execute now.

108
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,740
And there we go.

109
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,850
Well executed.

110
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,790
Now let's have a look.

111
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:33,750
At first the questions yes and the answer's yes.

112
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,070
All right.

113
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,920
Now let's check if our questions are well-aligned with our answers so let's say for example this one

114
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,670
how do you get your hair to look like that.

115
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,060
That's the question and the answer is Ebers deep conditioner every two days.

116
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,880
And I never ever use a Wherever So that looks correct and that's another example I can see some French

117
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,770
here semi at.

118
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,750
This is my head.

119
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,680
So this is my head is a translation of smattered.

120
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,320
And the answer is so same index Stenton right.

121
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,950
See you're ready for the quiz.

122
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:17,050
I suppose this is a French quiz I don't recognize any movies in these lines but it indeed looks like

123
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,320
some movie lines.

124
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,520
And anyway we aligned correctly our questions and our answers so congratulations you're getting closer

125
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,250
and closer to the right structure we're trying to get.

126
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,450
And so now actually we can start cleaning all this text because as you can see these will be difficult

127
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:42,390
for the chat but to train how to talk like a human because we need to do a lot of cleaning for example.

128
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,820
I don't we will replace that by.

129
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,770
I do not.

130
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:54,040
So that's all the Don't do not are associated with one same common token and same for your.

131
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,090
We're going to replace that by you are.

132
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,180
And that that is.

133
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,500
Anyway we're going to do a lot of cleaning like that and we're going to put everything in lower case

134
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,300
as well.

135
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,950
And that starts from the next tutorial.

136
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,840
And to learn and Jaideep deep LP.
