00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.980
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial and this one again a quick and easy one we're going to add the

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.610
as tokened end of string to the end of every answer.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.280
So as you might guess we're going to loop over all the answers in our clean answers.

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.280
Let's we're going to get back to the original clean answers list which is the list of all the answers

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.390
that we cleaned.

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.920
One by one and to each of these answers we're going to add this as string.

7
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.480
All right so let's do this.

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.260
Well since we already have the clean answers it is already existing.

9
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.410
We don't need to introduce anything here as we used to do before we can directly start the loop.

10
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.840
And so I'm starting here with four and now we need to choose a new Barbel.

11
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.140
So we're going to simply loop over all the indexes of the clean answers list.

12
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.730
Let's have a look at it again.

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.700
Clean answers this is right here.

14
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.110
So yes and as you can see this is just a list of clean answers that we can get with the index your index

15
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.690
going from zero to the length of this clean answers list.

16
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.780
So we're going to choose an arbitrary index for the Lavabo that will go through all these indexes.

17
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.890
All right so let's do this for I in range and in parenthesis we need to input the length of this clean

18
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.900
and list.

19
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.670
So I'm taking Lenn clean.

20
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.550
Underscore answers list which corresponds to the number of elements of this clean answers list and therefore

21
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.360
we will go through all the answers one by one and for each of them what are we going to do.

22
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.770
Well we're going to add in the end the end of string token.

23
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.240
Let's do this to get these answers we simply need to take our clean answers.

24
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:03.020
List then get the ice index which is the Index we're dealing with right now in the loop of the answer

25
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.090
and clean answers.

26
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.880
I will give us directly the answer.

27
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.940
And so what do we need to do with that answer.

28
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.900
Well we need to add the end of string token at the end of it and a trick to do that it's like an incrementation

29
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.400
we can add a plus here plus equals because clean answers plus equals actually means clean answers equals

30
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.970
clean answers I plus something.

31
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.730
And there's something coming after the press is going to be of course the end of string token.

32
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.170
So I'm adding some double quotes here because this end of string token has to be input in double code

33
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.690
that's when we do an addition operation between the elements of a list.

34
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.340
So quote here let's not forget them and then we need to at the end of string.

35
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.390
However be careful to make that separation between the last word and the answer and this end of string

36
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.410
token we need to separate them by space and therefore I just added a space here and then we can add

37
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.220
the token.

38
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.130
Oh that's all right.

39
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.980
Perfect.

40
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.710
And that's it.

41
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.590
The loop is done.

42
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.150
So that was pretty easy.

43
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:18.860
And I remind that we are doing this because end of string token is needed at the end of the decoding

44
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.110
layers of the sect to sect model.

45
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.990
We have to specify the end of the answer and the decoding part by this end of string token.

46
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.560
And that's why it's important to add it in the end as we just it.

47
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.840
All right so great let's execute this execute.

48
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.750
There we go.

49
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.460
Perfect.

50
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.600
Now let's check that it is right here and the clean answers list.

51
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.980
Yes.

52
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.570
All right.

53
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.190
So I'm going to expand this.

54
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.130
And there we go.

55
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.300
It is at the end of every answer in the clean answers list.

56
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.070
And as you can see it was necessary to add the space here so that it can clearly distinguish the last

57
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.230
word and the end of string token.

58
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.800
Otherwise it would confuse this for example do it as with one same token.

59
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.870
Now we understand better space.

60
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.310
All right so perfect.

61
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.050
That's another step done.

62
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.310
So now what do we need to do left.

63
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.050
Well we have two remaining steps in the data processing.

64
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.780
I'm pretty excited to be almost done with it because this is not the funniest part but we're almost

65
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.330
done.

66
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.930
And actually these last two steps will be easy.

67
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.190
The first one will be to remove all the non frequent words.

68
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.310
That is the 5 percent least frequent words from all the questions and the clean questions list and the

69
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.530
answers and the clean answers list.

70
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.790
We need to do that besides we'll need to do a less conversion to convert all of these cleaned and filtered.

71
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.660
Questions and Answers to integers that will be our last needed conversion.

72
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.630
And why do we need to make that conversion.

73
00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.770
That's because in the end which is our final step we will sort the questions and answers by the length

74
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.850
of the questions.

75
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.880
And this is very important to do for the training to improve it make it shorter and optimize it.

76
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.160
So we will do these last two steps in the next two tutorials.

77
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.030
And until then and Jaideep been LP.
