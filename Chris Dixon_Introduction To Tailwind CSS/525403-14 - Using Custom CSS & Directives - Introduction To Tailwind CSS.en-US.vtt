00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.535
You Tailwind utility classes has us covered for most use cases.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.430
This is pretty flexible because generally,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.455
one Tailwind utility class is equal to one CSS property.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:20.670
What about if we also wanted to add our own too?

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.430
This is also completely possible.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.100
We can do this by creating our own style sheets.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.035
Into the project and open up the sidebar.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.000
Then alongside our Index page,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.410
create a new file.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.775
This one is the custom.css.

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:42.630
Make sure this is alongside the rest of files and folders.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.230
Then inside here we can add any class as an example.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.290
Let's call this the custom which will set the color to be orange.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.680
This is just regular CSS like we would normally write when we weren't using Tailwind,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.205
and this will set the text color to be orange.

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:04.805
Then just like a regular HTML and CSS project,

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:08.290
we can include this in the head section with a link.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.655
Just blow our Tailwind CSS file, add in a new link.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:19.655
The href is just the custom.css This should now be our file link and we can test this.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:23.970
Let's go for our level one heading and add the class of custom.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.460
Give this a save and over to the browser.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.655
Now we can instantly see that this custom orange class has applied to our text.

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:35.715
This works and if you wanted to,

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:39.065
you could include multiple style sheets into a project.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.420
Sometimes certain plug-ins or libraries have

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.410
their own style sheet which you need to add and you can do it in this exact way.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.790
Or if you wanted to,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.375
instead of having our separate files in its customer's CSS file,

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:55.285
we could instead merge these custom styles into the Tailwind file.

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:58.200
We can do this with a terminal command.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.800
If you don't already have a terminal open,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.990
go to terminal and then new terminal inside a Visual Studio Code.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.800
Then from here, we're going to learn a Tailwind command,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.395
which is npx tailwindcss.

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:17.955
Remember we use any tailwind CLI for this.

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:20.960
What we need to do next is -i and then place

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.250
in it the file path for two different stylesheets.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.920
The first one is going to be./,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.425
and this is the custom.css.

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.830
This points to our custom CSS file which we just created.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.050
Then we use -o,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.565
followed by the file path to our Tailwind CSS.

00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:43.325
What this will do, this will merge our custom file into

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:46.120
the Tailwind file so hit "Enter" and we

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.215
can run this command inside the terminal. Locate this.

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:54.870
Out to our custom file and we can still see that our custom class is in place.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.870
However though, if we go to our tailwind.css

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.660
file rather than all the thousands of classes which we had before,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.455
this is all being completely removed and replaced with our custom CSS.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:08.950
We can also see this if we go to the browser too,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.185
we don't have any of the Tailwind styles.

00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:14.455
We just have our custom orange color for the heading.

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.270
Obviously, this is not right.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.440
We need a way to merge our custom styles with the original Tailwind classes.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.970
What we need to do is to go to our custom CSS file,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.800
and then other top we need to import Tailwind.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.585
To import Tailwind we have various Tailwind directives,

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:33.775
all which begin with the at symbol.

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:36.470
We have @tailwind,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.255
followed by what part of Tailwind we want to import.

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:43.555
Tailwind is organized into different sections.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.690
Remember earlier we said that Tailwind has a set of base styles,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.540
which includes things like resets and styles to make

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.035
our site look more consistent across different browsers.

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:57.350
Well, to begin, we can import these base styles with base.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.040
After this, we'll also include the same Tailwind directive,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.585
but this time we're going to import the components.

00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:07.690
We'll look at the components very soon,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.200
but next, we'll go for the utilities,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.845
the same Tailwind directive,

00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:15.980
and import the utility classes.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.710
Finally, we can import the screens.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:28.160
Screens is the additional Tailwind utilities which begin with these screen prefix.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.270
For example, if we had a prefix begin with SM for the small screens,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.110
or LG for the large screens.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.650
Screens directive is optional.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.290
If we leave this out, it will be automatically added in at the end of the file.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.160
We only really need to include this if we had a use case for reordering this CSS.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.620
Now if we go back to the Terminal and run this same command, press "Up",

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.620
it's entered to run this and then into our Tailwind CSS file,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.090
and then down to the very bottom of

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.035
this file and we see our custom CSS down at the bottom.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:10.880
There's only 800 lines so I've figured we've got an issue just inside here.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.115
As our custom style at the end,

00:05:13.115 --> 00:05:14.725
we've got the screens,

00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:17.200
these should just be utilities.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.760
Save this and since I made a spelling mistake,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.490
I also need to rerun this command in the terminal.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.790
This is done. Let's go back over to our Tailwind file.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.150
You can see we have a lot more styles which are now

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.180
more in line with the original Tailwind file.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.040
Down to the very bottom of this file is our custom class placed at the very end.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.800
This has been added in the same order as you've added all of these into our custom file.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.220
Then back to the browser and the Tailwind styles have now been reapplied.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.510
We can also remove our custom CSS file,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.760
save them back to the browser and our orange color will still

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.085
apply because it's not being merged in with our Tailwind CSS.

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:07.565
That's how we can create our own custom style sheets and include it with Tailwind.

00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:10.040
Next, we'll discover more directives,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.660
help organize our styles.
