00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.510
This wireframe shows that the big layout change

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.660
occurs with the sidebar and the main content.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.915
Small screens are generally stacked vertically and the big screen view is side-by-side.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.665
A common way to do this is with the CSS Flexbox,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:23.970
and Tailwind also has utility classes to do this too.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.230
The two sections which we're going to switch around is the aside section,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.925
and also building down alongside this is the main section.

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:37.070
We can see that both of these sections are child elements to the body,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.270
so let's apply the flexbox to this section.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.630
We're going to put a class, and this is going to contain two classes.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.450
The first one is flex and the second one is flex-col.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.300
The first one or flex,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.265
this will apply the display type of flex and then flex-col.

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:58.985
This is the same thing as setting the flex direction to be column,

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:01.660
which we need for the small screen layout.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.195
This will apply to the aside on the main section.

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:08.795
Now if we save this inside the browser,

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:11.285
we don't see much of a change at the moment.

00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:12.920
We don't see much of a difference,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.520
because the content is already laid out in this way,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.245
but we will change this from flex-col to flex-row in a later video.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.880
As I mentioned in the previous video,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.905
the next thing to do for the small screen view is place all the content in the center.

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:31.310
Way to do this is to go to the aside section.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.035
It already has the class,

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:35.530
so we'll just add some additional ones at the end.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.945
Again, making use of the display type of flex.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:42.425
If we save this, the default for the flexbox is flex-row.

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:44.465
Therefore, if we go to the browser,

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:47.755
we can see all this content is placed across the page.

00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:49.770
Just like above with the body section,

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.205
we can also flip this with flex-col and place the content as columns.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:58.055
To the center of the text, we can use text-center,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:01.720
and this will apply to our heading and also our links.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.860
The text is centered,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.030
but we also need to center the image too.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.860
Since the image is parent,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.995
which is the aside,

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.665
is currently making use of the flexbox.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.240
If we now go down to the image,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.500
we can also use a flex property called self-center.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.700
Self-center is exactly the same as if we had

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.665
our own CSS file and we set the image to be align-self center.

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:33.310
We can see this if we go into the developer tools, right-click and Inspect.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.655
Let's hover over the image elements.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:40.705
This has applied the align-self value to be center.

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:43.760
This now leaves us with pretty much where we need to be for

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.450
the small screen view and also with the aside section.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.875
Let's move further down onto the main content.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:54.080
You can see we have a user's name, an avatar,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.760
the All Products title,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.565
and then two buttons to work with the products.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:02.950
Flexbox will also be useful for this section too.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.435
I can go just below the aside section,

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:08.910
and take a look for the main element.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.880
Open this up and we can place our new content inside.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.510
For the avatar, you will need a picture of yourself to include in the images folder.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.320
Inside of mine, I have an image called me.jpg.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.200
If you don't have a personal image to use for the avatar,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.160
you can instead just use one of these smoothie images as a place holder.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.575
Now let's create the avatar section which will be surrounded in a div.

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:35.775
This div will contain the avatar image.

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:37.995
Jumping to the images folder,

00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:44.260
and the one as mentioned was me.jpg, the alt text.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.730
Then inside of these small tags,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.810
we're going to place in it the user's name.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.650
Put this in, hit Save,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.370
and there's the image and also the text just below.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.150
To make this section look more like a 1,2,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.925
we need to also add some Tailwind utilities.

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.730
For the wrapper inside the div,

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.755
let's put some margin to the top of this element or four.

00:04:08.755 --> 00:04:11.730
This will give us some spacing at the very top,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.100
and also we can make use of the flexbox.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.150
This flexbox will instantly make

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.575
these two elements appear in a row since the default flex direction is row.

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:26.310
Of course, the image is also far too big, so we can add the class.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.400
We can again make use of the width and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.165
the height utilities inside of here, so the height,

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:36.750
the value of eight, and also the same for the width,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.340
just like we used for the number of orders.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.950
We can also apply a rounded edge to this image.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.975
At the rounded value,

00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:47.630
you can add any rounded value inside of here.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.815
I'm just going to keep this as full to add a circle.

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:52.580
Next back to the parent,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.830
we need to align these into the center of

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.435
the content and also align these vertically too.

00:04:58.435 --> 00:05:01.380
Inside the div and it just after the flex,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.200
set the justify content to be center.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.510
This will place all the contents into the center of the section.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.860
Then we also need to take care of the vertical alignment.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.000
We can do this by using items-center.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.705
This will place the text in the center of our image.

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:23.045
Finally onto the text,

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:25.010
we'll just add a class inside of here,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.305
and this will be to set the text color.

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:29.990
Let's go for gray-500,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.000
and also to give some space in from the image,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.615
set the margin on the x-axis to be a value of four.

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:40.955
Good. Moving down from this avatar section,

00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:42.410
we're going to create a new section,

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.630
which is going to be a main wrapper for all of the rest of the content.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.990
Inside the main section,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.655
and just after the final div with a new div elements,

00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:58.090
and this is going to be the container for all of the contents including the table.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.730
To keep things organized, we'll just place a quick comment just above.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.180
We'll say container for all the main content,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.180
including the table, and then inside of this div,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.260
place in a new div inside.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.450
This is also going to be a container.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.165
We'll also add a comment at the top.

00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:23.105
This container will be used to align the All Products title alongside all of the buttons.

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:27.930
The comment will say container to align the buttons and heading.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.255
First of all, we'll place the heading inside.

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:34.190
Heading will be a h2,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.780
and the text of All Products.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.345
Below this, a div which is going to contain the buttons.

00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:45.795
The first one, place an new button element,

00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:48.285
and this will be the text of Add.

00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:51.330
Next, we also need the Plus icon.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.500
Once again, we can make use of a HTML entity.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.765
The plus symbol, we can use the ampersand, the hash,

00:06:58.765 --> 00:07:01.575
the value of 43, a semicolon,

00:07:01.575 --> 00:07:05.490
and then this will add this plus icon inside the button.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.840
We have this All Products title at the very top.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.635
Then this div has the first button of add.

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:16.180
Also alongside this, we have the select option.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.355
Just after the button, place in our select,

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:23.755
and the select means various options.

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:27.650
The first option is going to be the one which the user first sees,

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.510
and this one is going to be Bulk actions.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.840
Duplicate this. The second one is going to be for Edit,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.270
and the final one is going to be to Delete a product.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.765
Let's give this a try. We see the drop-down and also our Add button next to this.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:55.175
Let's now go back to our HTML and apply some utility classes to make this look better.

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:57.670
First of all, the main content wrapper,

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.650
which is the one at the very top,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.965
we can add some spacing on the left and right with px-2.

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:06.745
Then also to apply some space to this avatar section,

00:08:06.745 --> 00:08:11.550
we can also apply some margin to the top. Let's go for eight.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.595
Next, the div wrapper, which contains the heading and also the buttons.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:17.180
To ask some alignments to this section,

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.100
we can make use of the flexbox.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.365
Change the direction to be flex column,

00:08:24.365 --> 00:08:30.445
and then we can begin to align our content, as well items-center.

00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:33.440
This will move all the contents into the center of

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.625
your section when we have the direction set to column.

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.570
To add some spacing between these,

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.825
we'll go down to the level 2 heading and apply some margin

00:08:41.825 --> 00:08:46.220
just onto the bottom of the element with mb-4.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.220
Down to the very last section and we can begin to

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.470
work on our button and also the select inputs.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.140
First of all, the button,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.720
this will have the text color of gray-100.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.265
This light gray color doesn't stand out too good on the white background color,

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:06.400
but we're going to be changing the background color to be indigo,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.230
a shade of 500,

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.645
and this makes it stand out.

00:09:10.645 --> 00:09:13.150
Also, a hover state will again change

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.940
the background color to be a lighter shade of indigo.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.320
Let's go for 400.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:27.220
Good. We also need some padding on the inside of this and also to round the corners.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.590
The padding on the left and right,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:36.375
value 4, will shrink the text to be a small size.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:40.070
Then finally at the rounded edges.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.930
Good, this looks a lot better now and on to the select.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.240
Down to the opening tag.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.820
The name and the ID doesn't really matter at the minute

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.385
because we're not sending our form to a server,

00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:56.810
but we'll just set the name of bulk and also the id to be the same.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.215
The classes, to match our button,

00:10:00.215 --> 00:10:02.870
we'll keep the text to be a small size.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.150
Apply some margin left to give this spaced away from the button,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.380
a padding value of four on the x-axis,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.580
and then we'll also set the border to make this stand out.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.185
To apply a border, we just use the border utility class.

00:10:17.185 --> 00:10:20.020
We can also play around with the color too.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.790
As we looked at earlier with the color utilities,

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.620
we can use the border prefix,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.635
and then you use any one of our colors which you want to.

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:30.800
Let's go for grey-300.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.415
This the rounded edge.

00:10:33.415 --> 00:10:36.880
We can make use of the focus state.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.930
When this element is in focus,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:45.080
we're going to remove the outline and instead replace this with a focus state,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.860
which includes an indigo border with the value of 500.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.765
If we go to the browser, this is looking a lot better now.

00:10:56.765 --> 00:11:00.740
We'll just start small space in it to the y-axis of these elements.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.045
Let's do this inside of the select.

00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:09.210
Alongside the padding, we'll add some padding on the y-axis.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.475
Let's try a value of two.

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:14.860
Good. We'll also do the same for the button.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.035
This now looks much better.

00:11:19.035 --> 00:11:22.130
Just to test out the focus if we click on the browser,

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.490
and then use the tab button to cycle through all of our elements.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.110
Once we get to this select input,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.745
we can see the focus outline,

00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:31.030
which we've changed to be the indigo border,

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.540
giving the user a visual indication of which element is selected.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.995
We're now making good progress with the content and also the small screen view.

00:11:39.995 --> 00:11:44.250
Next we're going to begin working inside of our table.
