00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.915
Tailwind offers us multiple setup options,

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:12.490
depending on what we use to build our website and also what features we want to support.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.975
This video we're going to take a look at some of the different setup options.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:20.335
But first, we need to create a new project.

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:25.840
The project will need a project folder and I'm going to create mine on the desktop.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.285
Right-click "New Folder" and you can place this

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:31.120
anywhere on your machine which you prefer.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.850
Mine would be called the Healthy Juice Bar.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.480
Again, this is optional, you can change the theme and the style of your project,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.250
but mine is going to be based on a juice bar so then different types of smoothies.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.505
Also from the last video you should have downloaded the images and the wireframe,

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.155
you would like to use these.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:54.065
I'm going to can drag these images into the project for later use.

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:55.780
If you do want to use your own,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.140
create an images folder,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.370
and then you can add the different images inside of here.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.400
The only one which you won't have is this picture of me,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.300
but you can download a picture of yourself to use in this project.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.765
Next, open up your Text Editor or Visual Studio Code.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:15.620
Drag over the project folder to open this up.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.060
Then, as always we're creating a new website,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.015
we need to create a new file which is our index.html.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:26.445
You can use the Command or Control N shortcuts,

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:27.930
which will create a new page,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.380
or if you want to you can hover over the title and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.060
sidebar and use this icon to create a new page.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.250
Give this a save, and this is the index.html.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.669
Just before we start writing any code if we take a look at the wireframe,

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:51.265
what we need to do is to first decide what we're going to create first.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:54.920
We can see by these images we have two distinct sections.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.470
We have this sidebar area,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.285
and we also have this main content area over on the right.

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:04.790
The same with the smaller screen we have the sidebar which is

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.285
on top and then the main content area just below.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:11.770
We have two distinct sections which we need to create.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.410
Back to our index page,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.590
if you are using Visual Studio Code,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.420
you can make use of the built-in Emmet command,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.605
which is a shortcut to create our HTML boilerplate.

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:24.515
This is HTML:5,

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:29.275
hit "Enter", this will give us the basic structure which we need.

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:33.150
The document title is Healthy Juice Bar.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.660
As we had seen before inside of the body section we have our two main sections,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.625
and the first one is the aside elements.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:47.780
Also alongside this are the main content section.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.540
Let's begin work inside of the aside section,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.045
we're going to add a little content to work with.

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:56.240
As you can see inside the sidebar on the wireframe,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.195
we have a logo or a image at the very top of the sidebar and then the title just below.

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:04.960
This is the same for both of the layout.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.505
The aside, create the image elements,

00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:11.420
and inside of the supplied images folder,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.640
we have a image which is the logo.png, the old text.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.890
Then just below our image, as we just seen,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.370
we'll create a level one heading for the aside title.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.470
This is the Healthy Juice Bar,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.990
or the name of your choice.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.200
Let's open this up in the browser.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.880
First of all, save this file,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.270
and then I'm going to copy the path to this,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.020
open up Google Chrome and then paste this inside.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.030
A pretty standard look as expected,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.040
we have the image and our title.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.090
Now what we're going to do is to head over to

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.410
the Tailwind documentation and see how we can set this up in our project.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.800
For the Tailwind installation,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.730
we need to go to "Tailwindcss.com",

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.830
and from the homepage, we have a link here to the documentation.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.525
From the documentation the page which we need is this installation link just here.

00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:24.320
This installation page has some different guides on how we

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.100
can set Tailwind up using different frameworks and libraries.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.895
For example, if you use in a Vue or React or Gatsby,

00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:35.150
have some dedicated installation guides for these.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.790
We're going to be keeping it simple and just include

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.565
Tailwind into a regular HTML project.

00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:44.465
Starting with the simplest way which is to use a CDN link.

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:49.670
Over on the right, head down to the link which is using Tailwind via CDN.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.340
This is going to give us a style sheet link which we can

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.380
use to drop directly into our project.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.460
CDN is a content delivery network and it's a way of having our content, in our case,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.395
the Tailwind CSS file,

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:07.535
available across the world in multiple servers or datacenters.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:11.970
If we just copy this link and paste this into a new tab,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.895
this is the CSS file which we're linking to.

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:21.050
Of course, at the moment it does look a little bit of a mess because it's not formatted.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.530
We'll take a better look at this in the Text Editor very soon.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.685
But the key thing to note here is we are linking to a Tailwind CSS file,

00:05:28.685 --> 00:05:31.175
which is hosted on an external server,

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:35.320
rather than downloading this file and including it in our project.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.940
For now let's copy this full link from

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.620
the documentation and then we can

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.740
paste this inside of the head section of our index page.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.785
Give this a save. Now if we go over to our project,

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.495
refresh the browser,

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:55.820
instantly we see a slight change to our content.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.660
This is a good thing because it now means the Tailwind CSS file has now taken effect.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.600
The reason we see a change initially is because of

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.885
a set of base styles which Tailwind will apply.

00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:13.000
These base styles are not really intended to add style into our project, but instead,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.905
they are a set of styles to make our site

00:06:14.905 --> 00:06:18.415
render more consistently across different browsers.

00:06:18.415 --> 00:06:21.940
If you've used a normalized CSS file in the past,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.115
a lot of it is based off this.

00:06:24.115 --> 00:06:27.115
What about Tailwind utility classes?

00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:30.340
Well, these are also available with the CDN link too.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.835
We're going to now take a look at some simple examples inside of here.

00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:38.020
First of all, we'll work on the aside section and all we

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.305
need to do is add a regular class attributes.

00:06:41.305 --> 00:06:45.170
Then add our first utility class which is p-4.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.890
Now if we refresh the browser,

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.900
we can see a padding value of four,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.940
it's being applied to these elements.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.750
Simple enough, the next thing to take a look at is to add a background,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.290
and we can do this with bg,

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.565
followed by the color which I'm going to use as gray.

00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:07.509
Then the shade of gray, which is 800.

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:11.595
We will take a deeper look into all the shades and colors in a future video,

00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:14.805
but for now, this should apply it to our side section,

00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:17.600
given this is dark gray background color.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.090
The image, move down to the image elements and add our class in.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.680
The image will need a height and a width.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.740
Using Tailwind, this is relatively straightforward.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.065
Use h for height,

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.270
the value of 32.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.325
We will take a look at what all of these values mean very soon.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:41.190
The width, we can also do with w and make the square.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.530
We'll keep this as the same value.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.855
Refresh. The size has now taken effect.

00:07:47.855 --> 00:07:51.270
Since we have this dark background gray color,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.865
we also need to add some classes to our H1,

00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:56.895
to make this stand out on this dark background.

00:07:56.895 --> 00:08:00.870
The white color, we can add text, dash, white.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.080
Refresh, and this instantly takes effect.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.075
We can also transform this to be uppercase with this utility.

00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:11.640
We'll have utility classes available for

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.615
almost any type of CSS property, which you want to add.

00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:17.890
We can set the font way and in this case,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.875
let's go for our font medium.

00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:23.460
Save. They should be a little bit bolder than it was previously.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.415
We have lots of different text size and options.

00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:30.340
For this heading, I'm going to go for text to excel.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.050
Last one for the level 1 heading is going to be tracking wider.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.685
This will add some extra space in between our letters.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:43.645
We can already start to see by adding some simple utility class names,

00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:47.145
we can really make a big difference to the styling of our site.

00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:49.770
The CDN link, which we set up at the top,

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.620
is great for learning tailwind,

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.410
and it will be fine for the majority of this course,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.305
and also, some simpler projects too.

00:08:57.305 --> 00:09:00.540
There is also some drawbacks of using it.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.165
We can see some of these if we go back to the Tailwind documentation,

00:09:05.165 --> 00:09:10.080
we can see some of the drawbacks here which we have when using the CDN link,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.400
such as we can't use any directives such as apply,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.350
which we're going to take a look at later on in the course.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.995
Also, we cannot do something called tree shaking,

00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:24.110
which is a way to remove any unused styles from all final builds,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.835
meaning the file size will be larger.

00:09:26.835 --> 00:09:31.729
To help with this, we're going to install tailwind using the CLI.

00:09:31.729 --> 00:09:35.525
Click on the Tailwind CLI link on the right.

00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:38.625
To do this, we need to install node.js,

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:42.145
and we also need to make use of a few terminal commands.

00:09:42.145 --> 00:09:44.225
This can often scare people off,

00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:48.715
but it's really just a few simple steps which I'm going to guide you through.

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:51.270
Let's start by installing node.js,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.925
which is available from nodejs.org.

00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:57.900
I already have node.js setup on my computer,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.805
but if you don't already have this installed,

00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:02.550
go ahead and download the latest version now,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.230
and come back once this has been done.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.670
Once this is done, you can either open up

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.335
your own terminal which you want to use or in my case,

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:13.760
I'm going to keep it simple.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.300
In Visual Studio Code,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.250
if we go to the terminal option,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.115
open up a new terminal from here.

00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:23.775
Once you open up the terminal inside of Visual Studio code,

00:10:23.775 --> 00:10:28.190
it should automatically open up inside of your project directory.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.530
Step 1, is to first make sure we have successfully installed node.js.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.760
The way to do this inside of the terminal,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.410
is write write the command which is node-v.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.550
If this returns back a version number,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.720
this means we successfully installed node.js.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.645
The next thing we need to do is to run the Tailwind CLI.

00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:51.490
For this, let's go back over to the docs.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.835
We can see here we have a command,

00:10:53.835 --> 00:10:57.410
and need to copy this and add this inside of the terminal.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.995
This MPX tool is available since we just downloaded node.js,

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:06.600
which also comes bundled with MPM on this MPX tool.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.240
Let's grab this full command.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.625
Copy this, and paste this inside of the terminal.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:17.685
Hit "Enter". We can agree to install in the Tailwind package.

00:11:17.685 --> 00:11:21.530
Just give this a few moments to set things up.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.440
Once this finishes, we can go into the sidebar.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.060
We can see we now have this tailwind.css file.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.010
This is the same CSS file which we used earlier.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.330
Well, I'm going to link this with the CDN.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.775
We can now see it more clearly since this is formatted inside of the editor.

00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:48.130
The first thing we see at the very top is the set of base styles,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:53.415
which is used to render our site more consistently across different browsers.

00:11:53.415 --> 00:11:57.330
It does things like resetting any padding and margin values,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.690
it will set up default font families,

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.430
and generally give a consistent appearance to our HTML elements.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.240
But what about the utility classes which we've just used?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.395
Well, let's do a search.

00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:14.570
One of the ones which we used before is this background color of gray.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.330
Let's go over to our CSS file.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.520
Use Command or Control F to use the finder.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.020
Let's search for our LBG gray 800.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.595
Further down the CSS file or 15,000 lines into it,

00:12:29.595 --> 00:12:32.415
we can see we have a reference to this class.

00:12:32.415 --> 00:12:35.735
This is setting our gray background color.

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:38.430
Just above, we have the shade of 700,

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.885
which is a lighter version.

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:43.095
We can see, if we scroll up a little bit further,

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.985
we have all of these options,

00:12:44.985 --> 00:12:48.900
which is from gray shade 50 all the way up to 900,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.535
which is the darkest.

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:54.630
We then have the red versions with all the same shade values.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.530
You will also find lots of other colors too.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.765
If an else we've already used is the height class,

00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:07.340
let's do a search for h-32 and take a look for the very first occurrence.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.415
For each one of these values such as 32 or 28,

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:14.455
these will all correspond to a single height value,

00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:16.125
which is in grams.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:19.140
In our case, the h-32,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.655
which we've applied to our image,

00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:23.000
will apply eight rims of height.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.705
We can increase or decrease these values to give us a different RAM value.

00:13:27.705 --> 00:13:32.360
Let's look at one more. We also had four medium just hear.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.920
If we search and we can see the font weight of 500 has been applied.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.650
We also have extra light,

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.675
we have light, normal,

00:13:43.675 --> 00:13:47.970
semi bold, bold, and also extra bold too.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:52.375
Now, we have our own copy of our Tailwind file in the project.

00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:55.760
What we need to do is to replace this CDN link.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.730
Remove this and since our Tailwind file is directly alongside our index,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.830
we can link to this with the name of tailwind.css.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.325
Say this. Refresh the browser.

00:14:09.325 --> 00:14:12.600
All of our same tailwind styles is still applied.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.680
But this time we'll replace the CDN link with our own local version.
