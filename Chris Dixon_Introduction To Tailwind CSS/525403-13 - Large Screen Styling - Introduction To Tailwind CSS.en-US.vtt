00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.310
The y frame shows on the large screen that in the sidebar section,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.200
links are aligned to the left-hand side.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.120
We're going to begin there,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.170
and then move down through the rest of the larger screen styles.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.400
As we know, these links are inside of the UL section amongst the assigned content.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.025
Let's locate. A lot on other list.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.080
We already have the class attribute in place.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.795
All we need to do is to start with our large screen styling.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:33.720
The small screen, we do already have some space on

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.510
the y-axis between each one of our list items.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.690
We will now have more space available.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.145
I'm going to up this to be a larger value.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:46.360
Space y, the value of eight.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.790
The text is going to be left aligned as we've just seen in the y frame.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.145
Now, I have some more space in between each one of these items.

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:58.475
We can also add a little bit of margin on the top and bottom.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.425
Give me some space from the title on this icon.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:10.410
We'll do this with a margin on the y-axis and a consistent value of eight.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.060
This is better, but we also need to align the settings icon too.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.470
Let's go down to our span which wraps this section which is down at the very bottom onto

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.915
the unordered list inside the classes or the large screen only.

00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:30.450
We'll set the text-align to be left.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.660
Good. This is aligned over to the left-hand side,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.160
but if you do look closely,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.370
this is slightly further left than the actual text.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.685
This also needs some padding to movies in line with the rest of the link just above.

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:50.340
For this, we'll add a padding left value of two.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.485
Keeping this now in line with the rest of the links above.

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:56.360
I think the sidebar looks pretty good.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.700
This is all it wants to do for this section.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.405
Now, let's move on to the main content of on the right.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.730
Since we have more space available,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.260
let's start with some padding around this all section.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.980
This full section is the main section,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.030
so let's go into the clusters here and toggle

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.940
the large screens with a padding a value of four.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.700
This looks a little bit better. The next thing to do is to move

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.030
the avatar over into the top right corner.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.600
All the user's avatar and also the name to be in the corner.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.990
Also the editor, we can look for this section.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.110
We need to go just inside of the main section.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.190
This is the first div at the very top.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.960
There's not a lot to do with this section because we already

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.600
have the flex property set for this section.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.445
All we need to do is to override the layout for the large screen view.

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:52.905
We can do this by adding justify-end.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:56.665
Let's move this over to the top right-hand corner.

00:02:56.665 --> 00:03:02.600
This is the equivalent of certainty justify content property to be equal to flex-end.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.150
Moving down, we have the All Products title and also the buttons which I'm going to place

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.150
alongside each other on the same line. Just a little bit further down.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.170
Have our title on this container for the buttons.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.580
This is the surrounding div section just here.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.350
As we said with the comments earlier,

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.670
this is the container to the line,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.665
the buttons and also the heading.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:26.255
Let's add some classes inside of here.

00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:31.695
The large prefix on and since it's already makes use of the flex box and flex column,

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:36.420
all we need to do is to make this equal to flex row.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.790
Let's now place this both of our elements on the same row.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.020
But if you look closely,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.780
the heading is a little higher than it should be.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.985
This is because of some padding we have at the bottom from the small screen view.

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:52.705
For this neat place in an override.

00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:56.405
This is the original margin on the bottom we have here.

00:03:56.405 --> 00:04:01.570
We need to move this for the large screen view by setting this to be equal to zero.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.305
Save. This fixes the alignments,

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:07.460
and also now, we have some more screen space available.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.540
We can make the text a little bit larger. The text.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.490
Let's go for extra-large.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.485
Good. Finally, the spacing between these two sections.

00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:22.380
Since we're also using this flexbox for this section,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.660
we're placing the value of justify between.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.140
Pretty much got the top section where I wanted to be.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.145
The next item on our list is this table.

00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:37.550
The table is not too far away from where we need it to be.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.140
However, though, it would be nice to be full width of the screen.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.310
Let's go to our table section,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:51.490
which is just here, and Tailwind provides us with a class called min-w-full.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.640
Make this the minimum width of the screen.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.315
If you wanted to, we could also place this behind the large media query.

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:04.085
But since there always needs to be the minimum width of the screen on all screen sizes,

00:05:04.085 --> 00:05:08.780
this looks good on the small and the large screen view. We're almost there now.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.360
The final section is this number of products and the links at the very bottom.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.220
All I'm going to do for this section is place both of these items on the same row.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.270
Head to the bottom of the project.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.080
This is the wrapper section.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.965
Like some other sections, since it's also

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:30.935
uses the flexbox and the flex direction of column,

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:34.800
we can change this to be the flex direction of row.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.770
Let's move onto the same section,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.060
but we still need to add some spacing in between both of these items.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.270
Also, remove some of the default margin we have on the top of our links.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.900
First of all, we'll deal with the margin at the top of our unordered list,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.245
which is just here. We can override this.

00:05:55.245 --> 00:05:59.265
To be margin top zero for the large view, meaning,

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:04.285
all we need to do now is to justify the space to be in-between both of these elements.

00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:06.495
We do this on the wrapper.

00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:08.300
At the very end, just after we set

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.470
the flex-row at the large screen utility of justify between,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.150
and this is now exactly how we want it.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.630
This is all now done for the large screen view.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.550
You can see how easy it is to change a layout and a content with just a few overrides.
