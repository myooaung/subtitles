00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.540
Once we've finished our sites and we're happy with the contents,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.380
we can then deploy the site using a service such as Netlify.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.360
If you want to, you can make more changes and customizations to this project.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.460
First, I'm just going to leave it as it is.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.225
Netlify makes it really easy to make our projects go live on the web.

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:26.685
To use it, head over to netlify.com, it's free to use.

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:27.990
If you've not used it before,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.400
you will need to go ahead and create

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.285
a new free account with this sign-up link at the top.

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:36.645
Once you've logged in, you would be taken into an admin area,

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.615
which should look just like this.

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.245
If you have any current site which we used in the past,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.015
this will be available from this link about the top.

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:45.740
To add a new site to Netlify,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.935
we have a couple of different options.

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:50.570
If you're using GitHub, you can use this button at

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.374
the top and link this to your repository.

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:56.120
This has the benefit of it will automatically

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.975
update each time we push any changes to that repository.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.780
Or a really simple way if you don't have

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.980
a repository setup is to just simply drag over our project folder.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.755
This will go ahead and build our sites and then give us a link up at the top,

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:18.860
which we can click on to open up inside of a new tab. Opens up.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.540
This will give us a live website link which we can share with friends and family.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.940
You can see how quick and easy it is to deploy your site using Netlify.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.970
We can also modify this URL too.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.570
If we go into the Domain settings, click on the "Options",

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.475
we can edit our site name,

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:38.550
let's say My super project,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.840
and then we can save this.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.720
Now we can click on this,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.805
open this up in a new tab.

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.470
This will also point to our project.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.785
If you wanted to to a custom domain so we don't have the Netlify app at the very end,

00:01:56.785 --> 00:02:01.415
you can also follow the steps to do this with the Add custom domain button.

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:06.860
That's it. That's how easy it is to deploy a static site using Netlify.
