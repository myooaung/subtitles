00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.720
The final piece of content on this mobile view over on

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.320
the right is going to be the small section down at the bottom.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.770
We have some text which is saying how many products we're showing,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.570
how many products we have in total,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.260
and also the section to flip between each one of these pages.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.720
On the small screen view, this is stacked vertically,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.230
so we have the text on top and then the pagination at the bottom.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.250
We need to insert this section down at the bottom,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.100
so if we take a look for the closing main tag and then just above this final div.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.175
We can then place in a new section for all of this content,

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:40.860
starting with the p elements,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.480
which is the text.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.385
We'll say, showing 10 of 108 products.

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:49.470
Remember, this is completely fictional,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.220
so you can change the numbers.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.965
Next, the unordered list,

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:56.860
our first list item,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.710
and then each page can be inserted as a link.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.480
We don't have any pages to link to,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.845
so we can keep this empty,

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:06.355
and the first one is the number 1.

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:11.970
Let's copy this and paste this in to create four different links.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.730
At page number 2, page 3, and also 4.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.425
Save. There's all content down at the bottom.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:25.770
Remember from the wireframe that's to the left of this number 1,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.675
we have the left angle bracket,

00:01:27.675 --> 00:01:29.950
and then to the right of the number 4,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.230
we have the right angle bracket.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.840
What we're going to do to insert these is to include a span.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.070
We'll insert this inside the list elements and just above the number 1.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.455
We can insert this with a HTML entity,

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:46.840
use ampersand LT, and a semicolon.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.550
To give this some space in it to our number 1,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.020
also add the class,

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.330
which is margin-right, and the value before.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.785
Let's go down to the last list item.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.145
This one is going to go after our number 4.

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:11.050
The span, the entity this time is the ampersand and GT greater than, the semicolon.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.950
This will also have some margin.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.200
But this time, we need to place it on the left.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.935
Let's now get to work on the layout of this section,

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:22.520
and if we start at the main wrapper,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.650
we can make use of the flex-box.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.965
Control this on the small and the large screen view.

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:30.740
For the small screen, like most of the content,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.260
this will be laid out as columns.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.630
The items will be in the center.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.130
Add some spacing on the top and bottom at the padding y-value of six.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.900
A text will be a little bit smaller,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.075
so we use text-SM,

00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:50.985
and also a lighter weight too.

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:53.400
The text just below is fine,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.995
so we'll move on to the unordered list and the numbers need to be placed across the page.

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:01.285
This will also make use of the flexbox.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.845
The default flex-direction is row,

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.325
which places these across the page.

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:11.500
We'll add some space into the text above with mt-4.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.260
There's not a lot more left to do for this section,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.865
we'll just add some space in it to these numbers.

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:23.055
We'll do this inside the a-elements and the class of p-2.

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:27.750
We can also copy this and add this to each one of our numbers.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.620
Good, so just as a finishing touch for this section,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.915
we're going to highlight this at number 1.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:39.875
This is just to let the user know exactly which page they will be on.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:43.105
As ever will do is by adding it some utilities.

00:03:43.105 --> 00:03:46.820
First, we'll change the text color to be gray,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:54.120
a shade of 100, the background would be bg-indigo-500.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.165
The hover effects we'll also make this an indigo color.

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:00.800
Well, just like we did with the edit button,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.185
this will be a slightly different shade.

00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:06.200
The hover state for this element,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.840
the background, indigo-400,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.260
and run off the edges with rounded-full.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.310
Good. This is the final section I'll

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.475
complete and also all the content which we need for this project.

00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:24.520
Going forward, what we're going to do is make

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.800
this content more suitable for larger screens,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.865
and also learning about more of the features which Tailwind has to offer.

00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:33.670
Just a few little things though, before we move on,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.055
starting with the background for this main section,

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:39.970
let's locate the opening main tag,

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.770
which is near the top of the body.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.975
That's this side and the main section.

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:53.980
Place in a class, which is going to be bg-grey-200.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.930
We could keep it simple like this if we wanted to and add

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.110
a single shade of gray or any other color.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.235
Or, if we wanted to, we could also set this up as a gradient.

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:09.339
Gradients are available in regular CSS

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:13.040
and allow us to blend between two or more different colors.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.645
You can go extreme and blend between two opposite colors,

00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:21.865
but I'm going to keep things nice and subtle and change between two similar shades.

00:05:21.865 --> 00:05:25.060
The way we could do this, instead of the gray color,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.790
is to set the background to be a gradient,

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.660
followed by the direction of the gradient.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.060
Mine is going to be to-r. This will change color from left to right.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.895
If you wanted too, you could also change this to be the top,

00:05:39.895 --> 00:05:43.210
the bottom or left, a long way to combining them too.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.375
For example, tr would be the top right,

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:50.100
and tl would be the top left with a space between.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.210
We then use,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.540
the to and from to set the colors which you want to use.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.330
To make them all visible, let's add a red and blue value to begin with.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.975
We'll say from red-200,

00:06:02.975 --> 00:06:08.025
and then we'll go to a blue value of 100.

00:06:08.025 --> 00:06:09.880
This now makes it more visible.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.080
We have the red color,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.870
which we started from over on the left,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.950
and then we move over to

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.450
the right direction and transform this to be the blue color, which we see here.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.000
But as mentioned, I'm going to keep this a little bit more

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.970
subtle and change both of these to be gray.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.010
But do feel free to play around with any of

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.145
these colors or any other pieces of style in which you want to.

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:38.620
Moving on, we also need to add some space in just above this table.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.660
If we scroll down just a little bit,

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.525
we can see we have the container which we created earlier,

00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:46.085
and this is used to wrap our buttons.

00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:48.910
Add some spacing, we can add some margin onto

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.345
the bottom of this section with a value of six.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.175
To round off this video,

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:56.800
just like we have done with this number 1 at the bottom,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.440
the highlights of the user that we're on, page 1.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.535
We're also going to highlight the product link at the top.

00:07:02.535 --> 00:07:05.300
This is because we are on the all products page,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.010
so it makes sense to let the user know which page is active.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:15.585
Put this back to the editor and scroll up the product's link at the very top.

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:17.120
Then, inside the classes,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.100
we'll start by adding the background to be gray-500.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.750
This now lets the user know that the product's page is now active.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.840
The small screen setup is now complete.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.600
Coming up, you will learn about more of what Tailwind has

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.090
to offer, including responsive design.
