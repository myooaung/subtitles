00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.120
The wireframe for the small screen over on

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.450
the right has a table which we're going to now work on.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.715
Tables of data for this kind of product could also contain many more columns too.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.165
Since the width of the screen on a small device is limited,

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.490
rather than reduce the size of this table and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.100
try to squeeze everything on a small screen.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.130
I think the best thing to do in this case is to allow the user to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.070
swipe to the right to view the rest of the table data.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.030
In the previous video, we added this comment at the top around this div,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.935
which was the main container.

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:41.200
This contains all the content which we created and also the table.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.765
What we need to do is to locate the closing tag,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:46.580
which is just above the main,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.805
and keep this table section inside.

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:54.910
For this, create a new section and then inside our table.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.220
The reason we've added this surrounding section around

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.460
our table is to add an overflow class.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.200
We'll see the result to this in just a second if we add the class on

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.105
the utility of overflow dash x, dash auto.

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:16.475
This utility is the same as the regular CSS overflow x property.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:18.745
We've set the value to auto.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.770
This means if the content is too wide for the screen,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.645
which will be the case for our table,

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:26.045
rather than hide the table or cut it off,

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:28.900
a scroll bar will then be introduced.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.150
Inside the table, add our first element which is t-head.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.820
This is going to be the wrapper for all of

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.600
our table headings place in a class of bg-gray-100.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.280
Then inside of here we add our first row.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.055
With tables, we use the tr for table row.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:50.855
Then each one of the headings will be surrounded in the th element.

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:55.195
The first one, if you remember from my wireframe, is the item.

00:01:55.195 --> 00:02:02.610
The second one, the status of the item and the third one is for the category,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.580
the stock level, the price.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.700
Then finally a Edit button.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.000
Let's save this and see what happens inside the browser.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.425
I'm going to setup the live server to open, update the changes.

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:23.840
There's our table heading across the page.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.795
As expected, we need to add some utility classes,

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.190
make this look a lot better.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.665
For the th elements,

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:33.925
for the headings, place in the class.

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:38.265
First of all, some padding on the x-axis six.

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:40.785
I need texts over on the left.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.690
We can also make the text extra small

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.080
or medium to make this stand out and a little bit bolder.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.615
Then a color for the text,

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:57.165
which is going to be gray 500 and turn this to be uppercase.

00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:00.545
Then at the very end we're going to add one more utility class,

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:03.385
which is going to be tracking wider.

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:08.000
If you take a close look at the item before we save this, hit "Save".

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.020
This will increase the letter spacing.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.920
With this one now in place,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.635
we'll copy the full class attribute and at least each one of our table headings.

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:22.165
The second one, the category,

00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:25.550
the stock, the price,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.075
and finally the edit section.

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:30.250
If you remember from the wireframe,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.765
the first cell over on the left also has a check box to select all of our items.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.715
This is going to be inside of the first table heading.

00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:41.770
Just before the item text,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.630
place in the input.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.970
The input is the type of checkbox

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.980
and also to give some space in it to the text which is just alongside.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.695
We can also add the class to give it some margin on the right and the value of four.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:01.930
What we now have is a table heading with two pieces of information.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.580
We have the inputs and also the text.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.620
We also need to do some alignments,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.505
make this appear alongside each other inside of the cell.

00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:12.845
We can add some padding and alignment to the section.

00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:15.065
I'll just do over in the class.

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:17.660
We'll add some padding on the y-axis.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.090
The value of four just gives us a little bit more vertical space in.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.580
Now we need to figure out a way to place the checkbox alongside our item text.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.600
Well, we can do this by changing the table heading to make use of the flexbox.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.055
Remember by default the flexbox has the flex direction of row.

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:42.350
This means that both of the child elements will be placed alongside each other in a row,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.200
leaving our head section now completed and

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.590
our table now ready to add some data in the upcoming video.
