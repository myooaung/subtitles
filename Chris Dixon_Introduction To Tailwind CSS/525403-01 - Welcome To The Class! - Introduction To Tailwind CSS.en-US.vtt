00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.885
When it comes to building websites,

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.660
most of us fall into two groups,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.840
we're either a designer or a developer.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.180
Personally, I'm not the best designer out

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.330
there but I still need my websites to look good,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.790
and this is where Tailwind comes in.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.180
It is also other frameworks and libraries available

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.395
but many of them enforce their own strict way of doing things.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.665
We can write our HTML as we would normally do,

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.865
and then make use of the carefully designed class names.

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:38.610
All utility classes to provide a clean and professional look to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.874
your all project all while staying inside of our HTML.

00:00:42.874 --> 00:00:47.000
This is especially useful for when a project grows rather than

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.325
consistently thinking of new class names and ever-growing style sheets.

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:56.405
Tailwind offers a consistent design system which your whole team can use.

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:01.610
Buying simple utilities for controlling almost everything such as spacing,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.020
colors, typography, responsive design, and layout.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.740
As somebody who admittedly isn't the best designer out there,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.100
Tailwind has really helped give my website a professional base to build on.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.945
It's currently my go-to when beginning a new project.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:23.450
Allow me to focus on what I do best. How does it work?

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.685
Once Tailwind is included in your project and we'll cover how to do this in the class,

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.400
using it in your project is easy.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.940
We begin by adding our HTML just as we would normally do,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.280
add the content to the screen.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.370
This example shows a section containing some text

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.540
inside without any styling you see in the bottom right corner.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.020
This looks pretty boring on the screen.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.650
Staying here inside of our HTML,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.795
Tailwind provides us with these utility classes which we can apply.

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:56.960
Starting with these section wrapper I've added three of

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.415
these classes which are pretty descriptive for each one does.

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:02.705
Each class does one simple thing,

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.995
and the first one is bg-gray-800.

00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:08.655
This sets the background to be gray,

00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:10.920
and then you shade of 800.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.495
We'll also look at the color palettes later in the course too.

00:02:14.495 --> 00:02:17.930
P-six is a pattern value of six and we can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.695
increase or decrease this number with more or less space in.

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:26.135
Text-center is used to center the text contained inside.

00:02:26.135 --> 00:02:28.580
Of course, the text inside is now hard to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.090
read so we'll move on to styling the p-elements.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.055
Again, we add the class attributes that is elements,

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:39.370
and just like the outer wrapper we again make use of the color of gray.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.725
But this time we apply the lighter shade of 200.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:49.115
Text-lg is for larger text and font medium is the font weight which we're going to apply.

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:54.560
The result is a clean-looking section without even writing any CSS code.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.995
Also, we don't want every site which we create to look the same,

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:01.025
and we can still write our own styles if we want to.

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:07.410
Tailwind has lots of customization options available to make our site more unique.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.680
This class you'll learn about

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.550
these utilities and so much more that Tailwind has to offer.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.300
All while building a Dashboard style admin project,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.650
display a list of products available in our store.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.570
As we see here it will be responsive and it will take

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.095
care of the large and the small screen layout.

00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:30.740
This class is beginner-focused although you should be comfortable

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.360
with HTML and CSS before learning Tailwind.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.925
Tailwind is a great skill to learn,

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:41.820
and I'm looking forward to teaching you all about it during this class.
