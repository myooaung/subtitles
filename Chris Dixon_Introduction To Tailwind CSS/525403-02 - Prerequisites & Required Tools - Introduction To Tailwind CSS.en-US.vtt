00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.490
Tailwind is a CSS framework, and therefore,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.310
it's essential that you at least understand the basics of

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.075
HTML and CSS before taking this course.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:17.480
If you've used HTML and CSS in the past,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.635
either during existing course,

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:20.940
one of my courses,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.085
or built any simple project,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.140
you should be good to go.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.350
There is very little which you need to take this class.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.155
If you've built any kind of website in the past,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.320
you probably already have these skills which you will need.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.660
A text editor is essential,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.985
and I'll be using Visual Studio Code.

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:42.715
You can download this, or you can use any other which you prefer.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:45.910
If you need to download, the website is over on the right,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.390
which is code.visualstudio.com.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.580
It's available for free on Mac,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.125
Windows, and Linux.

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:54.670
If you don't already have one,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.200
go ahead and download this.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.500
A terminal is also required too.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.720
Don't worry if you've never used one.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.270
We just need a few simple commands.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.300
Visual Studio Code comes with a terminal already pre-built in,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.745
or if you already have a standalone terminal which you prefer to use,

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.480
this is completely fine too.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.525
There is no additional tools which we need to subscribe to, or purchase.

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:21.880
Any other tools or software we need,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.340
we will download as we go through the course.
