00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.150
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to start off our discussion by talking about the very basics

2
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.980
of CSX CSA stands for cascading style sheets and it's a style sheet language used for describing the

3
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.530
presentation of a document written in H.

4
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.000
But basically that means is that CSSA allows us to change style attributes of to him l elements and

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.980
that can be things like the color of an element the background of an element the borders of an element

6
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.870
and much much more.

7
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.970
First we need to do is actually create a CSSA file in order to effect those style attributes.

8
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.200
So the very basics as far as the steps we need to take is we're going to create a file for Dotsie SS

9
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.790
extension then we're going to use CSSA syntax to link element tags.

10
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.030
Then we're going to add style attribute name value pairs such as connecting the color attribute to a

11
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.590
specific value like red or blue.

12
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.610
And then finally we connect that CSSA document to our HVM l through a call in the head of the HMO.

13
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.180
Now I know it sounds like a lot but in practice it's actually very simple.

14
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.520
Let's get started by heading over to our text editor right here am back at the text editor and they

15
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.410
have my browser linked to the H Tim L file.

16
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.660
What I'm going to do is just type up h tim will enter so it has the auto complete and then inside the

17
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.470
body.

18
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.880
I'm going to add a few elements I'll add a Heading 1 and say this is the heading and then I will add

19
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880
a paragraph to that as well.

20
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.140
And the paragraph will say let's see a list.

21
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.650
Then after that I'll have an ordered list.

22
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.450
And then inside this ordered list I have a few list items such as Item 1 and let's add two more items

23
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.930
here.

24
00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.940
Item to and then Item 3 and then below this ordered list let's add one more thing we'll say heading

25
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.410
for and I'm asking a straight up type heading for OK.

26
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.790
I save that I'm going to refresh my browser and now I see this link to the HMO.

27
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.660
This is the heading.

28
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.480
Let's see a list item one two and three and then heading for.

29
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.640
Now what I'm going to do is try to affect the style properties of these Timah elements using CSSA and

30
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.790
the way I do that is first I need to create a new file.

31
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.880
So if I open up my left hand tab here notice under this folder flask examples I have basic Laddie's

32
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.640
Timo.

33
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.960
I'm going to create a new file here and you can really call this whatever you want.

34
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.270
I'm going to call it Master dot C Ss.

35
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.250
Again the actual name doesn't matter.

36
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.480
You just need to make sure that you're ending it with Dot CSSA.

37
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.190
That way Adam knows that you're talking about SS or a stylesheet file.

38
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:04.080
Ok so I have this master that CSSA file what I want to do is add property value pairs to this and the

39
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.000
general format is the following.

40
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.950
You have some sort of selected tag such as H-1.

41
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.160
So this is a tag that's in my name I'll file.

42
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.530
Here we see the H-1 tag and then you have curly braces.

43
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.420
Open and close curly braces and then inside of these curly braces Usually you'll see it formatted like

44
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.680
this.

45
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.220
If you hit enter you have the open and close.

46
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.400
And here is where you have those property value pairs.

47
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.180
So for example one of the really common properties is the color property.

48
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.600
So every single A-stan mint usually has some sort of color property you can mess around with or change.

49
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.330
So you have the property and then you'll say colon and then the actual value.

50
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.970
This property should have.

51
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.040
So for example colors can be names or coats.

52
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.220
So I'll say blue and then to end this I have a semi-colon.

53
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.110
So that way I know I have this single property value pairing.

54
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.300
So check this out.

55
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.470
I then to save this you'll notice if I refreshed my page I don't see anything change.

56
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.930
And that's because I haven't linked this dot CSSA file to my basic but each team l file.

57
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.010
So let's go ahead and show you how you can do that.

58
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.840
What you do is inside of this head block in between the opening head tag and the closing head Ted you're

59
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.650
going to start with a link and you can hit enter here and have it auto complete this link.

60
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.500
I'm going to collapse that sidebar so we can see the whole thing.

61
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.510
And basically a link right here is a self-closing tag doesn't have the closing tags just a single tag.

62
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.410
And we have some sort of relationship attribute and it's saying stylesheet we want to keep that because

63
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.100
this is going to tell the HTL hey this link it's a stylesheet implement those styles on the T.M..

64
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.120
What we need to change is this breath.

65
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.600
Basically this is where you provide the file path to your thoughts CSSA file.

66
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.720
And right now I'm just going to say it's under M. thought SS Remember you're gonna need to provide whatever

67
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.570
you called your C Ss file.

68
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.800
You should also know that right now this master CSSA file.

69
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.130
If I expand this tab again it's in the exact same folder location as my H Tim L file.

70
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.380
So that's why I just need to provide its name.

71
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.660
That's VSS all right so let's check this out.

72
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.120
I'm gonna save those changes it makes T.M..

73
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.990
And now I should have linked my CSSA file successfully to my HMO.

74
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.560
I'm going to refresh.

75
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.660
And now you should see this is the heading turned blue.

76
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.310
So what's actually happening here.

77
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.340
Well the C S S you're saying grab every H-1 elements.

78
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.660
Curly braces and then change these properties to be these values and you can check out resources that

79
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.060
are linked to you in the resource section of this course.

80
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.060
But basically you have resources like W3 schools and the Mozilla and the documentation that shows you

81
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.070
all the various properties and values you can adjust.

82
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.540
We will be missing of too many properties but color is one that you probably want to adjust often.

83
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:10.910
OK so let's explore how to adjust more property tags or elements in sort of Timo.

84
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.510
So right now we're affecting every single H-1.

85
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.950
Let's see if we can effect list items.

86
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:25.030
So I'll say I open and close parentheses and then I decide on a property and the value so I can take

87
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.570
in color as a property again.

88
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:33.030
And there's many string codes you can provide as the actual value but often you are looking for specific

89
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.550
colors maybe not something that you can find in a Crayola box like blue or red.

90
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.630
Instead you want a particular shade.

91
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.550
One way to do this is by defining R.G. be values.

92
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.060
So what this stands for are red green and blue.

93
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.370
So maybe I want a little bit of red in there 30 and then you can go up to 200 and then maybe I don't

94
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.860
want any blue there.

95
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.730
So there's a little bit of red and mostly green.

96
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.940
I'm going to save that.

97
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.460
And then when I save those changes I'm basically saying grab every Leithead.

98
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:12.680
So that's going to be item one item to item three here and then affect the colors using this RGV scale.

99
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.380
So if I refresh now I see them turn essentially green and what I can do is if I want to affect them

100
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.130
I can add maybe some more blue in there.

101
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.990
So we'll say 100 save that.

102
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.620
And if you refresh.

103
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.760
You should see the changes.

104
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.070
Now right now it's not making a big difference so let's reduce the green to something really small maybe

105
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.300
like 50 save those changes refresh.

106
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.790
And I get to see that blue come in.

107
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.640
OK.

108
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.290
So in other way you can affect colors.

109
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.340
And let's do it now.

110
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.680
The paragraph tag again we choose the tag that we're trying to affect inside the T.M..

111
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.480
I'll say color.

112
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.730
And another way you can do this is using a hex code to just say hash tag.

113
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.070
And then the hex code.

114
00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:02.210
And if you're unfamiliar if choosing R.G. or hex code values come to your browser and search for Hex

115
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:08.750
color and you should see a hex color picker automatically show up in Google.

116
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:14.210
Again that's just hecks color in Google and you'll see this automatically show up and now provides the

117
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.980
hex code as well as the R.G. code.

118
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.440
So you can move this around and choose a color that works for you.

119
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.880
So let's try to choose maybe a unique orange.

120
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.720
So this one is OK.

121
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:32.000
So going to copy this hex code and then I'll paste it in here.

122
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.300
Inside my CSSA file.

123
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.000
And then what I should do is close this off of a semi colon.

124
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.490
You'll notice they didn't close off the one inside the list of a semi-colon.

125
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.490
Basically you need to use semi-colons when you have more than one property value pairs.

126
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.530
So it's always good just to have them in there even if you only have one property value pair per element.

127
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.120
So let's save those changes.

128
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:58.620
We'll head back to our basic H-2A model and when I refreshed this now I see the paragraph tag looks

129
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.480
like that orange.

130
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.810
Let's see a list.

131
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.970
OK.

132
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.040
And finally the last one we can affect color.

133
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.030
Let's do on H for that last heading there.

134
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.230
I'll say color Colin.

135
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.920
And then I can also use an R G B A value.

136
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.840
And basically what this allows you to do is add a for value instead of just red green blue.

137
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.960
A For value of transparency.

138
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.160
So that's what Alpha stands for.

139
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:33.120
So maybe I'll do like 13 ninety one 40 in if I just choose 0 here hit save and then refresh.

140
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.080
You'll notice it looks like heading disappeared.

141
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.880
But it's actually still there it's just fully transparent.

142
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.210
So if you only want it to be maybe half transparent you'll say 0.5.

143
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.310
Save this.

144
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.120
And then when I refresh the page.

145
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.470
Now I can see that it looks a little transparent.

146
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:54.440
And if I have this fully at one save that and refresh then it has no transparency.

147
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.640
So basically zero is fully transparent and one is fully opaque.

148
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.010
So that's a fourth value you can add in in case you want your font to maybe color wise blend into the

149
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.100
background a little bit.

150
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.450
So that's R.G. B.

151
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.430
And then this alpha parameter for transparency.

152
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.400
OK.

153
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.020
So that's the very basics of a CSSA file.

154
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:19.760
Again we have to do is we choose the element that we want to affect inside the h m l.

155
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.590
We have these open unclose curly braces.

156
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.960
We choose the property and we'll be exploring different properties throughout these lectures.

157
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.420
And then you choose a value for that property.

158
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.270
Color is one of those properties that has a lot of different types of inputs.

159
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.920
Later on we're going to see other properties that are a little more strict than the type of inputs.

160
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.240
Now that's actually a good thing that we don't need to remember all these different possibilities.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.610
Often what I like to do is just open up that hecks color picker choose a color and then kind of play

162
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.960
around with it and later on we'll learn about bootstrap which has its own default styles.

163
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.870
But once you've created this CSSA file all you need to do is make sure that you've linked to the H team

164
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.400
L.

165
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.240
So you create this link set the relationship to the string stylesheet which is the default and then

166
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.860
make sure your breath is pointing to whatever your CSSA file is called.

167
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.390
OK that's the very basics of creating CSSA and linking it to your Each table.

168
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.600
We'll see you at the next lecture.
