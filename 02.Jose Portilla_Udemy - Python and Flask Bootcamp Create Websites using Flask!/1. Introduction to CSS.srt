Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:13,400
We just finished our team crash course and now it's time to move on to talking about C Ss and this crash

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,880
course.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,360
We have a few goals we want to complete by the end of this section.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,250
Once you've gone through this CSSA crash course you should understand how to connect H.T. e-mail to

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,880
your C Ss understand basic CSSA syntax.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,650
Understand selector types.

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,430
Be able to perform element inspection inside your browser and then finally connect CSSA fonts.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,970
If you already have an understanding of just connecting stylesheets the H Tim L in general you can feel

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,330
free to skip this section of the course.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,670
All right let's get started.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,740
I'll see in the next lecture.
