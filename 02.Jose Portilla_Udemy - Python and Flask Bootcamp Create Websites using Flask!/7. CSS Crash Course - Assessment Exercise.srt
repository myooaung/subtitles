00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,210
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,450
Let's finish off this section for a quick assessment of your new skills.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,450
So in order to master new skills we have an assessment exercise.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,510
You'll notice that there's three files inside that CSSA folder.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,020
Two of them are the C Ss assessment that h t m l and the CSSA assessment thought see SS go ahead and

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,750
open those and your text editor.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,290
There's a corresponding solution file that we're gonna go over in the next lecture.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,780
So don't open that yet unless you actually want to view the solutions.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,590
Let's jump to the text editor and see what the assessment looks like.

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,920
All right.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,750
Here we have the assessment.

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,090
Al file opened.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,530
So this year assess assessment and you'll notice that it's actually linked right now to the solutions

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,420
so you should link it to your own assessment.

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,840
That way you can actually edit the CSSA file.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,650
So basically what we have here is an H-2A HTML file for a bunch of different objects and elements and

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:59,440
it has a Heading 1 Welcome to the puppy blog division right here called with a connection to some class

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,240
that we have a heading to a paragraph an ordered list.

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,210
Notice there's a link to Google dot com here and then we have another heading.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Please log in.

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,900
And then a form that can take in some inputs and at the end we have another division class called Exit

22
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,240
another paragraph and then a text area and that's it in the body.

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,830
Well your job is to come over to the CSSA file for the assessment see assess and you have a variety

24
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,680
of tasks.

25
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,700
For example the first task is to give the entire body element of the site a light gray background using

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,550
a hex code.

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,630
So what are you going to do for each of these tasks is basically come in grab the element that it's

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,860
referring to and then adjust the property it's referring to.

29
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,300
So in this case it would be your background their background color and then you would find the hex code

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,660
to make it gray.

31
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,760
So all you need to do is go along through each of these tasks and edit the actual properties.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,000
H team L and keep it open in your browser so you can adjust and check to see if the changes are occurring

33
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,380
as you would expect.

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:06,550
What I would recommend doing as well is right clicking on one of these and then saying split right or

35
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,020
split left and then if you close the sky you can have both of them open at same time.

36
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,690
And if you zoom out you're able to directly compare tasks here in the CSSA to the actual elements in

37
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,340
the HTML file.

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,750
All right I hope that's useful to you if you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

39
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,670
But again the main idea here is to just follow the tasks in the CSSA file and complete the assignment

40
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,110
in the very next lecture.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,080
We'll go over an example solution for completing these tasks.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,660
We'll see other.
