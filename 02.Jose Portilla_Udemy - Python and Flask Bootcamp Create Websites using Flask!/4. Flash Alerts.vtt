00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.100
Welcome back in this lecture we're going to briefly show you how you can flash messages to a user often

2
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.030
and want to send the message to the user that we don't need to save or fix permanently to the template

3
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.580
page and we really need to save it toward database.

4
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.680
Instead we just want to show a quick either confirmation or message display to the user that they can

5
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.320
then quickly close things like saying thank you for submitting your form on the same page.

6
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.110
What we can do is we can use flash from flask to actually flash a message to the user that can later

7
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.260
on be close by that same user and flask actually makes that really easy.

8
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.910
All you need to do is you import a flash function from flask and then you can connect it to some bootstrap

9
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.920
code where you show you how to do all this.

10
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.780
Keep in mind we're going to be visiting the bootstrap documentation and the link for that code is inside

11
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.300
of the html file for this lecture.

12
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.240
So let's head over to our browser and our text editor.

13
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.500
All right.

14
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.360
Here you have an empty pie script.

15
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.930
We're just going to continue getting practice for our usual imports and our usual setup.

16
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.110
So I'll start from scratch.

17
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.860
We're going to say from flask import flask.

18
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.000
We're also going to be importing rendered template flash which we haven't done before and will say session

19
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.800
redirects and let's say you are l4.

20
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.820
So these are going to be the common imports that you do when actually get these all of them right now.

21
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.120
But just once you get the feel for importing those things often don't say from flask WTA if we're going

22
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.540
to import a flask form and then from W.T. farms import.

23
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.600
And we're gonna have a string field and a submit field.

24
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.820
All right.

25
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.290
Those are all our imports.

26
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.600
We set up our flask application like always passen name.

27
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.810
And then because we actually have a form we need to configure our secret key.

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.580
So we all say secret underscore key and then set it equal to some string will say Mikey and then we

29
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.320
can say class and let's just create a very simple form.

30
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.240
So we will call this class simple form and it will inherit from flask form.

31
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.800
And here we're just going to have it say submit equal to submit field click me.

32
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.960
So we're not even going to use a Streatfeild for this very first example.

33
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.100
It's just essentially one button on this form and let's connect that now to the home page will say app

34
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.200
thought route connected to the home page.

35
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.580
Remember when we have a form on this page when you say methods is equal to the list gets and post and

36
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.990
then we'll say index.

37
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.110
Make sure you spell that right.

38
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.690
We're going to create an instance of the form by saying Form is equal to simple form instance of it

39
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.750
and then just like we've done before we'll say if form validate on.

40
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.500
Well no wonder I'm not getting the complete form validate on submit.

41
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.450
I'm going to now call flash and and then be able to flash a message to the user.

42
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.470
So here I imported flash from flask and then I'm going to be able to flash a message to the user upon

43
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:23.070
submission so we can say a flash and say you just click it's the button and then I'm going to say return

44
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:33.880
and we're going to redirect your L4 index and then I'm going to have another return and we'll say render

45
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:43.550
a template and we'll say index the H T.M. where form is the form.

46
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.480
At the very bottom of all this will say if name is Eagleson mean take her app and run it.

47
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.060
I'll say de-bug a sequel to true.

48
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.590
All right so let's break down what we've done here.

49
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.550
I set up my imports create an application set up my secret key have a very very simple form here.

50
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.750
Basically it's just one button.

51
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.680
That's all the user can do that can just hit click me and then all we do is inside of our home page

52
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.720
called index.

53
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.460
We create a simple form and at the very first pass they haven't actually click the button.

54
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.040
Meaning this if statement hasn't executed yet.

55
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.390
So we just render the template for the H T.M. which I have open right here.

56
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.780
There's nothing in it yet.

57
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.400
And then we pass in the form.

58
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.050
Again that's just one button.

59
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.660
Then if the form is valid on submission.

60
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.640
Basically if they click the Submit field then will flash to the user.

61
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.200
Hey you just click the button and then we're going to return a redirect your L for index which basically

62
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.170
means we're going to serve that same home page again.

63
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.340
So now it's actually set up our index h tim L to do this.

64
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.260
Now for this we're going to use a little bit of bootstrap code.

65
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.270
This is the kind of code that you look up in the documentation of bootstrap.

66
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.020
Instead of having to memorize it let me show you where I can find this code on the bootstrap documentation.

67
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.670
So I have here the bootstrap docs right now we're looking at the version for 4.1.

68
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.370
We should be able to do this for the various versions.

69
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.520
Go ahead and click on the documentation and then what you're looking for is a alert component.

70
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.380
So if we come here to components it's actually the very first one is called alerts and then you see

71
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.110
various examples of alerts.

72
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.070
Here we can see some very simple alerts that essentially when someone said hello you can see the various

73
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.740
colors and the classes that are associated with them.

74
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.310
So we have class alert alert primary and you also say roll alert.

75
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.430
You'll notice the links on these alerts.

76
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.760
So here's a secondary alert link example.

77
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.340
You also see additional content so you can kind of large alerts here and then you have one that's a

78
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.410
little more complicated this dismissing.

79
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.630
So that's the one we're going to be using and I'm going to zoom in here.

80
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.050
So it says Holywell Kamali you should check in some of these fields below.

81
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.890
So that's the alert we're going to kind of show.

82
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.480
And what's also nice is it has a little dismiss button.

83
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.030
So we're going to be able to exit out of this and then the alert goes away.

84
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.670
And this is the code we're going to be using here.

85
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.260
So in case you're wondering where the heck did this code come from.

86
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.200
It's coming from this bootstrap page for this missing.

87
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.940
And you can either copy it directly from the documentation here and then edit it or you can copy and

88
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.010
paste it from are provided notes.

89
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.660
So let's get started.

90
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.810
Since we're using an alert we're going to need to connect not just the stylesheet for bootstrap But

91
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.790
we also need connect to Jake Query.

92
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.950
And again let me just bring in the documentation real quick second show where this coat's coming from.

93
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.110
If you go back to home notice we have the CSSA only.

94
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.670
That's just for the styling since we actually have interactivity on the page.

95
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.580
We're going to need to copy and paste these three lines as well.

96
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.650
You're going to put those all in the head of your T.M..

97
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.310
So go ahead and type out HTL led auto complete and then inside this head you're going to copy and paste

98
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.990
those four lines of code.

99
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.650
So from the documentation inside the head I'm going to copy and paste the stylesheet that's that C Ss

100
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.590
and then the three source lines for Jake Query.

101
00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.630
So there's our head.

102
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.000
And then we have the body.

103
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:08.130
So what we're going to do now is essentially copy and paste from that bootstrap page that described

104
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.760
how to actually display the flashed messages in order to do this.

105
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:22.200
We're going to do is the following were to say a little bit of control flow logic for mess in get flashed

106
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:33.970
messages and then here we're going to say and for me explain what this block of code is doing right

107
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.830
now you maybe wondering where is this get flash messages come from.

108
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.800
Because it's actually not in the bootstrap code.

109
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:47.500
This get flashed messages is what gets passed back when you call flash function from flask.

110
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.490
So again when you call flash that you import up here what happens is flask then automatically sends

111
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.050
back this object called Get Flast messages.

112
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.190
And the reason we do a for loop here is because you may have multiple flashes.

113
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.610
You could do something like Flash.

114
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.150
You click the button and then have another flash.

115
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.160
Hey how is it going.

116
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.370
And so on.

117
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.350
So we'll just do one single flash right now.

118
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.030
But it sends back an iterator of all these flashes.

119
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.440
So that way you can actually loop through it and if you only have one you can still use this for mass

120
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.100
and get flash messages.

121
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.600
And then we're going to do is use that code from the bootstrap.

122
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.390
I'm actually going to type it up manually so I can kind of explain what's going on.

123
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:39.500
Essentially it's a giant class called for alert and we say alerts alert warning alert and then call

124
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.210
alert dismissable.

125
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:47.870
And that actually allows the user to close it and then we'll say fade and then show the also pretty

126
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.210
much defines how it goes A-Whale slowly fade away.

127
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.150
Again these are all class calls and the last thing I want to say is its role is an alert

128
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.910
and then we're going to do is we're going to define it as a little button at the top which is going

129
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.000
to look like an X.

130
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:12.630
So we say type as Button will say the class of this is close which gives it that shape and then we have

131
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:20.880
a couple more parameters here will say data dash dismiss is equal to alerts.

132
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.760
And we actually don't need to provide a name for this button.

133
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.380
Pups will delete both on invalid and name there.

134
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.020
We have to dismiss alert.

135
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:37.550
And then we have an aria label and set that equal to close.

136
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:46.570
And then we can set the other class equal to fade fade space close

137
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.330
and actually looks like I already have a class here so let me just delete this class.

138
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:03.280
Let's let's make sure we don't delete that and the tide is going to add fade to the sky over here at

139
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.960
the top you go fake close.

140
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.880
OK.

141
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.230
So again this is somebody just copied and pasted this section from that bootstrap documentation that

142
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.220
we just showed.

143
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:22.630
And then the last thing we're going to do is say Spanne inside this band will say aria that hidden we'll

144
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:33.560
say true and then hear what we can do is the following will say ampersands times semi colon we and our

145
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:43.020
button there and then we're going to insert mass as a variable and then say and for.

146
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.510
OK so that's technically all the code we need for the splaying that flash and then right below it we're

147
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.410
going to set up that form which is just a single button.

148
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.620
So the form we don't need to worry about class or action because that's being taken care of by flask

149
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.450
for us we'll say post.

150
00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.900
And just to make sure we don't get any errors we'll capitalize it and then we'll do the following we'll

151
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:09.870
create our hidden tag we'll say form thought hidden underscore tag open close print princes and then

152
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.630
we'll have that form that submit button OK.

153
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.750
Save that.

154
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.190
Now I know there's a lot of complicated bootstrap going on here.

155
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.740
So I really want to clarify.

156
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.640
I would never memorize all of this.

157
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.160
I would just go to the documentation and copy and paste it and then adjust as needed.

158
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:33.580
So keep in mind that's why you're seeing so many calls of like span's classes all this giant class.

159
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.340
That's not the kind of stuff you need to memorize.

160
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.920
Well you do need to memorize or essentially understand is that you call get Flast messages and then

161
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.620
you can do something for that and you're inserting that mess.

162
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.560
So let's break down let's actually happening here.

163
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.930
We have a basic that pi.

164
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.070
I create a very simple form of a submit button.

165
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.910
If that form is valid upon clicking submit I call flash.

166
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.790
You just click the button and then I redirect them to that same index page.

167
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.950
Upon calling flash what happens is an object called Get Flast messages is now available for you in the

168
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.900
template.

169
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.610
And that happens automatically.

170
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.500
You don't need to pass it in as a parameter.

171
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.840
Then you save for every message and get Flast messages.

172
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.840
And typically just one be you may have multiple flash alerts.

173
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.070
You can then do something using bootstrap and then insert the message there.

174
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.370
If you don't use this bootstrap then it's really not going to be dismissible.

175
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.790
Instead you'll just see that message suddenly pop up.

176
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.440
So it's a mess.

177
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.960
OK.

178
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.340
So again all this code that's essentially just the bootstrap link that I showed you there.

179
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.240
And you can edit it as needed.

180
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.710
So let's save this and make sure all worked out for us.

181
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.320
Well say Python.

182
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.400
Basic thought PI enter.

183
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.300
It looks like it's running.

184
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.030
Let's make sure we didn't accidentally have a typo anywhere.

185
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.040
We'll visit the page and your page should look something like this.

186
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.270
Just a simple click the button nose starts to look like bootstrap.

187
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.310
They say click me and it says you just click the button.

188
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.710
Now there's a little expert in there.

189
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.520
I close it and it fades away.

190
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.700
And I say click me.

191
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.830
You just click the button close it and it fades away.

192
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.320
All right.

193
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.630
That's really the basics of using flash.

194
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:10.680
And you can expand this example to then start flashing information to the user based off what they selected.

195
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.480
And we're going to show you how to do that in the very next lecture.

196
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:20.750
Essentially we're going to do is add a new field to this form maybe a selection breed and then save

197
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.650
that to a session and report Black in a flash form.

198
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:29.060
What they just chose will be a little code along project to end this section of course on fields and

199
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.910
forms.

200
00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.790
The idea is you should have gone from the section or just how to create a form and then how to validate

201
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:39.890
it on submission and then do something with that information such as flushing it saving it to the session

202
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.070
and then redirecting to another page.

203
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.040
That's really the main concept so we're trying to hit on in this section.

204
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.850
This Flash is a kind of an extra little bonus on top of that.

205
00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.880
And then the bootstrap is just a nice way to format those flashed messages you technically don't need

206
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.970
to do that.

207
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.500
All right.

208
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.830
Let's finish up the section of the course by going to the next lecture and doing a little code along

209
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.350
project to kind of finish and wrap everything up.

210
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.060
We'll see it there.
