00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.120
Welcome everyone to this lecture on structuring a large flask application previously we just reviewed

2
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.480
the overall structure of our newly reformatted flask webapp.

3
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.010
Now it's actually time to implement this restructuring since you've already written a lot of the code

4
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.300
in previous lectures.

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.460
Mainly we're just going to be copying and pasting from the provided files.

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.460
Now we're actually going to do this through the use of blueprints flask has a built in blueprints capability

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.010
which will allow us to register modular components for our flask application.

8
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.080
This way we can easily reference a view for each component.

9
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.570
For example we're going to have to the rectories one for owners and one for puppies.

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.140
And each of those that rectories will have its own separate views that py file.

11
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.950
So essentially we'll have two views that PI file one for owners and one for puppies.

12
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.310
Then each of these views is going to have their own ad view.

13
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.240
So that means there's going to be a way to add owners and a way to add puppies.

14
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.390
Now typically what's going to happen is there would be some sort of confusion as far as when you say

15
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.880
slash add row if you're referring to owners or puppies.

16
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.510
Because now you have two views that profile file previously would call one forward slash at owner and

17
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.800
the other one for Slash at puppies.

18
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.150
How do we take care of this problem.

19
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.860
And now we have two separate views that py files.

20
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.670
Well in order for the flask application to not get confused with the ad route that's where we use blueprints

21
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.340
the blueprints are going to allow us to register a your a prefix for each views that py file.

22
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.210
So we're going to automatically be able to reference add as a view in each of these views that pi and

23
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.640
then separately with the use of blueprints flask is going to automatically register your old prefix

24
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.310
so that when we actually run this on our web application we'll see owners for Slash add and puppies

25
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.540
for slushed ads separately.

26
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.150
So overall the major differences in our code for this lecture are going to be restructuring and the

27
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:05.080
project folders adding in blueprints and then registering the blueprints in an in the pie file.

28
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.830
Please no.

29
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.750
It's really easy to make a simple typo that actually causes an error throughout this entire project.

30
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.880
So please make sure you follow along first very carefully and use our notes directly.

31
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.200
Make sure not to do any modification Tornos.

32
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.790
So if you're ever getting an error for this particular lecture it's almost impossible for us to help

33
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.230
fix it.

34
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.260
From our end.

35
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.290
Instead what you should really do is copy and use our note files directly because any simple typo is

36
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.810
going to be really hard to catch.

37
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.630
OK so again this lecture is really focusing on the overall structure of the fullers files.

38
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.940
Most of the actual content of the files is just going to be copied and pasted from our notes.

39
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.770
All right let's get started by heading over to the text editor.

40
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.100
OK so here you have the structure text file opening and we're going to set up all these files and folders

41
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.970
first and then we'll just copy and paste the actual content into them.

42
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.270
A lot of these files and folders We've actually already created.

43
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.020
For instance we've already made these templates for adding owners and adding puppies as well as the

44
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.310
forms and views.

45
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.560
All we're doing now is we're just separating them into their separate components for owners and puppies

46
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.640
and then we'll manually add in blueprints as well as manually set it up.

47
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.670
This in a file.

48
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.040
But first let's go over here to the left hand tab and start creating these folders.

49
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.970
First of all they're going to create or first file I should say is my app that py file.

50
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.580
So say create app that pi and then all start by creating my project folder so first thing to do here

51
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:40.550
is say new folder and will say my project and you want to make sure you follow the same naming convention

52
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.230
I do.

53
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.990
Otherwise your source code won't work.

54
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.750
So underneath my project will create a couple of directories.

55
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.450
One will be our owners directory.

56
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.260
That's the components where all the owners related materials are going to go.

57
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.230
Then I'll create a new folder called Puppies.

58
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.790
Let's roll up puppies material and then I'll create a new folder called templates and these are going

59
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.950
to be the top level templates things like my bass H.T. mail and my home H.T. file other templates are

60
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.200
going to go within owners and puppies.

61
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.270
And then after that I'll create a couple more files.

62
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.420
One is going to be my underscore underscore and it underscore underscore that py file and the last one

63
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.690
is going to be a model that py file that's going to store models and technically we could also separate

64
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.170
this model's not pie into owners and puppies but in this case there's only two models that exist so

65
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.540
it's not really worth the effort of separating it out.

66
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.370
OK so now it's time to go into owners and actually start building this out.

67
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.700
And in fact we're going to do a really similar thing for both owners and puppies so owners will create

68
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.690
a new folder here called templates.

69
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.690
Now we're going to the same thing within puppies.

70
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.240
So new folder templates.

71
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.860
So these are templates that are associated with puppies and owners and the actual structure for these

72
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.540
to work.

73
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.720
You have to then the way flask works is make a new folder underneath owners templates and create another

74
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.150
owner's folder.

75
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.190
So notice here in my structure it gives owners templates.

76
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.060
Owners will do the same thing for puppies.

77
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.620
Puppies templates new folder.

78
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.850
Puppies.

79
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.270
OK.

80
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.540
So this is really common as far as a structuring.

81
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.490
It basically allows flasks to read and make sure it's connecting to the right template.

82
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.820
Later on we'll add outreached him team files there ourselves.

83
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.630
So right now we have our template file their structure set up.

84
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:45.160
Now we just need to add for both owners and puppies will create their own forms that py file and then

85
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.590
also create their own views that profile.

86
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.860
And again notice here.

87
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.400
Same level as templates so owners has a template directory then forms interviews and basically people

88
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.170
is going to have the same thing.

89
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.630
So templates is already set up for puppies.

90
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:09.610
So then we're just going to save puppies and you file forms thought pie and then puppies and you file

91
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.140
views PI OK.

92
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.950
And this is basically the main structure we had to set up.

93
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.030
Now we have our owners components all within the owner's directory.

94
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.100
It has it's going to have its own formed its own views and its own templates within its owner's directory

95
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.120
here and puppies is going to work the exact same way.

96
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:36.240
OK let's start off by continuing an ad in the files that really have no changes between our last iteration

97
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.690
of this puppy adoption Web site versus our restructuring right now.

98
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.230
So those are mainly going to be the templates and the models that Paey file.

99
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.070
So lets open up a start for models that py file.

100
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.490
So just to make it clear right now I'm in models that pie and this is essentially the top level there's

101
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.420
only one models not pite file.

102
00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.090
All we're going to do is we're going to copy and paste what we previously had before.

103
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:06.050
So I'm going to say models that pi and copy and paste from our previous iteration of this project the

104
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.960
owner class and then the puppy class.

105
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.440
The one thing that we're going to have to take care of is how we actually get this D-B the model.

106
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.290
So we're going to set that all up in our in it that PI file.

107
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.140
So this underscore underscore in its underscore underscore that pi which is under the my project folder

108
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:31.050
that's going to contain all the code that creates the application and the database in order to import

109
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.120
that since it's underneath the init PI file underneath the my project folder.

110
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.720
All we need to say is from my project import D-B.

111
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:56.720
And that means that we're going to need to set up D-B inside the in a PI file under the my project folder.

112
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.190
OK.

113
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.080
So this is essentially something that's on our to do list set up this at about pi file but everything

114
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.770
else as far as setting up the puppy model and the owner model that looks exactly the same as we had

115
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.200
it before.

116
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.730
Suddenly to see these changes again and just copy and pasting here from the notes but our models up

117
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.010
file is now done.

118
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.420
The next thing I want to do is add in the templates that go at the top level of my project.

119
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.970
So let me expand templates right now and create some new files inside of templates.

120
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.510
Basically we just need to add the top level one is based on HVM L..

121
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.750
So I'm going to copy and paste that in right now.

122
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.750
This essentially just holds the nav bar.

123
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.410
So will copy and paste that save that in number.

124
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.550
We have the nav bar and then we say block content and we'll go over these actually your L's and just

125
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.060
a little bit.

126
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.650
That's going to be slightly different.

127
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:53.470
And then we'll say templates new file and I'll say home thought HVM L so home that each T.M. that's

128
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.420
essentially going to look pretty much exactly the same as our previous home.

129
00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.100
It's just going to be extending from based l a jumbotron and I'll say welcome to our adoption page.

130
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.140
Please click on the links for the nav bar so I'll save that right there.

131
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:13.490
So far we finished our templates and our models not pi file since our models that PI file is now finished.

132
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.690
Let's go ahead and sync it to the in it up high.

133
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.540
So remember I said we had to set up this from my project.

134
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.000
Import D-B line.

135
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.310
So I'm going to go to my in it up PI again just to make it clear I'm right now and underscore underscore

136
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.820
in its underscore underscore that PI underneath the my project folder.

137
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.810
So that's the current file I'm in.

138
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:47.870
What I'm going to do is import os and then I'll say from flask import flask from flask sequel alchemy

139
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.190
import sequel alchemy.

140
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.920
Again a lot of the same imports we used to have in our apple pie file.

141
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.490
Except now they're going underneath the pie.

142
00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.990
And last thing we're going to say is from flask migrates import

143
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.170
then we'll say app is equal to flask.

144
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.500
Well passen the builtin name variable.

145
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.320
And now we're going to set up our configurations.

146
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:21.670
So it is that bar configurations for our database so we're going to set up our base directory as OS

147
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:31.920
path absolute path and then OS path directory name and we'll pass and file just as we've done before.

148
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.170
So nothing really new here.

149
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:39.950
It's just going in a different location and then we'll set up our app config first one is going to be

150
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:46.630
the sequel alchemy underscore database underscore.

151
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:52.120
You are I basically where the actual sequel database is going to be located.

152
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.320
Elysée sequel.

153
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.990
Colin three forward slashes.

154
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:02.820
And then we'll put in the paff are currently located essentially OS pathic join based directory they

155
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.840
did the sequel.

156
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.370
OK.

157
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.180
So we set up our sequel alchemy database just as we've done many times in the past and they say app

158
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:21.470
config and we'll say sequel alchemy underscore track modifications.

159
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.340
And just as we've done before.

160
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:31.440
Well synthetical to false then I'll set up D-B is equal to sequel alchemy pasand the app.

161
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:38.230
And then also perform migrations on the app by passing the app and the database and to migrate save

162
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.270
those changes.

163
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.050
And now again I'm in the in it up file underneath my project folder and I've set up my application as

164
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.090
well as the configurations I need for my sequel Alcmene database I've created that database and now

165
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.500
I have the ability to migrate on that database.

166
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.580
So if I take a look at models up-I I've now successfully linked from my project import the B thus directly

167
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.830
calling in at that pipe because it's underneath my project folder and it's going to import this D-B

168
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.790
right here.

169
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.820
The last configuration I want to make here is for the forms.

170
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.010
Remember we need to configure a secret key.

171
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.000
So go ahead and do that.

172
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.330
Right below we create the app will see app config secret underscore key and you can just set this to

173
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.200
any string you want.

174
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.910
It's.

175
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.920
My secret key save that now we're not finished yet with this in it that PI file.

176
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.270
The last thing is going to have to do is register the actual blueprints but we haven't done that yet.

177
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.580
So right now we'll just leave it as is.

178
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:36.350
OK.

179
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.740
So we have our pie file set up.

180
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:44.850
Now let's go ahead and start setting up the templates for owners and puppies as well as the forms.

181
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.700
So next up we're going to do is start setting up forms for puppies.

182
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:56.200
So right now I am in the forms that PI file underneath puppies and I'm just going to copy and paste

183
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.530
the code that we previously used for our adoption site.

184
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:06.360
Again just importing flask form and importing the fields and I have an add form and a delete form for

185
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.790
the puppies.

186
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.560
Notice how I don't need to clarify further that this is add a puppy form or delete puppies form.

187
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.750
That clarification is already going to happen automatically for me because I have this as a subcomponent

188
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.720
of the puppies directory.

189
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:27.750
That being said let's now go to our owners forms potpie file and I was again going to copy and paste

190
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.950
this from the notes.

191
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:38.330
So the forms file for the owners and let me make it clear again I'm right now under owner folder forms

192
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:44.120
up high here and is going to copy and paste basically the same thing except now it says out of form

193
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.320
for the owner.

194
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.450
So I have name pop ID and submit again.

195
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.960
It's really crucial to note here that I have forms that are now sharing the same name as a form under

196
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.220
puppies and then add a form under owners.

197
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.100
What's crucial is that when I utilize blueprints later on in the views there's not going to be any mix

198
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.200
up as far as what form is what.

199
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.910
Because they're already in their own subcomponent folders.

200
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:15.320
OK so I going to say those changes in my forms that pie and other forms are essentially taken care of.

201
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.910
Now all I need to add in are the actual template files are going to be using.

202
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.690
So let's go back and add in those template files.

203
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.050
Essentially those are just are HVM l files.

204
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.860
We'll start with the puppies they actually have more templates.

205
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.600
So underneath puppies templates puppies are going to create some new files.

206
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.680
So the first one is going to be ad HVM L..

207
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.210
So I will say copy and paste from the notes.

208
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.250
Again this is just adding a puppy.

209
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.160
Remember we grab that form and then add a puppy to our database.

210
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.020
So save that there.

211
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.140
Then we want to be able to delete a puppy.

212
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:58.910
So create a new file we'll call delete that age DML and then we're going to copy and paste this pretty

213
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.230
much the same files we've been working with save that so that a puppy get adopted.

214
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.580
We thought the forums forms removed the puppy from the list and then we want to be able to list all

215
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:16.890
the puppies so all say new file lists h TNL and then they're going to copy and paste from the notes

216
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.830
save that change.

217
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.130
And now I have all the views I need for my puppies.

218
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.990
Now I want to add one view for my owners and that's going to be an add.

219
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.230
Owner HTL form so underneath that I'll say new file.

220
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:39.700
I will call it an underscore owner the h t m l and I'm going to copy this and paste it.

221
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.700
Save it again this is an owner h t m l underneath the owner's templates OK.

222
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.340
So basically what we've done so far is we've added in all the files that essentially don't need any

223
00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.260
major modification for the blueprint restructuring.

224
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.780
And those are things like your templates and your forms.

225
00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.710
The only modifications you'll need is the naming scheme.

226
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.300
Sometimes maybe sometimes you want to simplify it.

227
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.750
And again notice here on forms we have to out of forms previously would have something like a puppy

228
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.200
form and an owner form.

229
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.430
But now since they're in their own subcomponents we don't need to do that in the very next lecture.

230
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.250
We're going to continue our restructuring by now focusing in on the views that py files.

231
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.160
Those are the ones that are going to be slightly different because that's what we're actually going

232
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.560
to add in these blueprint calls.

233
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.820
We'll see you in the next lecture where we start manipulating with blueprints.
