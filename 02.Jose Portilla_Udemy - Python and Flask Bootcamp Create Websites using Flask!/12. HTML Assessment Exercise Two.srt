00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,050
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,610
To finish off this HTL crash course we're going to have a quick second assessment of your skills.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,140
So in order to test your skills your task is just going to be the same as the first assessment for each

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,080
team will essentially recreate the aged female first sight in your browser.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,170
So just by viewing what's in the browser tray to recreate it in Tamil in order to do that.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,530
Go ahead and double click open part 10.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,510
H tim l assessment to that each time L and view it in your browser.

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,110
Again mission out to peek at the actual HTL code since that will essentially be showing you the solution.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,620
Let's see what this looks like in the browser and then we'll set you off to actually try to recreate

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,600
it on your own.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,380
All right.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,340
So once you actually open this in your browser you'll notice you have a Heading 1 puppy adoption page

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,190
and then basically just the form asking you to fill in information in order to adopt a puppy you have

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,840
labels of a lot of these boxes.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,600
So first name this is just a text box.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,730
Notice how there's placeholders here for first name and last name and then notice that there's actually

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,030
a break in between this first name and last name to create a new line.

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,940
And you can do that either by adding in a brake tag that's the be our tag we saw one of the videos or

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:20,050
just by adding in an empty paragraph tag then we have email here as well as a password that it asks

20
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,870
you Are you over the age of 18.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,650
A need provide yes or no.

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,260
Notice how these buttons are linked.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,560
Meaning they share the same name and then we have a dropdown menu asking you if you have credit card

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,950
or Paypal and then you have submit feedback.

25
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,290
Now it's up to you what you want to do when you submit feedback.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,590
Right now we don't have any actual redirect.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,290
So when you submit your feedback the page has just refreshed along for your choices at the top.

28
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,220
OK.

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,360
Best of luck recreating this Web site.

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,940
Again just look at it in the browser.

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,670
Instead of looking at it in the text editor and the very next structure will show you how to go through

32
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,560
solutions.

33
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,040
We'll see if.
