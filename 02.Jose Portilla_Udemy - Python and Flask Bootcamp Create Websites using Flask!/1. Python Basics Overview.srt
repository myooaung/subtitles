00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,170
Welcome everyone to Python level one section of the course.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,430
Let's have a quick review of what we're actually going to cover in level 1 and in the next section.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,310
Of course we'll start with Python level 2.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,110
But for this section level one we're really starting off with the basics here.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,820
And if you're watching this I'm going to assume that you have very little to no experience in Python

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,540
because this really is going to start off with just the basics.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,350
So we're talking about basic data types such as numbers strings lists and then will go on to discuss

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,110
basic data structures such as dictionaries tuples sets and we also talk about booleans.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,860
They'll have a quick exercise go over those solutions then we'll begin to talk about control flow.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,800
Basically if Elsin Elif statements and then we'll end the section by talking about functions and give

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,730
you a couple of tasks for you to complete.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,320
And then the solution is for them.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,160
OK.

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,590
So again if you already have enough Python experience where you feel really comfortable with functions

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,000
and just basic things like an if and else statement then you can probably feel free to just skip this

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,110
particular section entirely.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,320
Maybe you can jump over and do the functions tasks first and then if you can pass all those then you

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,490
know you're ready to go to Python level 2.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,270
OK.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,400
With that all being said if you have any questions as far as what we cover in the section feel free

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,870
to post the Q&amp;A forums.

22
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,030
But if not let's go ahead and continue.

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,990
We'll see at the next lecture.
