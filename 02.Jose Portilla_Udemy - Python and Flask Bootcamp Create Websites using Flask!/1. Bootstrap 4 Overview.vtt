00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.710
Welcome to the bootstrap for a crash course.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.650
S. Let's quickly discuss our goals upon completion of this section by the end of this section.

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.610
You should have an understanding of a bootstrap is you should be able to get and use the bootstrap component

4
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.600
templates and the documentation specifically be able to create nav bars.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.700
Since we'll be using those a lot within our web applications and understand in general how to use that

6
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.390
documentation.

7
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.400
So let's quickly start off by understanding what bootstrap is at its very core bootstrap is really just

8
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.500
a very large CSSA file and a very large javascript file.

9
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.110
However in practice it's really a lot more than that.

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.450
Bootstrap has pre-built to use components that you can incorporate into your web applications and what

11
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.700
that means is we're going to be able to make our Web sites look nice and have basic functionality on

12
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.740
the front end without having to do a whole lot of work and bootstrap is going to save us a lot of time

13
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.930
or making those websites look clean which is important because as we're dealing with the tedious work

14
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.150
of the back and with Python flask and learning all that new material we don't have to have to worry

15
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.450
about each TMLC SS bootstrap is going to make those websites look nice on the front end for us now it's

16
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.730
easiest to understand how this actually works by going to the bootstrap documentation.

17
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.920
So let's quickly go to.

18
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.380
There'll be W.W. that get bootstrapped dot com or just google search Bitstrips and it'll take you to

19
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.250
this page.

20
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.120
Let's head over to the page on our browser.

21
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.710
OK.

22
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.790
Here we are at get bootstrapped dot com on the bootstrap documentation page.

23
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.230
And if you scroll down you'll notice that there's a bootstrap CDN.

24
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.380
So there's two ways of using bootstrap.

25
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.450
One is to just manually download the CSSA and javascript files and linked to them manually.

26
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.980
Just as we would link our own CSSA files.

27
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.040
Or you can easily just copy the CSSA link as well as these javascript links and Jake Query links and

28
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.000
they're hosted on what's known as a Cdn or content delivery network.

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.440
So as long as your Web site has some sort of link to the Internet it can grab these automatically from

30
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.020
the Internet.

31
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.070
So you don't need to actually download the files themselves.

32
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.240
Then typically that's what we're going to be using because it's really simple you just copy and paste

33
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.200
these four lines of code and then you can use bootstrap.

34
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.620
So we haven't really explored what bootstrap is before we do that let's check out some examples.

35
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.100
So scroll up here and click on examples in the navigation bar.

36
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.920
And they'll take it to some examples it can download the source code for all these examples as well

37
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.570
comes in a nice zip file.

38
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.210
But you'll notice if we start opening some of these in new tabs there's many different ways you can

39
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.740
use bootstrap.

40
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.480
So here's an example of bootstrap being used for a pricing page.

41
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.900
So we see here there's a navigation bar at the top.

42
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.120
There's kind of a nice container holding things in the center and then we see these cards first sign

43
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.440
up for free get started.

44
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.840
And then there's a nice footer here at the bottom.

45
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.730
So that's a very typical example of what our web sites will look like after implementing bootstrap on

46
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.540
them.

47
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.810
So here you can see a checkout for example you can provide your name.

48
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.990
Essentially it's a really nice looking form and we can see what's in the car.

49
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.840
There's a carousel temple template excuse me and you can see here the carousel allows you to see more

50
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.560
photos.

51
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.140
And then we can see other panels and little cards here as well.

52
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.710
One more cover template for kind of a home page features contact.

53
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.380
Here's a product example.

54
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.830
So all of these are built with bootstrap.

55
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.330
So what does that actually mean.

56
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.800
If we go back to get bootstrap that come come back to home.

57
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.970
And if you click on documentation you'll notice that there's lots of information here.

58
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.180
Introduction download contents.

59
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.740
Essentially what we need to understand is this basic concept.

60
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.590
Let's say I want to add a navigation bar to my actual Web site.

61
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.560
All I need to do is come to documentation component's scroll down until I find the component I'm looking

62
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.990
for such as nav bar.

63
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.940
Click on that it'll explain how it works.

64
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.700
So we can see the various classes the supported content as well.

65
00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.300
And most importantly we see these nice examples with their direct code below them.

66
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.240
So what does that actually mean.

67
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.450
It means that we have this navigation bar as it dropped down.

68
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.690
It has a search button etc. and here we see the actual code that builds it out.

69
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.780
So here's the navigation bar code and you'll notice that there's these class calls.

70
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.510
So if I zoom in here you'll see these specific class calls and these are the class calls that come with

71
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.580
bootstraps CSSA file.

72
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.320
So that's the really important part.

73
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.170
So let's say you want to add maybe a form to your Web site.

74
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.430
Will you come to components click on forms read the overview and then you can see here a really nice

75
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.340
looking form.

76
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.850
And that's where you're going to use your skeleton code.

77
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.630
So here we can see the form and we're already familiar of H.T. and all forms.

78
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.850
All you need to notice is that there's various classes here and these classes again make it look really

79
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.130
nice and you can always customize it yourself with your own C SS classes.

80
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.110
And then there's I just scroll down more examples of things like form control multiple select etc. and

81
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.600
you can always copy and paste this example code.

82
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.820
So if you scroll down you'll see tons of examples that are super useful.

83
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.650
OK.

84
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.780
So by the end of this section of the course you should have a really comfortable feeling of coming over

85
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.370
to the documentation page looking at the various components deciding on which one you want to add to

86
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.610
your actual Web site.

87
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.610
For instance we'll learn about how to add a Jumbotron that's really useful.

88
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.300
You'll copy this and be able to use his example code a lot of it is just copying and pasting from the

89
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.860
documentation and then making custom adjustments for your own Web site coming up next we'll begin to

90
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.900
actually learn some of these key components that we're going to be using to bootstrap.

91
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.540
We'll see if they're.
