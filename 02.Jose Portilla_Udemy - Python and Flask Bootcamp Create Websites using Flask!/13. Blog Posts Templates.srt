1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,560
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,370
So we just created a bunch of views.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,170
Now it's time to actually connect those views to the corresponding templates for the blog posts.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,720
Once you've done that we should pretty much be ready to actually explore the full web site.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,660
There's going to be a couple of things that we're going to introduce as new topics during these templates

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,310
so let's get started.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,780
All right if we take a look back at the views we created there's really just two templates that we need

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,470
to create.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,410
One is to create post template and we're going to be using that both for updating the post and creating

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,770
an original post.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,580
So how.

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,190
Create postdates smell is used in both of those.

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,500
Then the other one we're gonna have to work with is the blog post today.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,040
L.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,640
That's the code for just showing a single blog post.

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,060
Remember that we actually already created these files at least the basic HTL file for them in the previous

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,750
lecture.

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,690
Now it's time to actually fill them in.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,590
I want to start with the Create post because that one is much simpler than the singular blog post.

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,610
So we're going to say extends from base that each team L and then we'll create our content BLOCK And

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,940
since we're just creating a post this is essentially just passing in that form.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,730
So if we take a look back at creating that blog post Remember that are really doing is just passing

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,540
in that form.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,680
Given the title the text and user ID so we just need to display that form on this page for the user

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,330
to fill out.

26
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,790
I'll go ahead and lead this as a container and then have my form here.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,500
So I'm going to keep the class as a form group and then the method will be post and form group.

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,380
This class comes from the bootstrap documentation.

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,360
It's just going to make it look a little nicer.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,460
So our method to post and we need to put in our hidden tag here so say form hit and tag so that security

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,060
tag can then work and then just so this looks a little nicer and do the same thing here and create divs

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,960
for form groups.

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:03,350
For each major section or field of the form so that will be for form title label and again will set

34
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,110
the class here to something from Bootstrap.

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:14,350
In this case it's going to be let's see form dash control dash label and then right after that we'll

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:27,330
say form that title class equal to form dash control space form control LG for large then just grabbing

37
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,350
these class names from the bootstrap documentation for forms.

38
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,730
It's really up to you how much in depth you want to go.

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,110
But I noticed that at least for the Create post it looks a lot better if we added these divs So I went

40
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,170
ahead and did that.

41
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,550
Then I do this one more time here.

42
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,880
So that's for the title.

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,890
The other one is going to be for the text so I'll say the text label and then the text as well here

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,620
and we can go ahead and keep the same classes.

45
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,100
Then finally one last div as a form group and this is going to be for the submit button so just say

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,100
form submit.

47
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,490
Class equal to.

48
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:12,240
In this case will be say between BTs and ash outline dash info OK we'll save that and that's actually

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,050
all we're going to do.

50
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,530
For the Create post template.

51
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,470
Now it's time to move on to the blog post template.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,360
So we'll go to the blog post.

53
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,870
H tim l template that we created last time and we'll start off with the basics.

54
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,940
Extending from base each time L. and then creating our content blocks so say block content.

55
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,770
And this is the view that just shows a single blog post.

56
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,770
So we're going to start off with the following.

57
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,120
We'll create the vision for actually a Jumbotron here.

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,590
Up to you really how you want to style this.

59
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,690
I'm going to create a jumbotron and as the heading 1 I'll say grab the post title because remember passing

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,200
in the post and as it referenced when we're actually building out the views.

61
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,180
It's kind of up to you how much you want to pass back because if you check out our views and if we take

62
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,470
a look at the singular blog post view.

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:09,120
So this blog post viewer here actually already passed in the title as blog post title so I could just

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,470
say appear just title and that would be the title I passed back in.

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,100
It's up to you what you want to do.

66
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,150
Some people like passing it in individually over here on the Python side.

67
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,700
Other people just like keep passing in just the Singler blog posts and then you would call that they

68
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,510
thought title yourself off the template.

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,050
Again totally up to you how you prefer to style that.

70
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,970
So just to make sure we don't get confused.

71
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,780
I'll do everything off the post.

72
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,680
But remember we did passen title and date.

73
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,930
Individually you can play around with.

74
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,310
So kind of just trying to show you multiple ways of doing this.

75
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,920
Again there is no wrong or right way and they're both kind of just as efficient.

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,060
So they we want to say who this was written by psyching say grab that post grab that author grab that

77
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,710
username.

78
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,910
Again you can do this here at the template site or on the View site and then let's make header 3 and

79
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,570
this will be the publication date.

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,580
So say published and again we can say either grab that date that we did sent and manual in the views

81
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,570
or you could grab the date here and then you can even do things like structure it the way you want.

82
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:23,060
So I can say as TRF time and then passen print sees how I actually want the structured doots code so

83
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,620
I could say something like this.

84
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,910
And this basically says give me the full month the day and then comma the year so you could do it that

85
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,300
way again.

86
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,240
There is no right or wrong way to do this.

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,860
And then finally we actually want the content of the post so create paragraph here that has post text.

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,430
Ok so essentially just shows a single blog post.

89
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,760
However if the author matches the currently logged in user will want to display a button that allows

90
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,010
them to update or delete the post.

91
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,200
So we are going to do is right after this paragraph is at in a little bit of logic here.

92
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:06,940
I'm going to say if postop author is equal to the current user.

93
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,200
And remember we have access to this current user object because we're using Flast logon.

94
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,160
Then I will do the following.

95
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,150
And I have another little division here and this division is not going to be class just helped me organize

96
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,920
this and will have an anchor tied and will say the following.

97
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,850
I'm going to say that this anchor tag is going to be for updating and I'm going to create another anchor

98
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,410
tag.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:40,510
It's actually going to be a button you a HDMI button and this one is going to be for the elite and you'll

100
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,160
see why in a second I'm using a button for the lead and just an acre tag for update.

101
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,860
So what's going to happen is if I click up here it's going to take me to the update view which means

102
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:59,650
my ref is going to be the URL for and then we're going to say blog posts.

103
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,200
Whoops.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:14,490
The blog post blueprints grab the up the view and then pasan blog post ID is equal to the post ID and

105
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,410
I don't zoom in just a little bit so we can see the whole thing.

106
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,940
OK.

107
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,380
So that's just an anchor tag.

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,340
It's going to set up.

109
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,370
If you click on that it will come back to be used up high and then send you to this update by passing

110
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,990
in that blog post I.D. which basically kind of shows you things filled in already that you can then

111
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,820
start changing.

112
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,290
OK.

113
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,560
So that's if you the site to update if you decide to delete.

114
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,990
This is where we're going to introduce some new topics specifically modals with bootstrap.

115
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,940
So there's a link in the actual notes in case you want to check it out yourself.

116
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:55,280
But if you go to bootstrap com or get bootstrapped dot com and then check out the documentation and

117
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,460
check up the components and go down.

118
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,830
Eventually you should see something called a modal.

119
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,780
And basically this is a little bit of Javascript.

120
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,650
Basically javascript it's already included in Bootstrap to have a little dialog that pops up.

121
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,500
So what you end up seeing is a little button that pops up like this.

122
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,630
And when someone wants to delete their block posts we're going to have this Modal pop up that says hey

123
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,810
are you sure you want to delete and then you can either cancel it or you can selectively.

124
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,650
So this is kind of what we're using as a base code.

125
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm going to type it out myself but in case you obviously in your own work don't want to manually type

126
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
that off you're going to come to the documentation.

127
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,900
Come to motile and then kind of copy and paste here.

128
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:40,070
Remember all these examples have a little convenient copy to clipboard button and you can see the other

129
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,890
type of models that are available here as well.

130
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,040
So we're really just using this one as our skeleton code.

131
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,190
So the model title body and then some cancel button and some yes confirmed delete because maybe someone

132
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,620
accidently clicks that delete button when we don't want them to delete right away.

133
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,550
So that's the basis of what we're going to be adding in right now.

134
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,400
And that's also the reason why we're using a button I'm going to connect these actions to the button.

135
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,140
So let's see how that all works.

136
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,460
Again if you want to reference where I'm actually in his code from you can either use our notes or just

137
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,280
use the actual bootstrap documentation.

138
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,870
So I had this button right here what I'm going to do is keep the type button and I'm going to add in

139
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,500
a couple more things here.

140
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,730
I don't need to actually give it a name and give it a class for the bootstrap classes just so it looks

141
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,710
a little nicer.

142
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,670
We'll say between and then Beati endanger.

143
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,020
So it's going to be kind of this bright red danger button which makes sense is really.

144
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,950
And then I'm going to add two important things here.

145
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:43,550
I'm going to say data toggle is equal to motile and that connects this button to pop up instead of straight

146
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,420
deleting.

147
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,470
And the lesson here to do is say data target is equal to.

148
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,750
And this is where you decide on an ID.

149
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,890
So we'll say hash tag and then we'll just give it some name again this name is totally arbitrary what

150
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm doing because this is going to be the ID I'm going to use for the idea of the motile I'm going to

151
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,730
create.

152
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,230
So again zooming out here I gave it a class for styling.

153
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,230
So the type is button data toggles motile that gives the little pop up.

154
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:19,490
And then we have the data target linked to an ID so now it's time to actually create the modal object

155
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,860
and against that make it very clear when we're ever using bootstrap.

156
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,280
We're not memorizing anything.

157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,510
All we're really doing is coming to documentation looking at an example that more or less looks like

158
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,520
what we want to use and then copying it over.

159
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
So I'm actually going to do that myself.

160
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,970
I'm actually going to copy straight from the documentation and then really the things I want to end

161
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,980
it is the title text this body text and then what these two buttons actually do because right now they

162
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,180
don't do anything.

163
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,040
So I'll close that remember I've already copied it so I copied it to my clipboard and then I'm going

164
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,270
to come over here and we'll say if that's still going on here and that and then I have the model for

165
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,780
Papa.

166
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,200
So let's put that in there.

167
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,050
And in fact we're going to put it after this Jumbotron live.

168
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,700
So it doesn't look weird.

169
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,300
So there's the modal code.

170
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,280
And in order to actually link this to this button.

171
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,960
So this is it going to show up unless you actually click this button because it's kind of a data toggle.

172
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,680
I need actually label it as the same ID.

173
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,130
So I gave it the delete motile ID.

174
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,650
So that's when I'm going to provide.

175
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:30,420
So right here at the very top where it says class modal tab index negative one roll dialog I'm going

176
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,990
to add in one more thing which is the ID equal to.

177
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,560
And then you're going to set it equal to whatever you set here without the hash tag.

178
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,460
So in this case I'll just say DTL underscore motile something want to make very very clear is that this

179
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,650
DL underscore motile.

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,320
That's a totally arbitrary ID name.

181
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,230
All I need to worry about is that this right here after the hash tag matches this right here because

182
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,480
that basically tells the h time L when this person clicks this delete button it's going to toggle this

183
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,670
Modal to pop up.

184
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,570
So it's going to toggle all this h t m l along with the javascript to pop up and the modal you're going

185
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,450
to be looking for is the one that matches this idea.

186
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,380
And the reason for that is maybe you want multiple modal so pop up on update or delete.

187
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,640
So you're going to need some sort of data target to make sure you select the right modal OK.

188
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,160
So we added that idea.

189
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,570
So that's good to go and we're going to keep a lot of this one going to change here.

190
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,720
Is this title and instead we're going to just call it maybe delete.

191
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,740
Post a question mark so I'll save that and then we'll have the same sort of button here and then this

192
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,610
is going to stay the same.

193
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,050
This is going to stay the same.

194
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,500
The modal body text would say something like.

195
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:49,850
Are you sure you want to the post question mark so that way when this pops up I'll say delete posts

196
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,510
on top ask the person are you sure you want to delete the post and then all we need to do now is worry

197
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,090
about these two buns because these are the ones that are really going to do all the heavy lifting.

198
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,770
Deciding if you want to cancel and not do anything or actually delete the post.

199
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:10,710
So in the case of canceling this is actually all you need to do because it says they dismiss modal and

200
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,720
we're just going to say cancel and you actually don't need to change anything here because all the work

201
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,100
is being done by this line of day to dismiss.

202
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,890
That means when this button is clicked then you dismiss the motile that's currently open.

203
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,420
So all this HTL code goes away.

204
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,230
The last one which is the harder one is trying to figure out what what are you actually going to do

205
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,410
if you decide to delete the post.

206
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,460
So instead of save changes here and I say delete.

207
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,850
So in that case where instead of using a button or actually going to put in a almost like a mini form

208
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,690
that just contains a single submit button.

209
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,850
So I'll show you how we do that we first create this form and it's going to have we don't need to worry

210
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,970
about the class.

211
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,670
Instead we'll say that the action is to take you to the delete post your.

212
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,390
So the action here will say the following.

213
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,320
You are L for blog posts.

214
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,190
Dot delete.

215
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:05,880
View.

216
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,920
Actually actually I think it's the post view.

217
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,930
Let's make sure we'll come back to views.

218
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,720
So it looks like yes is delete post so upon submitting this form it's going to take you to delete posts

219
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,210
which remember when you automatically call that view.

220
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,800
It's going to delete that blog post and then redirect it to the home page.

221
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,340
You don't really get a second chance there so ill delete the post and we just let them provide it.

222
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,320
What post to delete and the post is going to delete is the post you're currently looking at.

223
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,650
Which happens to be the posts ID that we passed in.

224
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,470
So say poster ID.

225
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,280
All right so that's what's going to happen with this little tiny form and then we're going to do is

226
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,780
have an input button here and the type is going to be submit

227
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,360
and then we don't really need to worry about the name or value.

228
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,960
Actually the value should be whatever it says will say confirmed delete or something.

229
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,510
I'll just say delete and we won't need this button anymore and name.

230
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,620
I don't need to worry about the name going to make it look a little better.

231
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:12,510
Adding in a class call here with bootstrap and we'll just have it be in between danger.

232
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,780
Save that and then you're done.

233
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,250
So there's a lot going on here.

234
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,630
Specifically it is modal so it's kind of a review.

235
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,160
All these moving parts going to scroll back up here and let's review the following.

236
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,310
So the very beginning is actually pretty straightforward.

237
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,130
We're just showing the actual blog post.

238
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,670
I showed the title I showed the author username I showed the publication date and then issue the post

239
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,530
text.

240
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,940
Then I say if the current user is actually the author of that then they're going to have the option

241
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,240
to update it which then just links them to the update view.

242
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,940
Or they'll have the option to delete and delete button is going to toggle the motile that I've created

243
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,790
here at the bottom and then it's going to link it specifically to that model with this ID data target.

244
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,150
So this line and this highlighted line those are the ones being linked together.

245
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,450
So if we want to delete the post then they can click on that and it says.

246
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,850
Are you sure you want to delete the post as the title.

247
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,080
Delete post this is the body of that motile and then we have two things going on here inside the actual

248
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,530
modal footer which are those two buttons one button is just cancel.

249
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,290
Which is just going to call the Smiths closing the modal.

250
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,200
The other one is actually an entire form in one submit button which if you click on it it will call

251
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,530
delete.

252
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,810
Post on that post ID which if you take a look at that views remember delete posts.

253
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,190
All it does is it says hey is the current user or the author.

254
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,530
If so them are ready to delete.

255
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,610
Will just delete that commit it and then go to the index page and that's all this is doing.

256
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,720
It's just using this modal logic that we haven't actually seen before.

257
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,270
All right.

258
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,310
So we created our blog post each time L and R create that each tiem l file.

259
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,960
Those are the major components that we had left last.

260
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,970
We're going to do in the very next lecture is finishing up any last minute touches such as setting up

261
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,610
blueprints or setting up that home page to actually show all the blog posts and then we'll run our site

262
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,420
test and make sure everything works.

263
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,180
So we're almost at the homestretch here really finishing off to some last minute things to make sure

264
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,600
the site works and functions.

265
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,330
But other than that we've pretty much done about like 95 percent of the work to get everything up and

266
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,220
running.

267
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,310
I'll see you in the next lecture.

268
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,440
Well we kind of finish this off.
