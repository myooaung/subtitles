00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.410
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.550
Let's go over the solution for the SS assessment by going through the tasks that see a SS file.

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.010
OK.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.340
So here you have three major components open.

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.670
One is the actual HVM l file.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.850
The second is the CSSA file and then the third is the link to the H-2 him.

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.870
In my browser so I refresh this right now.

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.720
Notice there's no styling on this.

9
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.580
H tim L.

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.080
When I'm going to do now is expand the CSSA file and I'll keep this tab open for each T.M. in case I

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.800
want to ever reference it.

12
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
But right now we're just looking purely at the C Ss and our first task was to give the body element

13
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.130
of the site a light gray background using a hex code.

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:51.620
So the way we do that is we say body curly braces and we can do a background color like this or just

15
00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.410
background and the hex code I found by playing around with hex speaker is D-3 D-3 the three scientists

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.560
say that refresh my browser and now I see this light gray background task number 2 was to change H-1

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.270
to have a four pixel solid black border and to center that text.

18
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:22.970
So to try to say H-1 the border we can do this in one single line by saying one pixel solid black.

19
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.450
So my Kolins and that property value pair.

20
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.470
And then remember we can say text align and we can say Center save that refresh.

21
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.320
And now I see.

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.950
Welcome to puppie blog has that border and it's been centered task number three it was to make all H-2

23
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.930
elements the color purple.

24
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.900
Easy enough we just say H-2 color and set it equal to purple.

25
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.330
And when I refresh this page I should see these two heading TOS to be purple.

26
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.440
Next was to take all the input tag boxes and make them have a five pixel solid dark blue border.

27
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.280
So I'll say input and again there's two different ways of doing this.

28
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.490
You can either specify all of these individually like lips border color give it the value dark blue

29
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.660
and then grab border style and then give it the color solid or give it a style solid and then border

30
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.440
with and then say something like five pixels.

31
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.710
So that's one option.

32
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.850
The other option would be to do what we did before and just say something like five pixels solid dark

33
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.400
blue.

34
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.560
It's up to you which styles you prefer.

35
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.010
What's nice about doing them separately is that you get that nice autocomplete for the options.

36
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.910
So if I refresh this now on the input email password and log in I see those thick dark blue borders.

37
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.840
Task number six is that there's a text area element so if you scroll down.

38
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.980
This thing is a text area element and I wanted it to have some specialized properties.

39
00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:06.320
So what we can do is since it has an ID text block I can do a hash tag text block and then say give

40
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.400
it the border.

41
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.790
In this case it wants a five pixel solid gray border and we can adjust the width and height simply by

42
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.720
asking for those properties so I can say with 100 pixels and height.

43
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.360
Notice how it just auto completes which is really convenient for pixels.

44
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.770
Save those changes refresh and you'll see that change here.

45
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.870
Notice I'm superzoom then and I have this browser quite small.

46
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.210
So it's a little distorted on my screen test number 7 is there's a link to Google on the page make this

47
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.000
link read.

48
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.150
So since I know it's a link it must be an anchor tied and it's the only one on the page so I can just

49
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.490
call anchor tag color red save that change and it here take you to Google so you can search for pups.

50
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.540
I'll refresh this.

51
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.450
And now it's red task number nine was to finally set all the font to be this all Drik font and it's

52
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.560
actually already linked to.

53
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.630
If you come over here it's the h t m l it's linked right here.

54
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.950
Font's Google API all Drik.

55
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.620
So what we need to do here is just if you Google that link they'll tell you what to do.

56
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:21.640
I'm going to say body to grab everything and say font family and then essentially follow the instructions

57
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.770
if you follow that link on Google which is just all Drik comma Sincero of say that.

58
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.910
And when you refreshed this you'll notice this all everything in the body all the font family has changed.

59
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.770
So that's a nice way to essentially grab all the font on the Web site and change it at once.

60
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.710
That's why it was kind of a bonus task at the end.

61
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:42.250
OK.

62
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.300
If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.

63
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.350
The main idea should be able to do now is understand that you can connect classes IDs and element tags

64
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.370
from the C Ss chains or property values for styles and then affect your Each T.M..

65
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.960
OK that's it.

66
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.120
We'll see at the next lecture.
