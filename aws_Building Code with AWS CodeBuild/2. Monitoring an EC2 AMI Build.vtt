00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.510
Okay,

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.400
so now we have created another build. Let's take a look

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.070
at how we monitor it. In this demo,

4
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.320
we're going to cover the following, we're going to look at

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.710
using CloudWatch to monitor AWS CodeBuild builds similar

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.080
to in the previous module.

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
Okay, so, like in our previous module,

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.890
we're going to have a look at how to monitor our CodeBuild build

9
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.950
using CloudWatch, and that's one of those settings that we enabled

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.440
when setting up the initial build project.

11
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.380
So if we scroll down on our build, we can go to Build logs, and here is

12
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.420
all of our CloudWatch log outputted into the CodeBuild dashboard. So, we

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.410
can actually view the entire log over in CloudWatch, or we can view it

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.040
here too inside of CodeBuild dashboard.

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.040
When we scroll down, we can see where Packer started. It ran the install.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.330
We can have a look at it creating the image and then also destroying the

17
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.940
instance. There it is stopping the instance, then creating the artifact.

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.160
There's the AMI name, and then it destroyed it, and then let us know it

19
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.570
was successful from our little if statement, and then it uploaded our

20
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.830
build.log artifact.

21
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.660
Really simple,

22
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.880
really straightforward, and let's just jump over to CloudWatch quick,

23
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.560
and we can have a look at it in there.

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.320
So you have all of the same logs in here, and then

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.140
you can expand them if you want to.

26
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.670
Let's have a quick recap.

27
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.240
We just covered CodeBuild and Packer. We had a look

28
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.070
at the prerequisites required.

29
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.630
We had a look at planning the build with a build spec. We had a look

30
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.630
at creating the build in the CodeBuild dashboard, and then we had a

31
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.750
look at the AMI artifacts in AWS EC2, and then we had a look at

32
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.040
monitoring the build with CloudWatch and the logs that it outputs.

33
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.950
That wasn't so bad, was it?

34
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.540
Now you're all experts on AWS CodeBuild.

35
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.720
But before you go,

36
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.330
let's take a look at where to go next and have a look at some inspiration.

37
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.050
So what's next and where can you go from here?

38
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.510
I would suggest looking to automate as much as possible of your

39
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.130
software engineering lifecycle and start to really implement and

40
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.620
include as much DevOps methodologies as possible.

41
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.590
There are a couple of other AWS services that tie into

42
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.690
CodeBuild really well such as CodePipeline and also

43
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.180
CodeDeploy. Werner Vogels is a CTO of AWS.

44
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.010
He has driven and pointed AWS in innovative directions and makes sure they are

45
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.060
ahead of the market curve. As you can see from his quote,

46
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.280
he believes that to reduce risk to your services,

47
00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.750
we should be continuously integrating and continuously deploying changes.

48
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.210
Now CodeBuild is a key part and a key AWS service to achieve this.

49
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.440
Well, that's it. All finished, I promise.

50
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.680
Why not head over to the discussion tab to see how everyone else got on?

51
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.910
Or maybe try the test they put together on what you learned today.

52
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.470
Anyway, it's been an absolute blast, and if you're on Twitter,

53
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.710
why not give me a follow and send me a tweet.

54
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.000
I always love to hear feedback from my viewers. My name's @JoshuaGEdwards.
