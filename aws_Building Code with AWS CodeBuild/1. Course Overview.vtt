00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.160
Hello, and welcome to my course on Performing Continuous Integration

2
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.700
with AWS CodeBuild. First, a little bit about me.

3
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.420
My name is Joshua Edwards. I'm the vice president of engineering at a

4
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.720
blockchain and cryptocurrency focused business.

5
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.820
I have previously been the head of DevOps,

6
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.830
and I have used CodeBuild on a day‑to‑day basis.

7
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.620
This course is going to be focused on Amazon Web Services' CodeBuild.

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.740
CodeBuild is a super powerful, automated build service from AWS that

9
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.540
allows you to build artifacts in a number of ways.

10
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.600
This course will cover what CodeBuild is,

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.540
how to plant and create a build,

12
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.070
including local builds, prerequisites required to

13
00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.240
make these possible, and finally, how to monitor and debug builds.

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.430
By the end of this course,

15
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.940
you'll be well on your way to becoming a CodeBuild pro.

16
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.220
But before beginning this course, you should be familiar with EC2.

17
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.590
It's not necessary to be well‑versed in this service as

18
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.450
I walk you through using. From here,

19
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.010
you should feel comfortable diving into further AWS DevOp services

20
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.450
with courses on Code Pipeline and Code Deploy.

21
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.330
I hope you join me on this journey to learn all about

22
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:44.000
CodeBuild with my Performing Continuous Integration with AWS CodeBuild course, at Pluralsight.
