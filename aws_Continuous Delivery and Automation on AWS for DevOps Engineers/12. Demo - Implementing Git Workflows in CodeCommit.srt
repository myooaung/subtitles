00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,330
In this demo, we'll be implementing our first Git workflow using CodeCommit.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,370
We'll add new code directly to a main branch that we create,

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,150
and then we'll add new code via feature branches that we merge into that

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,170
main branch. We'll do this by opening CodeCommit pull requests and then

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,870
merging those pull requests into the main branch.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,740
So let's go over to VS Code and get started.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,020
You'll notice that the default name of the branch that we're

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,630
working with is called master, but if we wanted to,

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,070
we could change the name of that branch where we'll be merging everything into.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,460
If we wanted to do this, we could use git checkout ‑b for branch,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,500
which will create a new branch and check it out,

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,540
and we'll call this branch main.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,510
Now I'm going to clear the screen,

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,910
and we can start making commits to this main branch where we'll be merging

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,570
everything in after we've put it in feature branches.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,140
So to do this, let's just add a new file.

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,280
Let's do touch app.py,

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,900
which we'll be working with later on. Now inside app.py,

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,730
we're going to import the boto3 library,

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,030
which we'll be using later on with AWS.

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,120
So I'll leave that in there, and we can commit this code. First,

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,140
we'll do git status to check the current status of everything in

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,670
this branch and this repository, then we'll do git add to add

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,240
app.py, and then we'll do git status to see that it's been added to

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,720
our staging environment.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,560
And from here, we'll do git commit to commit this to our main branch. We'll

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,810
do add app.py as our commit message here, and then we'll hit Enter, and this

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,080
will be the first commit on our new repository.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,140
So now I'm going to clear the screen.

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,120
And if we wanted to push this up into our repository, we can do

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,790
git push, and then we'd have to select the name of the remote that

32
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,130
we're working with. Now in this case, by default,

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,850
that remote is called origin.

34
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,010
Now we need to pick the branch name right after the remote name.

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,040
In this case, we want to push it to a branch called main,

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,540
which is what we'll be calling the branch we're merging everything into.

37
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,220
Now, we should see that eventually it'll push everything up into

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,860
CodeCommit and create this new branch called main.

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,170
So let's clear this out, and now let's go to the AWS console to confirm

40
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,370
that this worked. Over in the AWS Management Console, we can go to the

41
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,010
Services drop‑down and look for CodeCommit,

42
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,140
and then we'll go into our repository that we created

43
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,520
earlier called flasky. Now in here,

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,430
you'll notice that we now have an app.py file that

45
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,100
appears inside of the flasky repository.

46
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,960
Now we push this directly to our main branch, which shows up the top here.

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,200
If we click the drop‑down,

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,500
you'll notice that it's currently our default branch and the only branch

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,590
that we're working with just because it's the first branch we pushed any

50
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,040
code to when we pushed code to our repository.

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,320
Now if anybody goes and clones our repo,

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,840
they'll automatically get this app.py file that we created.

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,620
But for the rest of the time that we're adding code to our repository,

54
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,930
we'll want to be adding code using a feature branch,

55
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,570
so we'll need to create a new branch and then merge

56
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,000
it into main with a pull request. We'll do that in the next video.
