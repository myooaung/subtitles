1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,010
Back in the AWS console, let's remove the resources we created in this demo.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,500
We'll start by going to Elastic Beanstalk because this is the most

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,660
important resource to remove as you'll likely be charged the most

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,750
for this one compared to other resources.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,930
Go in here and select the environment you created,

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,140
click the Actions, and then click Terminate environment.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,380
You might have to type in the name of the environment in order to do this.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,090
In this case, Flasky3‑env, and then we can hit Terminate.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,040
Now, once this is done,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,480
we can also go to the Applications section and delete our

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,520
application from the drop‑down here.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,570
We might want to wait until the environment is done just to

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,260
make sure that that's all cleaned up though.

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,410
While we're waiting,

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,580
we can go over to other parts of the console to remove some other resources.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,030
Let's go to the CodePipeline console first just to

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,090
start there. From inside of here,

18
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,970
we can remove our flasky3 pipeline just by clicking Delete pipeline,

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,340
and then we can type out delete here, and then hit Delete.

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,160
Next, we can remove the other resources we created, like our

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,680
build project and our build pipelines there.

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,030
So we'll go over to flasky3 and click Delete build project and then type delete.

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,040
And once we click Delete, this should start deleting too,

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,560
and you can also clean up the other resources you created

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,840
from other sections of this course.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,410
Now, once you're done with the build step,

27
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,430
you can even go over to the Source and the Repositories section,

28
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,170
and then you can select the repository we've been using and

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,850
click Delete and then type that out too.

30
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,410
I went ahead and deleted all the other repositories

31
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,960
that I created for this course too,

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,740
and you might want to to save yourself a little bit of money.

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,350
So after we've deleted everything,

34
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,310
let's go back to the Elastic Beanstalk portion of the console and then

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,260
click the Actions drop‑down for our application this time.

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,510
Now, we'll click Delete application.

37
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,140
This one is called flasky3, and then we can click Delete.

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,600
Now, this application and environment should have been deleted, and we

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,210
can double check by going to click Recent environment here. It looks

40
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,550
like it's still terminating this environment,

41
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,890
so we might have to wait a little bit longer just to be

42
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,040
sure all the resources get removed.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,870
But once it's done, which it looks like it just finished,

44
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,980
we should be able to remove flasky3 the application for

45
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,020
good now that the environment is gone.

46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,840
So let's try that one more time.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,300
Let's click Delete, and now everything in our

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,340
application here should be gone too.

49
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,160
And if you want,

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,250
go ahead and go through the rest of the services we created throughout

51
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,660
this course and just make sure you've deleted them in order to save

52
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:29,000
yourself a teeny bit of money on some of those. But the most important one definitely here is Elastic Beanstalk.
