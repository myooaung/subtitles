Hello and welcome to this module of continuous delivery and

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,150
automation on AWS for DevOps engineers.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,310
My name is Fernando Medina Corey, and in this module,

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,340
we'll learn about deploying our applications with AWS CodeDeploy.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,860
Let's look through everything we'll be doing in this module. To get started,

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,990
we'll look at what is AWS CodeDeploy, some deployment configuration that we

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,570
need to provide to it, CodeDeploy benefits that we get when we use the service,

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,990
and some other deployment tools that we might end up using in AWS just to

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,210
differentiate them from CodeDeploy.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:32,660
From there,

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,270
we'll take a closer look at some CodeDeploy concepts that we need to

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,080
understand when we work with it. After that, we'll visualize different

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,100
deployment types that happen with CodeDeploy.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,820
And then we'll look at AppSpec files and hooks, and both of

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,040
these concepts will be used with CodeDeploy.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,770
From there,

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,970
we'll look at a demo, and see how we can design an ECS

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,000
deployment strategy by leveraging CodeDeploy. So let's get started.
