1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,270
After we create the Identity and Access Management user,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,250
we'll then need to sign out of the AWS console and sign back in with that user

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,340
using the sign‑in link that was provided when we created it.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,340
So we'll enter our username and password,

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,130
sign into the AWS account,

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,240
and then we'll go over to the CodeCommit section of the console again.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,560
Now,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,680
what we're going to be doing is creating an SSH key

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,630
in order to use with CodeCommit,

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,660
and then we'll set that SSH key up underneath Identity and Access Management.

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,080
To do this,

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,840
we'll go back to the flasky repository and click on

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,140
the SSH section to connect with SSH.

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,280
Now,

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,490
there's going to be a few different options for setup instructions for macOS,

16
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,190
Linux, and for Windows.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,790
Go to the section that's most appropriate for your operating

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,800
system and then follow the steps there.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,640
I'll be going through the steps for macOS since that's

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,450
the operating system that I'm using.

21
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,180
Now, we've already done most of the prerequisites here.

22
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,440
We have to have a Git client,

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,940
which we've already downloaded in a previous demo from the Git website,

24
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,130
and it might already have been on our machines.

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,320
And we have to have a policy that gives us permissions to

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,880
access the AWS CodeCommit repository.

27
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,070
Now,

28
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,780
this is given both by the CodeCommit policy and the power user policy

29
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,740
that we attached to this user when we created it.

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:11,920
Now,

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,710
the last part of this first step is to create an SSH public‑private key pair.

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,130
Now,

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,870
it'll show you the instructions of how to do this when you click on the

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,650
Learn how to generate public‑private key pair link here,

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,650
but I'm going to assume that you've either done this already or that

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,780
you can go click on that link and get started.

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,480
It'll be a little bit different depending on the machine

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,620
that you're using so make sure to refer to the steps

39
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,530
underneath that operating system.

40
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,750
Once you have a public‑private key pair,

41
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,120
we'll need to register it inside Identity and Access Management.

42
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,230
So let's do that now.

43
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,040
We'll go over to the services drop‑down,

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,590
and we'll type in IAM and open up a new window here so that we

45
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,070
can work both with IAM and with CodeCommit.

46
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,520
Now, in the IAM window,

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,500
we'll probably see a lot of denies in terms of different

48
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,230
resources we're not able to access.

49
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,200
Now, this is fine.

50
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,760
That just means that the permissions we apply to this user are working

51
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,940
properly to not allow it to do everything in IAM.

52
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,040
Then we'll click on the Users section here,

53
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,340
and under the User section, we'll go to our user that we just created,

54
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,560
and we'll click on Security credentials.

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,550
Underneath here, we should see SSH keys for AWS CodeCommit.

56
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,900
Now, here, we'll need to click Upload SSH public key.

57
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,060
Now,

58
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,960
make sure to paste in the public key and not the private

59
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,750
key for your SSH public‑private key pair.

60
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,740
I'm going to go ahead and do this now.

61
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,740
Once this is pasted in, you can click Upload SSH public key.

62
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,350
Now, you should have an SSH key ID next to the key we just uploaded,

63
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,470
so go ahead and copy this SSH key ID now because we'll need to use it when we

64
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,340
set up some configuration for our Git client with our SSH key.

65
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,990
So let's go back to CodeCommit,

66
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,720
and you'll see the next thing that we need to do is take that SSH key ID and

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,590
set up a config file in a directory related to our SSH keys.

68
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:53,770
Now,

69
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,020
the steps here might be slightly different depending on

70
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,400
the operating system you're using,

71
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,440
so be sure to follow along with the appropriate one for your operating system.

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,160
In my case,

73
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,310
I'm going to need to create a new file named config

74
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,700
in the local tilde/.ssh directory.

75
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,790
Now, this is the home typical SSH directory that you'll have on a macOS system,

76
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,880
and it'll be pretty similar to what you do in Windows and Linux systems.

77
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,670
So I'm going to go over to my VS Code editor here,

78
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,830
and we're going to touch a new config file.

79
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,810
So let's create this new file with touch ~/.ssh,

80
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,350
which already exists because I've already created my SSH key pair here,

81
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,140
and then I'm going to need to create a new file.

82
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,380
Let's call this config.

83
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,900
You'll notice I have config_backup here,

84
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,740
which is an earlier version of my config so I don't lose it.

85
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,800
And inside of this config file,

86
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,690
we're going to want to add in what's included right below here in Step 3,

87
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,180
the Host, the User, and the IdentityFile.

88
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,680
So we can actually copy this entire thing here,

89
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,140
and then we can go back over to our VS Code editor,

90
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,650
and then we'll open this file up inside of VS Code.

91
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,670
We'll do code ~/.ssh/config,

92
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,320
and you could open this in whatever text editor you might be using.

93
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,960
But in this case, I just want to open it up in VS Code,

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,340
which I'm already inside of, and then we can paste that in here.

95
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:10,560
Now,

96
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,230
we'll need to copy and paste the different parts of this to make

97
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,100
it appropriate with our actual IAM SSH key ID.

98
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,590
In fact, we have to go back to the Identity Access Management console,

99
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,710
and we'll need to make sure that we copy this key here into

100
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,140
our VS Code editor and replace it there.

101
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,640
Then we're going to need to replace the IdentityFile for our private key name.

102
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,650
Now, in this case,

103
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,120
my IdentityFile is what the standard SSH key is on a macOS system,

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,850
which, if we list off the contents of the ~/.ssh directory here,

105
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,240
you'll see is id_rsa.

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,460
So I'll replace that here inside of the ssh section with id_rsa,

107
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,640
and we can save that here.

108
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,460
Now that I've done this,

109
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,100
we can go back over to the instructions in CodeCommit, and

110
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,820
the last step should be to make sure that the permissions

111
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,130
on this file are appropriate,

112
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,200
so we'll have to run one command on this Mac system to

113
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,300
change the permissions on the file.

114
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,560
So in this case,

115
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,240
it's not going to be exactly what is included in the pasted command

116
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,620
because this is referencing the current directory.

117
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,740
So what we'll need to do is go ~/.ssh/config,

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,220
and then this should change the permissions on the file so that

119
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,090
we can use it with the CodeCommit service.

120
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:24,240
Now,

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,660
be sure to save the config file before and after you do this to make sure

122
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,970
that all these changes are reflected when we're using it.

123
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,120
Now,

124
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,140
the last step is to copy the Git clone command that we'll

125
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
be using to work with this repository.

126
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,420
So after you copy it, you could go back to the VS Code editor,

127
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,730
and we can clear the screen here.

128
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,650
And actually, I'm going to close the config file out,

129
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,560
and we can just paste it in and type in git clone and ssh,

130
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,010
and you might have one other step that requires you to accept a fingerprint.

131
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,940
You can just type in yes and hit Enter if you see that.

132
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,880
So now that we've cloned the flasky repository,

133
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,700
you'll notice there's actually nothing in it.

134
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,160
So if I go and change directories into flasky and list the contents out,

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,210
there's nothing in here.

136
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,300
But if I list the contents out and look a little bit

137
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,430
more closely with the ‑al flag,

138
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,020
it'll look for hidden files as well, and we'll see

139
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,070
that there is a git folder here.

140
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,530
This just means that we've set up Git with this repository,

141
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:20,000
and we're about ready to start committing to it. So we'll push our first commits in the next demo.
