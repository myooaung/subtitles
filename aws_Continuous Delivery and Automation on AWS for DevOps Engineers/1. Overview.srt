Hello and welcome to this module of Continuous Delivery and

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,310
Automation on AWS for DevOps Engineers.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,150
My name is Fernando Medina Corey,

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,710
and in this module we'll learn how to create deployment

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,240
pipelines with AWS CodePipeline. To get started, we'll

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,470
look at what AWS CodePipeline is,

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,650
as well as the basic concepts that we need to

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,550
understand to work with the service.

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,530
From there, we'll visualize CodePipeline in an example.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,410
And then we'll take a closer look at CodePipeline action types and

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,540
the concepts that are inside of those action types.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,660
At the end of this module,

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,160
we'll look at a demo and see how we can build our own

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,000
CI/CD solutions using AWS CodePipeline. So let's get started.
