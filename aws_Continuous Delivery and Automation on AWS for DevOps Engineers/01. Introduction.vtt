00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello, and welcome to my course,

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.920
Continuous Delivery and Automation on AWS for DevOps Engineers.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.250
My name is Fernando Medina Corey, and in this module,

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.340
we'll be looking at how we can design a source

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.540
control strategy using AWS CodeCommit.

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.630
In this module, we'll be looking at some DevOps fundamentals,

7
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.370
including why you want to learn DevOps and what DevOps is, as well

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.850
as what the term CI/CD is and what it means.

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.050
From there, we'll look at some version control systems that we could use,

10
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.440
specifically looking at Git in a little bit more detail and some

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.190
of the essentials that we have around them.

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.810
And, some basic concepts that we'll need to understand when

13
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.470
we're working with the Git version control tool.

14
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.140
We'll also be looking at forking and branching and how we can use that

15
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.740
later on to get the most out of our DevOps tools.

16
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.930
Then, we'll look at some different repository hosting tools,

17
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.460
including AWS CodeCommit.

18
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.540
And finally, we'll look at how we can use CodeCommit inside of AWS.

19
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.240
Throughout this,

20
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.870
we'll have a few different demos that'll get you hands on

21
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.000
with all of these different concepts. So, let's get started.
