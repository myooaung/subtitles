00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,420
Nice work in this module.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,930
We covered everything ranging from DevOps fundamentals to what

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,950
CI/CD is and the different parts of CI/CD.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,180
We also looked at Git concepts and all the basic commands we need to

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,390
know to get up and running with different Git workflows, as well as

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,810
which ones we'll be using in this course.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,510
After that, we looked at different repository hosting tools,

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,280
but of course, we were working most with the repository

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,650
hosting tool CodeCommit. In the demos.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,970
we managed to create a CodeCommit user and repository,

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,690
and we pushed our first feature branch and merged our first pull

12
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:42,000
request using AWS CodeCommit. In future modules, we'll be doing a lot more with CodeCommit and other AWS services.
