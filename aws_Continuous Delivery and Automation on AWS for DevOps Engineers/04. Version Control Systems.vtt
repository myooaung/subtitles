00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.940
Let's look at different version control systems.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.510
Version control allows us to track and manage code changes over time and helps

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.640
us resolve conflicts when we're merging our code together.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.350
Now there's two different kinds of version or source control systems,

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.200
and these are distributed version control systems,

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.390
or DVCS, and centralized version control systems,

7
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.080
or CVCS. With the different version control systems, they

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.070
each have different tools that technically fall under one of

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.350
those two categories. For example,

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.430
Subversion, or SVN, CVS, and Perforce are all examples of

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.940
a centralized version control system.

12
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.130
There's also Mercurial and Git,

13
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.730
which are two examples of distributed version control systems. We'll be using

14
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.650
Git exclusively, as it's the most popular version control system for

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:59.000
development today, and it's the one that AWS supports most natively and can integrate with all of its developer tooling.
