1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,350
Welcome back. In this section, we'll create a bunch of other

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,490
infrastructure that our ECS cluster will use to help determine where

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,140
we're sending traffic between versions of our application.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,300
We'll start by creating the target groups that we'll need

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,540
in order to target traffic between one version and another

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,200
version of our application.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,980
Now, remember,

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,200
we have this output_values.txt file and we have some values in

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,800
here that we need to replace with it so go ahead and do that now.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,440
I'm going to use some magic to do mine.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,220
Poof! There we go.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,280
Now let's copy this first command and let's get the first target group that we

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,200
need and we'll scroll up and get the target group ARN, this we'll need to copy

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,060
and put into the output_values.txt file along with the second target group ARN

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,280
that we'll be creating with this second command, so make sure you copy both and

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,440
put them both into that file.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,950
With both these values copied,

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,400
we can go to the next step in p4. In here, we'll be creating a listener

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,200
that we configure with our application load balancer and our target groups

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,030
so make sure to copy the values from the output value section into this

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,840
file too. Poof! I did my magic again.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,450
Alright,

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,030
so now that we pasted in the ARN for the load balancer and the target

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,940
group ARN, let's copy this command and let's paste it in here too. What

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,760
this will be doing is it'll be creating a listener to listen for traffic

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,840
with the protocol of HTTP on Port 80.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,390
So let's grab the ARN for this listener and let's paste it into our

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,180
output_values.txt file as well because we'll be using this later on to

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,420
configure other application infrastructure.

30
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,210
So now that we've finished with this, let's move onto the next section,

31
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,700
which is to create our ECS cluster. Inside of here,

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,640
it's really one pretty simple command, which is aws ecs create cluster.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,940
Let me give it a cluster name and a region. Throughout this,

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,640
I'm using us‑east‑1.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,070
Now,

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,970
make sure to copy the cluster ARN that comes out of this command, it should

37
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,220
appear towards the top of the results, and then put that in your output_values

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,940
too so we can reference the cluster later, and then we're ready to scooch onto

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,310
the next step too, which is to register a task. Now for this section, we're

40
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,090
going to need to make sure that we move into the folder that contains the

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,540
fargate‑task‑blue.json file, which is just p6‑register‑task.

42
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,160
Now we can double‑check that this is true if we list out the

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,340
contents and see fargate‑task‑blue.json in there,

44
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,220
and from here, we can run the commands that we need to work with this.

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,970
The first thing we'll need to do, though,

46
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,310
is go into the fargate‑task‑blue.json file and scroll down to the

47
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,930
bottom of the file where it says a ROLE_ARN. We'll need to replace

48
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,710
this value too by getting the ROLE_ARN we created at the very

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,540
beginning of the previous section.

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,880
Now we'll paste that into here and then save it, and this means

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,310
that we'll have an execution role configured for this fargate

52
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,320
task and that will just make sure that we have the permissions we

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,120
need to work with it. Now,

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,690
everything else in here should be set up as it is and

55
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,160
you don't need to change anything.

56
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,990
In fact, if you do,

57
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,690
it might break things later, so please don't. Let's go to

58
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,100
the commands.txt file and let's copy this ecs

59
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,370
register‑task‑definition command here.

60
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,580
So let's paste that in, and this will register this task with ECS.

61
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,970
Now we'll need to scroll up to the very top of this,

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,170
which can actually go a little bit up, and we'll get a task definition error

63
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,640
and that we'll need to paste into our output_values.txt file.

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,890
You can think of this as essentially the first version of the

65
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,520
container that we're planning on running in the ECS.

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,120
Later on,

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,340
we'll make different versions that will then change to and deploy

68
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,640
to those different versions using CodeDeploy.

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,820
So with this done,

70
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
let's close out of our fargate task and let's scroll to the

71
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,860
bottom and make sure we've finished the last step,

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,940
which is to grab that ARN for the task definition.

73
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,520
Now that we're done with that, we can move onto Step 7,

74
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,480
which is to create the service that we'll have inside of the ECS cluster.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,640
Now for this section too,

76
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,640
we're going to need to clear the screen and then change directories

77
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,140
up a level and then change directories into p7‑create‑service.

78
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,120
Inside of here, you'll see that we have a service‑bluegreen.json

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,850
file and a commands.txt file.

80
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,320
We'll need to change the values in the service‑bluegreen.json file.

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,370
There are several different values we need to change,

82
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,410
including the TARGET_GROUP1_ARN, the SECURITY_GROUP_ID, and both of the

83
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,640
subnet IDs, so change all four of those values now.

84
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,260
Once you're done making these changes,

85
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,340
then save the service‑bluegreen.json file and go to the commands.txt

86
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,380
section. From here, we'll be using the aws ecs create‑service command

87
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,350
to create a service using that service‑bluegreen.json file. So we'll

88
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,890
paste this command in here.

89
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,740
Make sure you're inside of the P7 folder when you do this.

90
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,740
If you get an error, that's probably what it's related to,

91
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,580
or if you get another error that says you're missing some value,

92
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,170
make sure you pasted all the values into that file too. Let's scroll

93
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,090
up and let's grab the ARN for this service now that we've deployed

94
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,110
it. We'll need to scroll up towards the top and there is a lot of

95
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,890
information that comes out here, so make sure you grab the right value.

96
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,040
It should look like this right here.

97
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,630
So let's copy that value and take it to the output_value section here and

98
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,940
we'll paste it in right here under the service ARN.

99
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,800
Now that we've done this, we have that service value,

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,890
which means that our service has been created inside of the cluster and

101
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,070
we've created a task that's registered that we can use to deploy different

102
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,050
containers inside of that service in the cluster.

103
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,520
So now that we have all this configuration done with, we've finished setting

104
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,000
up everything we need to for ECS, and we're ready to start working with CodeDeploy and deploying things to ECS using it.
