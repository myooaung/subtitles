Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,120
My name is Fernando Medina Corey, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,640
Continuous Delivery and Automation on AWS for DevOps Engineers.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,170
I'm a Lead Cloud Architect, and I've previously used AWS as

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,440
a data engineer and software developer.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,530
I also hold six AWS certifications and have made

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,640
courses that span dozens of AWS services.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,930
This course is a tour of several important AWS DevOps services.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,430
With DevOps being one of the most inâ€‘demand engineering skills,

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,230
we need to learn how we can use it to improve our development practices.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,510
Some of the major topics that we will cover include creating

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,440
build and test pipelines with AWS CodeBuild,

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,240
deploying applications with AWS CodeDeploy,

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,070
managing infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation,

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,190
and creating automated release pipelines with AWS CodePipeline.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,560
By the end of this course,

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,480
you'll know how to leverage several important AWS services to

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,010
streamline your development practices and improve the

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,540
reliability and quality of your code.

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,110
Before beginning the course, you might want some experience with AWS or with Git,

21
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,740
but the demo code and the commands will all be provided for you.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,520
From here,

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,970
you should feel comfortable diving into other AWS

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,810
development topics with courses on AWS Lambda,

25
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,240
Architecting for Cost on AWS, or Collecting and Storing Data on AWS.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,030
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn about DevOps

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:38,000
on AWS with the Continuous Delivery and Automation on AWS for DevOps Engineers course, here at Pluralsight.
