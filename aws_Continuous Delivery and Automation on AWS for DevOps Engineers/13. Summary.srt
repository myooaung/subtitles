00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,490
Nice work throughout this module.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,980
We covered a lot of complicated stuff about CodeDeploy,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,960
ranging from the basics about the benefits CodeDeploy offers, some of the

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,550
configuration and the concepts around it, and also the details around how

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,060
CodeDeploy can be used with multiple platforms like EC2 or on‑premises

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,690
environments, and ECS, as well as AWS Lambda. And you took a closer look at

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,630
things like AppSpec files and the hooks that they have available to them when

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,660
you're working with different platforms. Both to run scripts at particular

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,690
times and installations on EC2 or on‑premises environments, we had to run

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,450
Lambda functions as tests in situations where you're deploying to ECS or AWS

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,250
Lambda. Now, at the very end,

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,800
you did a lot of great work deploying your own ECS application.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,620
That was a pretty complicated demo and a pretty sophisticated

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,190
deployment process, so you should pat yourself on the back

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,540
for getting through all of that.

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,270
There's a lot more to learn about ECS and working with it

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,500
that I wasn't able to cover in this course, but if you're

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,000
working with it in the future, you should feel pretty good about how you could integrate CodeDeploy with it.
