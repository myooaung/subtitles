00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.990
[Autogenerated] in this short clip will look at opening applications now,

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.910
as you're no doubt aware,

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.610
you can pin your favorite APS or desktop applications

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.760
to your taskbar to your start menu.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.970
You can even have shortcuts on your desktop.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.220
Opening pinned applications is a simple matter of

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.710
selecting or giving a single click toe.

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.570
Open that application and, of course, with shortcuts that air saved your desktop.

9
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.780
You'll need to double click to open those.

10
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.770
One important tip to take away from this clip is finding an

11
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.970
opening applications that are used less often as we've

12
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.250
already considered another clips.

13
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.280
It's not too difficult to locate APS there are installed

14
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.840
in your device using the all APS menu.

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.280
However,

16
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.570
you'll find it to be very practical to get used to the idea of

17
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.330
using the search box to locate your applications.

18
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.840
And absent aren't pinned.

19
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.150
Let's say, for example, that I need to use the paint desktop application.

20
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.800
I know where that's located at.

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.680
I would have to goto all apse windows accessories,

22
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.020
and then I could find the paint application.

23
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.110
Look how much easier it is just to simply type in paint.

24
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.380
And there it is.

25
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.500
Well,

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.720
let's say you've been told that you need to open a command prompt on

27
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.840
your computer to perform some task well again.

28
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.850
Instead of looking for that, simply type in command.

29
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.380
And they're easy.

30
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.640
The command prompt application.

31
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.980
No, the same tip applies.

32
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.720
If you're looking for settings,

33
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.940
let's say I need to do something with my display settings.

34
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.270
And here you can see different places where settings

35
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.270
that affect my display are indicated.

36
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.520
I can open up my settings, apt to display settings.

37
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:41.000
In this clip, we look briefly at opening applications. Thanks for watching you look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
