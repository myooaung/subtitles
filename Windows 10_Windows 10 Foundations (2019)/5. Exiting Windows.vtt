00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.540
[Autogenerated] in this little look at your options when accident windows.

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.740
When we're done using our device,

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.940
there's usually a few ways we can actually exit from one notes.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.630
The best choice for us will be determined by a few different factors,

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.080
like security and power settings.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.620
To see your options for X and windows,

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.540
you can select the start button and then power.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.510
Depending on your device,

9
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.660
you'll see options like sleep shut down and restart Occasionally.

10
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.950
You'll see variations on this that will let you know that there's

11
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.740
pending Windows updates that are awaiting a restart.

12
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.640
In that case, you'll see update and shut down and update and restart.

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.350
Occasionally.

14
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.900
I'll see issues with sound or applications not working correctly,

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.720
and sometimes I find that it's just a matter of there's a

16
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.340
pending update that needs a reboot, and then my devices fine again.

17
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.840
So it's a good idea to check this every now and then.

18
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.690
If you're having some issues.

19
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.790
Most Windows updates are able to be performed

20
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.650
without any reboot being requiring,

21
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.670
and it's not unusual for a computer tablet to be powered up for

22
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.840
many days or even weeks without an actual reboot.

23
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.110
But if you do start to experience issues with performance.

24
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.280
Selecting restart could be a good option to reset everything.

25
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460
This will make sure any open applications have been closed,

26
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.640
and it resets most service's and processes that might be tying up.

27
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.160
Resource is now.

28
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.440
If you won't be using your device for several hours or even days,

29
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.640
Shutting down is a good option.

30
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.900
Devices running Windows 10 tend to be more energy efficient.

31
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.440
It's often better to just let them sleep.

32
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.870
This gonna lot updates to be performed and reboots to be dining off hours.

33
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.540
And your advice will just need to be woken up the next time you need to

34
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.440
use the device certainly faster than putting up cold.

35
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.630
Another factor to consider when choosing between shut

36
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.940
down and sleep is battery life.

37
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.580
If you're on a battery powered device shutting down, we'll use no power at all.

38
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.560
While sleep does use minimal power,

39
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.580
and it will continue to slowly drain your battery by default on Windows 10.

40
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.890
Device asleep will also occur automatically if the devices

41
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.640
left undisturbed after a set period of time.

42
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
Usually this is set to 15 year, 30 minutes,

43
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.150
although sometimes you could have your set to a matter of hours,

44
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.840
or you could have it actually set to never go to sleep.

45
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.400
Open up the settings out and then select system and finally power and

46
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.840
sleep to see your current settings regarding sleep.

47
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.040
Another way to exit windows is to sign out or lock your device.

48
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.240
Select the start button again and then select your account.

49
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.140
You'll generally see options here to sign out and lock.

50
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.830
Sign out will close all of your open applications and will require you

51
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.240
to sign back in if you need to use the device again.

52
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.910
This is a good option when you're using a shared

53
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.670
device and you're done with the device.

54
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.920
For now, lock will leave your applications open,

55
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.940
but the device will require you to sign back in again to resume your session.

56
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.620
This is a good option if you're leaving your device

57
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.940
unattended for a few minutes or more.

58
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.140
I always recommend that you use an account with a password, even in your home.

59
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.160
While I appreciate it's easier and a secure environment to just start up you

60
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.830
device and not have the hassle of signing in there just too many unforeseen

61
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.730
ways that our privacy could be compromised Weatherby by a child or a guest in

62
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.050
the home or a home burglary and other clips.

63
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.780
We're gonna look more at security and some of the settings that could be used

64
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.270
to enhance the default security settings on your device.

65
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:25.000
In this clip, we've looked at options related to exiting windows. Thanks for watching and look forward to see new in the next clip.
