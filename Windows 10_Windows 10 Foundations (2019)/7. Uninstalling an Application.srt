[Autogenerated] in this clip,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,350
we're going to look at uninstalling an application from time to time.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,040
We need to remove applications that we've installed on our devices.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,740
It's good to remember that Windows 10 uses two types of applications.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,810
There are modern apse, which are obtained through the Windows Store,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,300
and desktop applications, which can be downloaded from the Internet,

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,390
installed where they can be installed from some type of installation media.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,950
The easiest way to uninstalling application is usually to locate

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,540
the application from our start menu and right click the

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,820
application to bring up the context menu.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,460
You'll see the option to uninstall now.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,040
If this is a modern app, you'll see this pop up,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,040
confirming that the APP and its data are about to be removed.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,370
Select uninstall again to confirm it will quickly disappear,

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,240
and it will be removed from your device.

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,240
If the application is a desktop application,

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,270
the programs and features window will open,

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,550
and it will show you all of the desktop applications

19
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,990
that are installed in your device.

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,640
You'll need to select your application here and then

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,770
select uninstall from the top of the list.

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,710
The uninstaller for that application will be launched and it will

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,040
walk you through any steps and may be needed.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,380
You may be asked to make decisions related to saved

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,170
information or components that were installed.

26
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:18,700
Additionally,

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,120
you may find that in some cases more than what item was

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,460
installed for a particular application.

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,720
So you may need to look through the list to make sure everything was removed.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,410
Another way to manager on installs is through the settings out under settings,

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,740
select APS and features,

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,540
and here you can filter the results in a few different ways.

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,210
Besides size, you can also sort by name and date of installation.

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,240
You can also focus the results to specific drives if you

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,540
have more than one location on your device.

36
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,630
This could be especially useful when you're trying to create

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,170
some space on your device and just need to see what chaps

38
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,890
are taking up the most space.

39
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,970
Select an application and then select uninstalled to start the

40
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,390
same on install process we described earlier.

41
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,320
In some cases,

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,950
you may select an app on your start menu and find that no uninstall action

43
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,240
is present where you may see an option on installed,

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
but it may be great out depending on the version of

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,830
windows you're currently using.

46
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,780
But this will be the case when an app is considered a core

47
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,140
app and is really part of Windows 10.

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,710
You can find instructions on the Internet for manually uninstalling most

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,490
of these core APS if you really determined to do so.

50
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,310
But I don't recommend doing this as some of these acts are expected to be there,

51
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,840
and you could find Windows to be negatively impacted if they were removed.

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,690
The main reason Windows 10 uses APS to handle some system tasks

53
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,540
is that these could be updated easily without requiring any

54
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,690
major updates to Windows 10 itself.

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:54,000
In this clip, we've looked at uninstalling applications. Thank you for watching and look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
