00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,910
[Autogenerated] in this clip, we're gonna look at understanding Windows APS.

2
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,210
This clip is designed to kind of get you familiar with.

3
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,850
Some of the terms will be used throughout this series.

4
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,820
Window zaps are modern APS that are installed through the window store.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,620
Desktop applications really meet more of the traditional criteria.

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,300
They have been downloaded from the Internet.

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,210
They're installed.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,610
Or maybe you have a installation disk to install this on your device.

9
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,550
It may make a difference if it's a 64 32 bit application.

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,690
They download both Windows.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,840
APS and desktop applications are really applications,

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,540
so sometimes you hear the term applications used in

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,220
reference to both of these categories.

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,970
Generally, when I use the term desktop application or windows app,

15
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,090
there's a reason I'm being very specific.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,430
Window zaps are designed to work very efficiently with Windows 10.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:05,880
In fact,

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,790
the installation and updates are managed right from the windows store window

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,470
zaps install very quickly and then install Justus quickly.

20
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,030
Another thing you may have noticed with windows,

21
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,500
APP says they're designed to keep the content as the focus,

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,550
so generally menus are kept to a minimum.

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,240
The windows will be borderless,

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,200
and you'll see a lot of consistency in the way menus

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,290
appear and behave in a Windows app.

26
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,940
So what else makes windows App is different.

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,090
Well,

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,210
Windows APS are designed to meet certain design criteria that

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,740
Microsoft has set out for developers that wanna write

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,040
applications that work with Windows 10.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,810
Now these design characteristics don't just include

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,530
the overall appearance of the app, although that certainly is a factor.

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,170
But it also includes the way they interact with the operating

34
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,870
system and with the hardware in your device.

35
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,860
Window zaps are designed to run sand boxed,

36
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,970
which means basically that they kind of run in their own little enclosure.

37
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,870
And any tax that need to be handled outside of that enclosure outside of the

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,190
app such as printing or sending something to the display,

39
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,280
are handed off to the operating system.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,230
This takes a lot of load off of developers,

41
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,450
since they don't have to know every piece of hardware variation that

42
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,280
computer might have to run a windows app because of the way windows app

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
is installed in this sand boxed environment,

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,850
windows after don't make changes to the operating system.

45
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,400
In other words,

46
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,510
there's not a lot of registry changes or special files that are

47
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,740
installed somewhere in the Windows operating system.

48
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,580
Now there's a lot of benefits to the way these modern Windows APS install.

49
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,390
Because of the nature,

50
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,220
it's very difficult for some malicious individual to try

51
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,830
toe damage or change your computer.

52
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,250
You'll also find that when a system is being overtaxed,

53
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,320
a Windows app will simply _____ rather than have the whole

54
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,840
operating system come to a screeching halt.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,100
So Windows APS are really designed to let the operating system manage

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,250
them as far as how much resource is they're using and how much of an

57
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,840
impact this is having on your devices performance.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,510
You'll also find that window zaps meet a certain design

59
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,050
standard that affects the overall appearance.

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,710
So things like menus and other characteristics of

61
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,490
APS are gonna be pretty universal.

62
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,350
Whether using them on a tablet, a desktop computer or a Windows phone.

63
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,120
Let's just take a moment.

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
We'll look at some of the basic characteristics

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,240
that you'll find in a windows app.

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,330
You know any app for application that's running on?

67
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,340
Windows will have a title bar.

68
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,460
These tidal bars generally will have the same controls to minimize,

69
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,480
maximize our close a window.

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,280
In some cases, you may see a back arrow.

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,340
You'll also see hamburger menus,

72
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,630
another common feature that's been introduced with Windows 10.

73
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,160
These hamburger menus are designed to expand and reveal additional

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,410
controls when needed when not in use the minimize so they're not

75
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,510
obstructing your view of the application itself.

76
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,820
That's also common to see pains that may open from the left

77
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,880
or the right side of the application.

78
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,210
These may include other settings or other configurations.

79
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,070
Some Windows APS will have a command bar,

80
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,600
and it's gonna have to be revealed if you're using the most by right clicking,

81
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,860
and you may then see additional commands pop up

82
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,220
either from the top or bottom or both.

83
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,450
Window zaps often use an ellipsis, the three little dots,

84
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,430
as you can see here, and this also could be expanded.

85
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,560
That's letting you know there's more options or more

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,370
commands available in this clip.

87
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:30,000
We've looked at understanding Windows, APS. Thanks for watching had look forward to seeing you in the next clip
