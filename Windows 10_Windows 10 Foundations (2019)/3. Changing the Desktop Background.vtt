[Autogenerated] in this clip will get changing the desktop background.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.830
It's probably nothing that ties a computer to a person

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.740
as much as their desktop background.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.510
And that's my Windows Through many generations has allowed us

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.040
to personalize their desktop background.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.770
We have become used to using wallpapers that reflect our inner artist

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.280
to help us to remember family and friends or maybe think about places

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.290
that we've been or do we help to visit.

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.070
Windows 10 certainly allows you to personalize the appearance of the desktop.

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.640
And, as with many other elements of Windows 10 it's even added some new features.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.160
So if you decide you'd like to change the desktop background,

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.140
you actually have a few choices.

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.040
We'll start by opening the settings out.

14
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.030
Next will select personalization, and with Windows 10 we have a nice preview.

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.390
Does lets us see our changes right away.

16
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.620
Now most people will find Windows 10 by default,

17
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.670
is using a picture for their background.

18
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.540
If you scroll down a little bit,

19
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.120
you'll see there's actually some preloaded

20
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.500
wallpapers for our Windows 10 devices.

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.110
Just select one of these automatically apply it to your background.

22
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.340
Now, most of us have accumulated some pictures and images over the years,

23
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.700
so you can also select brows and select a picture from your own collection.

24
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060
But down here below, you actually have a few other options.

25
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.490
As far as how your image will fit on the screen,

26
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.980
just select the current choice and then choose from the

27
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.620
options here to get the best effect.

28
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.200
Besides using a traditional picture for our background,

29
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.240
we can also choose a solid color.

30
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.610
The last trace we have for our background is slideshow how,

31
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.460
by default,

32
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.650
the slide show will go through the pictures that are in our pictures folder.

33
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.960
However,

34
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.020
you can select brows and then navigate to a folder that has some

35
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.240
pictures that you'd like to use for your sideshow.

36
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.250
Now, below this, we have a few settings a defector slideshow against,

37
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.400
like this dropdown menu to change how often our pictures will swap out.

38
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.820
We can have our pictures play an order,

39
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.480
or we could have them shuffle randomly and again under choose

40
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.630
a fit we can select from the options here.

41
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.620
The best one that will work with the pictures in our slide show.

42
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.610
After you've selected your background should also look at colors,

43
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.090
colors has to do with colors that complement the

44
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.730
current background that we're using.

45
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.090
Windows 10 is actually able to look at the back room we're using

46
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.240
and picked the perfect complement color for that.

47
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.770
So you'll notice that this setting automatically pick an accent

48
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.540
color for my background is enabled by default.

49
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:26.000
In this clip, we've looked at changing the desktop background. Thank you for watching and therefore to seen you in the next clip.
