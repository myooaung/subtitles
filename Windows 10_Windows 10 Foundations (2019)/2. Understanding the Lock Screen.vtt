00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.730
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at the lock screen.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.040
The Windows lock screen fulfills an important function.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.450
When your device has been secured or locked.

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.410
It will require some means of authentication to access your device again.

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.030
Now this is enabled by default,

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.080
and I recommend against disabling this unless you have a unique situation.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.240
No,

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.580
the last green can present a static image or can actually display a slide show.

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.640
And we'll talk more about that in a moment.

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.260
The lock screen Kam present you with some good

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.390
information to have at your fingertips.

12
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.690
Here you can see the time, the date I can see.

13
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.470
I have e mails and I can see I'm connected to a network.

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.480
Selecting or swiping the lock screen will reveal my sign in screen.

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.030
After signing in, I could go look at my settings,

16
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.030
which control how my lack screen will behave and how it will appear.

17
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.150
The quickest way to get to my lack screen settings is

18
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.430
simply to type in lock in my search box,

19
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.600
and here you can see lock screen settings.

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.630
This opens up the settings app to the personalization section under lock screen.

21
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.920
You can see I can choose the overall appearance of my lock screen and down here,

22
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.510
I can control which of the apse will present

23
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.020
information by means of my lock screen.

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.380
Here you can see I have my calendar.

25
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.740
I have email, and I also have the alarms and clock out.

26
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.150
No wonder screen time out settings you actually was sitting there,

27
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.830
let you determine how long the lack screen will appear

28
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.300
before the screen goes dark or shuts off.

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.740
They're returning to the personalization section and lacks screen.

30
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.610
You can see the overall appearance is determined by

31
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.360
this drop down under background now.

32
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
Currently, it's using just a specific image.

33
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.540
A picture.

34
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.050
I can also select a slide show and some devices.

35
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.670
You'll see Windows Spotlight,

36
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.710
which is a feature that Microsoft has made available that will actually push

37
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.360
out unique images kind of random images as time goes on,

38
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.640
and you indicate that you like some of the images that appear,

39
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.470
you'll see this start to personalize,

40
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.510
and you'll see similar images based on your feedback.

41
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.760
When the spotlight is a service and it's designed

42
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.730
new highlighter feature new APS,

43
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.220
maybe help you discover things that are in the store

44
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.160
can also present you with tips.

45
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.790
It can even help you to see AP Security have on your

46
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.940
device that maybe you've never used.

47
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.220
Now Microsoft has included some attractive images you

48
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.000
can use for your black screen here, but you can choose your own.

49
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.840
Maybe you have some family pictures or a pet that you want up here.

50
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.950
You just use the brow is to select the picture that you

51
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.910
want to have on your lock screen.

52
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.540
Now, if you'd like your lock screen to present a slide show,

53
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.840
just select slideshow.

54
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.640
You'll see your choices.

55
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.840
Alter a bit and by default, the Pictures folder is included in your slide show.

56
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.470
No, my case.

57
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.220
I don't want to just have all my pictures randomly show

58
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.540
without any organization or thought.

59
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.530
It's what you can do is you can have a folder that you set

60
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.170
up ahead of time with specific pictures.

61
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.100
You'd like to be in your slide show select add a folder and then

62
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.550
simply pointed to the full that he'd like to add.

63
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.120
It's like Choose this folder,

64
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.920
and now I have two folders that are listed or albums

65
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.550
that are listed for my slide show.

66
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.600
In this case, I'm going to select pictures and then remove it.

67
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.310
Now, when my device goes toe lack screen,

68
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.440
I'll see a slide show using the specific images I've selected for my slide show.

69
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.610
No one last thing to be aware of.

70
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.180
If you do select slide show and you look at screen time out settings,

71
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.790
the screen will never actually go dark.

72
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.380
The slide show will continue playing into you,

73
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.110
unlock your device or actually power it down in this clip.

74
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:38.000
We've looked at the lock screen thing for watching head look forward is he knew in the next clip.
