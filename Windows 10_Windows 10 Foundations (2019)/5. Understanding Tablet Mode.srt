00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,010
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at understanding tablet mode.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,610
Another clips.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,840
We've made reference to tablet mode and rapture, wondering what is tablet mode.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,140
It certainly is a new term for long time Windows users.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,310
Well,

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,140
Tablet Mode is a new feature with Windows 10 that allows your device to

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,360
dynamically change the way it interfaces with you.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,550
Now.

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,540
Windows eight was really designed to work with

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,290
tablets in touch screen interfaces.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,260
Obviously, many computers don't have touch interfaces,

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,580
and it could be a pretty awkward way of working with your desktop computer.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,540
So when does Time was designed to work well with desktop hardware?

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,990
They have a keyboard and mouse while the same time

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,540
working well with tablets that use touch.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,920
Now there are actually quite a few devices out there that I

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,590
referred to its hybrid devices or two and one.

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,480
So it may be a tablet with an attached keyboard,

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,180
and sometimes you'll see these keyboards can either

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,860
detach or they fold behind the tablet, and in doing so,

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,900
they're disabled.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,640
That allows you to use the screen itself as a touch interface.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:02,810
Now,

24
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,610
Windows 10 can see this difference and recognize when there's hardware

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,040
such as a keyboard that's available for interface or not.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,480
When it detects that the keyboard is no longer present,

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,520
it will automatically switch the device to tablet mode.

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,230
Knowing that touch is now going to be the preferred method of interaction.

29
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,460
It's really a pretty slick transformation now.

30
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,440
You can also manually make this change and you confined tune

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,880
how tablet mode works for your device.

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,310
Let's look at some of the settings involved.

33
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,630
First of all, from the action center,

34
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,690
you'll see a quick action button that's labeled tablet mode.

35
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,220
By enabling tablet mode, you'll see quite a few changes automatically take place.

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,400
Any open APS will now be full screen by default,

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,530
and in this case you can see how my taskbar lost all of its icons for open

38
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,230
APS tablet mode also provides a more subtle differences.

39
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,410
You may see things they're more spaced out,

40
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,740
allowing for better and easier touch interaction.

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,310
For example,

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,780
the icons that are visible on my taskbar have more space between them,

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,790
so it would make it easier to touch the correct ones just using my fingers.

44
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,460
Another thing in Lotus with tablet mode is when you select a search field or a

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,830
text field touch keyboard automatically appears so again,

46
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,630
Windows consents when it needs to have text input

47
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,700
provided the keyboard will appear.

48
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,780
And when you select somewhere outside of your text field,

49
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,040
the keyboard can go away.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,950
Now, as I mentioned earlier,

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,100
there are some settings that allow you to personalize or to fine

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,990
tune how tablet mode works and your device.

53
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,290
If I open the settings, APP and I select system and then tablet mode,

54
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,330
notice that I can choose the default behavior of my device when I sign in.

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,200
In this case is going to remember what I used last.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,770
I could change that always go to the desktop or always

57
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,430
go to tablet mode and again as faras,

58
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,020
allowing the device to automatically make those changes.

59
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,710
I can control that from here.

60
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,450
Don't ask me, don't switch.

61
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,530
Always ask me before switching or just make the switch.

62
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,340
So if the hardware changes, that computer can actually make those changes for me.

63
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,610
Finally, this is one.

64
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,480
You may want to make a change with Hyde App icons on

65
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,050
the taskbar when I'm in tablet mode, so again,

66
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,960
by default to avoid clutter,

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,210
you'll find that Europa naps are hidden on the taskbar.

68
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,070
This allows you to turn those back on now.

69
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,270
Some other observations to be aware of with tablet mode

70
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,430
is that when you're in tablet mode, you'll rarely if ever see your desk top.

71
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,180
So if you have the habit of saving shortcuts or documents to your desktop,

72
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,680
you won't have easy access to those when you're in tablet mode.

73
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,730
Another thing is was mentioned is your ___ will default to

74
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,240
full screen view Now that doesn't mean that you can't have

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,790
more than one at visible at a time, and another clip will look at using snap.

76
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,880
And this allows you to have more than one app available

77
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,100
or visible on your display at a time.

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:59,000
In this clip, we've looked at understanding tablet mode. Thanks for watching and look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
