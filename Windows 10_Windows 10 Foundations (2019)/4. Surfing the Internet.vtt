00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.040
[Autogenerated] in this clip, we'll talk about surfing the Internet.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.150
Now,

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.800
with the popularity of Windows 10 there's many users

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.490
that are really new to the Internet,

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.840
so this may be the first time you're being exposed to some

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.160
of the information that's out there.

7
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.240
So really much of information in this clip is designed to

8
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.030
help ones that are new to the Internet.

9
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.970
Now you may have several devices in your home or

10
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.980
workplace that are used every day.

11
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.640
Now, when you throw in a switch or router,

12
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.780
these devices can connect to one another and then you have a network.

13
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.010
So whether you're at home, your place of work,

14
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.970
we're just using public WiFi when you connect to the network.

15
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.240
All of the device is connected to that same access

16
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.630
point are part of the same network.

17
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
Not being connected to a network does not in itself guarantee.

18
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.680
Did you have access to the Internet?

19
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.840
It's only when you're access.

20
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.130
Point has a connection to the Internet that your devices

21
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.040
come benefit from that Internet connection.

22
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.550
Now you'll find that on your Windows 10 device,

23
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.780
there's many applications that benefit and require a passive

24
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.620
Internet connection to be able to pull down sports data or

25
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.010
weather or the latest news stories.

26
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.230
Other applications require an Internet connection to pull down email and

27
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.700
yet others to provide the latest social network updates.

28
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.410
Besides these passive Internet connections that you device may enjoy,

29
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.340
we all like to surf the Internet.

30
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.230
Nobody means of the Internet.

31
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.830
We have access to an incredible amount of information,

32
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.040
some of it very useful, some of it not so much.

33
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.670
The challenge is locating the information that we

34
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.310
need now to make this productive.

35
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.200
We have a variety of tools at our disposal.

36
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.690
There's many different Web browsers that are available.

37
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.530
Some popular choices include Chrome, Firefox,

38
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.240
Internet Explorer and, of course, with Windows 10.

39
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.840
Microsoft Edge has been introduced as the latest Web

40
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.740
browser for Microsoft devices.

41
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.880
So regardless of the Web browser you use,

42
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.200
many basic features are gonna be the same across all of those now,

43
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.600
Most website addresses look something like this.

44
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.760
Www dot Microsoft dot com Now, generally, Web browsers will assume the W.

45
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.040
W.

46
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.860
W is there, so you can simply type in Microsoft dot com and, well, thank you.

47
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.910
The website.

48
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.540
Now, many times when we start browsing the Web.

49
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.430
We don't know where to find the thing that we're looking for.

50
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.740
So that's where we rely on search engines.

51
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.460
So when you browse the Web, you may start with a popular search engine.

52
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.780
You may go with being, or maybe Google.

53
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.010
Or maybe you have your own favorite now,

54
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.230
while there are many different search engines,

55
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.880
essentially, they all perform the same basic function.

56
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.160
Type in keywords and launch your search.

57
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.330
So let's say we're looking for a new tablet for Windows 10.

58
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.070
So tablet and Windows 10 would certainly give me relevant

59
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.230
results if I wanted to be more specific.

60
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.050
And let's say I want to look for surface tablets for Windows 10.

61
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.620
Just buy it in the word surface.

62
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.040
It really narrows down my results.

63
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.210
And Web browsers generally would provide filters that

64
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.480
you further refine your results.

65
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.030
And one last tip something to be aware of is that while search

66
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.370
engines very on how they present the results,

67
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.860
how they find the information out there in the

68
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.850
Internet that they present to you, some results are influenced by advertisers,

69
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.620
and most search engines will tag these and let you know this is an ad.

70
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.500
Hopefully that provide you with some basic information.

71
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.410
Could you start in surfing the Web?

72
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.450
And I encourage you to watch some of the other clips we have

73
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.280
devoted to Microsoft Edge to get the most of your surfing

74
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.880
experience with this new Web browser.

75
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:19.000
In this clip, we've looked at surfing the Internet. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
