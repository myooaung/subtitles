00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,070
[Autogenerated] and this clip will be looking at using the settings out the

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,940
settings at please a very important rule of Windows 10.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,500
If you're a longtime Windows user,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,800
you likely have used the control panel on Windows to

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,170
manage settings and hardware in the past.

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,780
The control panel still exists in Windows 10.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,350
However,

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,600
most of the apple it's and settings that were managed from the control panel

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,490
have been brought into the settings out with future updates.

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,440
This migration will continue.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,990
There's actually several ways open the settings out.

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,850
The most common way is from the start menu by selecting

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,240
the settings icon over here on the left.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,040
When you first opened the settings up, you'll see the homepage.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,110
The categories you see may vary a little bit,

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,290
depending on your device and the hardware you have.

17
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,940
For example, not all devices will display mixed reality settings,

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,410
but you will at least see 13 categories,

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,510
and most of your windows 10 devices throughout this course will

20
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,840
examine many of the settings and categories in detail.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,390
This clip is intended to provide us with an order of you so

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,850
that you get a general feel for what's in here and how to find

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,840
savings you need when you need him.

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,790
A lot of thought has been put into making the categories logical,

25
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,340
and settings have moved around a bit since when Justin was first

26
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,540
released between redesigns and migrating settings.

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,590
It's simply not reasonable to try to memorize where every setting is located.

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,340
So throughout the course,

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,570
I'll often point out how useful it is to use the search tool down

30
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,890
on your taskbar rather than opening the setting.

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,940
Zap it all.

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,180
As you can see right on the home page, there's a search tool appear labeled.

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,440
Find the setting.

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,950
And if you open up a category,

35
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,580
that same tool will appear on every page in the city's

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,280
aptly includes this navigation menu here.

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,510
If we type in a keyword,

38
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,340
we'll see a quick list that provides the most common results for the key word.

39
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,340
If we don't see what we're looking for, we can select show all results.

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,070
Depending on just how many results there are,

41
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,160
we can actually scroll through the list.

42
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,400
Selecting on any of these will jump a straight to that page or pain

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,940
within the settings up that contains that setting.

44
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,720
As I mentioned there are still some settings that could

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,100
be found in the older control panel,

46
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,010
and you may have come across sayings that over that

47
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,690
meaning they could change the same setting.

48
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,180
And both the sayings that and the control panel,

49
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,330
for example, if I type in sound and then I scroll all the way down,

50
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,840
notice that there's a few icons that seem out of place,

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,260
these icons actually will.

52
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,540
Open control panel Apple it's that are used to handle that related setting.

53
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,180
This comprehensive search tool that uses both the settings up and the

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,640
control panel makes it so much easier to locate those very hard to find

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,700
settings when you make changes in control panel Apple,

56
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,310
it's it's important to realize that changes to settings must

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,700
be applied before they will take effect.

58
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,410
You may see an actual apply button, but often it's enough to select.

59
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,340
Okay,

60
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,230
Cancel will actually close the apple it or dialogue box

61
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,390
without ever having made a change.

62
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,590
Now this is very different from changes you make in the

63
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,770
settings that won't you change the setting.

64
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,240
It's almost always up immediately applied,

65
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,140
and you'll rarely see cancel or pie _______ when working with the settings out.

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,490
Another factor you'll occasionally run into is that some

67
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,610
sightings may make changes to your device,

68
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,940
and they require administrator rights to make that change.

69
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,150
For that reason, you may see additional prompts to confirm a change,

70
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,720
or you may be asked to provide an administrator user name and password toe.

71
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,280
Authorize the change.

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,720
For example,

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,790
Watch what happens when I tape in remote and then I select

74
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,070
remote desktop settings now find able to switch here to

75
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,060
allow remote desktop connections.

76
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,060
I'm prompted to confirm this choice,

77
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,440
even though I'm logged in right now with admin rights with this account.

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,020
And this is actually to protect me,

79
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,660
because normally it would be unwise to facilitate a

80
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,300
remote connection in my device,

81
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,610
and a standard user wouldn't even be ableto flip the switch house I mentioned.

82
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,090
This is actually a protective or security measure because some settings,

83
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,030
by changing them,

84
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,650
could have malicious results that could damage your account security.

85
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,840
They can affect your device performance or even compromise access to your data.

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,030
If you're asked by Windows to confirm in action,

87
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,120
it's a good indication that you might want to pause to consider why

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,150
this may not be a recommended action in this clip.

89
00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:02,000
We've looked at using the settings out there watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
