00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.040
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at pinning maps to the START menu.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.250
In a previous clip, we looked at the elapse menu,

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.420
which presents us with that comprehensive list of

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.840
everything installed on your device.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.680
Using this list, you can always find the applications you need.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.300
However,

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.340
some applications used more often really should be pinned to

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.140
your start menu to make it easier to find them.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.640
Let's use the Windows text editing application WordPad as an example.

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.870
If you watch the previous clip,

11
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.780
you might recall that this application is buried in a folder,

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.960
and it would be pretty tedious to hunt for it every time we

13
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.320
needed to create a letter or work on a text document opinion

14
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.750
application to your start menu.

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.940
It's a pretty straightforward process.

16
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.840
First, we locate the APP in the all its menu.

17
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.350
Now I right click the application.

18
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.540
I can actually select pin to start,

19
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.690
but when you're in desktop mode and you can see both

20
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.860
the all APS list in the start menu,

21
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.850
there's an even faster way you can actually simply

22
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.670
select and then drag and drop.

23
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.560
The application to create a new tile knows that the icon changes to a tile.

24
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.150
Once it's over,

25
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.250
the main start menu applications already pin will move around to create a

26
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.840
space until you decide where you want to drop the new tile.

27
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.980
Many ups are designed to actually display live tile information,

28
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.440
and you'll only see this if they're pinned to start.

29
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.480
Applications have been pinned to start will still

30
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.600
appear in your elapse list menu,

31
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.940
so don't worry that you're making any changes to that comprehensive list.

32
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.490
Pinning maps to the start menu is easy as you've seen,

33
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.410
but I encourage you toe on Li Pin APS.

34
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.140
To start that you really use as the start menu can also become cluttered.

35
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.840
I've seen some start menus that start to look like the all APS list.

36
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.950
It can really become a chore to locate an app you need

37
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.720
when there's just too many pin APS,

38
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.390
this roll through and other clips will look a TTE.

39
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.040
Other tools you can use to keep your start menu organized Now.

40
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.340
It's also good to know that applications can be unplanned

41
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760
because Windows 10 includes many pre penned APS.

42
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.230
It's worth taking the time to clean up your start menu to make it

43
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.010
truly your own right click on the tile for an application you do

44
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.270
not want to see in your start menu.

45
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.140
The first option you'll see is toe un pin from start.

46
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.340
It's that easy.

47
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.910
Unfortunately,

48
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.440
there's not a way to quickly select multiple APS

49
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.360
and then UNP in them all months.

50
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.740
Maybe we'll see that ability in the future.

51
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:29.000
In this clip, we looked at pinning maps to the start menu. Thanks for watching had looked forward to see new in the next clip.
