00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.040
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at the notifications area in Windows 10.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.720
The notification area refers to the region located to the

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.360
extreme right end of our task for when we have a display

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.980
at the bottom of our display.

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.540
Depending on your device and the software you've installed,

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.510
you'll see important icons here that will indicate

7
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.960
status and present useful information, such as the date and time,

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.140
as well as battery and network status.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.220
The notifications area includes both my guns that are

10
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.250
visible as well as some that are hidden Now.

11
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.420
Hit icons are generally only visible wings.

12
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.340
Select this small show hidden icons tool.

13
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.040
You'll see some system icons that could be related to anti virus protection

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.750
USB usage as well as notification icons for other soft.

15
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.750
But that you may have installed over time.

16
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.090
Understand makes good use of the small space down here.

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.570
While hidden icons are kept out of you mainly to minimize clutter,

18
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.960
they can become visible at times when they you have

19
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.040
useful or relevant information for you,

20
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.730
such as a matter that needs your attention,

21
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.040
perhaps related to a virus or malware incident.

22
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.990
Also, it's good to understand that the icon juicy will reflect your hardware.

23
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.620
For example, a desktop computer will not display,

24
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.900
and battery indicator by default in a laptop may have

25
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.940
a Nikon freezing the touch pad.

26
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.420
You can use the icons of the notification to quickly see important information.

27
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.640
Take some actions or to open the related settings or application.

28
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.060
For example.

29
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.790
The network I can hear lets me see that I have a connection

30
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.030
to a network using an Ethernet cable.

31
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.140
A WiFi connection would appear slightly different.

32
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.480
Also, there's no badges here on the icon that would indicate problems.

33
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.020
An exclamation point or read acts, for example, and hovering over.

34
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.240
The icon confirms that I have a connection with Internet access.

35
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.060
Right click in the icon gives me a context menu,

36
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.260
and most icons here will have some type of context menu with

37
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.960
options for that particular application or system.

38
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.450
In this case, the network I kind gives me options to troubleshoot problems,

39
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.810
or I can launch the networking Internet settings,

40
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.070
which is actually part of the settings out.

41
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.870
The notification area also includes the action center,

42
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.970
and we're gonna look at the action center in more detail.

43
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.130
Another clips well, the specific icons that you will see in your notification.

44
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.120
Air will vary from one device to another.

45
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.260
You can also manage the icons that appear here and even remove

46
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.820
icons that you don't want to see in another clip.

47
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.450
We're gonna look closer at the options you have related to

48
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.320
your notification area and how you can manage the contents

49
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.240
of this notification area.

50
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:31.000
This clip we've looked at using the notification eri you for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
