00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,310
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at working

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,030
with life tiles in the start menu.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,920
There's no doubt about it,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,380
one of the features that really grabs your attention when you first see a

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,720
Windows 10 device are the tiles on your Start menu.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,500
Many of the tiles that make up your start menu are actually live tiles.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,680
That's a really good name for him.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,120
You can see they're always in movement.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,640
There's information being presented images.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,250
Live tiles are really designed to give you information from within the app,

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,480
so you can take that away at a simple glance.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,620
As you can see here, information from calendar,

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,190
e mails, photos,

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,520
news and many other sources is being presented and updated constantly.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,900
No, not every tile that appears in your start menu is alive tile.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,500
The lifestyle feature really is associated with APS

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,600
that come from the Windows Store, their modern APS And really,

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,540
it's a feature that the developer has to enable in order for

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,390
the tile to present information from that.

20
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,920
At other factors that will determine if your live tiles are presenting,

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,320
information may be related to the size of the tile APS that have never

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,940
been opened may not present lifestyle information,

23
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,710
and occasionally I'll notice APS that I've not used in a while

24
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,050
that stop presenting live tiled information.

25
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,620
So there's a few different things you can do to make

26
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,580
lifestyles really work for you.

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,740
One of these has to do with actually managing that functionality from the tile.

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,450
When you right click a tile in your start menu,

29
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,030
you'll see there's a few different things that appear in the context menu.

30
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,780
Generally, when you select more,

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,520
you'll see the option to turn live tiles off or on now,

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,310
very default.

33
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,160
When APS are pinned to the start menu,

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,610
live tiles are enabled if that features available so it could be that you find

35
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,690
this to be a little distracting in the case of some maps.

36
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,750
So to disable this,

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,560
you would actually just select turn lifestyle off knows I mentioned previously.

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,180
Not all tiles are live tiles,

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,170
so if an application was installed by means of a

40
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,600
download or from an installation disk, you can still right click it.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,790
You'll still see them or option here in your contacts menu.

42
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,130
But you won't see the ability to turn on or off lifestyle functionality

43
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,330
because it was really never part of that applications abilities.

44
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,510
Now some applications have special features that work with

45
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,440
live tiles from within the APP itself.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,210
A good example of this is the photos out here If I open the photos

47
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,640
up and then select settings noticing my settings.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,810
I have a tile setting.

49
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,090
So even though I can enable or disabled the lifestyle

50
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,390
functionality from the tile itself in the start menu here,

51
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
I can fine tune a little bit.

52
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,430
What appears on the lifestyle notice gives me a choice of using recent

53
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,920
photos or having one fixed single photo for my lifestyle.

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,550
So presently,

55
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,760
there's really not too many gaps that have the ability to

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,920
control or manage what appears in the live tile.

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,510
But it could be that with time we'll see more APS that leverage this

58
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,240
powerful ability of using live tiles within the start menu.

59
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,390
I mentioned previously that the size of the tile has an

60
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,040
effect on live tiled performance as well.

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,740
Basically, the bigger the tile is, the more information that could be presented.

62
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,570
If you go with a small tile, you can't really expect there to be any live tile.

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,920
Information is presented so medium wide and large certainly

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,230
function perfectly well for most applications.

65
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,400
Well,

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,870
some other things to consider when you work with

67
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,130
lifestyles is in some situations.

68
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,140
You may be concerned about data consumption.

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,400
Now, in the case of lifestyles,

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,830
it's a very small amount of data that's being consumed.

71
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,930
But that can add up,

72
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,660
especially if you have a big start menu with lots of different maps

73
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,480
that are constantly pulling information down from the Internet to

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,340
provide updated live tile information.

75
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,000
So it could be that you want to disable life tiles for

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,660
many of your APS in a case like this,

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,270
or even all of them if you're really concerned about

78
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,400
data consumption in this clip,

79
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:50,000
we've looked at working with live tiles on the start menu. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
