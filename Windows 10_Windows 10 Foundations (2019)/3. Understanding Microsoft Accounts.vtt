00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.420
[Autogenerated] and this clip will look at understanding Microsoft accounts.

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.200
Using a Microsoft account may well be a new concept to you.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.840
Microsoft accounts were first introduced to computer users with Windows eight.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.480
No Microsoft account is simply an email and a password.

5
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200
They've been set up with Microsoft.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.670
You may have created a Microsoft account when you

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.140
first logged into a Windows 10 device.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.910
Or you may have created a Microsoft account in the past using things

9
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.190
like Xbox or one Dr Traditionally and computers.

10
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.970
You would use a user name and password,

11
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.840
and these would be set up locally on that device so that user name and

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.620
password we're really only good for that particular device.

13
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.840
Now with the Windows 10 computer, you can still use a local account,

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.010
but there's a lot of advantages to using a Microsoft account.

15
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.940
First of all, with a local account.

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.850
If you ever lose your password or forget your password,

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.230
you're pretty much in trouble with the Microsoft account.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.880
If you ever forget your password,

19
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.630
there are built in mechanisms that help you recover for gotten password.

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.380
Another big advantage will find with the Microsoft account is

21
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.700
that it's not local to a single device.

22
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.300
You may have multiple devices use with your same Microsoft account,

23
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.460
and that brings up another important feature.

24
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.290
Synchronization between devices is part of using a Microsoft account so

25
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.090
you'll see things like your personalization settings,

26
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.150
your preferences, things maybe you've created on one device,

27
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.570
such as a music playlist, will appear on other devices as well.

28
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.030
Important service is such a CZ.

29
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.810
One drive,

30
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.510
which is a cloud based storage system that is

31
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.310
included with the Microsoft account, allows you to save pictures,

32
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.750
music and documents on one device to your one drive and

33
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.330
then retrieve them from another device.

34
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.780
When does that includes a personal assistant and search tool named Cortana,

35
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.220
which requires a Microsoft account toe work?

36
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.860
So does having a Microsoft account on your device require

37
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.410
you to always have an Internet connection?

38
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.350
No.

39
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.620
The first time you use your device and sign in,

40
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.510
you need to have an Internet connection to authenticate to verify the password.

41
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.210
But after that,

42
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.630
that password is cached locally in your device will remember the correct

43
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.050
password if you use your Microsoft account later and you don't have the

44
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.340
Internet connection to check the password.

45
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.750
Of course,

46
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.250
There are a lot of service is and synchronization that won't function

47
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.820
properly or at all without an Internet connection.

48
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.930
So here's the important question.

49
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.120
Should you be using a Microsoft account on your device?

50
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.490
Well, unless you have unusual circumstances were very specific needs.

51
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.140
I recommend you use a Microsoft account.

52
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.180
You may not appreciate all of the benefits and

53
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.390
enhancements that it brings to your device,

54
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.750
but as you get to know your Windows 10 device better,

55
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.040
you'll certainly appreciate the benefits of using that Microsoft account.

56
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.680
In this clip.

57
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:59.000
We've looked at understanding Microsoft accounts. Thanks for watching, and I look forward to seeing you in the next clip.
