San was first released in July of 2015 Microsoft.

6
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.410
A lot of people upgrade from Windows seven or Windows

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.490
regardless of the device they happen to be using,

11
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.920
with hundreds of millions of devices out there running Windows 10 it's

12
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.140
practical for us to get familiar with this operating system.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.340
But they were using at home or work or pulse.

14
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.480
Microsoft has established a rhythm of releasing large feature

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.040
updates about twice a year for Windows 10.

16
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.280
These feature updates are intended to introduce new

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.090
features and abilities to win US 10.

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.160
That same pattern will continue as Microsoft responds to user

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.140
feedback and addresses evolving hardware and use each scenarios

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.710

most people will either be running home or professional versions of Windows 10.

23
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.350

24
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.140
including enterprise education and I ot that use the same core features

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.680

26
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.240

27
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.150

versions where there are important differences.

30
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.040
