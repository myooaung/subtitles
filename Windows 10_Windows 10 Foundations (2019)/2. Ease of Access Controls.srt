00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,470
[Autogenerated] in this little look at the ease of

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,540
access controls included in Windows 10.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,440
Ease of access or accessibility Controls are nothing new to Windows,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,540
and you may have used them in the past.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,990
There is a wealth of tools here that are designed to help people

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,540
with disabilities interact with their computer.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,090
However,

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,100
just about anyone could make use of some of the tools that are located

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,180
in ease of access to enable ease of access tools,

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,900
open your settings out and then select ease of access navigation pane.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,290
Here,

12
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,380
there's a nice grouping of tools that help us to locate tools that

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,070
target vision hearing or interaction challenges.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,070
Now we're not gonna look at every tool here in detail,

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,820
but we're gonna look over many of them as we're going through these.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,520
Take note of ones that could help you or those you know under vision.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,870
We start with display,

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,540
and we can see or hear that the purpose of each tool is clearly labeled.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,240
Use the slider here, for example, to make text bigger on the screen.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,020
If we're happy with the sample text size,

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,740
we can apply that we'd also make everything a bit bigger from this drop down,

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,230
scrolling down we can hide or prevent some of the eye candy and Windows 10.

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,540
That could be distracting for some.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,500
Incidentally, if the graphics hardware in your devices being taxed,

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,040
this could actually help improve performance.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,980
There's a good sitting here to know about that changes how long

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,840
banner notifications will stay in the screen.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,390
Under cursor and pointer size,

29
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,430
we can manage things like the pointer size that we see when using a mouse.

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,710
The current selection is marked with a check mark,

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,500
and I have to say that I rather like the third option here to

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,890
swap the color of the pointer under magnifier,

33
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,660
we can enable the magnifier tool and control it using

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,990
keyboard shortcuts also scrolling down here.

35
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,480
There's several options related to how that magnifier starts and

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,360
whether it would be a full screen experience.

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,350
We're just an area that can follow your cursor under color filters.

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,580
There's some settings now for color blindness.

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,140
In addition to inverted in gray scale choices,

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,550
we also have a few high contrast themes.

41
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,330
You would select the switch to enable this,

42
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,840
and immediately you would see high contrast themes applied.

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,090
You can choose from themes in this dropdown list to pick

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,540
the one that best fits your needs.

45
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,850
The last tool under vision is the updated narrator tool now enabling

46
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,720
this school will read any tax that appears on the screen where your

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,690
mouse pointer happens to be located, such as men use in Web content.

48
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,580
You can choose from different voices.

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,010
You can tweak the speed pitch and volume major scroll down here.

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,400
You can see there's many more sightings than in the past that can allow

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,540
you to manage just how the narrator tool he used.

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,700
Our next category is hearing challenges.

53
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,460
And under audio,

54
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,950
we have a visual other tool that helps us to see

55
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,740
win and where audio is generated.

56
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,890
Closed captions is a relatively new set of tools that lets us manage the

57
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,370
appearance of closed captions where they could be used by Windows.

58
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,430
Changes to the font,

59
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,280
color and transparency are all settings you can manage from here.

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
Under interaction,

61
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,940
we see tools that help us to use voice commands throughout windows.

62
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,860
Many of these air links it's actually see everything all in one place.

63
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,520
Now, Windows 10 includes a new dictation tool,

64
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,090
and we'll look at that tool in more detail.

65
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,700
In a separate clip here,

66
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,830
we also see length related to Cortina and speech recognition under keyboard.

67
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,820
We have some switches here related to the onscreen keyboard.

68
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,370
Now this is different from the touch keyboard that pops

69
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,840
up when needed on touchscreen devices.

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,150
And if you find yourself accidentally hitting your caps lock button quite often.

71
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,050
This switch here,

72
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,110
let's windows generate and beat when cap lock and other of

73
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,740
these locked _______ are enabled or disabled.

74
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,140
Mouse has a switch to use the new Mary keyboard to control your mouse cursor,

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,690
and lastly, a newer area here is divided to buy control.

76
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,670
Of course, we need to have an eye tracking device connected to our computer,

77
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,180
but it's nice to see Windows 10 including new tools and expanding others to

78
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,280
better accommodate the need of many users as possible.

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,710
In this clip,

80
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,960
we've considered some of the ease of access tools

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:58,000
that are included in Windows 10. Thank you for watching Hack for to see New in the next clip
