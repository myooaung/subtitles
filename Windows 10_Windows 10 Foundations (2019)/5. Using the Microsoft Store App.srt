1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,840
[Autogenerated] in this clip will look at using the Microsoft store out.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,570
The Microsoft store APP was first introduced with

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,340
Windows eight as the Windows Store app,

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,830
and it's been updated and greatly improved since then.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,990
In addition of finding new APS and Games free device,

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,360
you can also purchase or rent movies and TV shows.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,540
And in some markets you can actually shop for devices and purchase E books.

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,460
When you first open the Microsoft Store APP, you begin at the hometown.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,560
From here, you'll see sales,

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
promotions or featured content found throughout

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,800
different areas of the APP scrolling down.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,240
I can see some daily deals, but a few top lists and new contact.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,700
As you can see, the home tab has a little bit of everything.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,830
We're looking for something specific.

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,140
Use the tabs to jump between available product areas and types.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,540
Example.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,560
Let's jump over to the AP stem Now.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,710
Here again, I can see sales and featured content and scrolling down.

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,340
I'm seeing top lists and categories within APS.

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,220
If I scroll all the way down, I'll eventually get two categories,

21
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,490
and this could be a practical way to filter content.

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,330
As you browse through content, you can see prices are indicated.

23
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,140
You can tell there's many reviews and you give me an idea for

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,400
how favourable those reviews have been.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,690
To get more specific details will select a nap now.

26
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,890
In some cases, the video might be displayed automatically,

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,750
such as a movie, trailer or otherwise.

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,180
You'll see artwork or an image purchase.

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,690
Options are primarily displayed, as well as a brief description of the product,

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,340
and you can see rating information will be displayed here as well.

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,300
Scrolling down just a little bit.

32
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,090
You'll see important.

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,840
Tam's or review gives you a full description of the product,

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,740
and you could notice that some maps may have availability for

35
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,640
specific hardware form factors that run Windows 10.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,310
It's rolling down.

37
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,630
Pay attention to the approximate size down here.

38
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,070
This could be important when you're considering some maps

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,180
and games when you're looking at movies,

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,260
you'll also see size information indicated down here gives you

41
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,690
an idea how much space would be required if you decided to

42
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,040
download the movie to your toys.

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,600
Now, when you're looking at an APP, you can see screenshots.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,860
Similar APS are usually presented a list of features.

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,210
You'll see information from the developer.

46
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,670
Usually it will also give you links to their website.

47
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,880
So if you need support for an issue for that application,

48
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,040
this would probably be the best place to start.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,920
Notice that there's also a list of permissions for that app

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,290
listed under this app can know Absecon.

51
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,380
Very some will require access to your Internet connection location,

52
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,860
settings, webcam, a microphone or your contacts.

53
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,340
Depending on the APB and its purpose jumping to the System Requirements tab,

54
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,340
you can see the recommended and minimum requirements.

55
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,920
Some maps, especially gaming APS,

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,800
could be pretty advanced and demanding they could actually exceed

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,590
your devices abilities to render and play properly.

58
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,160
If that's the case,

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,900
generally you'll see an alert here that will let you know if this

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,640
particular app could be an issue on your particular device.

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,690
That's usually a good idea to look at the reviews,

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,060
and the review tab will show you whatever reviews

63
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,850
might be available for the out again.

64
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,940
Some of them may have more than others.

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,420
Reviews from other users may also reveal issues regarding

66
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,840
hidden costs or general support for the out.

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,190
Finally,

68
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,270
the related tab will show you more content that

69
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,530
similar perhaps from the same developer.

70
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,140
Or that's targeting the same type of user.

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,300
When you're looking at a product,

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,500
you can use the back arrow up here to return to where you are previously,

73
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,110
or use the tabs a top to return to any of the upper level areas within.

74
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,590
The Microsoft store knows I mentioned earlier, and some market.

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,950
You may see different tabs up here, so in the US you'll see devices,

76
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,460
and this allows you actually shop for hardware that sold through

77
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,240
the Microsoft store and on the Microsoft website.

78
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,990
The books have also is not shown in all markets as yet,

79
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,990
but from here you could shop for e books that can be

80
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,440
downloaded and red using your Edge Web browser.

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,500
Yet another town that you can see here is the edge extensions Tam.

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,630
Now this tab features plug ins or extensions for the Edge

83
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,040
Web browser that comes with Windows 10.

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,240
As with APS and movies, you can browse through extensions and look at reviews.

85
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,750
You can purchase an extension, which can then be downloaded,

86
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,940
and you'll find it available within the edge Web browser,

87
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,210
now off to the right of our tabs in the Microsoft store up.

88
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,590
We have the search tool.

89
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,460
You can use this to search for keywords,

90
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,060
and you'll see the content from anywhere within the Microsoft store app that

91
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,670
matches typing cruise and you can see there's a lot of results,

92
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,340
and it split up for us into corresponding areas within the hour.

93
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,140
While Microsoft account is not required to obtain freedom through the store,

94
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,310
you will be encouraged to sign into the APP want resigned in.

95
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,630
You could manage many things that are linked to your Microsoft account,

96
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,240
including purchases and payment options,

97
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,760
and also from this more list, you can also manage,

98
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,340
absent or install the new device, including updates.

99
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,090
Now we're gonna look in more detail at making purchases and many engineer

100
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,070
installs from the Microsoft store app in another clip.

101
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:47,000
In this clip, we've looked at using the Microsoft store out. Thanks for watching had looked forward to seeing you in the next clip
