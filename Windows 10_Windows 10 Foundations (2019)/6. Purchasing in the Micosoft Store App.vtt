00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.730
[Autogenerated] and this little look at making

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.440
purchases in the Microsoft store out.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.720
In a previous clip, we looked at the Microsoft store APP,

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.440
and we saw how to look for APS, games and video content.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.220
Once we've found something we would like to add to our device

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.090
or a movie or TV show we'd like to watch.

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.920
We need to purchase that item even when the apus free

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.980
there is a purchase transaction involved.

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.820
Generally for free.

10
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.980
APS and games will not be required to have a Microsoft account,

11
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.330
However, when an actual purchase is required,

12
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.840
then you'll need to have a Microsoft account to pay for the purchase.

13
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.530
In this case,

14
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.040
I'm signed into my device with the Microsoft account

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.800
because purchases are linked to your account.

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.150
It's good to understand your options when just and allows us to

17
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.950
sign into individual APS with a Microsoft account.

18
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.980
Even if he can't used in.

19
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.840
That app is different from a Microsoft account used in Windows.

20
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.390
First of I select my count up here, I can see sino now.

21
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.260
Once I'm signed out,

22
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.340
I could sign and again with a different account if I needed to,

23
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.070
so this could give you some flexibility when making purchases

24
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.990
on a particular device over here reckons,

25
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.690
like more, and you can see several links here related to my account.

26
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.500
My library would display upside on, even if they're not installed in this device.

27
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.770
If I need to change devices,

28
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.140
this is a quick way to install laps to get things set up.

29
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.850
I can also use the payment options and purchase links to launch

30
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.140
a Web browser to look at these areas online.

31
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.040
There are a couple of important sayings in settings to be aware of.

32
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.490
You're the first ones related to AP updates.

33
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.160
Nobody fault.

34
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.440
APS will update automatically.

35
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.240
This is a good setting and leave enabled,

36
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.700
although if you have special needs,

37
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.540
you can disable this and you can still manually update

38
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.140
specific APS when updates are available.

39
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.970
If you're concerned about APP updates consuming data,

40
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.340
there is actually a better way to prevent that by using a metered connection.

41
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.940
And we'll look at meter connections in a separate clip.

42
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.820
Scrolling down.

43
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.540
There's a setting labeled purchase Sinan.

44
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.920
This is off by default,

45
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.700
and generally I recommend that this stay off when you purchase a napper,

46
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.340
a movie you're asked to authenticate with a password

47
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340
or another valid Sinan method.

48
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.730
But if you enable this feature,

49
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.240
you won't see that prompt to authorize the actual purchase.

50
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.000
Now this could open the door to potential problems if you have the

51
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.240
young ones at home or lose control of your device.

52
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.630
Leaving this off well, of course,

53
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.070
prompt you for that authorization each time of purchases made finally down here,

54
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.140
there's a setting related to our account.

55
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.160
It's labeled manager devices.

56
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.370
This is another link, and it takes you to your online Microsoft account,

57
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.660
where you can manage the devices that are linked to your Microsoft account.

58
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.170
Windows itself and most Microsoft store APS have limits regarding

59
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.770
remain devices you can use under that account.

60
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.440
So if you get a warning that you have too many devices,

61
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.830
this is one way to quickly jump to that list of devices.

62
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.420
You have to make some changes.

63
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.780
With that.

64
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.570
Out of the way, let's look at the actual steps involved when making a purchase.

65
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.760
In this case, I'm gonna purchase an app that I have in mind,

66
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.880
so I'm gonna search for it by name.

67
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.840
After selecting it,

68
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.100
I can again check things like compatibility space requirements,

69
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.340
et cetera.

70
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.040
In this case, I'm also warned that this app as specific hardware requirements,

71
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.530
I'm actually purchasing the app on this device.

72
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.840
But I'll install the app on a different device that meets those requirements.

73
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.540
Also liked by just aren't the purchase.

74
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.670
As we mentioned, I'm asked to re enter my password in this case.

75
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.640
So I'm gonna do that and I'll select next.

76
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.080
Here I see a summary of the purchase and my available

77
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.140
purchase methods are indicated.

78
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.970
Now, As you can see here, I actually have some funds in my Microsoft Co.

79
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.090
When I can use toward the purchase.

80
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.800
If you have a family, you can also add funds to Microsoft,

81
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.480
a counselor, part of your family.

82
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.090
This could be a good way to manage purchases for Children.

83
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.180
In the case of this purchase,

84
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.200
I can see the balance will be charged to a credit card

85
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.540
that's already linked to my account.

86
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.040
Now here, I can select change on any of these to modify things.

87
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.430
I can select alternative methods that can redeem gift cards,

88
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.370
or I can actually add new payment methods.

89
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.140
It was like back and then it's like, Bye,

90
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.240
Lindsay, My purchase goes through in the APP can now be installed in my device.

91
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.460
An email would also be triggered and sent to my Microsoft account with

92
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.260
details of the purchase doesn't mentioned earlier in this case.

93
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.240
I really don't want this app installed on this particular device.

94
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.310
You can see the APP is cute for download and install making.

95
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.900
Simply select the XO here.

96
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.740
Halt that process.

97
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.750
Now if I select all owned,

98
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.290
I can see this APP is listed with the option to install.

99
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.300
It wasn't on my other devices going to my library and then all owned and

100
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.480
again I can select installed here to actually get it installed in that

101
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.940
device without having to complete a new purchase.

102
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.390
In this clip,

103
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.700
we've looked at making purchases in the Microsoft store

104
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:46.000
out you for watching how the word is. He knew in the next clip
