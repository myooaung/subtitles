1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,080
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07,080  -->  00:00:09,030
R programming and today we're finally at

3

00:00:09,030  -->  00:00:10,559
the top. We're at the top of the food

4

00:00:10,559  -->  00:00:11,309
chain.

5

00:00:11,309  -->  00:00:14,009
We're talking about the theme, layering of

6

00:00:14,009  -->  00:00:16,740
R visualizations and so what does that

7

00:00:16,740  -->  00:00:19,050
involve? Well it involves all the non

8

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:21,750
data ink on our chart, so basically

9

00:00:21,750  -->  00:00:23,250
when you change the formatting of the

10

00:00:23,250  -->  00:00:26,519
text or make given colors or you change

11

00:00:26,519  -->  00:00:28,980
where the label is positioned. The legend

12

00:00:28,980  -->  00:00:30,359
is positioned and things like that. So

13

00:00:30,359  -->  00:00:34,110
let's see how we can apply all that. Now

14

00:00:34,110  -->  00:00:36,570
well that's that came unexpected that's

15

00:00:36,570  -->  00:00:38,010
the beautiful chart that we created

16

00:00:38,010  -->  00:00:42,059
last time and now we're going to recall

17

00:00:42,059  -->  00:00:43,829
one of the charts that we created

18

00:00:43,829  -->  00:00:45,930
previously and we're going to improve it

19

00:00:45,930  -->  00:00:48,090
by adding a theme to it. Now ideally

20

00:00:48,090  -->  00:00:50,100
you'd want to add a theme to all the

21

00:00:50,100  -->  00:00:51,840
charts that we created and make them all

22

00:00:51,840  -->  00:00:54,360
look stunning for the presentation but

23

00:00:54,360  -->  00:00:57,239
we won't spend all the time doing this

24

00:00:57,239  -->  00:00:58,920
it will take a couple of tutorials to go

25

00:00:58,920  -->  00:01:00,180
through all them so we're just going to

26

00:01:00,180  -->  00:01:02,820
practice on one and then in your free

27

00:01:02,820  -->  00:01:04,260
time you can go back to the transfer

28

00:01:04,260  -->  00:01:06,450
created and and do the same operations

29

00:01:06,450  -->  00:01:09,000
because ultimately is just working with

30

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:12,420
the same types of elements on charts. You

31

00:01:12,420  -->  00:01:15,900
can simply replicate the same procedures.

32

00:01:15,900  -->  00:01:19,439
Ok so the letter today is 0 and we're

33

00:01:19,439  -->  00:01:22,170
going to create the histogram so let's

34

00:01:22,170  -->  00:01:25,530
first find it improve right, let's look

35

00:01:25,530  -->  00:01:28,950
for the word improve and this one that's

36

00:01:28,950  -->  00:01:31,259
the one I'm talking about. So let's copy

37

00:01:31,259  -->  00:01:35,070
this line and put it in here and there

38

00:01:35,070  -->  00:01:37,860
was it? This one that's what I'm after.

39

00:01:37,860  -->  00:01:41,729
So let's copy this into todays

40

00:01:41,729  -->  00:01:43,829
tutorial you can close the search.

41

00:01:43,829  -->  00:01:46,380
Ok that's our letter O and now we want

42

00:01:46,380  -->  00:01:49,680
to say O plus. Ok I've already copied the

43

00:01:49,680  -->  00:01:52,680
plus, so what is this we're creating a ggplot

44

00:01:52,680  -->  00:01:55,110
with data equals movies aesthetic is

45

00:01:55,110  -->  00:01:57,360
the budget millions and then we're

46

00:01:57,360  -->  00:01:59,729
plotting it as histogram so we're

47

00:01:59,729  -->  00:02:03,420
mapping the fill to genre and we're

48

00:02:03,420  -->  00:02:05,640
setting the color to black. So we are

49

00:02:05,640  -->  00:02:08,160
well familiar with this histogram, it's our

50

00:02:08,160  -->  00:02:10,170
favorite histogram we used it so far

51

00:02:10,170  -->  00:02:12,420
many times. Alright and so now what  we're

52

00:02:12,420  -->  00:02:13,590
going to do is we're going to

53

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:15,030
learn how to add a couple of things. So

54

00:02:15,030  -->  00:02:17,340
first we're going to add a label right?

55

00:02:17,340  -->  00:02:19,709
That's what we want to learn how to add

56

00:02:19,709  -->  00:02:23,430
and label basically means the access

57

00:02:23,430  -->  00:02:25,260
label, I meant now let's type that an

58

00:02:25,260  -->  00:02:29,160
axis, axis labels so what we're

59

00:02:29,160  -->  00:02:30,480
going to do in fact what we're going to

60

00:02:30,480  -->  00:02:32,400
do is we're going to change put this

61

00:02:32,400  -->  00:02:35,160
into an object so that it's faster and

62

00:02:35,160  -->  00:02:37,920
let's give it a name let say H, we run that

63

00:02:37,920  -->  00:02:40,650
and now if I run just H on its own

64

00:02:40,650  -->  00:02:42,660
you'll see that the whole histogram is in

65

00:02:42,660  -->  00:02:44,610
there because it includes both the base

66

00:02:44,610  -->  00:02:46,980
layer and this additional layer and we

67

00:02:46,980  -->  00:02:48,870
just saved this new combination of the

68

00:02:48,870  -->  00:02:52,200
two inside H right and what we're going

69

00:02:52,200  -->  00:02:56,549
to do now is on top of H we're going to

70

00:02:56,549  -->  00:03:01,200
add a couple of things. So that it is so

71

00:03:01,200  -->  00:03:03,989
we achieve those non data ink

72

00:03:03,989  -->  00:03:07,560
transformations so let's say H plus and

73

00:03:07,560  -->  00:03:10,500
will say xlab, whoops... and we actually

74

00:03:10,500  -->  00:03:12,959
talked about ylab. So this should be

75

00:03:12,959  -->  00:03:17,760
a bit familiar money axis right and if

76

00:03:17,760  -->  00:03:20,100
we run that,  you'll see that at the

77

00:03:20,100  -->  00:03:21,630
bottom is very small so if we zoom in

78

00:03:21,630  -->  00:03:25,049
over here it says money axis and we change

79

00:03:25,049  -->  00:03:27,359
the name and we can do the same thing we

80

00:03:27,359  -->  00:03:31,980
can do plus y lab and we can say number

81

00:03:31,980  -->  00:03:36,599
of movies so let's maybe put like that

82

00:03:36,599  -->  00:03:37,920
its looks better.

83

00:03:37,920  -->  00:03:40,380
So there we go so we have relabeled both

84

00:03:40,380  -->  00:03:42,569
of the axis, that's great. Now let's

85

00:03:42,569  -->  00:03:44,549
format them so there they look better

86

00:03:44,549  -->  00:03:47,250
label formatting and we're going to say

87

00:03:47,250  -->  00:03:50,519
pretty much the same thing and here

88

00:03:50,519  -->  00:03:53,280
we're going to say plus so this might

89

00:03:53,280  -->  00:03:55,950
look a bit complicated but sometimes

90

00:03:55,950  -->  00:03:58,859
it's just best to remember it so theme

91

00:03:58,859  -->  00:04:04,919
axis dot title dot x equals. So the title

92

00:04:04,919  -->  00:04:08,519
of axis x equals element this is the

93

00:04:08,519  -->  00:04:10,169
part that you have to remember element

94

00:04:10,169  -->  00:04:12,870
text and here's going to be color equals

95

00:04:12,870  -->  00:04:17,070
we're going to say just dark green. So

96

00:04:17,070  -->  00:04:18,269
we're not mapping to anything we're just

97

00:04:18,269  -->  00:04:20,340
setting it because it's just the color

98

00:04:20,340  -->  00:04:22,979
of the text right so color of the text

99

00:04:22,979  -->  00:04:25,260
is dark green and the size is going to be 30,

100

00:04:25,260  -->  00:04:28,710
and then I want to say comma and then I

101

00:04:28,710  -->  00:04:30,240
want to say access and just basically

102

00:04:30,240  -->  00:04:33,870
all the 304 practice axis title dot y

103

00:04:33,870  -->  00:04:39,030
equals element underscore text and here

104

00:04:39,030  -->  00:04:42,930
you wanna say color equals red and

105

00:04:42,930  -->  00:04:45,990
size same thing equals 30. So if I run

106

00:04:45,990  -->  00:04:48,630
this, you'll see that now they're nice

107

00:04:48,630  -->  00:04:51,990
and big size 30 money axis and number of

108

00:04:51,990  -->  00:04:54,330
movies beautiful. Ok that's a great start

109

00:04:54,330  -->  00:04:57,750
and that's what we mean by non a data

110

00:04:57,750  -->  00:05:00,390
ink and now we're going to do is we're

111

00:05:00,390  -->  00:05:02,010
going to make these tick marks bigger

112

00:05:02,010  -->  00:05:03,660
because they're pretty small right? So

113

00:05:03,660  -->  00:05:06,330
let's go ahead and make them bigger. So

114

00:05:06,330  -->  00:05:08,550
I'm going to take this all of this copy

115

00:05:08,550  -->  00:05:12,390
it and I'll say tick mark formatting and

116

00:05:12,390  -->  00:05:14,760
so basically just inside theme. This is

117

00:05:14,760  -->  00:05:16,200
the main function we can be working with

118

00:05:16,200  -->  00:05:18,330
and we'll check it out just in just a

119

00:05:18,330  -->  00:05:23,520
second so here we'll say axis dot text dot x

120

00:05:23,520  -->  00:05:26,760
equals, let's get to the tickpoints, tick

121

00:05:26,760  -->  00:05:30,150
marks, text element text and then size

122

00:05:30,150  -->  00:05:33,660
equals 20 and this one I'm not going to

123

00:05:33,660  -->  00:05:37,530
retype. This is going to be y. So lets

124

00:05:37,530  -->  00:05:38,820
run this,

125

00:05:38,820  -->  00:05:41,220
so there you go so they're much bigger now

126

00:05:41,220  -->  00:05:44,460
better looking and much more legible.

127

00:05:44,460  -->  00:05:47,160
Alright that's a great thing. So you're

128

00:05:47,160  -->  00:05:48,810
probably getting curious about this

129

00:05:48,810  -->  00:05:50,940
theme function that we're using what

130

00:05:50,940  -->  00:05:53,340
else can you supply to this function

131

00:05:53,340  -->  00:05:54,990
right? So let's check it out.

132

00:05:54,990  -->  00:05:59,580
Alright let's zoom in into here and what

133

00:05:59,580  -->  00:06:01,290
you'll see here theme elements we've got

134

00:06:01,290  -->  00:06:04,350
line, rectangle, text, title, aspect ratio,

135

00:06:04,350  -->  00:06:07,500
axis title, axis text, ticks line,

136

00:06:07,500  -->  00:06:09,750
background a lot a lot a lot of stuff so

137

00:06:09,750  -->  00:06:12,540
all of these are how you can control the

138

00:06:12,540  -->  00:06:14,340
presentation of your chart and I highly

139

00:06:14,340  -->  00:06:16,080
recommend you just look through them and

140

00:06:16,080  -->  00:06:18,150
whatever you want to do something just

141

00:06:18,150  -->  00:06:20,580
check the theme function and see what

142

00:06:20,580  -->  00:06:22,530
try to guess what it would be and it'll

143

00:06:22,530  -->  00:06:24,720
probably be there or you can always

144

00:06:24,720  -->  00:06:27,150
check online and look for the help and

145

00:06:27,150  -->  00:06:29,730
it will help you understand which

146

00:06:29,730  -->  00:06:31,380
elements of the theme function you need

147

00:06:31,380  -->  00:06:33,960
to tweak to get the chart that you are

148

00:06:33,960  -->  00:06:35,880
after. So so far we've learned quite a

149

00:06:35,880  -->  00:06:38,150
few and let's

150

00:06:38,150  -->  00:06:41,300
learn a another few that we will need

151

00:06:41,300  -->  00:06:43,400
for this plot so what we want is we

152

00:06:43,400  -->  00:06:45,770
want to now control this legend

153

00:06:45,770  -->  00:06:49,130
alright so let's do that, let's say legend

154

00:06:49,130  -->  00:06:54,500
formatting, legend formatting alright. So

155

00:06:54,500  -->  00:06:56,480
what we're going to do is we're going to

156

00:06:56,480  -->  00:06:59,300
say comma and here I'm just gonna add an extra

157

00:06:59,300  -->  00:07:01,370
space so just that we have some space

158

00:07:01,370  -->  00:07:04,250
not necessarily don't have to add it.

159

00:07:04,250  -->  00:07:06,740
Element, so legend title element

160

00:07:06,740  -->  00:07:10,100
underscore text and here we're going to

161

00:07:10,100  -->  00:07:16,550
say size equals 30 and legend dot text as

162

00:07:16,550  -->  00:07:20,150
you can imagine that's the actual names

163

00:07:20,150  -->  00:07:22,760
of the categories element underscored

164

00:07:22,760  -->  00:07:26,300
text size equals 20 and let's not, let

165

00:07:26,300  -->  00:07:31,280
end there that for now. Let's run that. Ok you

166

00:07:31,280  -->  00:07:33,020
can see it's much bigger and now I'm

167

00:07:33,020  -->  00:07:34,370
going to show you another thing so if

168

00:07:34,370  -->  00:07:38,270
you put in this how to control the

169

00:07:38,270  -->  00:07:40,400
positioning of the legend.

170

00:07:40,400  -->  00:07:42,620
So what we need to do is first we want

171

00:07:42,620  -->  00:07:44,840
to say a legend position, legend dot

172

00:07:44,840  -->  00:07:47,120
position so I want to put it in the top

173

00:07:47,120  -->  00:07:49,310
corner over here on the chart on

174

00:07:49,310  -->  00:07:51,740
actual chart, legend position and that

175

00:07:51,740  -->  00:07:55,670
way I want to say c11. So you can pass 0 or

176

00:07:55,670  -->  00:07:57,320
1 and once again you can find all this

177

00:07:57,320  -->  00:08:00,530
information in the help of theme. So 0 is

178

00:08:00,530  -->  00:08:03,710
left, so 0 is the start of the

179

00:08:03,710  -->  00:08:06,230
action so basically this is 0,0 this is

180

00:08:06,230  -->  00:08:09,980
1,0 this is 0,1. This corner and this corner

181

00:08:09,980  -->  00:08:11,930
is 1,1. So I wanted in the top right

182

00:08:11,930  -->  00:08:12,620
corner.

183

00:08:12,620  -->  00:08:15,800
I just run this you will see that it

184

00:08:15,800  -->  00:08:17,990
gets put in the top corner but it gets

185

00:08:17,990  -->  00:08:20,420
put their kind of like crooked that's

186

00:08:20,420  -->  00:08:22,040
because I need to set an anchoring point

187

00:08:22,040  -->  00:08:25,250
you need to say legend dot justification

188

00:08:25,250  -->  00:08:30,260
equals c11 so which corner of the

189

00:08:30,260  -->  00:08:32,360
legend once again bottom left, bottom

190

00:08:32,360  -->  00:08:34,640
right, top left or top right you want to

191

00:08:34,640  -->  00:08:36,950
put in that in this corner. I want to put

192

00:08:36,950  -->  00:08:38,900
the top right corner of the legend in

193

00:08:38,900  -->  00:08:41,780
the top right corner of the chart so if I run

194

00:08:41,780  -->  00:08:42,860
this now,

195

00:08:42,860  -->  00:08:46,640
beautiful! right? So now the legend is

196

00:08:46,640  -->  00:08:48,260
actually where it's possible it's on the

197

00:08:48,260  -->  00:08:50,000
chart in the top right corner and we

198

00:08:50,000  -->  00:08:51,329
saved all of that

199

00:08:51,329  -->  00:08:53,399
white space on the right. Ok one more

200

00:08:53,399  -->  00:08:56,670
thing left and that is of course the

201

00:08:56,670  -->  00:09:00,269
title of the plot. How do we add a title

202

00:09:00,269  -->  00:09:01,350
to the plot?

203

00:09:01,350  -->  00:09:04,170
You need to add a layer which is called

204

00:09:04,170  -->  00:09:08,189
GGtitle and in the in here you type in

205

00:09:08,189  -->  00:09:10,649
the title we plot which is a movie for us

206

00:09:10,649  -->  00:09:15,329
is movie budget distribution and then

207

00:09:15,329  -->  00:09:19,439
you and that plus back so if I run this. You

208

00:09:19,439  -->  00:09:21,299
will see that the titles appeared but it's

209

00:09:21,299  -->  00:09:24,509
very small so how do we format the title

210

00:09:24,509  -->  00:09:25,439
itself?

211

00:09:25,439  -->  00:09:27,059
Well we go back into the theme function

212

00:09:27,059  -->  00:09:30,269
and here we just say plot dot title

213

00:09:30,269  -->  00:09:34,799
equals element underscore text color

214

00:09:34,799  -->  00:09:37,980
let's give it a color like dark blue

215

00:09:37,980  -->  00:09:41,189
then we'll say size, let's put this on

216

00:09:41,189  -->  00:09:45,929
a new line, size equals 40 and family

217

00:09:45,929  -->  00:09:47,399
this is the font. I just wanted to show

218

00:09:47,399  -->  00:09:49,980
you how you can change the actual font

219

00:09:49,980  -->  00:09:52,529
and here we'll say a carrier.

220

00:09:52,529  -->  00:09:57,149
Alright so if we run this now it's dark

221

00:09:57,149  -->  00:09:59,669
blue, it's big and it's a different font.

222

00:09:59,669  -->  00:10:02,639
Beautiful I think we've done a great job

223

00:10:02,639  -->  00:10:06,600
and I think now we can with a lot of

224

00:10:06,600  -->  00:10:10,139
pride take this and put it into the

225

00:10:10,139  -->  00:10:13,230
final report and let's put the

226

00:10:13,230  -->  00:10:16,290
resolution now let's go ahead and copy

227

00:10:16,290  -->  00:10:19,559
this or I'll just save it and we'll copy

228

00:10:19,559  -->  00:10:22,410
it into our final presentation over here

229

00:10:22,410  -->  00:10:25,649
and viola! Everything is beautifully,

230

00:10:25,649  -->  00:10:27,689
beautifully done. So we've got this final

231

00:10:27,689  -->  00:10:30,600
climb deliverable with all of these

232

00:10:30,600  -->  00:10:33,989
beautiful and visualizations in it and I

233

00:10:33,989  -->  00:10:36,089
think we've done a great job overall.

234

00:10:36,089  -->  00:10:37,619
So today we learned quite a few things

235

00:10:37,619  -->  00:10:39,839
most of them are relating to the theme

236

00:10:39,839  -->  00:10:42,989
function and we talked about how to add

237

00:10:42,989  -->  00:10:46,589
non-data ink to our charts so he'll play

238

00:10:46,589  -->  00:10:48,149
around with that check out all the other

239

00:10:48,149  -->  00:10:50,759
order some of the other options that are

240

00:10:50,759  -->  00:10:52,649
available to your theme and maybe see

241

00:10:52,649  -->  00:10:54,920
how else you can improve this chart

242

00:10:54,920  -->  00:10:57,380
and I look forward to next time until then,

243

00:10:57,380  -->  00:11:09,019
happy coding.
