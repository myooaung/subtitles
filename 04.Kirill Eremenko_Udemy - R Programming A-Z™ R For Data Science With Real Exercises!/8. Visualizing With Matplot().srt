00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,109
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:07,109  -->  00:00:09,809
R programming and today we're finally

3

00:00:09,809  -->  00:00:12,509
going to talk about visualization. We're

4

00:00:12,509  -->  00:00:15,030
going to create some charts and graphs

5

00:00:15,030  -->  00:00:16,920
and in particular we're talking about the

6

00:00:16,920  -->  00:00:19,380
matplot function, so let me tight type out

7

00:00:19,380  -->  00:00:22,199
the name of function here - matplot and

8

00:00:22,199  -->  00:00:25,320
let me give you a quick overview of this

9

00:00:25,320  -->  00:00:27,090
function. So we'll start by bringing up

10

00:00:27,090  -->  00:00:30,630
the help and here you'll see that this

11

00:00:30,630  -->  00:00:33,660
function is designed to plug columns of

12

00:00:33,660  -->  00:00:37,020
matrices now we bear in mind we won't be

13

00:00:37,020  -->  00:00:39,390
using this function a lot a lot we'll

14

00:00:39,390  -->  00:00:40,950
just use it in this section and then

15

00:00:40,950  -->  00:00:42,870
there'll be more powerful tools that we'll

16

00:00:42,870  -->  00:00:45,719
learn but for now this function will do.

17

00:00:45,719  -->  00:00:47,280
So what does it do?

18

00:00:47,280  -->  00:00:49,680
Matplot takes him quite a lot of

19

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:51,390
parameters so don't get scared,

20

00:00:51,390  -->  00:00:53,370
don't get put off by all these

21

00:00:53,370  -->  00:00:55,860
parameters. We will go through the ones

22

00:00:55,860  -->  00:00:57,600
that we need and I'll show you the

23

00:00:57,600  -->  00:01:01,079
values that we will need to input. So XY

24

00:01:01,079  -->  00:01:03,809
are vectors and matrices of data for

25

00:01:03,809  -->  00:01:06,180
plotting and the right number of rows

26

00:01:06,180  -->  00:01:09,240
should match, its if so I'm not going to read

27

00:01:09,240  -->  00:01:11,100
through all of this. Basically you supply

28

00:01:11,100  -->  00:01:12,900
some data for these parameters and

29

00:01:12,900  -->  00:01:16,020
then, type is what kind of plot you want.

30

00:01:16,020  -->  00:01:19,409
If you want a line, you want dots, you want

31

00:01:19,409  -->  00:01:22,200
characters and so on. So then we won't be

32

00:01:22,200  -->  00:01:24,450
using these parameters PCH is the

33

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:27,240
character string or vector, so what kind

34

00:01:27,240  -->  00:01:30,840
of if you're plotting points then what

35

00:01:30,840  -->  00:01:32,970
kind of images you want in those points?

36

00:01:32,970  -->  00:01:34,590
You want dots? do you want X's? do you want

37

00:01:34,590  -->  00:01:37,950
triangles? You want two squares then col

38

00:01:37,950  -->  00:01:40,920
is for color and that is you need to

39

00:01:40,920  -->  00:01:43,110
supply a vector of colors and that's

40

00:01:43,110  -->  00:01:45,090
pretty much all we will need. We won't be

41

00:01:45,090  -->  00:01:47,159
delving into the rest of these

42

00:01:47,159  -->  00:01:49,439
parameters. So let's go ahead and check

43

00:01:49,439  -->  00:01:52,079
this out and practice, so Matplot right?

44

00:01:52,079  -->  00:01:54,509
We'll start off by plotting a simple

45

00:01:54,509  -->  00:01:57,000
matrix, we'll just choose field goals for

46

00:01:57,000  -->  00:01:59,430
instance. We want to visualize how the

47

00:01:59,430  -->  00:02:00,990
players have been scoring field goals of

48

00:02:00,990  -->  00:02:02,880
attempt. Now the important thing to note

49

00:02:02,880  -->  00:02:05,549
here is that we can just apply field

50

00:02:05,549  -->  00:02:07,560
goals because that would be incorrect.

51

00:02:07,560  -->  00:02:11,220
The matplot function plots columns of matrix

52

00:02:11,220  -->  00:02:13,590
one by one. So what it will plot

53

00:02:13,590  -->  00:02:15,629
is if we look here, so let's just

54

00:02:15,629  -->  00:02:19,980
run field goals, right? Field goals, if we

55

00:02:19,980  -->  00:02:22,980
run this table, what the functional plot

56

00:02:22,980  -->  00:02:26,010
is it will plot each column but we want

57

00:02:26,010  -->  00:02:27,780
to put is we want to plot each row

58

00:02:27,780  -->  00:02:29,910
right? We want to plot this player as one

59

00:02:29,910  -->  00:02:32,489
color. This player as another color. This

60

00:02:32,489  -->  00:02:34,440
player as another color and so on. We want to

61

00:02:34,440  -->  00:02:35,580
see how the players have been

62

00:02:35,580  -->  00:02:38,519
progressing through their career. So how

63

00:02:38,519  -->  00:02:40,530
do we get that? How do we change this

64

00:02:40,530  -->  00:02:42,840
table to be able to put it into this

65

00:02:42,840  -->  00:02:44,220
function properly?

66

00:02:44,220  -->  00:02:46,410
Well we need to transpose it and if

67

00:02:46,410  -->  00:02:48,660
you're not familiar with the operation,

68

00:02:48,660  -->  00:02:50,220
mathematical operation of transposing,

69

00:02:50,220  -->  00:02:53,010
That's ok, that's totally fine,

70

00:02:53,010  -->  00:02:55,110
what transposing means is it basically

71

00:02:55,110  -->  00:02:57,690
means flipping this table and changing

72

00:02:57,690  -->  00:02:59,640
the rows into the columns and the

73

00:02:59,640  -->  00:03:01,829
columns into the rows. There you go, it's

74

00:03:01,829  -->  00:03:02,790
as simple as that.

75

00:03:02,790  -->  00:03:05,700
A very complicated word for a very

76

00:03:05,700  -->  00:03:08,340
simple thing and how do you transpose the

77

00:03:08,340  -->  00:03:11,160
table in R? It's very easy. You just

78

00:03:11,160  -->  00:03:13,530
type in T. That's the name of the

79

00:03:13,530  -->  00:03:16,260
function just T and then you type in

80

00:03:16,260  -->  00:03:18,690
you put your color matrix into the

81

00:03:18,690  -->  00:03:19,889
function that's all,

82

00:03:19,889  -->  00:03:22,139
so if I run this now, let me make some

83

00:03:22,139  -->  00:03:24,870
more space here and let's rerun this one

84

00:03:24,870  -->  00:03:27,389
and if I run this now you can see that

85

00:03:27,389  -->  00:03:29,730
the table has been transposed. So here's

86

00:03:29,730  -->  00:03:32,310
our field goal's table and this is our

87

00:03:32,310  -->  00:03:34,739
transposed field goals table. So you

88

00:03:34,739  -->  00:03:37,260
can see that now the columns represent

89

00:03:37,260  -->  00:03:39,120
the players and that's exactly what we

90

00:03:39,120  -->  00:03:41,250
want for the matplot function. So just be

91

00:03:41,250  -->  00:03:43,019
careful of that whenever using the matplot

92

00:03:43,019  -->  00:03:45,810
function. Check if the columns

93

00:03:45,810  -->  00:03:47,940
are actually what you want to plot or if

94

00:03:47,940  -->  00:03:49,829
that's not the case, if you want to plot

95

00:03:49,829  -->  00:03:51,450
the rows then you need to transpose your

96

00:03:51,450  -->  00:03:52,019
table.

97

00:03:52,019  -->  00:03:54,419
Alright so there we go, we've supplied

98

00:03:54,419  -->  00:03:57,329
the data now matplot knows what to plot

99

00:03:57,329  -->  00:03:59,310
right? So pretty much we could run it

100

00:03:59,310  -->  00:04:00,780
right now, so let's make some room here

101

00:04:00,780  -->  00:04:04,739
and let's run it for the first time. If

102

00:04:04,739  -->  00:04:06,569
we run the function, you can see that

103

00:04:06,569  -->  00:04:08,819
something has been plotted. It's not

104

00:04:08,819  -->  00:04:11,250
exactly what we want right?

105

00:04:11,250  -->  00:04:14,250
It's just numbers, there is already some

106

00:04:14,250  -->  00:04:16,680
like trends but let's make this look

107

00:04:16,680  -->  00:04:18,660
nice right? That's what we're going to do.

108

00:04:18,660  -->  00:04:21,810
We're going to select the type and type

109

00:04:21,810  -->  00:04:24,840
is going to be B, so once again you

110

00:04:24,840  -->  00:04:26,669
don't need to know all of these off by

111

00:04:26,669  -->  00:04:27,210
heart

112

00:04:27,210  -->  00:04:29,370
because one is you get better as you

113

00:04:29,370  -->  00:04:31,830
practice R, two we won't be using matplot

114

00:04:31,830  -->  00:04:34,380
a lot. So let's just select type B which

115

00:04:34,380  -->  00:04:38,160
will be for these characters that we're

116

00:04:38,160  -->  00:04:40,169
going to select and the characters or

117

00:04:40,169  -->  00:04:44,970
the pictures are going to be 15 to 18. So

118

00:04:44,970  -->  00:04:46,410
just type in these parameters and the

119

00:04:46,410  -->  00:04:49,080
last thing is color, so we need a vector

120

00:04:49,080  -->  00:04:50,669
of colors and the colors we're going to use

121

00:04:50,669  -->  00:04:54,240
are going to be one to four and six. So

122

00:04:54,240  -->  00:04:56,880
if I run this now, you can see it's much

123

00:04:56,880  -->  00:05:00,720
better right? So I've got better colors,

124

00:05:00,720  -->  00:05:03,449
I've got a much more logical plot the

125

00:05:03,449  -->  00:05:05,430
only thing I don't have is a legend. I

126

00:05:05,430  -->  00:05:07,560
don't know which player is which color

127

00:05:07,560  -->  00:05:09,690
here and which shape so there's actually

128

00:05:09,690  -->  00:05:12,570
two black colors, two blue colors which

129

00:05:12,570  -->  00:05:16,289
players who here. So to add a legend, we

130

00:05:16,289  -->  00:05:19,620
can simply add a legend here by calling

131

00:05:19,620  -->  00:05:22,949
the legend function so this is us using

132

00:05:22,949  -->  00:05:25,470
the matplot function and legend function which

133

00:05:25,470  -->  00:05:28,979
are built into R to build a chart and

134

00:05:28,979  -->  00:05:30,780
the legend is going to go on top of the

135

00:05:30,780  -->  00:05:33,419
existing chart you just created, so to

136

00:05:33,419  -->  00:05:35,550
build a legend, very simple we have to

137

00:05:35,550  -->  00:05:38,099
say where we want the legend, bottom left

138

00:05:38,099  -->  00:05:40,949
then after that we want to say in set.

139

00:05:40,949  -->  00:05:43,949
That's how far it will be moved away

140

00:05:43,949  -->  00:05:46,889
from the bottom left and a corners of

141

00:05:46,889  -->  00:05:49,740
the chart then we want a legend

142

00:05:49,740  -->  00:05:51,150
what is the legend going to actually

143

00:05:51,150  -->  00:05:52,889
represent? It's going to represent the

144

00:05:52,889  -->  00:05:53,699
players.

145

00:05:53,699  -->  00:05:55,949
Why what does players mean in this case?

146

00:05:55,949  -->  00:05:58,409
Players is that vector which you can see

147

00:05:58,409  -->  00:06:01,560
here with the player names because we

148

00:06:01,560  -->  00:06:04,080
know that this vector was actually used

149

00:06:04,080  -->  00:06:07,860
to create the columns, the rows of the

150

00:06:07,860  -->  00:06:11,190
matrix so we know that this these rows

151

00:06:11,190  -->  00:06:13,080
are actually stored in this vector

152

00:06:13,080  -->  00:06:15,360
players so let's go ahead and actually

153

00:06:15,360  -->  00:06:18,180
use that vector and then we're going to

154

00:06:18,180  -->  00:06:20,250
use colors so we're going to use exactly

155

00:06:20,250  -->  00:06:22,440
the same colors, let's just copy that.

156

00:06:22,440  -->  00:06:25,680
So we want the cat colors to match and

157

00:06:25,680  -->  00:06:30,000
then we want to use these pictures and

158

00:06:30,000  -->  00:06:33,539
last we want horizontal equals false so

159

00:06:33,539  -->  00:06:36,330
we want a vertical legend. So quite a lot

160

00:06:36,330  -->  00:06:38,849
of parameters here, in your own free time

161

00:06:38,849  -->  00:06:40,040
you can explore

162

00:06:40,040  -->  00:06:43,580
or using the question mark, the legend function but

163

00:06:43,580  -->  00:06:46,040
in short this is what we're going to use

164

00:06:46,040  -->  00:06:48,530
basically you can see that we're using

165

00:06:48,530  -->  00:06:52,280
the same colors and the same symbols for

166

00:06:52,280  -->  00:06:54,380
our legend as for the chart and the

167

00:06:54,380  -->  00:06:56,540
important thing to note here is that

168

00:06:56,540  -->  00:06:59,660
this one, that's why I'm saying

169

00:06:59,660  -->  00:07:01,430
we're not going to use a lot of this

170

00:07:01,430  -->  00:07:03,110
function and the this type of approach

171

00:07:03,110  -->  00:07:06,530
to visualizing a lot because here legend

172

00:07:06,530  -->  00:07:08,720
is absolutely separate to matplot. It's

173

00:07:08,720  -->  00:07:11,420
actually just going to happen to appear

174

00:07:11,420  -->  00:07:13,550
on the same chart once we run this line,

175

00:07:13,550  -->  00:07:16,100
but in reality there are two separate

176

00:07:16,100  -->  00:07:18,830
objects and if you by accident

177

00:07:18,830  -->  00:07:20,930
give the the wrong colors here, if you

178

00:07:20,930  -->  00:07:22,850
supply their own color different colors

179

00:07:22,850  -->  00:07:26,060
here then your legend will be misleading

180

00:07:26,060  -->  00:07:27,440
you because it will be telling you the

181

00:07:27,440  -->  00:07:29,210
wrong colors for the wrong players so

182

00:07:29,210  -->  00:07:32,090
it's a you have to be very careful when

183

00:07:32,090  -->  00:07:34,730
you supply the symbols and the colors

184

00:07:34,730  -->  00:07:36,860
and also the data so here players

185

00:07:36,860  -->  00:07:39,290
has to be associated with the players

186

00:07:39,290  -->  00:07:41,870
used in the data. It's just that our

187

00:07:41,870  -->  00:07:43,460
data is pretty clean and nicely

188

00:07:43,460  -->  00:07:46,010
formatted so we're lucky that way. We can

189

00:07:46,010  -->  00:07:49,070
do this, but for more complex situations

190

00:07:49,070  -->  00:07:50,810
they are much more powerful tools which

191

00:07:50,810  -->  00:07:52,610
will explore further in the course and

192

00:07:52,610  -->  00:07:55,220
then you look back on today's tutorial

193

00:07:55,220  -->  00:07:57,890
and you'll think wow. That was very very

194

00:07:57,890  -->  00:08:00,830
inconvenient. Anyway, so let's run this

195

00:08:00,830  -->  00:08:03,200
legend function and as you can see now

196

00:08:03,200  -->  00:08:05,720
we have a legend on our chart. o Kobe

197

00:08:05,720  -->  00:08:09,590
Bryant is that color, that's a Joe Johnson

198

00:08:09,590  -->  00:08:11,750
over there. So now you can explore how

199

00:08:11,750  -->  00:08:13,460
many field goals each one of these

200

00:08:13,460  -->  00:08:16,100
players has scored right? Throughout

201

00:08:16,100  -->  00:08:18,470
their career, you can see clearly that

202

00:08:18,470  -->  00:08:21,500
Derrick Rose is this blue color here

203

00:08:21,500  -->  00:08:23,660
because he didn't score any goals in

204

00:08:23,660  -->  00:08:25,640
this season he was injured. I am not

205

00:08:25,640  -->  00:08:27,110
picking on Derrick Rose. I think he's a

206

00:08:27,110  -->  00:08:27,980
great player.

207

00:08:27,980  -->  00:08:30,170
It's just a great example for our

208

00:08:30,170  -->  00:08:32,360
data set to verify that we are

209

00:08:32,360  -->  00:08:34,370
visualizing what we want because we

210

00:08:34,370  -->  00:08:36,229
already know that Derrick Rose wasn't

211

00:08:36,229  -->  00:08:38,840
playing in that season and so here ya

212

00:08:38,840  -->  00:08:40,400
you can visualize the data. You can

213

00:08:40,400  -->  00:08:41,900
see the trend, so you can see that kind

214

00:08:41,900  -->  00:08:43,669
of general you going down but once again

215

00:08:43,669  -->  00:08:46,700
just visualizing field goals isn't very

216

00:08:46,700  -->  00:08:49,340
accurate because the players play

217

00:08:49,340  -->  00:08:51,650
different games and this chart doesn't

218

00:08:51,650  -->  00:08:53,200
reflect injuries.

219

00:08:53,200  -->  00:08:55,360
So I mean like injuries are not taken into

220

00:08:55,360  -->  00:08:56,920
account. The best way to take into

221

00:08:56,920  -->  00:08:59,290
account injuries is if you divide by the

222

00:08:59,290  -->  00:09:01,750
number of games, for instance. Also like

223

00:09:01,750  -->  00:09:05,140
if you normalize your data so in this

224

00:09:05,140  -->  00:09:07,270
case we're dividing by the number of

225

00:09:07,270  -->  00:09:10,270
games and that's that's how just R

226

00:09:10,270  -->  00:09:13,030
transpose should divide here. We divide

227

00:09:13,030  -->  00:09:14,710
by the number of games and we plot this

228

00:09:14,710  -->  00:09:15,460
now.

229

00:09:15,460  -->  00:09:18,700
Now you can see the actual picture right?

230

00:09:18,700  -->  00:09:21,790
So here you can see what has been going

231

00:09:21,790  -->  00:09:24,580
on and the legend is the same. So you

232

00:09:24,580  -->  00:09:26,290
can see which players actually scored

233

00:09:26,290  -->  00:09:29,410
the most field goals per game they play.

234

00:09:29,410  -->  00:09:32,470
Ok so that's how you visualize. Let's

235

00:09:32,470  -->  00:09:35,380
just visualize one more and then I will

236

00:09:35,380  -->  00:09:38,590
let you explore the data and let your

237

00:09:38,590  -->  00:09:40,390
imagination run free.

238

00:09:40,390  -->  00:09:41,740
Alright, so let's say we want to

239

00:09:41,740  -->  00:09:45,310
visualize field goals divided by field goal

240

00:09:45,310  -->  00:09:47,080
attempts. That's going to be an

241

00:09:47,080  -->  00:09:48,970
interesting one because that is the

242

00:09:48,970  -->  00:09:51,580
accuracy that's what we talked about at

243

00:09:51,580  -->  00:09:53,230
the end of last tutorial. So if we divide

244

00:09:53,230  -->  00:09:55,540
field goals by field goal attempts and

245

00:09:55,540  -->  00:09:58,420
we visualize that you will see that we

246

00:09:58,420  -->  00:10:01,000
are now looking at the accuracy that

247

00:10:01,000  -->  00:10:04,090
these players have, so can you see this

248

00:10:04,090  -->  00:10:06,010
line up at the top? That is the most

249

00:10:06,010  -->  00:10:07,960
accurate player. Who is that? It's Dwight

250

00:10:07,960  -->  00:10:10,960
Howard, Dwight Dwight Howard sorry Dwight

251

00:10:10,960  -->  00:10:13,120
Howard is the most accurate player his

252

00:10:13,120  -->  00:10:15,250
accuracy is like way above and it's

253

00:10:15,250  -->  00:10:17,050
pretty consistent in the past years and

254

00:10:17,050  -->  00:10:19,180
some players their accuracy is up and

255

00:10:19,180  -->  00:10:21,490
down so Kobe Bryant for instances,

256

00:10:21,490  -->  00:10:24,670
his accuracy has been dropping. Who else do we

257

00:10:24,670  -->  00:10:27,610
have here? We've got LeBron James, but

258

00:10:27,610  -->  00:10:29,440
his accuracy drop so sometimes the

259

00:10:29,440  -->  00:10:31,360
accuracy drop can be due to injury as

260

00:10:31,360  -->  00:10:32,830
well if they had an injury and then they

261

00:10:32,830  -->  00:10:35,680
did come back to play and then for

262

00:10:35,680  -->  00:10:37,900
instance they could still be not

263

00:10:37,900  -->  00:10:39,520
performing to their best.

264

00:10:39,520  -->  00:10:41,020
Alright so there's a couple of

265

00:10:41,020  -->  00:10:42,580
visualizations and now you've got this

266

00:10:42,580  -->  00:10:45,370
template, I invite you to explore this

267

00:10:45,370  -->  00:10:47,890
data set and see what you can do and let

268

00:10:47,890  -->  00:10:49,780
me just remind you what tables we have,

269

00:10:49,780  -->  00:10:52,060
we've got field goal attempts, field

270

00:10:52,060  -->  00:10:55,480
goals, games, minutes played, points, salary,

271

00:10:55,480  -->  00:10:57,430
so you could look at things like, uhmm

272

00:10:57,430  -->  00:10:59,440
let me give you a couple ideas. You can

273

00:10:59,440  -->  00:11:02,410
look at Point a salary for point so how

274

00:11:02,410  -->  00:11:04,120
many dollars per point to do they get

275

00:11:04,120  -->  00:11:06,790
paid? Points per game?

276

00:11:06,790  -->  00:11:10,000
You could look at minutes of points

277

00:11:10,000  -->  00:11:12,460
points per minutes played, so how many

278

00:11:12,460  -->  00:11:14,950
points do they score on average per

279

00:11:14,950  -->  00:11:17,110
minute of their games and so on. But

280

00:11:17,110  -->  00:11:18,670
don't get too carried away, just have a

281

00:11:18,670  -->  00:11:20,230
look at a couple and then come back to

282

00:11:20,230  -->  00:11:22,300
the next tutorial because we will be

283

00:11:22,300  -->  00:11:24,550
moving on and we'll be continuing on

284

00:11:24,550  -->  00:11:25,720
working with his data set

285

00:11:25,720  -->  00:11:27,700
throughout this section so sooner or

286

00:11:27,700  -->  00:11:28,840
later we'll come back and we'll

287

00:11:28,840  -->  00:11:31,450
visualize some more and yeah we'll

288

00:11:31,450  -->  00:11:32,740
explore the data together as well.

289

00:11:32,740  -->  00:11:34,360
And I look forward to seeing in the next

290

00:11:34,360  -->  00:11:34,990
tutorial.

291

00:11:34,990  -->  00:11:47,240
Until then happy coding.
