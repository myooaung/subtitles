00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,170
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07,170  -->  00:00:09,090
R programming. In the previous tutorial,

3

00:00:09,090  -->  00:00:12,719
we prepared our data set for analysis so

4

00:00:12,719  -->  00:00:15,030
now that we have the region column in

5

00:00:15,030  -->  00:00:17,550
this merged data frame and today we're

6

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:20,039
going to visualize it and first off

7

00:00:20,039  -->  00:00:22,109
we're going to use the same Q plot

8

00:00:22,109  -->  00:00:25,170
function, so in that way it's going to be

9

00:00:25,170  -->  00:00:26,789
very similar to what we've already done

10

00:00:26,789  -->  00:00:29,010
in when we were creating this beautiful

11

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:31,619
plot and therefore well first of all let

12

00:00:31,619  -->  00:00:34,469
me type in for the name, visualizing.

13

00:00:34,469  -->  00:00:38,399
There we go so and that's why because we're

14

00:00:38,399  -->  00:00:39,870
going to be very similar, that's why I

15

00:00:39,870  -->  00:00:41,879
wanted to encourage you to pause this

16

00:00:41,879  -->  00:00:45,480
video and go and try to practice that on

17

00:00:45,480  -->  00:00:47,520
your own to just try and create that

18

00:00:47,520  -->  00:00:49,410
plot based on your what you already know

19

00:00:49,410  -->  00:00:52,289
about Q plot and what we've already seen

20

00:00:52,289  -->  00:00:55,260
and trained how to do. So try and create

21

00:00:55,260  -->  00:00:56,699
it and then come back to the video and

22

00:00:56,699  -->  00:00:58,890
we'll compare the results and now I'll

23

00:00:58,890  -->  00:01:01,440
proceed to creating this visualization.

24

00:01:01,440  -->  00:01:03,780
Alright so follow along with the code

25

00:01:03,780  -->  00:01:06,659
and we're going to get this done and

26

00:01:06,659  -->  00:01:08,310
also by the way it's not going to be

27

00:01:08,310  -->  00:01:09,990
just the repetition of what we've

28

00:01:09,990  -->  00:01:11,760
already done we will also learn a couple

29

00:01:11,760  -->  00:01:14,040
of new tricks with Q plot, I've got some

30

00:01:14,040  -->  00:01:16,650
some things I wanted to show. So Q plot,

31

00:01:16,650  -->  00:01:19,320
and don't forget we need the library

32

00:01:19,320  -->  00:01:21,570
GGplot2 but we've already got it loaded

33

00:01:21,570  -->  00:01:24,450
so that's that sorted so data equals

34

00:01:24,450  -->  00:01:26,070
merged, that's our data frame that

35

00:01:26,070  -->  00:01:28,200
we're visualizing and then we've got x

36

00:01:28,200  -->  00:01:32,400
equals internet users and y is going

37

00:01:32,400  -->  00:01:35,100
to be birth rate so it's just as last

38

00:01:35,100  -->  00:01:35,549
time.

39

00:01:35,549  -->  00:01:38,220
Alright so if we run that, there

40

00:01:38,220  -->  00:01:41,430
we go so now we can just copy paste and

41

00:01:41,430  -->  00:01:44,520
improve our visualization step-by-step. Here

42

00:01:44,520  -->  00:01:46,710
we're going to say color equals region,

43

00:01:46,710  -->  00:01:49,799
remember we don't need the I if we are

44

00:01:49,799  -->  00:01:51,899
mapping a variable or rather than

45

00:01:51,899  -->  00:01:54,869
applying it to all of the values. So here

46

00:01:54,869  -->  00:01:57,420
we go, that is pretty much the end result

47

00:01:57,420  -->  00:01:59,880
that we were after with map division, but

48

00:01:59,880  -->  00:02:02,250
once again we want this to look nice we

49

00:02:02,250  -->  00:02:04,799
wanted to tell a story. Here it's still

50

00:02:04,799  -->  00:02:07,350
very small, so let's start fixing it up

51

00:02:07,350  -->  00:02:10,140
and also let's learn quite a few new things and

52

00:02:10,140  -->  00:02:11,520
so first thing we're going to learn is

53

00:02:11,520  -->  00:02:13,740
shapes. I will show you how to

54

00:02:13,740  -->  00:02:15,900
change the shapes of these

55

00:02:15,900  -->  00:02:16,830
scatterplot.

56

00:02:16,830  -->  00:02:19,380
Alright so let's say I want to

57

00:02:19,380  -->  00:02:22,020
paste that or actually I want to copy

58

00:02:22,020  -->  00:02:24,510
that and paste that and here after

59

00:02:24,510  -->  00:02:26,460
region, what I want to say is first we

60

00:02:26,460  -->  00:02:28,230
need to increase the size. We use the

61

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:31,860
other I and then we want to say shape, so

62

00:02:31,860  -->  00:02:34,380
I'm going to start with just one shape

63

00:02:34,380  -->  00:02:36,840
and then we will explore what other

64

00:02:36,840  -->  00:02:39,810
shapes exist if you run that then you

65

00:02:39,810  -->  00:02:41,430
can see that we've got triangles now

66

00:02:41,430  -->  00:02:41,970
right?

67

00:02:41,970  -->  00:02:45,090
Looks like a little forest and so what's up

68

00:02:45,090  -->  00:02:47,940
with the shape of parameter? What kind of

69

00:02:47,940  -->  00:02:50,400
shapes can we have? Well I've got a small

70

00:02:50,400  -->  00:02:53,010
chart prepared over here and you can have

71

00:02:53,010  -->  00:02:55,740
shaped from 0 to 25 so at the start

72

00:02:55,740  -->  00:02:57,480
you've got kind of like hollow shapes,

73

00:02:57,480  -->  00:02:58,950
the first three then you've got these

74

00:02:58,950  -->  00:03:00,660
and another holes so all of these are

75

00:03:00,660  -->  00:03:03,150
pretty much hollow out up to here. The field

76

00:03:03,150  -->  00:03:04,770
shapes is good to remember their fifteen,

77

00:03:04,770  -->  00:03:07,590
sixteen, seventeen up to 20 and then 21.

78

00:03:07,590  -->  00:03:09,180
If you ever forget, you can

79

00:03:09,180  -->  00:03:11,910
always just type in R shapes in google

80

00:03:11,910  -->  00:03:13,770
and this is you know you'll get one of

81

00:03:13,770  -->  00:03:16,890
these pictures right away. So let's

82

00:03:16,890  -->  00:03:17,910
try a couple more,

83

00:03:17,910  -->  00:03:20,700
let's see how this chart will change if

84

00:03:20,700  -->  00:03:23,220
we actually let's just try it right here, let's

85

00:03:23,220  -->  00:03:25,560
say shape number two, the hollow triangle

86

00:03:25,560  -->  00:03:28,260
and if you run that you can see that

87

00:03:28,260  -->  00:03:30,840
here is a bit different and you can see

88

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:31,950
a bit better so you can see where

89

00:03:31,950  -->  00:03:34,440
triangles overlapped it might be a

90

00:03:34,440  -->  00:03:36,540
better option for some charts.

91

00:03:36,540  -->  00:03:39,180
Let's try another one, let's try 15. 15 is

92

00:03:39,180  -->  00:03:44,220
squares right and 23, 23 is hollow

93

00:03:44,220  -->  00:03:47,040
rhomboid or diamonds.

94

00:03:47,040  -->  00:03:49,590
Ok so that's enough playing around with

95

00:03:49,590  -->  00:03:51,900
that but at least now you have learned

96

00:03:51,900  -->  00:03:54,750
how to create how to change the shape of

97

00:03:54,750  -->  00:03:57,150
the point in this scatterplot.

98

00:03:57,150  -->  00:03:58,500
Alright so now what we're going to do?

99

00:03:58,500  -->  00:04:01,530
Now we're going to, going to learn about

100

00:04:01,530  -->  00:04:04,710
transparency. So that's the second thing

101

00:04:04,710  -->  00:04:08,280
I want to show today is

102

00:04:08,280  -->  00:04:09,150
transparency.

103

00:04:09,150  -->  00:04:11,760
Alright so we're going to copy what we already

104

00:04:11,760  -->  00:04:14,790
have and let's say shape number 19,

105

00:04:14,790  -->  00:04:17,100
if you run that, you'll see that it's

106

00:04:17,100  -->  00:04:18,780
not hollow and sometimes that they

107

00:04:18,780  -->  00:04:20,850
overlap right? So sometimes you've got

108

00:04:20,850  -->  00:04:23,790
overlapping shapes and that might hide

109

00:04:23,790  -->  00:04:26,610
some of the dots and might misrepresent

110

00:04:26,610  -->  00:04:27,300
your data.

111

00:04:27,300  -->  00:04:29,280
So how'd you fix that? Well it's very

112

00:04:29,280  -->  00:04:31,199
simple, you add transparency and touch

113

00:04:31,199  -->  00:04:32,849
transparency, you use the parameter which is

114

00:04:32,849  -->  00:04:35,490
called alpha. So you type in alpha equals

115

00:04:35,490  -->  00:04:36,960
once again we're setting transparency

116

00:04:36,960  -->  00:04:39,300
for all the dots and here you type in

117

00:04:39,300  -->  00:04:42,360
value from 0 to 1 right? So basically

118

00:04:42,360  -->  00:04:45,720
zero is fully transparent, one is fully

119

00:04:45,720  -->  00:04:50,550
opaque so let's say 0.1 and let's have a

120

00:04:50,550  -->  00:04:53,340
look at that. So if I run that, you can see that it's

121

00:04:53,340  -->  00:04:57,389
very transparent, very likely fading can

122

00:04:57,389  -->  00:04:59,879
barely see them so let's say is 0.6, see

123

00:04:59,879  -->  00:05:01,949
that's already better so when they

124

00:05:01,949  -->  00:05:03,719
overlap you can actually see that they

125

00:05:03,719  -->  00:05:05,009
are overlapping. You can kind of see

126

00:05:05,009  -->  00:05:08,069
behind the dots, so there you go and it's very

127

00:05:08,069  -->  00:05:10,440
useful for scatterplots we have lots and

128

00:05:10,440  -->  00:05:12,870
lots of observations, to see where there

129

00:05:12,870  -->  00:05:14,550
are clusters of observations because

130

00:05:14,550  -->  00:05:16,710
those areas will be darker when

131

00:05:16,710  -->  00:05:18,990
observations overlap.

132

00:05:18,990  -->  00:05:22,379
Ok and finally the third thing I wanted

133

00:05:22,379  -->  00:05:24,960
to show you is how to add the title to

134

00:05:24,960  -->  00:05:27,120
your visualization. Right now we don't

135

00:05:27,120  -->  00:05:29,520
have a title up at the top so let's go

136

00:05:29,520  -->  00:05:31,560
ahead and add one. It's very simple, you

137

00:05:31,560  -->  00:05:33,750
just need to use the parameter which is

138

00:05:33,750  -->  00:05:37,500
called main so if I type in comma main so

139

00:05:37,500  -->  00:05:39,599
you can see how we are chaining more and

140

00:05:39,599  -->  00:05:42,060
more parameters we've got all of this is.

141

00:05:42,060  -->  00:05:44,190
All being passed into Q plot and you

142

00:05:44,190  -->  00:05:46,169
can keep going for quite a while and

143

00:05:46,169  -->  00:05:50,039
here we're going to say birth rate vs

144

00:05:50,039  -->  00:05:53,009
something simple internet users, let's

145

00:05:53,009  -->  00:05:56,009
give it some more space and let's run that,

146

00:05:56,009  -->  00:06:00,330
whoops, so here you can see the title has

147

00:06:00,330  -->  00:06:01,349
appeared now.

148

00:06:01,349  -->  00:06:04,379
Well there we go, that's how we used a

149

00:06:04,379  -->  00:06:06,870
Q plot to create another awesome

150

00:06:06,870  -->  00:06:09,750
visualization and also we learned a

151

00:06:09,750  -->  00:06:11,729
couple of things about Q plot, shapes

152

00:06:11,729  -->  00:06:13,379
transparency and how to set the title

153

00:06:13,379  -->  00:06:15,750
and we'll talk much more about

154

00:06:15,750  -->  00:06:17,940
visualization further down in the course.

155

00:06:17,940  -->  00:06:20,159
We will learn a even more powerful

156

00:06:20,159  -->  00:06:23,009
function which is a GGplot can't wait

157

00:06:23,009  -->  00:06:25,349
to tell you all about it and for us to

158

00:06:25,349  -->  00:06:27,210
go through those tutorials and this

159

00:06:27,210  -->  00:06:29,340
brings us to the end for today. I hope you

160

00:06:29,340  -->  00:06:31,560
enjoyed these basketball tutorials and

161

00:06:31,560  -->  00:06:33,120
you learned quite a lot about data

162

00:06:33,120  -->  00:06:35,880
frames and also some basics of

163

00:06:35,880  -->  00:06:37,680
visualization. As you can see it's not

164

00:06:37,680  -->  00:06:39,009
hard at all and

165

00:06:39,009  -->  00:06:40,930
can help you create very powerful

166

00:06:40,930  -->  00:06:42,520
insights and I look forward to seeing

167

00:06:42,520  -->  00:06:43,599
you in the next tutorial,

168

00:06:43,599  -->  00:06:55,549
until then happy coding.
