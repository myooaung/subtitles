00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,410
Hello and welcome back to the course on R

2

00:00:07,410  -->  00:00:09,510
programming. I hope you had a chance to

3

00:00:09,510  -->  00:00:11,880
play around with Q plot and maybe even

4

00:00:11,880  -->  00:00:14,130
you attempted the challenge for this

5

00:00:14,130  -->  00:00:16,020
section and what we're going to do today

6

00:00:16,020  -->  00:00:19,650
is we're going to build that visualization

7

00:00:19,650  -->  00:00:22,890
that we're after and now we know so much

8

00:00:22,890  -->  00:00:24,900
about Q plot already and it's such a

9

00:00:24,900  -->  00:00:27,720
simple tool it won't take long at all. So

10

00:00:27,720  -->  00:00:30,119
let's dive straight into it. Going to

11

00:00:30,119  -->  00:00:32,640
copy this comment here to create a new

12

00:00:32,640  -->  00:00:36,210
section of code visualizing what we need

13

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:39,570
very elaborate name for a section.

14

00:00:39,570  -->  00:00:42,239
Alright let's try it, let's start doing

15

00:00:42,239  -->  00:00:45,120
it. Q plot data equals that's right

16

00:00:45,120  -->  00:00:49,020
we're going to pass the data to Q plot.

17

00:00:49,020  -->  00:00:51,780
Now we can freely operate with the

18

00:00:51,780  -->  00:00:53,760
columns in our data and we'll say what do we

19

00:00:53,760  -->  00:00:55,530
want to visualize. We want to visualize internet

20

00:00:55,530  -->  00:00:57,059
users so we'll put them on the

21

00:00:57,059  -->  00:01:00,059
x-axis and we want the birth rate we'll

22

00:01:00,059  -->  00:01:02,250
put it on the y-axis so we'll go internet

23

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:07,740
users comma y equals birth dot

24

00:01:07,740  -->  00:01:12,000
rate. Run that, viola! Simple as that one

25

00:01:12,000  -->  00:01:14,430
line three components and we've got our

26

00:01:14,430  -->  00:01:16,799
visualization ready. Let's go take that

27

00:01:16,799  -->  00:01:17,880
to our manager.

28

00:01:17,880  -->  00:01:19,680
Well of course where data scientists we

29

00:01:19,680  -->  00:01:21,630
can just take it like that is it's gotta

30

00:01:21,630  -->  00:01:23,070
is going to tell stories going to look

31

00:01:23,070  -->  00:01:25,140
good right? So let's let's work on that.

32

00:01:25,140  -->  00:01:26,820
What we're going to do? We're going to

33

00:01:26,820  -->  00:01:30,329
copy this and we're going to add the

34

00:01:30,329  -->  00:01:33,180
size and we're going to make them a bit

35

00:01:33,180  -->  00:01:35,159
bigger. Now the size we're not mapping the

36

00:01:35,159  -->  00:01:37,619
size, mapping is when we're assigning as

37

00:01:37,619  -->  00:01:38,700
we discussed in previous tutorial

38

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:41,369
mapping is when we're assigning a

39

00:01:41,369  -->  00:01:44,070
parameter so in this case size we would

40

00:01:44,070  -->  00:01:45,750
assign it to a variable in this case we

41

00:01:45,750  -->  00:01:47,610
just want to increase the size for all

42

00:01:47,610  -->  00:01:50,009
these points. We are going to say size

43

00:01:50,009  -->  00:01:53,040
equals I and four and that's why the I

44

00:01:53,040  -->  00:01:55,200
is there because we're assigning the

45

00:01:55,200  -->  00:01:58,290
size increase to every point so let's

46

00:01:58,290  -->  00:02:01,140
run that, there we go. The size has increased,

47

00:02:01,140  -->  00:02:04,290
good. Now what we're going to do next

48

00:02:04,290  -->  00:02:07,649
we're going to let's add a color. Let's let's

49

00:02:07,649  -->  00:02:09,899
color all these points to start off with

50

00:02:09,899  -->  00:02:11,220
let's see how we can do that.

51

00:02:11,220  -->  00:02:14,640
Let's add the color here color equals, we

52

00:02:14,640  -->  00:02:16,500
already know that we need the I again

53

00:02:16,500  -->  00:02:18,600
because we want the same color for all

54

00:02:18,600  -->  00:02:21,600
of them and what we're going to say I

55

00:02:21,600  -->  00:02:24,420
let's say red, make some space here and

56

00:02:24,420  -->  00:02:27,690
run that, run that. There we go, so all the

57

00:02:27,690  -->  00:02:30,660
points are red. Okay that's great now

58

00:02:30,660  -->  00:02:33,720
what we want is remember that the

59

00:02:33,720  -->  00:02:36,240
challenge actually asked us to

60

00:02:36,240  -->  00:02:39,330
categorize the scatter plot by the

61

00:02:39,330  -->  00:02:41,430
income groups of the country's so how

62

00:02:41,430  -->  00:02:43,500
would we do that now. So we'll take this,

63

00:02:43,500  -->  00:02:47,700
and instead of I red, we're going to use

64

00:02:47,700  -->  00:02:49,530
income group. Now we won't need the I

65

00:02:49,530  -->  00:02:51,930
anymore because we are mapping this

66

00:02:51,930  -->  00:02:56,280
variable to the visualization. We want the

67

00:02:56,280  -->  00:02:57,660
different income groups to have different

68

00:02:57,660  -->  00:02:59,790
colors and maybe will increase the size

69

00:02:59,790  -->  00:03:02,459
here bit because we started small. So if I

70

00:03:02,459  -->  00:03:04,320
run this and i run this now

71

00:03:04,320  -->  00:03:06,810
much better right? Isn't that much better?

72

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:09,150
We can see that we've got income groups.

73

00:03:09,150  -->  00:03:12,570
We've got red, green, blue and purple and

74

00:03:12,570  -->  00:03:16,260
we can see how they are located here so

75

00:03:16,260  -->  00:03:20,430
that is already a great start and we can

76

00:03:20,430  -->  00:03:23,760
now even analyze this chart. We can even

77

00:03:23,760  -->  00:03:26,760
derive some insights. We can see that so

78

00:03:26,760  -->  00:03:28,890
let's recall on the horizontal axis

79

00:03:28,890  -->  00:03:31,500
we've got internet users right so how

80

00:03:31,500  -->  00:03:33,269
many what percentage of the population

81

00:03:33,269  -->  00:03:35,310
has access to the insurance from zero to

82

00:03:35,310  -->  00:03:38,070
hundred and on the vertical axis we have

83

00:03:38,070  -->  00:03:41,040
the birth rate. So how many children are

84

00:03:41,040  -->  00:03:44,280
born for per year for a thousand people

85

00:03:44,280  -->  00:03:47,489
of this population? So if you take a thousand

86

00:03:47,489  -->  00:03:50,760
people, how many children for that

87

00:03:50,760  -->  00:03:53,070
thousand will be born in every year and

88

00:03:53,070  -->  00:03:55,019
this is the data for 2012,

89

00:03:55,019  -->  00:03:57,450
so what you can see here is that the

90

00:03:57,450  -->  00:03:59,730
high income group are all kind of

91

00:03:59,730  -->  00:04:02,160
located here meaning that a lot of the

92

00:04:02,160  -->  00:04:04,860
plant population a huge percentage over

93

00:04:04,860  -->  00:04:07,140
fifty percent and in most in many cases

94

00:04:07,140  -->  00:04:09,299
over seventy-five percent have access to

95

00:04:09,299  -->  00:04:12,840
the internet but the birth rate is quite

96

00:04:12,840  -->  00:04:13,530
low

97

00:04:13,530  -->  00:04:17,910
it's somewhere between 5 and 20 or 25

98

00:04:17,910  -->  00:04:20,039
then you've got the upper middle-income

99

00:04:20,039  -->  00:04:23,160
the purple ones they're a bit back so

100

00:04:23,160  -->  00:04:24,540
they don't have

101

00:04:24,540  -->  00:04:27,150
these countries not that many not much

102

00:04:27,150  -->  00:04:29,550
of the population has access to the

103

00:04:29,550  -->  00:04:31,260
internet, a percentage somewhere between

104

00:04:31,260  -->  00:04:34,650
for most cases between 25 and 75 for

105

00:04:34,650  -->  00:04:36,960
some cases under 25 and then the

106

00:04:36,960  -->  00:04:39,240
birthrate is a bit higher then the lower

107

00:04:39,240  -->  00:04:41,070
middle-income, the birthrate is even

108

00:04:41,070  -->  00:04:43,650
higher and access to internet is even

109

00:04:43,650  -->  00:04:45,870
lower. It's more in most cases under

110

00:04:45,870  -->  00:04:47,880
fifty percent of the population have

111

00:04:47,880  -->  00:04:49,830
access to internet and finally the

112

00:04:49,830  -->  00:04:53,880
low-income, so more very high birth rate

113

00:04:53,880  -->  00:04:57,330
in at times four times as higher or five

114

00:04:57,330  -->  00:04:59,730
times as high as in the high income

115

00:04:59,730  -->  00:05:02,490
category but at the same time the

116

00:05:02,490  -->  00:05:06,180
internet axis is very low so less than

117

00:05:06,180  -->  00:05:08,880
twenty-five percent. How interesting is

118

00:05:08,880  -->  00:05:12,030
that right? So as you transition from a

119

00:05:12,030  -->  00:05:14,640
low-income countries to high-income

120

00:05:14,640  -->  00:05:18,420
countries your internet usage increases the

121

00:05:18,420  -->  00:05:20,100
percentage of people using internet

122

00:05:20,100  -->  00:05:22,260
and your birth rate falls. It almost

123

00:05:22,260  -->  00:05:23,910
seems like there's a correlation between

124

00:05:23,910  -->  00:05:26,100
the two right? So when people don't have

125

00:05:26,100  -->  00:05:28,500
introduces of course not and

126

00:05:28,500  -->  00:05:30,390
correlation doesn't imply causation

127

00:05:30,390  -->  00:05:33,240
right so it's a of course not we're

128

00:05:33,240  -->  00:05:34,440
not proving here that there's a

129

00:05:34,440  -->  00:05:36,810
correlation but it almost seems that

130

00:05:36,810  -->  00:05:39,450
when people have like a lot of internet

131

00:05:39,450  -->  00:05:41,760
they don't have time for children, when

132

00:05:41,760  -->  00:05:44,370
people have no internet and all they're

133

00:05:44,370  -->  00:05:46,440
doing is making more children so it's

134

00:05:46,440  -->  00:05:48,120
just a funny observation like it but

135

00:05:48,120  -->  00:05:50,730
otherwise this chart is telling a

136

00:05:50,730  -->  00:05:53,430
beautiful story and this is exactly what

137

00:05:53,430  -->  00:05:56,010
we are after. So congratulations, we have

138

00:05:56,010  -->  00:05:59,940
solved the challenge. I hope you enjoyed

139

00:05:59,940  -->  00:06:01,770
this tutorial and I hope that you're

140

00:06:01,770  -->  00:06:04,200
truly proud of what you are able to

141

00:06:04,200  -->  00:06:06,870
achieve using data frames and

142

00:06:06,870  -->  00:06:09,060
learning about them in such a short

143

00:06:09,060  -->  00:06:10,800
period of time and I look forward to

144

00:06:10,800  -->  00:06:12,150
seeing in the next tutorial where we

145

00:06:12,150  -->  00:06:14,130
will continue our journey into the world

146

00:06:14,130  -->  00:06:16,680
of data frames and until then happy

147

00:06:16,680  -->  00:06:27,689
coding.
