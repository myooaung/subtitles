00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,930
Hello and welcome back to the course on

2

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:09,750
R programming and today we're going to

3

00:00:09,750  -->  00:00:13,049
talk about plotting with layers. So I've

4

00:00:13,049  -->  00:00:16,139
got the check mark set on geometry, it's

5

00:00:16,139  -->  00:00:17,220
because we are going to be talking about

6

00:00:17,220  -->  00:00:20,130
geometries and we will see how you can

7

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:22,769
layer geometries on top of each other

8

00:00:22,769  -->  00:00:24,840
and what plotting with layers actually

9

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:28,439
means in R and let's dive straight

10

00:00:28,439  -->  00:00:29,220
into it.

11

00:00:29,220  -->  00:00:30,570
Alright so this is where we left off

12

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:32,579
last time we create beautiful beautiful

13

00:00:32,579  -->  00:00:36,030
visualization and now let's move on to

14

00:00:36,030  -->  00:00:37,200
the next point.

15

00:00:37,200  -->  00:00:39,960
Alright so let's remember what we talked

16

00:00:39,960  -->  00:00:40,590
about here.

17

00:00:40,590  -->  00:00:43,469
Here we said what do we need from here?

18

00:00:43,469  -->  00:00:45,989
Well what did we do? We added this

19

00:00:45,989  -->  00:00:48,600
aesthetics right? We said okay what x

20

00:00:48,600  -->  00:00:49,800
going to be? What's y going to be?

21

00:00:49,800  -->  00:00:52,500
Color, genre and so on and then we said

22

00:00:52,500  -->  00:00:55,170
plus geom point so what's going on with

23

00:00:55,170  -->  00:00:57,539
this plus? What is actually going on? Well

24

00:00:57,539  -->  00:00:59,609
the thing is that in ggplot that the way

25

00:00:59,609  -->  00:01:01,410
its design every time you want to add

26

00:01:01,410  -->  00:01:05,700
layer, you literally have to add it to

27

00:01:05,700  -->  00:01:08,490
the object you're creating and that's

28

00:01:08,490  -->  00:01:11,280
right you are creating an object and I

29

00:01:11,280  -->  00:01:13,830
can prove it too you. So if we just take this

30

00:01:13,830  -->  00:01:17,460
code right and if I say

31

00:01:17,460  -->  00:01:19,979
P for plot and then I copy this code

32

00:01:19,979  -->  00:01:22,500
right and now I run these two lines,

33

00:01:22,500  -->  00:01:25,259
you'll see that nothing changed, nothing

34

00:01:25,259  -->  00:01:28,890
appeared but what did happen is we just

35

00:01:28,890  -->  00:01:30,869
created an object. Let me drag this down

36

00:01:30,869  -->  00:01:33,689
so you can see object P, list of nine so

37

00:01:33,689  -->  00:01:35,520
we haven't talked about list. That is

38

00:01:35,520  -->  00:01:37,770
coming later on the course but if i open

39

00:01:37,770  -->  00:01:41,009
it up now, if I unlock it over here,

40

00:01:41,009  -->  00:01:44,909
you can see that this is a huge object.

41

00:01:44,909  -->  00:01:46,920
It has the data frame so actually

42

00:01:46,920  -->  00:01:49,439
the data is physically copied into

43

00:01:49,439  -->  00:01:51,270
the subject and be careful that that's

44

00:01:51,270  -->  00:01:53,310
important to remember because if you

45

00:01:53,310  -->  00:01:55,470
refresh the data it's then your plot want

46

00:01:55,470  -->  00:01:57,810
refresh until you recreate the object

47

00:01:57,810  -->  00:01:59,640
and we'll we'll talk more about that

48

00:01:59,640  -->  00:02:01,380
further down so you can see that the

49

00:02:01,380  -->  00:02:03,360
data frame is in here then it's got some

50

00:02:03,360  -->  00:02:07,469
layers, scale, add, clone. fine, all these

51

00:02:07,469  -->  00:02:10,200
unknown to us things, oh here's got

52

00:02:10,200  -->  00:02:12,989
color so there are aesthetic so you can

53

00:02:12,989  -->  00:02:13,740
see the world mapping

54

00:02:13,740  -->  00:02:15,990
which we will also talk about in an

55

00:02:15,990  -->  00:02:17,910
upcoming tutorial but that's exactly

56

00:02:17,910  -->  00:02:20,490
what aesthetics do they map variables to

57

00:02:20,490  -->  00:02:23,310
our aesthetic and so there's lots of

58

00:02:23,310  -->  00:02:26,430
things going on here and yep we create

59

00:02:26,430  -->  00:02:29,490
an object and so now from this point on

60

00:02:29,490  -->  00:02:31,020
which we're actually going to work with

61

00:02:31,020  -->  00:02:33,810
layers open plots as they are objects so

62

00:02:33,810  -->  00:02:35,970
what I can do now is I can just type in

63

00:02:35,970  -->  00:02:40,020
p and if I run this line that creates or

64

00:02:40,020  -->  00:02:42,090
visualize that object p of course we

65

00:02:42,090  -->  00:02:43,470
don't see anything because we haven't

66

00:02:43,470  -->  00:02:44,790
what have we done

67

00:02:44,790  -->  00:02:47,130
we haven't said the geometry yet. So let's go

68

00:02:47,130  -->  00:02:50,730
ahead and do that, let's say P + geom

69

00:02:50,730  -->  00:02:54,210
underscore point, around this line you

70

00:02:54,210  -->  00:02:56,250
can see that I've got about the object

71

00:02:56,250  -->  00:02:58,110
and this is the important concept of

72

00:02:58,110  -->  00:03:00,690
GGplot, so I got this object which is the

73

00:03:00,690  -->  00:03:03,690
foundation of my plot, the starting layer

74

00:03:03,690  -->  00:03:06,690
and what it's got is it's got it has the

75

00:03:06,690  -->  00:03:08,550
data and it's got the aesthetics and now on

76

00:03:08,550  -->  00:03:11,550
top of it I can put the layer I want, so

77

00:03:11,550  -->  00:03:15,300
I can say what was this? This was a points or

78

00:03:15,300  -->  00:03:17,160
I can say, I can use the same object and

79

00:03:17,160  -->  00:03:19,380
I can say I want lines this time. It's a

80

00:03:19,380  -->  00:03:22,200
P+, can you guess what it will be? Geom

81

00:03:22,200  -->  00:03:25,980
underscore line correct, so brackets and

82

00:03:25,980  -->  00:03:29,250
now if I run this line, viola I know it

83

00:03:29,250  -->  00:03:31,560
doesn't make sense at all this line so

84

00:03:31,560  -->  00:03:35,430
completely meaningless plot but the

85

00:03:35,430  -->  00:03:36,930
concept stays the same

86

00:03:36,930  -->  00:03:40,770
we just used P so the object and

87

00:03:40,770  -->  00:03:43,260
overlaid it which already contained is

88

00:03:43,260  -->  00:03:46,830
it's supercharged with the data, the

89

00:03:46,830  -->  00:03:50,580
aesthetics so XY color and size and now

90

00:03:50,580  -->  00:03:52,470
we're just overlaying a geometry and as

91

00:03:52,470  -->  00:03:53,850
you can see here the lines

92

00:03:53,850  -->  00:03:55,110
some of them are thinner some of them a

93

00:03:55,110  -->  00:03:57,660
wider and that is because we've got the

94

00:03:57,660  -->  00:03:59,610
size, aesthetic and also the colors are

95

00:03:59,610  -->  00:04:01,980
different and so on. So that is what

96

00:04:01,980  -->  00:04:03,540
plotting with layers is and actually

97

00:04:03,540  -->  00:04:07,110
taking a step even further, we can say

98

00:04:07,110  -->  00:04:11,760
multiple layers right? We can say P +

99

00:04:11,760  -->  00:04:15,660
geom underscore point and then plus

100

00:04:15,660  -->  00:04:18,690
geom underscore line. How about that?

101

00:04:18,690  -->  00:04:20,880
We run that, you'll see that there are

102

00:04:20,880  -->  00:04:23,640
dots and there are lines and of course you

103

00:04:23,640  -->  00:04:25,020
can't really see the dots here because

104

00:04:25,020  -->  00:04:26,250
the lines are on top

105

00:04:26,250  -->  00:04:29,640
them so let's take that and will change

106

00:04:29,640  -->  00:04:34,350
the order. We'll just say P + geom line,

107

00:04:34,350  -->  00:04:38,910
then plus geom point. Around that now you

108

00:04:38,910  -->  00:04:40,350
can see the dots better because they're

109

00:04:40,350  -->  00:04:42,540
on top of the lines and once again even

110

00:04:42,540  -->  00:04:44,160
though this is a completely meaningless

111

00:04:44,160  -->  00:04:46,980
visualization, the concept remains the

112

00:04:46,980  -->  00:04:49,470
same. We're plotting with layers, layer on

113

00:04:49,470  -->  00:04:50,820
top of the layer, on top of the layer and

114

00:04:50,820  -->  00:04:53,820
that's how GGplot works. So go ahead and

115

00:04:53,820  -->  00:04:55,770
try experimenting with that,

116

00:04:55,770  -->  00:04:57,900
see what you can come up with and maybe

117

00:04:57,900  -->  00:05:00,300
change around the P object and just

118

00:05:00,300  -->  00:05:02,669
give it a go and kind of get used to the

119

00:05:02,669  -->  00:05:04,500
concept of layers because we'll be using it

120

00:05:04,500  -->  00:05:06,870
a lot about the section and moreover it

121

00:05:06,870  -->  00:05:08,550
will be very important in your work with

122

00:05:08,550  -->  00:05:10,470
R going forward, and I look forward to

123

00:05:10,470  -->  00:05:23,559
seeing you next time, until then happy coding.
