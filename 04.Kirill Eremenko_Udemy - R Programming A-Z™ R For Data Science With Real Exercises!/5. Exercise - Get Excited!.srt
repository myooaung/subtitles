1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:10,590
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:10,590  -->  00:00:12,240
R programming and the first question

3

00:00:12,240  -->  00:00:14,070
you probably have on your mind right now

4

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:17,550
is, Kirill why is there a huge timer right

5

00:00:17,550  -->  00:00:18,779
in the middle of the screen?

6

00:00:18,779  -->  00:00:20,369
Well I'll tell you, the reason for this

7

00:00:20,369  -->  00:00:22,230
timer is that I'm super-excited about

8

00:00:22,230  -->  00:00:23,910
you taking this course. I don't want to

9

00:00:23,910  -->  00:00:25,920
get you excited about taking this course

10

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:28,529
completing it and finally mastering R

11

00:00:28,529  -->  00:00:30,900
programming and in order to do that I'm

12

00:00:30,900  -->  00:00:32,820
going to illustrate what a powerful tool

13

00:00:32,820  -->  00:00:35,070
R is and what amazing insights you can

14

00:00:35,070  -->  00:00:36,809
derive with some just some basic

15

00:00:36,809  -->  00:00:38,910
knowledge of R in under seven minutes.

16

00:00:38,910  -->  00:00:41,730
So let's dive straight into it, the first

17

00:00:41,730  -->  00:00:43,530
thing that you'll need is a browser and

18

00:00:43,530  -->  00:00:47,579
in your browser, go to www.superdatascience.com/rcouse

19

00:00:47,579  -->  00:00:49,950
and this is the page where

20

00:00:49,950  -->  00:00:52,379
all the data sets for this course are

21

00:00:52,379  -->  00:00:54,329
stored and if you scroll down you'll

22

00:00:54,329  -->  00:00:56,010
find the one that we need is under

23

00:00:56,010  -->  00:00:57,210
Section 1,

24

00:00:57,210  -->  00:00:59,039
it's called miss price diamonds. So go

25

00:00:59,039  -->  00:01:00,660
ahead and download that and that way

26

00:01:00,660  -->  00:01:02,280
you'll be able to follow along with the

27

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:04,170
code in your own computer and have the

28

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:06,330
same insight on your own machine.

29

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:08,100
Alright so we have just six minutes to

30

00:01:08,100  -->  00:01:10,920
go, let's explore the data set. Here we've

31

00:01:10,920  -->  00:01:13,560
got three columns, one is carat, the next

32

00:01:13,560  -->  00:01:15,990
one is clarity and price and these are

33

00:01:15,990  -->  00:01:18,299
all diamonds. Every row represents a new

34

00:01:18,299  -->  00:01:21,689
diamond and carat is its weight, clarity

35

00:01:21,689  -->  00:01:23,909
is its clarity and price is the price at

36

00:01:23,909  -->  00:01:26,130
which it was sold and if you scroll down

37

00:01:26,130  -->  00:01:28,170
you'll see that this data set has a lot

38

00:01:28,170  -->  00:01:31,320
of transactions, in fact over 50,000

39

00:01:31,320  -->  00:01:34,439
transactions in just this one data set

40

00:01:34,439  -->  00:01:37,710
which makes it pretty big and so what

41

00:01:37,710  -->  00:01:38,700
are we doing today?

42

00:01:38,700  -->  00:01:40,860
Well let's look at this cla.. clarity

43

00:01:40,860  -->  00:01:42,720
over here. We've got some abbreviations

44

00:01:42,720  -->  00:01:44,939
and these abbreviations are explained in

45

00:01:44,939  -->  00:01:47,310
this chart on the right. So you can see

46

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:49,740
that the eyes mean that there are some

47

00:01:49,740  -->  00:01:51,990
inclusions in the data set and in the

48

00:01:51,990  -->  00:01:55,350
head in the diamond and met it isn't a

49

00:01:55,350  -->  00:01:58,500
pure and then you've got less inclusions

50

00:01:58,500  -->  00:02:00,540
less inclusion and less inclusion and it

51

00:02:00,540  -->  00:02:02,909
would make sense right that diamonds

52

00:02:02,909  -->  00:02:05,130
that are clearer are priced higher,

53

00:02:05,130  -->  00:02:06,960
should be priced higher than diamonds

54

00:02:06,960  -->  00:02:09,149
that are less clear at the same weight

55

00:02:09,149  -->  00:02:11,160
and carats, and what we're going to be

56

00:02:11,160  -->  00:02:13,650
investigating today is does this

57

00:02:13,650  -->  00:02:15,450
relationship between price and clarity

58

00:02:15,450  -->  00:02:17,790
always hold true. Now we won't be looking

59

00:02:17,790  -->  00:02:19,890
at individual diamonds per se, but we're

60

00:02:19,890  -->  00:02:21,629
going to be looking at is the statistical

61

00:02:21,629  -->  00:02:24,239
averages for clarity. So we're going to

62

00:02:24,239  -->  00:02:27,959
want to investigate, does a better

63

00:02:27,959  -->  00:02:30,359
clarity always mean that the diamond is

64

00:02:30,359  -->  00:02:31,739
going to be priced high or does that

65

00:02:31,739  -->  00:02:34,650
relationship sometimes not hold true and

66

00:02:34,650  -->  00:02:37,349
are there miss pricings in the market? It's

67

00:02:37,349  -->  00:02:38,849
going to be pretty exciting and with

68

00:02:38,849  -->  00:02:40,379
50,000 roads, it's going to be pretty

69

00:02:40,379  -->  00:02:42,510
challenging but with the help of R,

70

00:02:42,510  -->  00:02:44,099
we'll get there very quickly. We only have

71

00:02:44,099  -->  00:02:45,329
four and a half minutes to go

72

00:02:45,329  -->  00:02:48,030
let's dive straight into R studio. Now

73

00:02:48,030  -->  00:02:50,040
I'm going to type in some code and just

74

00:02:50,040  -->  00:02:51,870
follow along and I won't explain

75

00:02:51,870  -->  00:02:55,409
everything in this one tutorial but you

76

00:02:55,409  -->  00:02:56,819
will definitely learn all of this

77

00:02:56,819  -->  00:02:59,040
throughout the course. So type in my

78

00:02:59,040  -->  00:03:01,530
data read csv and then file choose

79

00:03:01,530  -->  00:03:03,329
in brackets and run this line by

80

00:03:03,329  -->  00:03:05,129
pressing control enter on windows or

81

00:03:05,129  -->  00:03:07,170
command return on a mac, and then we'll

82

00:03:07,170  -->  00:03:08,609
allow you to select the file that you

83

00:03:08,609  -->  00:03:11,579
downloaded. If you located and selected,

84

00:03:11,579  -->  00:03:13,560
what that does is that it lowers your

85

00:03:13,560  -->  00:03:16,739
data into R. Now we're going to, now

86

00:03:16,739  -->  00:03:17,879
that we've loaded the data. We're going to

87

00:03:17,879  -->  00:03:20,370
install a package and this package will

88

00:03:20,370  -->  00:03:22,230
help us visualize the data set, it's called

89

00:03:22,230  -->  00:03:25,049
GGPlot2, so let's run that line what

90

00:03:25,049  -->  00:03:26,430
you'll see is R studio is going to

91

00:03:26,430  -->  00:03:28,650
start downloading this package from the

92

00:03:28,650  -->  00:03:30,690
internet and installing it on to machine

93

00:03:30,690  -->  00:03:32,609
so it's taking a while to think over

94

00:03:32,609  -->  00:03:34,680
there and there you can see the download

95

00:03:34,680  -->  00:03:38,220
has started its downloading this package

96

00:03:38,220  -->  00:03:40,079
and all of its components to install

97

00:03:40,079  -->  00:03:41,519
into the machine and we're here in the

98

00:03:41,519  -->  00:03:44,310
packages tab, you'll see that now we have

99

00:03:44,310  -->  00:03:46,500
GGPlot2, just appeared over there.

100

00:03:46,500  -->  00:03:48,090
So now we're going to activate the

101

00:03:48,090  -->  00:03:50,220
package by clicking at this check box.

102

00:03:50,220  -->  00:03:52,019
Alright, so three minutes left we're

103

00:03:52,019  -->  00:03:53,430
halfway there already.

104

00:03:53,430  -->  00:03:55,799
Let's call the function called GGPlot,

105

00:03:55,799  -->  00:03:57,510
and we're going to pass it's some variables.

106

00:03:57,510  -->  00:04:00,989
Data equals my data then X we're

107

00:04:00,989  -->  00:04:03,299
going to say aesthetics and for

108

00:04:03,299  -->  00:04:05,069
aesthetics we're going to x equals

109

00:04:05,069  -->  00:04:08,669
carat and y equals price. So we're going

110

00:04:08,669  -->  00:04:10,799
to create a scatterplot and here we're

111

00:04:10,799  -->  00:04:14,909
going to say plus, we want to add points

112

00:04:14,909  -->  00:04:16,109
right? We want to say that we want to

113

00:04:16,109  -->  00:04:17,579
have a scatterplot so we're going to say

114

00:04:17,579  -->  00:04:19,889
geom point. So if you run into these two

115

00:04:19,889  -->  00:04:23,159
lines together now geom pointed toward

116

00:04:23,159  -->  00:04:23,969
the bottom part.

117

00:04:23,969  -->  00:04:26,430
There we go, in a rush alright so if we

118

00:04:26,430  -->  00:04:27,360
run these two together

119

00:04:27,360  -->  00:04:30,810
now you will see that here we've

120

00:04:30,810  -->  00:04:33,750
got the scatterplot for the diamond, so

121

00:04:33,750  -->  00:04:35,879
all of the records are illustrated here

122

00:04:35,879  -->  00:04:37,770
and it already looks pretty interesting

123

00:04:37,770  -->  00:04:39,599
but at this stage it doesn't tell us

124

00:04:39,599  -->  00:04:41,610
much because we don't have our third

125

00:04:41,610  -->  00:04:43,229
variable which is clarity here. So let's

126

00:04:43,229  -->  00:04:44,909
add it in, gonna put this on a new

127

00:04:44,909  -->  00:04:46,770
line to make some space and here I'm

128

00:04:46,770  -->  00:04:49,830
going to say color equals clarity and

129

00:04:49,830  -->  00:04:51,900
now if I run these three lines together

130

00:04:51,900  -->  00:04:54,060
you'll see that the data set, the

131

00:04:54,060  -->  00:04:55,740
plot is going to change. It's going to

132

00:04:55,740  -->  00:04:58,650
include clarity and we have a legend on

133

00:04:58,650  -->  00:05:01,169
the right here so now already we can

134

00:05:01,169  -->  00:05:02,610
see that some diamonds are priced higher,

135

00:05:02,610  -->  00:05:04,590
some diamonds are price low. That's a great

136

00:05:04,590  -->  00:05:07,080
start but the scatterplot is quite

137

00:05:07,080  -->  00:05:08,939
cluttered and we got all these points on

138

00:05:08,939  -->  00:05:10,379
the right that are not statistically

139

00:05:10,379  -->  00:05:11,430
significant.

140

00:05:11,430  -->  00:05:13,590
So first of all, let's make it less clear

141

00:05:13,590  -->  00:05:16,259
have more clear will say alpha for some

142

00:05:16,259  -->  00:05:19,560
transparency equals 0.1 if we run this

143

00:05:19,560  -->  00:05:21,180
and we check the time

144

00:05:21,180  -->  00:05:24,750
one minute 45 seconds alright so we've

145

00:05:24,750  -->  00:05:27,419
made some improvements. We can already

146

00:05:27,419  -->  00:05:29,939
see the where there's a lot of data and

147

00:05:29,939  -->  00:05:31,500
with this little data, and now we're

148

00:05:31,500  -->  00:05:33,300
going to filter out everything to the

149

00:05:33,300  -->  00:05:35,909
right of this line two and a half carats

150

00:05:35,909  -->  00:05:37,319
because it's not statistically

151

00:05:37,319  -->  00:05:39,240
significant. It's not going to help us or what.

152

00:05:39,240  -->  00:05:41,370
So you will learn how to filter inside

153

00:05:41,370  -->  00:05:43,050
the course but for now just type in my

154

00:05:43,050  -->  00:05:45,419
data dollars sign carat less than 2.5

155

00:05:45,419  -->  00:05:48,690
comma nothing and if you run that that

156

00:05:48,690  -->  00:05:50,759
will filter your data set and leave only

157

00:05:50,759  -->  00:05:52,349
the two and a half carats and below.

158

00:05:52,349  -->  00:05:54,210
Alright and the last thing that we need

159

00:05:54,210  -->  00:05:58,349
here is geom smooth, so let's add the

160

00:05:58,349  -->  00:06:00,389
smoothers so that we can see the

161

00:06:00,389  -->  00:06:03,300
averages for these different carats. I'm

162

00:06:03,300  -->  00:06:06,210
going to make some space here so that we

163

00:06:06,210  -->  00:06:08,610
can see the chart very nicely. Alright we won't

164

00:06:08,610  -->  00:06:10,469
need the code that much, so there we go

165

00:06:10,469  -->  00:06:12,270
let's see how much time 57 seconds.

166

00:06:12,270  -->  00:06:15,240
Okay time to derive insights, beautiful!

167

00:06:15,240  -->  00:06:17,219
That's exactly what we're after so here

168

00:06:17,219  -->  00:06:20,099
you can see that the lines should be in

169

00:06:20,099  -->  00:06:24,539
this order. So Brown is the the best

170

00:06:24,539  -->  00:06:26,699
clarity and then this rate is the worst

171

00:06:26,699  -->  00:06:27,990
quality, so they should be in this order

172

00:06:27,990  -->  00:06:29,520
all the time. But whenever they're

173

00:06:29,520  -->  00:06:31,139
crossing each other, that means there is

174

00:06:31,139  -->  00:06:32,759
mispricing. So you've got some mispricing

175

00:06:32,759  -->  00:06:34,830
over here, these lines shouldn't be crossing

176

00:06:34,830  -->  00:06:37,380
like that and then you've got some

177

00:06:37,380  -->  00:06:40,289
mispricing over here right? So some of

178

00:06:40,289  -->  00:06:41,190
the lines are crossing

179

00:06:41,190  -->  00:06:43,290
over there and some of the lines

180

00:06:43,290  -->  00:06:45,300
are crossing over here at the low prices

181

00:06:45,300  -->  00:06:47,400
as well. So as we get to the right, you

182

00:06:47,400  -->  00:06:50,130
can see that the confidence bounce are getting

183

00:06:50,130  -->  00:06:51,840
greater, so that we have less confidence

184

00:06:51,840  -->  00:06:53,880
about what's actually going on because

185

00:06:53,880  -->  00:06:56,550
of the data set but nevertheless we can

186

00:06:56,550  -->  00:06:58,980
already tell where what is going on and

187

00:06:58,980  -->  00:07:01,110
you can see how the diamonds are being

188

00:07:01,110  -->  00:07:02,970
purchased at one carat, one and a half

189

00:07:02,970  -->  00:07:05,850
carat, one and half carat over there, point

190

00:07:05,850  -->  00:07:09,480
seven carats, point five and so on. So there

191

00:07:09,480  -->  00:07:11,850
we go, just on time, time expired.

192

00:07:11,850  -->  00:07:15,240
We have derived some great insights from

193

00:07:15,240  -->  00:07:18,150
this data set it was very very quick and

194

00:07:18,150  -->  00:07:20,040
as you can see R is a super powerful

195

00:07:20,040  -->  00:07:21,960
tools. Just a few a couple of lines of

196

00:07:21,960  -->  00:07:23,430
code we were able to build this

197

00:07:23,430  -->  00:07:25,590
beautiful visualization which we can

198

00:07:25,590  -->  00:07:27,270
then take to the client or to our

199

00:07:27,270  -->  00:07:30,360
managers and explain what exactly what's

200

00:07:30,360  -->  00:07:31,890
going on in the data set.

201

00:07:31,890  -->  00:07:33,930
Alright as you can see, it was all

202

00:07:33,930  -->  00:07:35,730
step-by-step we slowly build this

203

00:07:35,730  -->  00:07:37,590
visualization and that is exactly how

204

00:07:37,590  -->  00:07:39,030
this course is organized you will learn

205

00:07:39,030  -->  00:07:41,850
our step-by-step improving every

206

00:07:41,850  -->  00:07:44,340
tutorial one skill at a time and learning

207

00:07:44,340  -->  00:07:46,500
a lot and I can't wait to see inside the

208

00:07:46,500  -->  00:07:48,870
next section. I look forward to seeing

209

00:07:48,870  -->  00:07:51,419
inside the first tutorial and until then

210

00:07:51,419  -->  00:08:02,819
happy coding.
