00:00:02.430  -->  00:00:07.290
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07.290  -->  00:00:09.450
R programming. Today we're going to

3

00:00:09.450  -->  00:00:11.130
have the project brief and we're going

4

00:00:11.130  -->  00:00:12.810
to download the data set. So what is a

5

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:14.640
project this time? The project is a

6

00:00:14.640  -->  00:00:17.310
demographic analysis, very interesting

7

00:00:17.310  -->  00:00:19.560
let's see what we've got here. You are

8

00:00:19.560  -->  00:00:21.510
employed as a data scientist by the

9

00:00:21.510  -->  00:00:23.700
world bank and you are working on a

10

00:00:23.700  -->  00:00:25.470
project to analyze the world's

11

00:00:25.470  -->  00:00:27.810
demographic trends. You are required to

12

00:00:27.810  -->  00:00:29.279
produce a scatter plot illustrating

13

00:00:29.279  -->  00:00:31.949
birth rate and internet usage statistics

14

00:00:31.949  -->  00:00:34.739
by country. The scatterplot needs to also

15

00:00:34.739  -->  00:00:37.350
be categorized by country's income

16

00:00:37.350  -->  00:00:38.340
groups.

17

00:00:38.340  -->  00:00:39.540
Ok interesting, very interesting

18

00:00:39.540  -->  00:00:41.520
combination they're trying to analyze

19

00:00:41.520  -->  00:00:45.840
birth rate and internet usage so soon

20

00:00:45.840  -->  00:00:48.000
what will that lead to? Does is there any

21

00:00:48.000  -->  00:00:49.890
dependency there? Is there any

22

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:51.809
correlation? What you think? Alright

23

00:00:51.809  -->  00:00:54.510
we'll find out in this section,

24

00:00:54.510  -->  00:00:56.670
so where do we get the data set for the

25

00:00:56.670  -->  00:01:00.239
section? Well just like usually, we need

26

00:01:00.239  -->  00:01:04.229
to go to www.superdatascience.com/rcourse

27

00:01:04.229  -->  00:01:08.040
one word and here if you scroll down

28

00:01:08.040  -->  00:01:10.890
to section 5, data frames and

29

00:01:10.890  -->  00:01:12.780
then the file you download is called

30

00:01:12.780  -->  00:01:14.310
demographic data and this one over here

31

00:01:14.310  -->  00:01:17.820
it's a CSV file. Also you can download

32

00:01:17.820  -->  00:01:20.610
the section 5 a challenge if you like

33

00:01:20.610  -->  00:01:22.590
that the presentation that we went

34

00:01:22.590  -->  00:01:24.869
through just now and also there's

35

00:01:24.869  -->  00:01:26.880
another file but you don't need it just

36

00:01:26.880  -->  00:01:29.430
yet. You can download it but don't open it

37

00:01:29.430  -->  00:01:31.590
yet we will look at it later on. Alright

38

00:01:31.590  -->  00:01:33.840
so what's this demographic data? The

39

00:01:33.840  -->  00:01:36.060
demographic data is a CSV file and the

40

00:01:36.060  -->  00:01:38.610
CSV stands for comma separated values

41

00:01:38.610  -->  00:01:42.720
and all it is is just data in text

42

00:01:42.720  -->  00:01:44.549
format separated by comma so i opened it

43

00:01:44.549  -->  00:01:47.430
with excel and if you don't have excel

44

00:01:47.430  -->  00:01:49.829
that's okay you can open it was just a

45

00:01:49.829  -->  00:01:52.259
text editor that's totally fine and you

46

00:01:52.259  -->  00:01:53.880
will see pretty much the same thing. A

47

00:01:53.880  -->  00:01:56.909
good text editor is notepad + +, but

48

00:01:56.909  -->  00:01:59.100
otherwise excel is good. So here we've

49

00:01:59.100  -->  00:02:01.170
got five columns, country name, country

50

00:02:01.170  -->  00:02:04.229
code, birth rate, internet users and income

51

00:02:04.229  -->  00:02:06.390
group. So what we need to visualize is

52

00:02:06.390  -->  00:02:09.509
these two in a scatter plot and also

53

00:02:09.509  -->  00:02:12.269
categorize it by the income group of

54

00:02:12.269  -->  00:02:14.370
that country. We don't really care that

55

00:02:14.370  -->  00:02:15.750
much about the country name

56

00:02:15.750  -->  00:02:17.790
and the country code because it is kind

57

00:02:17.790  -->  00:02:19.230
of like a statistical approach so we're

58

00:02:19.230  -->  00:02:20.970
not analyzing individual countries we

59

00:02:20.970  -->  00:02:23.160
want to see the overall trend, what's

60

00:02:23.160  -->  00:02:24.960
going on in the world that's what the

61

00:02:24.960  -->  00:02:27.780
World Bank is about about analyzing

62

00:02:27.780  -->  00:02:29.970
these stats and seeing what kind of

63

00:02:29.970  -->  00:02:31.830
things are going on in the world right

64

00:02:31.830  -->  00:02:34.709
now what trends there are. Now what is what do

65

00:02:34.709  -->  00:02:35.700
these numbers mean?

66

00:02:35.700  -->  00:02:38.040
Well birth rate so let's start with internet

67

00:02:38.040  -->  00:02:40.170
users. It's a bit easier, it's basically the

68

00:02:40.170  -->  00:02:42.630
percentage of people using internet in

69

00:02:42.630  -->  00:02:44.550
that country, so how many out of a

70

00:02:44.550  -->  00:02:46.890
hundred people have access to internet?

71

00:02:46.890  -->  00:02:50.430
78%, 78.9% in Aruba, 5.9%

72

00:02:50.430  -->  00:02:54.330
in Afghanistan, 19.1% in Angola and

73

00:02:54.330  -->  00:02:58.470
so on and this data is for 2012 because

74

00:02:58.470  -->  00:03:01.140
that's the latest that the world bank

75

00:03:01.140  -->  00:03:04.290
had for all of these combined statistics

76

00:03:04.290  -->  00:03:07.230
and birthrate. Well, it's a bit more

77

00:03:07.230  -->  00:03:10.290
complicated but in essence in order like

78

00:03:10.290  -->  00:03:12.900
the general description of birth-rate.

79

00:03:12.900  -->  00:03:15.209
This statistic is that if you take a

80

00:03:15.209  -->  00:03:17.760
thousand people in this country for

81

00:03:17.760  -->  00:03:20.910
instance in Argentina how many new

82

00:03:20.910  -->  00:03:23.400
people will be born in that same country

83

00:03:23.400  -->  00:03:25.380
in that in one year?

84

00:03:25.380  -->  00:03:27.420
So in that year and it's measured

85

00:03:27.420  -->  00:03:29.190
somewhere mid-year so that there's some

86

00:03:29.190  -->  00:03:30.570
more specifics to it but basically

87

00:03:30.570  -->  00:03:32.370
that's a the main idea that you take a

88

00:03:32.370  -->  00:03:34.140
thousand people and per thousand people

89

00:03:34.140  -->  00:03:36.510
how many new people are born in that

90

00:03:36.510  -->  00:03:40.230
country and so basically if you add on

91

00:03:40.230  -->  00:03:42.810
any migration like people immigrating

92

00:03:42.810  -->  00:03:44.910
into the country and emigrating out of the

93

00:03:44.910  -->  00:03:47.489
country then that will give you the

94

00:03:47.489  -->  00:03:49.680
change in population for you but all we are

95

00:03:49.680  -->  00:03:52.170
interested in here is birth rate. So

96

00:03:52.170  -->  00:03:53.730
basically want to see if there's any

97

00:03:53.730  -->  00:03:57.090
dependency or association between birth

98

00:03:57.090  -->  00:03:59.310
rate and internet users as they like any

99

00:03:59.310  -->  00:04:02.070
visible correlation that we'll see on the

100

00:04:02.070  -->  00:04:04.049
chart. So that's what we'll be doing in

101

00:04:04.049  -->  00:04:06.060
this section of the course and we'll get

102

00:04:06.060  -->  00:04:07.680
started right away in the next tutorial.

103

00:04:07.680  -->  00:04:09.420
I look forward to seeing you there and

104

00:04:09.420  -->  00:04:21.740
until next time, happy coding.
