00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:06.810
Hello and a warm welcome to the course

2

00:00:06.810  -->  00:00:08.670
in R programming. In this tutorial, I

3

00:00:08.670  -->  00:00:10.889
will show you how to install R and our

4

00:00:10.889  -->  00:00:12.660
studio onto your computer.

5

00:00:12.660  -->  00:00:14.759
Alright to get started, we need to go

6

00:00:14.759  -->  00:00:19.109
to the website, we found a www.cran.r-project.org

7

00:00:19.109  -->  00:00:23.310
and this is the

8

00:00:23.310  -->  00:00:25.410
website where you can download R. Now

9

00:00:25.410  -->  00:00:27.570
select the machine that you're using. I'm going

10

00:00:27.570  -->  00:00:28.980
to be using a mac throughout these

11

00:00:28.980  -->  00:00:31.590
tutorials but you can also download the

12

00:00:31.590  -->  00:00:33.719
Windows version here and everything we

13

00:00:33.719  -->  00:00:35.579
talked about will also work for the

14

00:00:35.579  -->  00:00:37.440
windows version and now let's go ahead

15

00:00:37.440  -->  00:00:40.680
and download the correct file. So just select the

16

00:00:40.680  -->  00:00:43.230
option that you like and then you'll be

17

00:00:43.230  -->  00:00:46.469
presented with some packages, usually

18

00:00:46.469  -->  00:00:48.989
it's the one just at the very top. So

19

00:00:48.989  -->  00:00:53.160
let's go ahead and download that, you'll

20

00:00:53.160  -->  00:00:56.309
see it's going to take a few minutes

21

00:00:56.309  -->  00:00:59.160
because it's quite a large package 69

22

00:00:59.160  -->  00:01:03.180
nearly 17 megabytes so let's just fast

23

00:01:03.180  -->  00:01:05.990
forward until it's downloaded.

24

00:01:05.990  -->  00:01:07.759
Alright so the file has been downloaded,

25

00:01:07.759  -->  00:01:10.549
got over here by the way I wanted to

26

00:01:10.549  -->  00:01:11.810
show you that if you're having trouble

27

00:01:11.810  -->  00:01:13.520
downloading the file from right here

28

00:01:13.520  -->  00:01:15.439
there's a button on the left called

29

00:01:15.439  -->  00:01:17.899
mirrors and if you click that button you

30

00:01:17.899  -->  00:01:21.020
can select a different location from

31

00:01:21.020  -->  00:01:22.729
where this file will be downloaded and

32

00:01:22.729  -->  00:01:24.590
maybe you'll find something closer to

33

00:01:24.590  -->  00:01:27.770
you and yeah so if you having trouble

34

00:01:27.770  -->  00:01:31.700
just check out this mirrors button. And now

35

00:01:31.700  -->  00:01:33.439
we're going to proceed with installing

36

00:01:33.439  -->  00:01:36.500
the file, so once again I'm on a mac on

37

00:01:36.500  -->  00:01:38.509
the windows computer this might look a

38

00:01:38.509  -->  00:01:41.659
little bit different but the whole

39

00:01:41.659  -->  00:01:43.490
concept is the same which is basically

40

00:01:43.490  -->  00:01:47.630
installed are on your computer.

41

00:01:47.630  -->  00:01:52.310
Ok install for all users, there we go.

42

00:01:52.310  -->  00:01:54.140
It was quite a quick installation, just

43

00:01:54.140  -->  00:01:56.450
maybe a minute or two and now we're

44

00:01:56.450  -->  00:01:59.360
going to close and now R is installed,

45

00:01:59.360  -->  00:02:05.270
right? So if I look for R, you'll see

46

00:02:05.270  -->  00:02:07.039
that I have R over here and I can

47

00:02:07.039  -->  00:02:09.200
launch R. I'm going to do that just to

48

00:02:09.200  -->  00:02:13.459
demonstrate what R actually is. We've

49

00:02:13.459  -->  00:02:15.560
got this R console here and you can

50

00:02:15.560  -->  00:02:17.959
already start programming R in here,

51

00:02:17.959  -->  00:02:20.060
but the thing is that it is a console

52

00:02:20.060  -->  00:02:22.130
and it's not very convenient. It's not

53

00:02:22.130  -->  00:02:24.799
very nice to work in a console like this.

54

00:02:24.799  -->  00:02:26.150
So what we're going to do is we're going

55

00:02:26.150  -->  00:02:28.910
to close this and we're going to install

56

00:02:28.910  -->  00:02:32.090
R studio on top of that. R studio

57

00:02:32.090  -->  00:02:34.459
will be like like a shell on top of the

58

00:02:34.459  -->  00:02:37.549
console to which we'll make our work much

59

00:02:37.549  -->  00:02:40.160
more convenient and pleasant in R. So

60

00:02:40.160  -->  00:02:41.900
the website you need to go to,

61

00:02:41.900  -->  00:02:44.090
let me reload this page and the website you need to

62

00:02:44.090  -->  00:02:49.280
go to is www.rstudio.com and if

63

00:02:49.280  -->  00:02:51.410
you go to this website, here you can get R

64

00:02:51.410  -->  00:02:54.200
studio. It's a completely free software. So

65

00:02:54.200  -->  00:02:55.970
what you need to do is go to products

66

00:02:55.970  -->  00:03:00.200
and here select R studio. Now here, we

67

00:03:00.200  -->  00:03:02.389
can just download R studio desktop,

68

00:03:02.389  -->  00:03:08.450
that's the one we want and download R

69

00:03:08.450  -->  00:03:10.519
studio desktop open source that's the

70

00:03:10.519  -->  00:03:11.209
one we want.

71

00:03:11.209  -->  00:03:14.120
So here once again, you will need to

72

00:03:14.120  -->  00:03:16.639
select your machine type, windows or mac.

73

00:03:16.639  -->  00:03:18.540
I'm going to select mac

74

00:03:18.540  -->  00:03:21.750
and this is another 60 megabytes so

75

00:03:21.750  -->  00:03:24.299
let's give this some time to download as

76

00:03:24.299  -->  00:03:25.079
well.

77

00:03:25.079  -->  00:03:26.519
Alright, so the file has been downloaded

78

00:03:26.519  -->  00:03:29.519
and now let's go ahead and install R

79

00:03:29.519  -->  00:03:33.629
studio. So I'm going to bring to

80

00:03:33.629  -->  00:03:39.299
double-click R studio and just open it

81

00:03:39.299  -->  00:03:43.109
up and as easy as that, so your

82

00:03:43.109  -->  00:03:44.370
installation process might take longer

83

00:03:44.370  -->  00:03:46.739
because I did originally have R studio

84

00:03:46.739  -->  00:03:49.650
on my computer installed, but

85

00:03:49.650  -->  00:03:51.810
nevertheless once you're done with the

86

00:03:51.810  -->  00:03:54.480
installation you will get R studio

87

00:03:54.480  -->  00:03:56.819
which looks something like this.

88

00:03:56.819  -->  00:03:58.500
Alright, now that we're in R studio,

89

00:03:58.500  -->  00:03:59.879
there's two things that we need to do.

90

00:03:59.879  -->  00:04:02.400
First we're going to set up how R

91

00:04:02.400  -->  00:04:05.400
studio looks. So I'm going to expand this

92

00:04:05.400  -->  00:04:08.609
to full screen mode and I'm going to go

93

00:04:08.609  -->  00:04:11.430
into the settings. On all windows you can see,

94

00:04:11.430  -->  00:04:13.590
this might be in a different location on

95

00:04:13.590  -->  00:04:16.320
a mac pc, you need to go to R studio

96

00:04:16.320  -->  00:04:18.209
and preferences. In Windows PC, it would

97

00:04:18.209  -->  00:04:20.130
also be somewhere at the top so if you

98

00:04:20.130  -->  00:04:21.690
go into preferences,

99

00:04:21.690  -->  00:04:22.979
what do you want to do is we want to

100

00:04:22.979  -->  00:04:25.650
change the appearance. So right now, it's

101

00:04:25.650  -->  00:04:27.840
very white and I find that when you

102

00:04:27.840  -->  00:04:30.000
program a lot it's a bit too bright like

103

00:04:30.000  -->  00:04:32.639
that, like your eyes can get tired so I

104

00:04:32.639  -->  00:04:34.830
prefer a different appearance. Here in

105

00:04:34.830  -->  00:04:38.340
appearance, you can select the type you

106

00:04:38.340  -->  00:04:39.810
like. So there's lots of different styles

107

00:04:39.810  -->  00:04:42.240
and is a preview over here. First I'm

108

00:04:42.240  -->  00:04:44.400
going to increase the font size to maybe

109

00:04:44.400  -->  00:04:48.120
something 14 and here on the right you

110

00:04:48.120  -->  00:04:50.520
can see a small preview of what it will

111

00:04:50.520  -->  00:04:52.740
look like. So let's try try applying that

112

00:04:52.740  -->  00:04:55.169
one. As you can see it's nice and a dark

113

00:04:55.169  -->  00:04:58.620
and that will from my experience, once

114

00:04:58.620  -->  00:05:00.120
again everybody is different from my

115

00:05:00.120  -->  00:05:02.520
experience it will allow your eyes to to rest so

116

00:05:02.520  -->  00:05:04.320
have a look at the different options

117

00:05:04.320  -->  00:05:06.030
that you have. My third one is the

118

00:05:06.030  -->  00:05:08.370
cobbled one and I'm going to stick to

119

00:05:08.370  -->  00:05:11.159
that and maybe actually I will increase

120

00:05:11.159  -->  00:05:14.159
the font even a little bit more. Okay

121

00:05:14.159  -->  00:05:15.960
and the other thing that I would like to

122

00:05:15.960  -->  00:05:19.500
do is after we click ok here, I would

123

00:05:19.500  -->  00:05:21.840
like to follow the very traditional

124

00:05:21.840  -->  00:05:23.430
approach to learning a programming

125

00:05:23.430  -->  00:05:25.979
language where you first, your very first

126

00:05:25.979  -->  00:05:28.800
program is a hello world program. So

127

00:05:28.800  -->  00:05:29.990
let's go ahead and

128

00:05:29.990  -->  00:05:32.750
create one of those. In order to create a

129

00:05:32.750  -->  00:05:34.550
new script, click the button up at the

130

00:05:34.550  -->  00:05:37.940
top over here and select R script and

131

00:05:37.940  -->  00:05:40.280
this brings up a fourth window over here

132

00:05:40.280  -->  00:05:44.810
and now you can type in your code. So

133

00:05:44.810  -->  00:05:46.310
what we want is we want to create a program

134

00:05:46.310  -->  00:05:49.070
that will say hello world and then the

135

00:05:49.070  -->  00:05:50.870
message will appear here. So let's go

136

00:05:50.870  -->  00:05:52.580
ahead and do that in R is actually

137

00:05:52.580  -->  00:05:54.470
very very simple. All you have to do is

138

00:05:54.470  -->  00:05:56.780
open up quotation marks and as you can

139

00:05:56.780  -->  00:05:58.160
see R closes them for you

140

00:05:58.160  -->  00:06:00.020
automatically so you don't forget and

141

00:06:00.020  -->  00:06:02.300
inside these quotation marks and type in

142

00:06:02.300  -->  00:06:06.860
Hello world! Now we're going to save

143

00:06:06.860  -->  00:06:08.930
this program, so click this button save

144

00:06:08.930  -->  00:06:13.040
and give it a name. So my first R

145

00:06:13.040  -->  00:06:17.690
script, save and now in order to run this

146

00:06:17.690  -->  00:06:20.870
line make sure your carriage is on this

147

00:06:20.870  -->  00:06:23.240
line and then go and click this button

148

00:06:23.240  -->  00:06:26.270
up the top run and there you go.

149

00:06:26.270  -->  00:06:29.420
Congratulations! That is your very very

150

00:06:29.420  -->  00:06:33.260
first R script. You have just printed

151

00:06:33.260  -->  00:06:35.270
out the phrase hello world on your

152

00:06:35.270  -->  00:06:37.100
screen and even though this might seem

153

00:06:37.100  -->  00:06:38.960
as a small accomplishment, it's a very

154

00:06:38.960  -->  00:06:41.990
big step towards learning R

155

00:06:41.990  -->  00:06:44.420
programming and once again I welcome you

156

00:06:44.420  -->  00:06:46.010
into this course. We're going to have a

157

00:06:46.010  -->  00:06:49.460
lot of fun along the way and you will

158

00:06:49.460  -->  00:06:51.530
learn tons in this course I can promise

159

00:06:51.530  -->  00:06:53.990
you that right now. And I look forward to

160

00:06:53.990  -->  00:06:55.430
seeing throughout the lectures and until

161

00:06:55.430  -->  00:07:07.019
next time, happy coding.
