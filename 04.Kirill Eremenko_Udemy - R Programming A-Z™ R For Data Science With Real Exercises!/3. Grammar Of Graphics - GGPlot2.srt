00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:07,230
Hello and welcome back to the course in

2

00:00:07,230  -->  00:00:09,210
R programming. I'm very glad that you

3

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:11,280
got this far in the course and as you

4

00:00:11,280  -->  00:00:13,320
can already probably tell from my voice

5

00:00:13,320  -->  00:00:15,120
I'm super excited about today's tutorial.

6

00:00:15,120  -->  00:00:17,010
Today we're talking about the grammar of

7

00:00:17,010  -->  00:00:18,930
graphics and in line with the topic I've

8

00:00:18,930  -->  00:00:21,180
got a very vibrant and colourful

9

00:00:21,180  -->  00:00:23,789
presentation prepared for us so let's

10

00:00:23,789  -->  00:00:25,410
dive straight into it because I can't

11

00:00:25,410  -->  00:00:27,210
wait to show you around.

12

00:00:27,210  -->  00:00:28,830
So what is the grammar of graphics and

13

00:00:28,830  -->  00:00:31,529
where did it all start? Well as the story

14

00:00:31,529  -->  00:00:34,170
goes, it all started back in the 19th

15

00:00:34,170  -->  00:00:36,809
century. Here we've got a map, a map which

16

00:00:36,809  -->  00:00:39,540
illustrates the French campaign or

17

00:00:39,540  -->  00:00:42,210
Napoleon's campaign against Russia back

18

00:00:42,210  -->  00:00:46,230
in 1812 and this map was created by a

19

00:00:46,230  -->  00:00:49,890
gentleman named Charles Minar and he

20

00:00:49,890  -->  00:00:53,579
created it around 1869 and what it's

21

00:00:53,579  -->  00:00:55,770
showing is how the French troops started

22

00:00:55,770  -->  00:00:57,780
over here even by just looking at it you

23

00:00:57,780  -->  00:00:59,550
can probably already guess what it's talking

24

00:00:59,550  -->  00:01:02,280
about but just like going to interlude

25

00:01:02,280  -->  00:01:04,199
of detail like the French troops started

26

00:01:04,199  -->  00:01:06,810
over here on the border of Poland and

27

00:01:06,810  -->  00:01:10,020
then they went went went got all the way

28

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:13,110
to Moscow turned around and went back so

29

00:01:13,110  -->  00:01:15,150
after I told you that,

30

00:01:15,150  -->  00:01:17,040
now you can already even just by looking

31

00:01:17,040  -->  00:01:18,659
at it you can regather so much

32

00:01:18,659  -->  00:01:21,299
information from here. You can see the

33

00:01:21,299  -->  00:01:23,220
how many, how many troops there were so

34

00:01:23,220  -->  00:01:26,040
they started at 422 thousand men by the

35

00:01:26,040  -->  00:01:27,750
time they got to Moscow is a hundred thousand

36

00:01:27,750  -->  00:01:29,250
men and when they got back it was only

37

00:01:29,250  -->  00:01:32,909
4,000 men. You can see how they split, how

38

00:01:32,909  -->  00:01:34,799
the army split at certain points in time. You

39

00:01:34,799  -->  00:01:37,140
can see the direction of travel. You can

40

00:01:37,140  -->  00:01:40,110
see which cities they went past and you

41

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:41,579
can even see the temperature so on the

42

00:01:41,579  -->  00:01:43,320
way back you've got the temperature here

43

00:01:43,320  -->  00:01:46,920
and here it's it's a bit of a different

44

00:01:46,920  -->  00:01:50,100
scale but in terms of Celsius and

45

00:01:50,100  -->  00:01:52,799
Fahrenheit that it got asks over here

46

00:01:52,799  -->  00:01:54,090
they called this point was around minus

47

00:01:54,090  -->  00:01:57,750
thirty.. 38 degrees Celsius and minus 35

48

00:01:57,750  -->  00:01:59,850
degrees Fahrenheit. So it was very cold

49

00:01:59,850  -->  00:02:02,549
when they were returning and yeah so

50

00:02:02,549  -->  00:02:04,920
that wasn't in their favor at all.

51

00:02:04,920  -->  00:02:06,990
So we can see a lot of information

52

00:02:06,990  -->  00:02:10,170
from this one picture and in fact

53

00:02:10,170  -->  00:02:13,160
Charles Minar was able to depict

54

00:02:13,160  -->  00:02:16,160
six different types of data in a

55

00:02:16,160  -->  00:02:18,320
two-dimensional image so here we can see

56

00:02:18,320  -->  00:02:20,330
the number of troops, the distance they

57

00:02:20,330  -->  00:02:23,240
traveled, the temperature, the latitude

58

00:02:23,240  -->  00:02:25,490
and longitude, the direction of travel

59

00:02:25,490  -->  00:02:27,650
and also the time. So here you've got

60

00:02:27,650  -->  00:02:29,810
some dates over here so you know when

61

00:02:29,810  -->  00:02:32,330
they were there. So that is an incredible

62

00:02:32,330  -->  00:02:34,850
amount of information all-in-one

63

00:02:34,850  -->  00:02:36,590
two-dimensional picture and that's where

64

00:02:36,590  -->  00:02:38,870
it all started that's where of course

65

00:02:38,870  -->  00:02:40,130
you didn't call the grammar of graphics,

66

00:02:40,130  -->  00:02:42,350
grammar of graphics came later and so it's

67

00:02:42,350  -->  00:02:44,600
actually a book that was written in 1999

68

00:02:44,600  -->  00:02:47,210
and if you if you find the original

69

00:02:47,210  -->  00:02:49,490
hardcover it will have this image on top of

70

00:02:49,490  -->  00:02:52,550
it but he started the whole concept of

71

00:02:52,550  -->  00:02:55,070
layering your image so you can see here

72

00:02:55,070  -->  00:02:56,660
that there's lots of different layers

73

00:02:56,660  -->  00:02:59,000
and lots of different not just layers

74

00:02:59,000  -->  00:03:00,620
but also done a different types of

75

00:03:00,620  -->  00:03:02,660
elements to image. There's the data,

76

00:03:02,660  -->  00:03:04,100
there's some aesthetics which we'll talk

77

00:03:04,100  -->  00:03:07,280
about. There's some geometries, there's some

78

00:03:07,280  -->  00:03:09,470
schematics and so on there's lots of

79

00:03:09,470  -->  00:03:11,420
elements to an image and even though you

80

00:03:11,420  -->  00:03:13,160
don't think of it in that way that's

81

00:03:13,160  -->  00:03:14,450
what constitutes an image and that's

82

00:03:14,450  -->  00:03:15,320
exactly what we're going to be talking

83

00:03:15,320  -->  00:03:16,580
about. We're going to be talking about

84

00:03:16,580  -->  00:03:18,709
how to create charts that tell a story

85

00:03:18,709  -->  00:03:20,630
and one of the main components of them.

86

00:03:20,630  -->  00:03:23,900
So let's move on to the next slide, a

87

00:03:23,900  -->  00:03:27,380
chart or a layer on a chart will consist

88

00:03:27,380  -->  00:03:29,690
of the data obviously.

89

00:03:29,690  -->  00:03:32,630
Aesthetics and aesthetics are things we

90

00:03:32,630  -->  00:03:35,840
see, so they can be like you might have

91

00:03:35,840  -->  00:03:38,240
some some information in your data so it

92

00:03:38,240  -->  00:03:41,600
might be a number like the revenue or an

93

00:03:41,600  -->  00:03:44,060
expense or some like the number of

94

00:03:44,060  -->  00:03:45,980
popula, number of people but you can't

95

00:03:45,980  -->  00:03:48,320
see a number on a chart. You might you

96

00:03:48,320  -->  00:03:50,300
might see an x-axis. That's an aesthetic, we

97

00:03:50,300  -->  00:03:52,160
might see a color, a color is an aesthetic

98

00:03:52,160  -->  00:03:54,260
or the size is an aesthetic. Things you can't

99

00:03:54,260  -->  00:03:56,780
actually see. Then there's geometries so

100

00:03:56,780  -->  00:03:59,330
the size of what? Or the color of what?

101

00:03:59,330  -->  00:04:01,640
Is it a circle? Is it a square or is it

102

00:04:01,640  -->  00:04:03,890
is it a dot or is it a line? So those are

103

00:04:03,890  -->  00:04:06,680
geometries, so that's only if those three

104

00:04:06,680  -->  00:04:09,230
elements are absolutely necessary for

105

00:04:09,230  -->  00:04:11,450
you to create a chart. You have to have

106

00:04:11,450  -->  00:04:14,780
data. You have to have a way to translate

107

00:04:14,780  -->  00:04:16,850
the data into things you see which are

108

00:04:16,850  -->  00:04:19,280
aesthetics and you have to also explain

109

00:04:19,280  -->  00:04:21,440
how there's aesthetics which forms the

110

00:04:21,440  -->  00:04:22,850
aesthetics are going to take, what geometries.

111

00:04:22,850  -->  00:04:25,460
Ok on top of that, you can have

112

00:04:25,460  -->  00:04:26,930
additional layers. You can have another

113

00:04:26,930  -->  00:04:28,970
layer which is statistics. So you might

114

00:04:28,970  -->  00:04:30,860
make transformations to a data to

115

00:04:30,860  -->  00:04:33,520
create new variables and visualize them.

116

00:04:33,520  -->  00:04:35,830
They're in charge might have facets and

117

00:04:35,830  -->  00:04:37,360
we'll talk about facets in a bit more

118

00:04:37,360  -->  00:04:39,220
detailed going further down in this

119

00:04:39,220  -->  00:04:40,810
tutorial but basically facets are

120

00:04:40,810  -->  00:04:44,650
multiple of the same chart based on some

121

00:04:44,650  -->  00:04:47,259
category or so like if you have many

122

00:04:47,259  -->  00:04:48,789
different years then you might have the

123

00:04:48,789  -->  00:04:50,919
same chart for every year. Then you might

124

00:04:50,919  -->  00:04:53,680
have coordinates right? So you're is your

125

00:04:53,680  -->  00:04:56,020
chart in normal coordinates like XY

126

00:04:56,020  -->  00:04:58,690
coordinates or is your chart and pull

127

00:04:58,690  -->  00:05:00,250
the coordinates or do you want to zoom

128

00:05:00,250  -->  00:05:02,169
in or do you want to zoom out of your chart and

129

00:05:02,169  -->  00:05:04,000
things like that. So after everything is

130

00:05:04,000  -->  00:05:06,250
built, we'll you actually see it and

131

00:05:06,250  -->  00:05:08,770
finally there's a theme so theme is all

132

00:05:08,770  -->  00:05:10,330
the other stuff that goes in your chart

133

00:05:10,330  -->  00:05:12,340
so things that make your chart pretty

134

00:05:12,340  -->  00:05:15,460
and even like this might all seem very

135

00:05:15,460  -->  00:05:18,639
overwhelming at first like 7 layers of

136

00:05:18,639  -->  00:05:20,590
information on a chart, you never

137

00:05:20,590  -->  00:05:22,720
thought of it this way and personally I

138

00:05:22,720  -->  00:05:25,000
was a bit confused at the first time

139

00:05:25,000  -->  00:05:28,419
when I saw this. But don't get scared

140

00:05:28,419  -->  00:05:29,590
because right now we're going to go

141

00:05:29,590  -->  00:05:31,930
through all of this one all these layers

142

00:05:31,930  -->  00:05:35,169
one by one on the real example and it'll

143

00:05:35,169  -->  00:05:36,940
all make sense. So let's jump straight

144

00:05:36,940  -->  00:05:39,430
into it. Here we've got a chart, a chart

145

00:05:39,430  -->  00:05:41,289
which will actually create in this

146

00:05:41,289  -->  00:05:42,849
section of the course which looks pretty

147

00:05:42,849  -->  00:05:45,909
cool right and it's showing some data on

148

00:05:45,909  -->  00:05:48,009
a movie distribution, movie budget

149

00:05:48,009  -->  00:05:50,349
distribution so you've got a y-axis at

150

00:05:50,349  -->  00:05:52,960
the bottom which shows the budget in the

151

00:05:52,960  -->  00:05:54,310
millions of dollars and then the number

152

00:05:54,310  -->  00:05:57,400
of movies that were produced at that

153

00:05:57,400  -->  00:06:01,630
budget between the years 2007-2011 and

154

00:06:01,630  -->  00:06:03,520
then you've also got genre. So it looks

155

00:06:03,520  -->  00:06:04,840
like a pretty straightforward chart when

156

00:06:04,840  -->  00:06:06,490
you think about it that way, but now

157

00:06:06,490  -->  00:06:08,139
we're going to go through it layer by

158

00:06:08,139  -->  00:06:10,180
layer and see all those things that we

159

00:06:10,180  -->  00:06:12,190
just talked about right? So let's get

160

00:06:12,190  -->  00:06:14,860
started, here are our layers so where's

161

00:06:14,860  -->  00:06:15,430
the data?

162

00:06:15,430  -->  00:06:17,169
Well first of all you can't see the data.

163

00:06:17,169  -->  00:06:19,630
You can see objects on the chart,

164

00:06:19,630  -->  00:06:21,219
you can actually see the numbers you can

165

00:06:21,219  -->  00:06:23,229
see the data that was given to you. The data is

166

00:06:23,229  -->  00:06:24,279
somewhere else, somewhere in the

167

00:06:24,279  -->  00:06:26,349
background. So you've got the data

168

00:06:26,349  -->  00:06:27,789
and the data that was used for this

169

00:06:27,789  -->  00:06:29,979
specific chart is the movie name, the

170

00:06:29,979  -->  00:06:32,529
budget and the genre and notice that we

171

00:06:32,529  -->  00:06:34,000
can't even see the movie name some

172

00:06:34,000  -->  00:06:36,400
anywhere here so this part of the

173

00:06:36,400  -->  00:06:37,960
data was not even used. We can see

174

00:06:37,960  -->  00:06:40,270
the budget and we can see the genre so

175

00:06:40,270  -->  00:06:41,319
that's the data.

176

00:06:41,319  -->  00:06:43,060
Where are the aesthetics? Well aesthetics

177

00:06:43,060  -->  00:06:45,039
again you can't see them. Aesthetics are

178

00:06:45,039  -->  00:06:46,849
things like the

179

00:06:46,849  -->  00:06:48,649
mapping of your data to the chart.

180

00:06:48,649  -->  00:06:51,020
That's like the intermediate step and

181

00:06:51,020  -->  00:06:53,449
how what aesthetics are using? Well we're

182

00:06:53,449  -->  00:06:56,449
using the x-axis over here and the fill,

183

00:06:56,449  -->  00:07:00,860
so the color basically of these bars and

184

00:07:00,860  -->  00:07:03,679
aesthetics basically means how is the

185

00:07:03,679  -->  00:07:06,529
data map? So how's this map to these

186

00:07:06,529  -->  00:07:10,520
values, so in our case budget is x value

187

00:07:10,520  -->  00:07:13,159
and genre is the field we can see over

188

00:07:13,159  -->  00:07:15,319
here and then we get to geometry so

189

00:07:15,319  -->  00:07:17,360
we're what I mean when I say we can't do

190

00:07:17,360  -->  00:07:18,679
the data, we can't see the aesthetics

191

00:07:18,679  -->  00:07:21,830
because up to now we for all we know,

192

00:07:21,830  -->  00:07:23,809
this could be circles or these could be

193

00:07:23,809  -->  00:07:25,429
triangles it could be lines we don't

194

00:07:25,429  -->  00:07:28,490
know what geometry this these objects

195

00:07:28,490  -->  00:07:30,709
would take so that's when the geometries

196

00:07:30,709  -->  00:07:33,259
layer comes in and now yes we can

197

00:07:33,259  -->  00:07:36,259
actually see that their bars or boxes

198

00:07:36,259  -->  00:07:38,689
you can think of them as boxes and that

199

00:07:38,689  -->  00:07:41,269
is all of the basic building block those

200

00:07:41,269  -->  00:07:43,909
three layers are absolutely necessary to

201

00:07:43,909  -->  00:07:45,259
create a chart.

202

00:07:45,259  -->  00:07:47,300
Alright statistics so where can we see

203

00:07:47,300  -->  00:07:49,399
statistics here, that's that's our

204

00:07:49,399  -->  00:07:51,979
geometry and now let's move on to statistics.

205

00:07:51,979  -->  00:07:54,529
Where can we see statistics here? Well in

206

00:07:54,529  -->  00:07:57,379
this case our geometries and statistics

207

00:07:57,379  -->  00:07:59,119
are actually combined because we're

208

00:07:59,119  -->  00:08:01,519
creating a a bar chart which is not just

209

00:08:01,519  -->  00:08:03,319
a bar chart is the distribution right? It's

210

00:08:03,319  -->  00:08:05,479
a histogram and when we're creating this

211

00:08:05,479  -->  00:08:08,329
histogram. We're running a statistic so

212

00:08:08,329  -->  00:08:10,579
we're grouping our data which has

213

00:08:10,579  -->  00:08:13,909
like 500 rows and we're grouping

214

00:08:13,909  -->  00:08:17,719
these 500 rows by some column, by genre

215

00:08:17,719  -->  00:08:20,569
so we're saying how many movies fall into

216

00:08:20,569  -->  00:08:22,639
the genre of action? How many movies fall

217

00:08:22,639  -->  00:08:24,229
into the genre of comedy? So that is

218

00:08:24,229  -->  00:08:26,119
radius statistical transformation of our

219

00:08:26,119  -->  00:08:27,979
data and we're creating a new

220

00:08:27,979  -->  00:08:30,169
variable which is the count variable for

221

00:08:30,169  -->  00:08:32,269
every genre which is basically not even

222

00:08:32,269  -->  00:08:34,039
present in our data, so we creating a new

223

00:08:34,039  -->  00:08:36,649
variable and we're visualizing it and that is

224

00:08:36,649  -->  00:08:38,329
order statistical transformation is all

225

00:08:38,329  -->  00:08:40,399
about. It's about doing something to

226

00:08:40,399  -->  00:08:43,039
existing data to create new variables

227

00:08:43,039  -->  00:08:44,660
that you're going to visualize so in

228

00:08:44,660  -->  00:08:46,370
this case our geometries and statistics

229

00:08:46,370  -->  00:08:49,850
work together to create this bar chart

230

00:08:49,850  -->  00:08:52,490
which is also histogram. Then facets,

231

00:08:52,490  -->  00:08:53,959
we're going to skip facets for now. We're

232

00:08:53,959  -->  00:08:55,370
going to move onto straight to corners

233

00:08:55,370  -->  00:08:57,709
because I'll show facets after we get

234

00:08:57,709  -->  00:08:59,480
through all these just so that

235

00:08:59,480  -->  00:09:00,250
we don't

236

00:09:00,250  -->  00:09:02,230
over complicate the chart. So

237

00:09:02,230  -->  00:09:04,540
coordinates what is that? Well it's the

238

00:09:04,540  -->  00:09:05,770
coordinates that we have. We got an

239

00:09:05,770  -->  00:09:08,410
x-axis and y-axis and also you can see

240

00:09:08,410  -->  00:09:10,360
that this chart is actually zoomed in so

241

00:09:10,360  -->  00:09:12,220
you can see that we we can't see the top

242

00:09:12,220  -->  00:09:14,350
of this chart so obviously it goes

243

00:09:14,350  -->  00:09:16,300
further there somewhere maybe up to a

244

00:09:16,300  -->  00:09:18,850
hundred or even further but we have

245

00:09:18,850  -->  00:09:21,010
zoomed in and so that is part of the

246

00:09:21,010  -->  00:09:22,840
coordinates layer so we're not only we

247

00:09:22,840  -->  00:09:24,820
select that we want XY coordinates we

248

00:09:24,820  -->  00:09:27,040
don't want polar coordinates or we don't

249

00:09:27,040  -->  00:09:29,320
want a world map or something else. We

250

00:09:29,320  -->  00:09:31,150
want just XY coordinates plus we want to

251

00:09:31,150  -->  00:09:33,760
zoom in into this part of the chart so

252

00:09:33,760  -->  00:09:35,590
everything to do with how you observe

253

00:09:35,590  -->  00:09:37,540
your data that is coordinates and

254

00:09:37,540  -->  00:09:39,280
finally the theme, what is the theme?

255

00:09:39,280  -->  00:09:41,440
Well the theme is everything else you

256

00:09:41,440  -->  00:09:42,850
see on the chart, that is not related to the

257

00:09:42,850  -->  00:09:44,890
data. You've got the title over here

258

00:09:44,890  -->  00:09:47,320
right? So we could have done without the

259

00:09:47,320  -->  00:09:50,500
title then we've got the color of the

260

00:09:50,500  -->  00:09:53,950
X&amp;Y axis labels and the size of the text

261

00:09:53,950  -->  00:09:56,050
you've got the size of the text of your

262

00:09:56,050  -->  00:09:58,960
tick marks and you've got the legend so

263

00:09:58,960  -->  00:10:01,630
not just the size of the legend but also

264

00:10:01,630  -->  00:10:04,060
the positioning of the legend, the size

265

00:10:04,060  -->  00:10:05,920
of the text of the legend, the size of

266

00:10:05,920  -->  00:10:07,630
the title of the Legend and all those

267

00:10:07,630  -->  00:10:09,220
things. So all of these things that make

268

00:10:09,220  -->  00:10:10,930
the chart look pretty and in fact they

269

00:10:10,930  -->  00:10:12,910
have a name, they are called non-data ink so

270

00:10:12,910  -->  00:10:14,980
they're completely not related to the

271

00:10:14,980  -->  00:10:16,480
data but they're still present in

272

00:10:16,480  -->  00:10:18,820
the form of ink on your chart.

273

00:10:18,820  -->  00:10:20,740
Alright so those are the six elements

274

00:10:20,740  -->  00:10:23,290
and facets let's just quickly look at

275

00:10:23,290  -->  00:10:26,290
facets that's a facets basically means if

276

00:10:26,290  -->  00:10:28,660
you had instead of this one chart if you

277

00:10:28,660  -->  00:10:30,610
have a chart like that for every year so on

278

00:10:30,610  -->  00:10:31,870
the right here, you can see that there's

279

00:10:31,870  -->  00:10:34,030
multiple years and basically that's what

280

00:10:34,030  -->  00:10:36,010
fascinates means. That's faceting your chart

281

00:10:36,010  -->  00:10:38,530
and that's how all these seven layers

282

00:10:38,530  -->  00:10:41,170
work. It doesn't necessarily have to be

283

00:10:41,170  -->  00:10:44,440
in exactly that order so some, from

284

00:10:44,440  -->  00:10:46,630
some books or from some other sources

285

00:10:46,630  -->  00:10:49,300
you might find that these layers are put

286

00:10:49,300  -->  00:10:50,980
into different orders personally this is

287

00:10:50,980  -->  00:10:53,080
my interpretation of everything. This is how I

288

00:10:53,080  -->  00:10:55,780
best understand it so feel free to look

289

00:10:55,780  -->  00:10:57,730
around and maybe your own understanding

290

00:10:57,730  -->  00:11:01,810
of GGplot2 and a grammar of graphics

291

00:11:01,810  -->  00:11:04,270
will be a bit different but in essence

292

00:11:04,270  -->  00:11:06,520
those are the seven layers that you require or

293

00:11:06,520  -->  00:11:08,110
that are required to create a beautiful

294

00:11:08,110  -->  00:11:10,540
stunning visualization and we're going

295

00:11:10,540  -->  00:11:12,490
to go through them one by one in this

296

00:11:12,490  -->  00:11:13,360
section of the course

297

00:11:13,360  -->  00:11:15,700
and I can't wait to jump into it. I hope

298

00:11:15,700  -->  00:11:17,529
you enjoyed this presentation and I look

299

00:11:17,529  -->  00:11:19,420
forward to seeing you next time, until then

300

00:11:19,420  -->  00:11:31,169
happy coding.
