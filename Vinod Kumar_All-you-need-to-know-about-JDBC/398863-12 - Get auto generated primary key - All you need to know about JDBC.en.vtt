X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.050
in the sector.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.780
Let's look into a very unique scenario where we may have a table that contains a auto

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.230
generated primary key on.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.740
Then we want to insert the record without asking the user toe.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.760
Enter the idea for that.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.400
So I have a table here called customers where ideas a primary care off integer type.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.350
But it is also an auto increment.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.730
I remember this feature is a back and feature,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.300
which means that some other babies may not provide on demand problem in a different way.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.190
For example,

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.030
in Microsoft SQL Server,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.630
this is called.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.320
I didn't recede in H two and my Ask your colorist auto underscore increment in Article one

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.270
of this feature,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.050
but we use an object called sequence toe.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.810
Bring in the same concept so you may have to tweak your application logic accordingly.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.770
But assuming that you're backing has a support for auto increment like this,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.700
let's say we have a first name,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.750
which is mandatory,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.500
so you cannot miss this.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.070
If you're not passing the value,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.340
then it will be an editor.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.030
However,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.680
I can miss the last name.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.270
No problem.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.280
It will be in Saturday's Nall email is minded.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.520
Read is not known,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.980
but city is optional because there is a default value off Bangla.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.750
So if I except only first name on email and insert the record,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.220
I really should be originated First name via supplying Last name is gonna be no email were

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.900
supplying on City is supposed to be Bangla So let's copy this entire SQL Command Onda,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.850
go over here based and then click the run button toe create the actual table.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.750
So we have this stable.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.160
Now,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.940
of course,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.200
there is no record over here because we just created right now.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.820
But we want to see how to insert record without the i d.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.580
Our city for that.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.140
Let me clear this and then type your insert in tow customers and then give the name of the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.590
column that I want to supply.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.660
So they're forced to name as the last email these the only two columns I want to supply.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.910
And then I say values for the first name and email our letter I give here.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.290
We know on email as we know.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.410
We know dot co onda semicolon.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.660
Run this You will not see.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.100
It says one row inserted,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.960
but it will take your select star from customers.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.770
Andi,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.980
select this and then click this run selected.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.270
You'll see that because inserted the ideas one last name as know what city as bangle.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.960
So this is the skill command that we want toe executive from our Jello program.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.100
And not only that,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.720
we want to see what is the idea generated.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.060
So that's most important for us.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.630
So we want to not only ask the back and to insert the idea automatically,

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.860
but we also want to ask the back and to give you that opportunity.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.250
90.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.790
Let's go back great clips and clear the New Jolla class.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.950
I'm gonna right click on package New Class.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.090
Let's call it us.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.640
Insert new customer at a public static y me click.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.730
Finish getting off this studio.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.550
Let's full screen this and then first,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.500
let's create the SQL Command.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.870
So which is nothing but insert in tow customers.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.250
But the columns are first name.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.860
You may also want to ask the last name in this case and then the email.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.890
We don't want to accept the I.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.880
D and city because we want toe assume that the city is Bangla or and I did our degenerated

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.880
.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.310
So you have to give now three question marks because we are mentioning three columns over

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.800
here.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.030
Let's put a semi colon that's also accept the values for first name,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.940
last name and email.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.610
Let's try your string first Name that call it F name equals tow cable util dot Get string

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.360
that there in the first name on.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.880
Similarly,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.970
I'm gonna copy and paste this and say last name Over here,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.500
this is L name on this is supposed to be last name based One more time and then this is

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.610
gonna be email.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.640
Let's call.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.570
This is enter your email address Now that we have accepted,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.520
let's try inserting the same now while inserting is very simple because we just have toe

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.150
call the executor update function of the prepared statement.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.910
But what is important is we want to return the artery generative ideals.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.710
Now for this demo,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.720
I don't want to read the try catch block.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.170
You know how that works by reading a trivet resources block.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.290
So I'm gonna simply say you're throws exception.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.550
So let's throw all exceptions from here.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.050
The first thing I want is their connection.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.300
Con equals toe de beautiful,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.850
dark get connections.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.890
So we got the connection.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.150
Let's import the same.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.430
But the way you create the prepared statement this time is prepared.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:00.500
Statement S T e m p equals toe con dot prepare statement on You can see here The second

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.650
variant says you give me an a skill.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.650
You also mention whether our Trojan Ricky should be fetched or not.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.440
So if you select that,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.350
you'll see a bit of documentation over here on the auto generated key,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.760
basically or to say return generated keys are no generated.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.660
Case of this section will explain you.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.180
What are the options we have?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.180
You have only two options by default.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.150
It doesn't get any generated keys,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.550
but we want to get the auto generated case.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.570
So the way you do is now you select this SQL,

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.240
which is our insert commander Beer guard on here.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.570
He heard a typed statement dot You say return generated keys.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.720
Now this is an individual that's a flag on.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.760
That tells that whenever an SQL command is executive and if that happens to be an insert on

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.940
that automatically generates the primary key,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.500
we also have to return the primary key at the same time.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.740
So you send in a skill in circumvent.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.850
But in Britain it would have also fetch the generated primary key value.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.250
So let's import the prepared statement.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.690
And now we have to say s t empty dot set string because we have all the three of them are

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.410
strings.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.480
The first question mark is nothing but the F name.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:24.330
The second question mark is nothing but the l name on the third question mark is email.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.400
Now we have it ready.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.450
We can simply say s t empty dot execute update.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.270
No,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.580
it is the return value here is in.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.680
But don't confuse that for the idea generator.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.790
This is nothing but the number of rows that got inserted in this case.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.950
It's going to be one because we're not inciting a batch of reckons.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.320
It's just one single record.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.090
But after this is executed,

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.650
if it is successful now we can say s t empty dot get generated keys,

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.670
which Retton's results said.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.710
And I can simply call it us keys.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.380
Since cases not declared,

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.480
it's giving me another.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.370
I can press command one our control one on windows,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.730
and it has cleared a local variable called keys I noticed that Keyes is nothing with the

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.590
result set,

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.950
and we saw how results it works.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.610
So this will now be the list off on the primary keys that generated for all the insert

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.390
statements that you sent in case you feel sent multiple values over here,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.010
for example,

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.010
I would have sent five different records,

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.590
dated of gendered at five different ideas.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.400
But in our case,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.570
we sent only one set of records,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.650
so obviously it would have got a single record over here.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:45.800
All I have to do is to say if keyes dot next so mood a car pointed the next to record

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.820
available on the only record that's available in that record.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.460
There's a single column which is a primary key value on I simply helped type your int idea

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.690
cause Tau kee start get int off one.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.710
We don't know the name of the column here,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.230
so we simply have to give one because there's only one single column in dissenter results

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.250
it and then I can type your system 10.0 dot print Ellen,

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:16.780
we say your new customer added with I d plus I d.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.020
And then we can simply come out of all the than before that we can close the results that

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.980
close the statement,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.190
close the connection.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.030
Of course.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.470
Anyway,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.730
this program is actually going toe exit,

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.230
and and Jeremy itself is gonna quit.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.320
So ideally,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.600
you do the clothes resources over here.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.050
I'm not doing that for this.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.540
Sick of simplicity.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.470
So let's try toe run this on.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.710
I'm gonna enter a couple of values that say,

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.410
I'm gonna type your sham on Say,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:46.060
Sunder,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:52.600
let's type the email s sham cinder at example dot com I pressed.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.180
Enter.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.130
You can see it says new customer added with I need to let me run this again.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.560
I'm gonna type here,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.300
say,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:06.480
John Doe And then I say John Doe at example dot com First enter,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.650
you can teach us new customer added with I d treat.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:15.290
So if I go back to the browser and then say select star from customers run the selected one

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.290
,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.710
you can see that the primary keys have been automatically generated,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.880
as expected,
