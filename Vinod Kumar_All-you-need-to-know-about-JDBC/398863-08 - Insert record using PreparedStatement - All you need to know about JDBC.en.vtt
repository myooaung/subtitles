00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
let me create a new job class for this demo.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.940
I right click on my package New class.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.520
Let's name the classes.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.890
Insert Ricard using prepared statement.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.530
That's also are the public static wide main Click finish.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.220
Let's get it up this total once again.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.280
Like in the previous example,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.000
we would like toa except values from the user.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.730
So I'm gonna copy that section.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.960
So these are the variables that I want except from the user.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.320
I will copy that Onda based.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.080
Over here,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.030
however,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.240
the skill command is a little bit different than the previous one.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.930
So let's create a string.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.750
SQL equals two insert in tow.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.930
Prado's and then is a values question mark for each off the columns that we have and I have

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.320
five problems for which are collected.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.290
The values already and these question marks are called perimeters notice.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.830
This is not an actual SQL command.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.800
So if you try to copy this command and execute on hitch to client,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.870
this will fade.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.280
But this is going to be a cent from the Jolla program to the actual age to rid of its

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.200
server and David get pre compiled and kept in user session Whenever we have data,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.090
we have to send the data instead of the actual SQL Command.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.920
To do that,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.200
let's create a try,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.560
catch,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410
block and in the catch block.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.420
I want toe handle All exceptions and the way I want to handle is by printing its stack

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.840
Chris.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.300
And in here,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.450
let's create a couple of variables.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.420
The number one variable is the connection.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.510
Con equals toe debut till dark.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.430
Get connection.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.540
We need to import connection.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.560
So I'm gonna press command,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.820
shift off on Windows Control shift ball and then prepared statement s T and T equals toe

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.760
conduct prepared statement and notice.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.910
We need to supply the skill command at this point in time.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.950
So the actual called to the D.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.100
V.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.300
Sir,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.310
what happens at this point in time by sending an SQL command without values Onda that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.020
command gets pre compiling stored in the server on we simply get a reference or some kind

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.910
of an ivy back over here.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.510
So that S t empty.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.390
Contains a reference to the three.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.640
Compile still command on the federal side.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.920
On using that,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.250
I can send these values to the server,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.370
so we also need toe import prepared statement from SQL Package.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.150
Let's do that.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.430
And now I have your s t empty dot Execute notice that I can use executive or executive

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.320
update our even execute quietly,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.300
depending on the kind of statement that we have.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.640
One thing that you can observe here is that I'm not sending the actual SQL Command unlike

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.820
the previous example.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.260
If you go to the previous program over here,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.810
you can see when I call the executor update I had to supply the SQL Command.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.080
But as here,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.780
the Eskil Command has already been separated the server and it's in the pre compiled format

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.780
.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.130
When we do this,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.880
it is now going toe execute on the server side.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.290
But we haven't supplied the values yet,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.330
so this would be an error in orderto send the values before calling the executor update

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.800
human help.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.390
It's a s t empty dot and then call one of the set functions.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.970
Now,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.390
since I want to set the value for this first question mark,

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.440
which is an individual,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.440
we have a set int and then we say 14 Question mark.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.180
Number one.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.850
This is not a zero based index.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.980
This is a one based index here.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.150
So we say column number one should be supplied with i d Similarly,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.570
I can say s tempted or set string.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.230
And then I supply here column number two and then I give the value for that which is

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.230
variable name.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.260
Similarly I can now say S t empty Lord Sex String Param Eter number three,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.010
which is the caution factory?

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.680
This is supposed to be our description.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.210
STM did or said String off Param Eter number four.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.510
The value is category on one last S T empty door said double the column number five.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.130
The value is price.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.250
So whenever we want to call this executor update at this point in time,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.740
the statement object already contains the values for the missing perimeters over here.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.800
So the values get sent to the server and the server will now take this values and associate

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.810
with the insert statement,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.950
which is already combined.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.530
And then it will execute the actual SQL Command.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.290
If there is no other it's gonna come out on,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.250
we can print a message over here.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.940
System that or don't print Ellen.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.800
Let's call it as data inserted and in case often other,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.670
it will throw an exception which we have already handed over here.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.460
So whether there was an exception are no exception.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.120
When you come out of the strike catch block,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.190
both Khan and Esti empty gets closed automatically.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.430
Let's save this and try running the court and insert a new record.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.080
So that's right,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.080
like roundness.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.550
Java application.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.930
So here is the console it's asking for I D.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.030
This time I'm going to give the idea as to let's call it s told she bought laptop.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.700
Let's give some description,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.420
Let's say 1.4 gigahertz speed on.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.110
Let's assume it's going to be our own eight g b off Ram.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.500
Let's press enter.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.910
Give the category as electron ICS once again,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.030
like the previous case on the price,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.060
probably around 25,000 was Kendall.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.970
You can see it,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.550
says data inserted on the program terminated.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.980
So if I go back toe our H two console and select start from products.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.170
If I read on that,

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.840
you'll see that the second record is also inserted.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.510
So let's go back to eclipse.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.590
In the next lecture.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.670
Let's insert multiple records using a batch execution
