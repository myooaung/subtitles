00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.090
in this lecture,

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.570
let's see how we can insert multiple records are,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.300
for that matter,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.040
execute multiple demon statements using batch execution.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.510
So instead,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.930
off calling this executive update function in a loop multiple times we can do a single

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.760
execution outside the loop.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.590
So inside the loop,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.830
we can accept values,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.690
but the actual executor of dead,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.450
we're gonna call only once.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.780
So all the values that we have accepted,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.410
we're gonna send it toe the server at one shot,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.440
thereby avoiding multiple around trips to the back.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.700
And let's create a new Java class by right clicking the package.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.560
New Class Insert multiple records that's also at a public static worried me click finish.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.380
Let's get it off.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.710
The to do over here,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.780
Let me also full screen this time.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.660
This time,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.020
let's create a string SQL first,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.630
which corresponds toe the same insert command like the previous one.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.240
So I say,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.250
insert in tow products values with five cushion months separated by commas.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.750
But the accepting off values were going to do inside a loop.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.160
But before that,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.370
let's also create a try catch block where we're going toe,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.990
create a connection and prepared statement.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.160
We'll also have a catch block for the same toe handle all exceptions only for printing the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.080
stack tress.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.440
So in the try block over here where I have to declare the auto plausible resources,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.300
I'm going to say connection con equals toe debut till dark,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.110
Get connection important and then prepared Statement.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.860
It's t empty equals toe conduct.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.560
Prepare statement off that SQL Command we already have over here.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.160
It's also important prepared statement.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.360
Let's use a while to Luke and in finance look to accept the news again and again.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.620
But then we will also as the user do you want to continue,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.760
and if the user says no,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.340
we're gonna quit the loop for accepting the values.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.630
It's the same thing as the previous two programs.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.120
I'm gonna copy those five lines over here and then based inside the look this time we

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.970
already had the statement ready.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.190
So we're gonna say s t empty dot and then say set int off one,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.230
which is the first question monk and then I really is the value for the same.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.630
This also remains the same thing as the previous programs.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm gonna copy the remaining four lines from here and then paste over here.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.330
Now that we have the values ready instead of executing this at this point in time,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.700
we can simply say,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.140
hey,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.150
are these were used to a batch.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.200
So we're gonna say S t empty,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.670
dark are batch notice that this time the are batches simply going toe collect these values

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.390
into a collection but not doing any thought of communication with the remote server.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.160
Next,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.010
we want to ask the user whether he or she wants to continue.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.210
So I'm gonna pay it here.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.680
A variable string answer equals toe keyboard.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.370
Util dot get sting.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.370
We give a message to the user.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:16.080
Do you wish to on another record and let's the user is supposed to say yes or no And if the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.420
user says no,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.630
so I can't say if answer dot equals ignore case is no.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.450
Then we want toe break the loop.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.210
But if the user type anything other than no,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.210
it simply going to continue on asked another set of values acts the same thing toe the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.460
statements batch and the loop continues again and again until the user breaks the look.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.200
Once we come out of the loop now it's time for us to send the values back to the remote

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.680
server.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.820
So all the values are executive one by one because the Sarwar already has a compiler

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.250
version of this particular command.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.450
All you have to do now used to say,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.350
S T empty dot executive batch.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.020
If everything is OK,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.390
we can now tell the user that all is well.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.510
Some of the system dot out dot print Ellen Records inserted.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.090
Save it on.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.800
Now let's try running this program and see if we can insert multiple records at the same

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.890
time using the batch execution.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.060
So let's right.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.120
Click Rawness Joe application.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.240
Let me also full screen this console,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.580
and I want to insert couple of records.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.920
Let's say the idea is number three.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.990
Let's college guys laptop back description.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.000
Let's call it us American Tourister and then we give you a category.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.920
Let's colored as bags and then the price probably around 2400 enter.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.700
It's going to say,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.500
Do you wish to add another record?

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.330
I can simply press enter because only if it is no,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.150
it's gonna break style Press.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.360
Enter Narragansetts,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.000
asking me one more idee.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.670
Let's say four.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.980
Let's give it a name.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.770
Mobile Charger description letter,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.660
for example,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:10.220
Apple iPhone Charger category again is electron ICS and then the price probably around 1009

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.710
100.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.060
Enter.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.500
So it is going to ask you,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.950
Do we start another record?

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.640
I'll say no this time it doesn't matter whether it type in lowercase,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.240
uppercase and say no annuity.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.650
Know that records inserted on the program exterminated.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.000
If you go now to the edge toe console,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.340
Select stuff on products applicant run.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.520
You will see that two more records have been inserted.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.920
So this is how you can do multiple insert.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.800
Update our village operations in the next lecture,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.450
let's see how we can execute an SQL Select statement and get the values from the database.
