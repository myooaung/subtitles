Humans get localized for so many reasons,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.910
for example,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.860
then devoted to greet someone.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.130

especially to attract the opposite gender during the breeding season.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.730
Their degree of vocalization also varies from breed to breed and certain treated

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.450
