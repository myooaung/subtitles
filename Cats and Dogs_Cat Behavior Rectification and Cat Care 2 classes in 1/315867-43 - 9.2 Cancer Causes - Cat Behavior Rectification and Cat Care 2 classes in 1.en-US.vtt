she may get exposed to a number of stimulus that may trigger abnormalities within the cells

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.350
and does leading to cancel.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.000
For example,

overexposure to sunlight on various different chemicals may induce cancer in her.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.480
Another cause of cancer is vital infections.

feline leukemia virus infection can make a cat susceptible to develop lymphoma,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.270
a type of blood.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.990
Cancel infection.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.500
It's the line.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.850
Immunodeficiency virus can also make a get susceptible to develop.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.450
Cancel.

Besides,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.760
some care said,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.950

skin cancel.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.650

Atriss directs and neck contains ultraviolet traditions,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.100
which can cause dearly mutations in skin cells,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.370

.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.170
In some cases,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.910
the Kansas tumor develops at the site off an injection of various medications like vaccines

antibiotics,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.110
etcetera on.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.340
That is why it can sometimes be called for line injections.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.250
Sites are camo.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.150
Lymphoma is the most common cancer seen in cuts.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.990
It is a type of blood cancel that occurs when violent cells that protect the body from

infection divide uncontrollably.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.000
Feline leukemia virus is one of the leading causes off this cancer in cats,

especially those who are not vaccinated against this fighters.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.750
Breast cancer is also one of the common cancers in camped,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.030
but it can significantly be reduced or even eliminated through Spain on new trim off.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.920
Your cat can actually also developed cancer students in brain,
