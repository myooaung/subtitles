00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
Now let's understand the serious health consequences off this deadly disease.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.560
The infection call spread this virus results and shortage of Weigert,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.960
says Viteri,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.650
involved in body's defense against bacteria and other infection causing microorganisms.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.100
This with a compromised immunity,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.120
their ability to fight diseases decrease,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.950
and they are at a higher risk of bacteria and other infections.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.350
The incubation immediate between exposure to writers till the development off symptoms in a

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.550
cat is less than dentists.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.520
The visible signs that an effective cat made exhibit include depression,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.750
loss of appetite,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.800
high fever,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.150
luck,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.720
RG vomiting,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.230
severe diarrhoea,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.750
nasal discharge and dehydration.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.260
The virus can even damage brain and eyes off the infected.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.410
Kurt Pregnant gets that,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.960
in fact,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.310
it did.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.090
This virus may become in and may even abort if she gives birth to kittens.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.270
The kittens may be born with severe damage to cerebellum,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.090
a part of the brain that coordinates between the nose muscles and the bones to produce body

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.850
movements.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.270
He doesn't also have abnormalities in the rich,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.350
not their eyes.
