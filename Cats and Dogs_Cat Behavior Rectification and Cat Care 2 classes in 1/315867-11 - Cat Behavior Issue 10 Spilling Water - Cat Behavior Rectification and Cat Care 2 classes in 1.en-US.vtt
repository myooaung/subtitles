00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
cats billing water from the water board.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.940
His experience when many of the pet parents strange it may sound,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.590
but there are many reasons why you can't get involved in such an old behavior.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.740
In some cases,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.350
they remove the border from their balls with the help of their posts,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.850
while in other they just flip over the whole water bowl.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.760
In either case,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.710
it's a mess,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.710
which no back parent likes but very know this behavior can be corrected with your patients

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.050
and some easy tips.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.650
Let's first understand,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.990
but I look at practice,

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.350
this water spilling behavior.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.350
This behavior is a part of their natural instincts,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.550
very deep effort to take their food and water to a safe place free from any sort of danger

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.550
.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.650
It is also believed that cats love the reflective surface of photo.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.920
Besides,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.950
the weight splashes when the poor at it gives them an extra incentive to repeat this

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.550
behavior.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.560
Some experts believe that cats prayer for moving water or still and standing water that has

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.950
been kept there for hours and sometimes days,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.850
and that is why many cats splash water before drinking to play the same moving water effect

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.850
.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.600
This is also the exact reason why cats purr for drinking from a running step or the phone t

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.230
one off.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.610
The other reasons that you can't might be spilling water all over the place is to safeguard

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.900
have whiskers cats,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.190
and we don't prefer narrow and deep balls because when they try to drink water from it,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.950
they discuss up against the side of the water bowl.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.680
If you tax ball is narrow and deep,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.520
she might be spilling water so that she can break it from the ground without hurting or

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.050
discuss lower water level in the bowl is another reason for this behavior.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.170
Before being domesticated as pets,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.020
Cat used to live in the white,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.620
where they always have to keep an eye on the surroundings to save guard themselves against

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.350
predators.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.850
So we have a doctor demonstrates,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.580
but still many off their behavior treats example.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.700
With cats living in the white in case the water level is toady.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.600
That cat might not pay for dipping her head to such debts.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.320
As then.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.950
She won't be able to keep an eye on the surroundings,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.050
and that is why Medicaid spring water on the moon surface for ground to drink it from there

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.050
,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.670
she might be spilling water to force you to refute aboard the boy with fresh water every

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.950
day.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.660
Gently,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.150
perfectly bring fresh photo.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.990
So in case she has to drink dirty and state water,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.660
she might use it as a trick to get access to fresh water supply.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.630
Now let us look at the possible ways to keep a check on this border,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.130
spilling behavior off UK interiors.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.450
The ball is narrow and deep.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.250
Switch to a shallow bowl with a bigger radius.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.640
It will no longer hurt her whiskers as she will get sufficient space while lending from the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.050
bull.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.350
Hoping for heavier bowl made out of glass or ceramic will make it nearly impossible for a

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.120
cat to flip it.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.180
Or even if a ball is almost free,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.000
make sure to change the water in a bowl at least once every based,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.280
not place first.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.050
This will say this for her urge for being fresh and clean water,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.510
and second,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.850
you will get to know about have water intake on a daily basis.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.690
This,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.400
in turn,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.730
will help you to easily identify any underlying issue.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.950
You get this facing your car accident required to stoop very low to access the photo.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.750
All this makes you that you can't has easy access to the water in the bowl.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.690
The circulating water fountains,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.740
which are readily available in the market,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.050
are also very good option for cats.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.850
Aztecs enjoyed drinking running water.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.060
These motor functions are worth a try.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.850
Cats don't have much options to entertain themselves.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.100
So if you get is not getting the right amount of play,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.430
splashing and spilling water can seem to be an exciting activity for stimulate your cat

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.560
both physically and mentally by playing with her and getting her sufficient exercise on a

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.450
daily bases.
