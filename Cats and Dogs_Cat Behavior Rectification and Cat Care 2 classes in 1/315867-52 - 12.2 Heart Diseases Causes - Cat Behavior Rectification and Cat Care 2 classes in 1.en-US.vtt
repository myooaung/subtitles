00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
Jack's generally don't suffer from heart attacks as humans to nevertheless,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.270
this suffered from heart diseases,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.750
which can occur because of the falling presents.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.330
First is the cardiomyopathy,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.130
which is a disease of heart.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.750
Mrs.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.760
It occurs when the heart muscles tickin,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.720
resulting in the enlargement of the heart this making it harder for the heart to pump blood

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.550
throughout the body.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.550
Clot formation in the heart results in heart diseases.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.090
As the clock moved through the heart,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.450
it can cut off the proper blood supply to the highlands.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.950
Many heart city in focus,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.250
bumping off blood from heart to other organs of the body decreases,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.150
which leads to an increased pressure in the heart.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.950
The witness is sworn to this increase pressure in the heart by retaining fluid water and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.010
salt in the body.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.450
This food buildup leads to a condition in the body.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.220
Do discarding and contraction of heart falls.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.050
They're unable to control the blood flow inside and outside of the heart.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.790
This in turn leads to leaking off blood between the heart chambers,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.350
which is also include formation in the heart,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.900
Andi,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.760
improper blood supply to other parts of the body infection,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.070
heart walls and harmful infection.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.650
Heart can also cause heart diseases.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.110
Obesity is also one of the main reasons for heart problems,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.450
or bees cancel more thrown to her diseases than cats with normal bit.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.190
Increased blood pressure also leads to thickening off the heart muscles,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.560
thus making hard to work harder to pump blood to other organs of the body and also causing

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.450
smaller vessels stood up to this leading to heart diseases.
