00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
one of the most common problems faced by pet periods is improper elimination by the pets.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.860
Many of these issues are related to litter box issues and at the same thing.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.150
Many of these issues have nothing to do with the litter box.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.390
And there's more of a communication problem You and marking is an indirect way of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.660
communication used by cats to prove the presence among detaches gas at a species which

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.880
don't careful living,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.850
hunting or eating in groups.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.200
This can be seen very clearly from lions and other big cats,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.950
who generally have dedicated territory to them.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.390
Similarly,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.650
when household cats become met you,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.250
they claim certain areas and territories for themselves.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.140
And that is way.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.640
They live in direct messages for other cats to know that this is their territory and nobody

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.650
has the permission to enter this territory.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.410
Urine marking is one of the numerous ways that cats used to live in direct messages for

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.860
other cats by marking a particular area out thing with valuing the highlight their presents

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.150
and further establish a sense of ownership for that thing or area.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.320
Certain times it is even used as a message and invitation with the opposite gender for

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.790
meeting Doe.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.530
Domesticated cats no longer have to hunt for food or live in the white with constant threat

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.350
from religious and other gates.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.180
This jihad white who think like I get who needs to so in the way marking a territory not

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.060
only helps a cat to part of strangers but also creates an environment of safety and family

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.150
charity for the get.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.480
Now let us look at the V's to differentiate urine marking.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.550
Formulated books issue.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.550
Urine marking is generally done on vertical surfaces.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.940
Then a cat marks a vertical surface with looting.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.350
It is known esprit.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.870
In spring,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.840
the vaginally stands with rear sight facing the vertical surface,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.450
like the leg off a tear,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.700
a wall or a door she's praising on the world taken surface while standing erect with her,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.350
they lifted high up in the air.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.200
The amount of hearing also varies when it comes to urine marking and this comparatively

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.920
lesser than the amount she would otherwise eliminate.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.870
If she's going in the little books.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.300
What if she's eliminating outside the books Beauty litter box issues you are eliminated

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.540
from marking smells more pungent than the normal during you were in use by a cat for

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.750
territory marking is no just shooting but convinced some extra chemicals has been who

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.650
communicating various other messages to a counterpart.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.850
The pens of these chemicals in a Ewing is what makes it pundits spelling for US humans.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.770
If you're not able to make out whether it is a little box problem but a communication

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.750
behaviour program,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.450
it is recommended to consult a vet to find out the root cause.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.290
Consulting of that will further help to rule out any underlying medical condition.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.950
Put this behavior in your care now.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.950
As you know,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.550
if a cat is urine marking,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.100
it would be appropriate to understand the underlying causes that lead to this behavior in a

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.550
cat.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.890
This behavior is only absorb if they don't mind people.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.290
Cats in the household increase in the number of cats in the household results in an

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.350
increased probability of this behavior.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.760
Generally,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.350
this behavior is seen in intact make.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.150
Its as one of the other reasons for urine marking is to declare once availability for a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.150
productive meeting in tech meals at the common culprits for such behavior,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.250
Doe,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.610
in some cases on spare females and neutered cats are also found to be involved in such a

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.240
behavior.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.560
These cases are generally area in case the cat distressed,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.890
deep,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.150
retained in the household.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.350
She can urine micro territory to create an environment of safety and familiarity.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.390
Jackson not comfortable to Change So when anything today this inside the house,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.750
they become stressed.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.720
This team can be in the form off introduction off a new cat dog child,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.150
some construction or remotely activity in the house.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.660
They may indulged in this behaviour to leave a message about the ownership,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.380
or they might be remark to comfort themselves in this face off uncertain unity with the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.250
family Assman.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.950
Conflict within cacs is another reason why cats market territory with doing this conflict

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.120
could either be between the household cats or between the household care and outside cats

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.650
who often visit your property.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.550
She becomes anxious on side of the other kids in a directory,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.450
and this very anxiety of the cat culminates in her urine marking behaviour.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.650
Now let's look at the ways to manage a cat suffering from this condition.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.430
If you can't is unsparing or inject new drink and your solution to fix this issue,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.350
you get as an index get primarily marks would be cleaner availability for a meeting.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.340
Mick X generally mark when they hear the yelling off a few minutes.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.850
Get who isn't it?

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.440
One of the base took up.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.450
This behavior is to prevent your cat from seeing or hearing at the cats in the neighborhood

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.350
by closing curtains and windows of the house.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.950
If you have multiple cats in your home,

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.950
the first and foremost step is to find out which get is responsible for your remarking.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.090
You can either do this by confining.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.750
Each of you gets individually one at that time.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.430
What,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.620
by mixing an edible die in the food off every kid one at a time on Did you find out the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.470
culprit that I makes the urine glow blue on?

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.550
Do you relate for a period of approximately 20 for us?

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:02.660
Sometimes this behaviour is observed when the number of little boxes is less as compared to

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.850
the needs of the kits.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.150
In such a scenario,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.490
they may be dispute on the user's off the little books and can therefore result in the

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.500
marking behaviour.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.700
The general rule of thumb in such a scenario is to have an extra little balls compared to

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.450
the number of cats in your household.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.970
What example?

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.350
If your forecasts,

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.120
you should have at least file it the boxes in your home father.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.740
It is recommended that the additional letter books should be placed in a location with the

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.140
anxious.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:40.140
Kate spends most of her time clean the soil area totally with the Ginza labor fork,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.500
losing and neutralizing Catherine order.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.150
If you get this marking in a specific location,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.650
engage in a play activity we look at in that specific area.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.520
This will help change the CAT association with that area,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.700
and we'll make it a positive location for you.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:04.650
Get at least nearly you can spare synthetic film one own and near the targeted area,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.550
which is the text association with that video.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.070
This has been shown to help gets,

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.750
and they're living their stress and curb this behavior.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.100
In some cases,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.370
it is recommended to completely close off deck area for UK on Do the Behavior of the CAC is

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.050
rectified.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.680
Really.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.050
Scooping off the letter books is highly recommended.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.320
Additionally,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.200
it is poison,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.920
suggested Brookly.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:37.090
All the litter boxes once a week with unset it so plain water and even completely replacing

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.850
the litter is also recommended.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.350
This helps to remove scent of other cats from the little books,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.150
which is responsible.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.310
Who?

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.480
Making the cat and she's RWE.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.250
Sufficient separate spaces for cats in the house,

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.150
gas love to spend time on their own,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.120
and if sufficient spaces are we liberated them,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.750
it can fight off the issue of territorial monkey.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:07.500
Multiparty batteries can really come handy in such a situation further and show that you

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.300
can't has access to areas which she feels are safe to retreat,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.750
such as batteries,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.440
tunnels,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.240
hiding places,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.950
etcetera,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.790
1,000,000,000 collectively tank with UK.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.950
This highly recommended to reduce her anxiety further.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.350
This was part offer insecurity and we helping boosting her confidence.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:32.180
Sometimes spring is observed specifically on a particular family members,

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.350
floats or items.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.050
In such a scenario,

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:40.250
it would help if that person feels that day and spend some extra time with her.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.350
This will help in mitigating the cats insecurity for that person.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.390
If nothing off these additions work for you,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:53.420
get your last resort is to concert an animal behavior expert who can design a behavior

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.750
change plan specifically for UK
