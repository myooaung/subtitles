00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
aggression is a common behavior issue in cats.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:10.080
The consequences off this behavior can be quite dying as it can cause severe injuries to

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.040
other cats,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.760
animals and humans as well.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.330
Our report even estimates that 27% of the cats said and led to shelters,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.250
but because off this unmanageable aggressive behavior,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.750
therefore,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.360
it is very crucial for cat owners to know the reasons for this aggressive behavior and

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.100
always to manage this period.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.320
Yeah,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.270
cats and kittens that were no trees with the little mitts and didn't go opportunity to play

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.350
with other cats generally showed this type of aggression.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.250
They learn how to play appropriately during that time spent with other little mitts,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.850
and this is an important part off their socialization.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.630
We know that cats are hunters and even kittens during their play store teeth and pounds

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.870
over each other gets raised with little mitts learned during the play that if they will

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.210
scratch and bite other catch too hard,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.940
they stop playing with.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.720
Therefore,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.550
they learn to control the intensity off biting and scratching.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.080
During these play sessions,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.750
they also learn nor to inflict injuries with their clothes.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.410
Cats were lobbyist alone do not receive adequate socialisation lessons and generally

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.470
developed Lee aggression Gas display.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.460
Plea aggression.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.220
We often height and will then pounds from the Heidi sport when the target passes by and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.350
scratched the target,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.910
even if it is their owner.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.250
Speeds or hands.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.620
Let us look at the movies to manage.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.400
Play aggression in,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.740
gets to manage,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.160
play aggression in your get you must know value.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.550
Cat becomes aggressive on also had hiding places from where she can pounds on you.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.920
First thing that you should do is to deny had access to the hiding places where she hides

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.850
before policy.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.980
You can even put a bell in her cooler that will tell you about her.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:17.870
Variables now are punished for toucher during this feels as she will become fearful off you

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.870
,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.650
and this may promote further aggression in her.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.740
You can redirect her focus by startling her started her by blast from a can of compressed

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.250
air or best for tinker with border from a spray border.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.550
Keep in mind that your goal should now be to scare her,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.200
but to distract her so as to refocus that attention book away and ignored her during her

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.750
aggression.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.200
This was a teacher that inappropriate play aggression results in unwanted consequences for

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.450
food,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.260
and you also stop playing with her when she becomes accuracy to reduce play aggression in

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.980
your cat,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.650
you can take these steps,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.950
provide her with the number of toys and observe her preference off toys.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.410
She may like to play with small toys like balls and faith mice.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.340
Or she would prefer to stop teeth and pounds on the toys that move likely once you know her

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.180
preference.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.700
Prue,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.030
I heard,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.180
though,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.020
is that she likes for preface.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.550
Spend at least 15 to 30 minutes a day with your cat to play with her.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.650
You should direct a play away from you.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.330
You can use long dangly toys or trove it toys to play with.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.320
Don't Anchorage her to play with your hands,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.750
fingers and feet.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.840
You're really fingers and dicer to play with them,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.450
and she may even consider them as toys.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.250
Don't use toys that teach you can't to play with your hands,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.350
such as a glove with boys hanging from the fingers.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.230
If you do so,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.760
your dad will be encouraged to dicuss play at your hands,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.210
and she won't understand that it's okay only to attack your hands when you're viewing the

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.050
toy cliffs.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.150
Why it may be a fun when she's a kitten as a biting will not hurt much,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
but it becomes really painful and dangerous when she grows up.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.250
Training messages should always be consistent throughout your cat's life,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.590
so now use your hands,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.350
feet or any other body part as a cat toy.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.390
If you don't phone your cat to bite you when she's upset,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.250
then teacher that biting a human even during playtime is not acceptable.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.950
Be consistent in your messages,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.220
and it will really help to manage this behavior in your if you can't likes to grab your

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.460
feet as you go up and down the stairs or hide under things and attacked your ankles or legs

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.660
as you walk away that it is advised to carry toys with you and throw them ahead off you to

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.580
redirect attention and correct her to focus on teasing the toys instead of attacking,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.540
you do not physically initial cat.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.450
For roughly,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.410
she may perceive your actions as play,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.970
and this action off yours may even encourage her to play more fluid.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.100
You or she will become scared off you and may become defensive in front of you when you

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.140
observe that have plays getting rough immediately leave the play and go into another.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.330
Now I'll be cut up to place her in another room at this super work aggression and biting

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.140
behavior in her.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.860
Instead,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.260
you should leave the room.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.750
Who paid her that this kind of behavior is not acceptable,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.150
even if you can't grabs your hand with her teeth.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.310
Don't pull out your hand from her mama,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.040
because if you do this it refueling her feeling or being afraid data and pulling over you

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.840
had will trigger to bite you even more instead confused or startled her,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.950
which will cause her to lose in her bowl on your hand.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.050
Once you hand a set free immediately stopped a play and ignore her.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.980
This will bring and teacher that such active first can end again.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.920
Another reason for your cat developing play.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.150
Aggression can be a boarding environment.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.250
Why it is safer for a cat to be kept in does,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.090
but she gets bored in a confined environment when she doesn't have much to do inside the

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.130
you as a cat parent should and Richard environment and create opportunities for a physical

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.450
and mental stimulation,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.650
provide her with a favorite toys when she's left alone.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:45.870
Further provide her with a window seat so that she can explore the outside environment and

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.040
rich and stimulate her mental health with four passages it will satisfy,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.540
Have playing desire and will revolt her with their favorite food.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.450
At the same time,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:03.880
you can even consider adopting another cat if you have known working US gas Lampley and

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.550
socialization skills with the little mitts.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.560
But be sure to properly introduce her with her new leader,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.050
Mitt.
