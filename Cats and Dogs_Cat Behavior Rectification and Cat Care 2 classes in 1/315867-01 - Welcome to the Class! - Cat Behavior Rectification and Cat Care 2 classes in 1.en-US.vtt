00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
are you a cat parent?

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.430
Then,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.930
without any second put,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.750
you would agree that cats are wonderful yet mysterious creatures.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.520
You must have realized by now that cats play by their own rules,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.500
and it's very difficult to predict their behavior.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.770
But sometimes this unpredictability results in unwanted behaviors like urine marking or

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.450
scratching,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.750
which becomes a cause of worry for you.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.150
Wouldn't it be great if you could understand and rectified these behavior issues?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.080
If this is the case,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.650
you were at the right place.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.150
