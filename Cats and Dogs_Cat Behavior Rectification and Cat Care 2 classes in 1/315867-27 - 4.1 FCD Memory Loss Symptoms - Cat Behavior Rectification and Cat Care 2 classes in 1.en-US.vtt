In medical studies.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:03.550

with a happy move,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.850

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.350
irritated and get over dependent on you,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.030
or if she shows less interest in food and toys,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.460
which used to entice her,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.050
