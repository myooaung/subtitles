00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.170
If she prefers to scratch in a vertical position,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.640
the scratch post should at least be tall enough so as to match the high traffic get when

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.050

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.360
Why located using it?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.800
The next step is to relax her scratching behavior onto the scratch post,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.020
please the scratch post near those places where she likes to scratch if she likes to

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.540
scratch it.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.360
Different things in your home places great supposed near each one off them.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.650
Don't force her to use the scratch post what put her clothes on the scratch post and she

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.630
won't understand.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.160
But you are doing and may even start disliking the post once she discovers protection off

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.750
the post and start scratching and correction to use it by rewarding Harvick treats and low

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.750
.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.550
Once she has started using the scratch post,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.210
place it in her room,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.910
where she can never miss it.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.750
The scratch post should always be accessible to her.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.390
You can cover the household items with plastic sheets or blankets,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:27.320
which will make them inaccessible for her replacing old scratch post If all scratch post

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.080
looks awful and this stone don't simply discard it.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.200
If you decide to get a new post,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.850
place it alongside the old scratch post.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.440
If you remove it,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.150
your cattle now use a new one because the old one header sent in marks.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.580
Therefore it is back into place a new post with the old one.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.490
Gradually,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.630
she will learn to use the new post hustle.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.170
You need to keep a few things in mind to stop scratching on undesirable things.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.620
The first and the foremost ing.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.530
It's too narrow.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.780
When issued cat put a scratching behavior get.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.610
Don't respond well to punishment,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.140
but conversely,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.950
it can lead to aggression in her.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.010
If you will punish or scold her when you see us creating.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.390
She will become fearful off you and we learned nor to scratch in your presence.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.350
But we launched off this behavior.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.750
The idea here is to train her north to scratch certain things off your home.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.350
The best way is to cover your household items and make them inaccessible for her to scratch

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.350
.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.750
Gradually,

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.550
her scratching will be redirected to her scratch post.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.460
The second most important point to remember is to never go for declining off your cat the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.490
time declawing is actually a miss Normal Declawing is not simply the removal of meals,

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.800
but is the amputation off last digital bones at the tips off the post.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.490
It is equal int to removing off the last joint offer humans fingers.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.890
So imagine what brutality we do with our cats if it did.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.650
Clothing declawing makes them more prone to infections.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.720
Declawed cats are unable to defend themselves as a front close.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.050
Other primary defense,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.100
feeling defenseless,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.840
can even make you get emotionally distressed and hosting to other animals and humans,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.600
including you.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.920
Declawing can alter her sense of balance and therefore can reserved in her decreased

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.650
ability to play and jump.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.970
Declawing can also little aversion to use the letter books because of the pain associated

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.050
with scratching the little,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.430
thus forcing her to find a more comfortable place to eliminate herself,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.460
which means increased house soiling accidents.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.670
However,

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.550
oil declare your cat is simply inhuman.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.870
Some countries have even ruled declawing illegal.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.410
Therefore,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.540
the best thing that the Pac parent can do in such a situation is to teach your cat to use

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.450
the appropriate surfaces for scratchy.
