00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
let us look at the causes off arthritis in cats in order for lines it because due to the

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.720
prolonged fear and tear of those joints,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.050
we just subjected to maximum stress.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.570
Certain injuries,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.420
like ligament years,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.550
dislocated and broken bones can also lead to arthritis.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.490
Cartilage in joints at is a cushion that provides smooth surface,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.050
which allows adjoining bones to move freely over each other.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.650
This movement is also assisted by lubrication provided by Sinovel fluid in the joints.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.360
But if the cartilage deteriorates and Sinovel through it losers lubricating properties,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.310
it can need to outrageous and as a result,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.450
movement of bones become difficult and rough,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.850
leading to discomfort and reduced mobility.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.290
Autoimmune disease were her own body's immune system attacks.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.150
The joints can also be the reason off are traitors that leads to information off the joints

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.150
.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.750
Obesity could be another reason.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.550
As extra weight puts,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.850
extrapolation of the joints does leading to this condition
