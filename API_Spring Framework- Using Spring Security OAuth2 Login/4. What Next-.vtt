00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.730
Before we wrap up this module and course,

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.800
let's look at our application.yml file.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.540
Now, having the client‑secret in plain text is a no‑no.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.140
At the very least, this should be encrypted.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.940
To achieve this, you can check out my previous course,

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.140
but these values should probably be stored in a secure data store,

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.720
ideally, a centralized secret management solution,

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.620
like Vault by HashiCorp.

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.810
Next, in production, you need to use HTTPS.

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.630
It's a must‑have.

11
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.330
And again, you can get a free certificate with Let's Encrypt,

12
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.730
so there's no excuses.

13
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.090
Check out this module for more details on that.

14
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.580
And finally, exception handling to prevent those default WhiteLevel error pages.

15
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.080
Let's get back to wrapping up this module.

16
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.440
With authorities, roles, and scopes, there is no right way of doing things.

17
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.200
There are many options out there,

18
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.120
and you really need to tailor it to your

19
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.410
application's security requirements; however,

20
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.740
generally, roles and authorities are for users and scopes for clients.

21
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.800
Okay, now that completes the module and the course.

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.930
In future courses,

23
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.720
we will look at using OAuth to secure service

24
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.940
communication and more advanced authorization.

25
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.100
Now,

26
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.870
feel free to leave feedback or any questions you might have in

27
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.660
the comments and subscribe if you want to get notifications of

28
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.470
future courses in this space.

29
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.030
All the source code can be downloaded from the exercise

30
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.000
files or the following Git location. Thank you for watching my course, and I really hope you found it useful.
