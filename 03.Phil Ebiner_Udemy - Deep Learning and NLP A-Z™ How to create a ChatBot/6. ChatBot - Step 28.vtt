00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.880
Highs and welcome to this new tutorial and this one we're going to be setting the sequence length to

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.580
a maximum length which will be 25 if you remember we already did that previously and actually Part 1

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.730
day of pre-processing at the end.

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.920
If I remember correctly in this sorting questions and answers by the length of the questions here we

5
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.680
chose to go up to a certain sequence length which was 25 and this plus one wishes to include the twenty

6
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.380
five or be bound but already by doing that we set a maximum sequence length and we have to do it again

7
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.910
here to specify this on our sequence slings variable which is one of the arguments used by the functions

8
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.670
of part 2.

9
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.680
If we go to part two you see the encoder Arnon takes as the argument the sequence length as well as

10
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.870
the decode Arnon right here sequence lengths.

11
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.890
So we have to basically set this sequence length variable now and that's exactly what we'll do in the

12
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.900
tutorial.

13
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:13.110
So I'm introducing this sequence length variable which is this time not an argument of a function like

14
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.940
previously but a real variable that we'll use later integrate the sequence length variable.

15
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.240
Well we are going to take tenths of flow and this variable has to be inside a placeholder attentive

16
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.300
of placeholder like our model inputs and therefore I'm going to take the place holder but the placeholder

17
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.770
with default function because we're going to set a default value to produce when the output is not fed

18
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.110
into the record or a neural network.

19
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.870
That's why we have to use the placeholder with default function instead of the simple placeholder function.

20
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.890
So placeholder with default and it's going to take as arguments first the maximum length.

21
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.650
We want to have in the sequence which as we chose before is going to be 25 to 25 maximum length.

22
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.720
Then the second argument as you can see is the shape.

23
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.610
And if you look at the tense of the documentation you'll see that it corresponds to a sense of what

24
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.330
sense of shape or a simple list of integers.

25
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.290
And here since sequence length is just a simple maximum length.

26
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.140
There is no tensor to deal with and therefore will just input none.

27
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.790
That's the second argument.

28
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.060
And then finally the third and last argument is just a name we want to give to that sequence length

29
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.460
and will give the following name in quotes sequence lengths.

30
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.540
All right sequence length simply so that we can reuse it afterwards when we need it for the training.

31
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.170
All right so that sets basically the maximum length of the sequences in the questions and the answers.

32
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.160
This maximum length is twenty five which means that in the training we won't be using two questions

33
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.210
and the answer is that I have more than 25 words.

34
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.640
All right so let's execute this line of code execute and there we go.

35
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.090
We have our sequence things viable created that will now be able to use as one of the future arguments

36
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.220
are set to take model function.

37
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.470
So that's a new step done.

38
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.700
And now we're going to move onto the next step.

39
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.040
Another quick step before starting to get the training and test predictions which is going to be to

40
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.470
set this time the input shape this is going to be very easy and we'll do that in the next tutorial.

41
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.120
Until then enjoy the build up be.
