00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.310
Hello and welcome to the final tutorial of part 1 there are pre-processing I'm super excited to be almost

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.430
done with it because I can tell you that what's coming next is going to be really exciting.

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.720
We're going to build the brain we're going to get into deep learning between us deep learning is much

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.270
more exciting than natural language processing.

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.670
So that's why I'm super pumped to get to deep learning but that will be in the next tutorial in this

6
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.120
one.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.440
We're going to tackle the final step of our natural language processing phase which is to sort the questions

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.770
and answers by the length of the questions before we were sorting both the questions and the answers

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.910
by the length of the questions.

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.660
So first of all why do we want to do that.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.580
Well I mentioned it in the previous Etoile but I'll say a little more here.

12
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.530
Basically we want to sort the questions and the answers by the length of the questions because this

13
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.800
will speed up the training.

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.550
This will speed up the training and help to reduce the loss.

15
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.490
And the reason for this is that because it will reduce the amount of padding during the training.

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.600
So it's pretty technical but it's important to know why we're doing this.

17
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.730
Remember I told you at the beginning of our adventure here it's always important to know where you come

18
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.550
from and where you want to go.

19
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.440
And so right now we want to go what we want to do is to sort the questions and the answers by the likes

20
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.230
of the questions to speed up the training and optimize it.

21
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.720
All right.

22
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.080
So let's do this let's sort these questions and answers.

23
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.680
So we will have to make some new lists because we can not change the order in an existing list.

24
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.010
This is not possible and by then we have to make a list or we could override the previous list.

25
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.900
But it's dangerous to do that so we'll make a list and we'll make actually two new list.

26
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.870
The first one we're going to call it sorted clean.

27
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.570
Questions.

28
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.980
Sorry for the long names but it's just for you to visualize clearly what we're making sordid clean questions

29
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.890
that we're going to initialize as an empty nest and then same we are going to make the sordid clean

30
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.070
answers that we are initialising as well as an empty list.

31
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.890
So questions and clean answers.

32
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.690
Great.

33
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.750
Now starts the for loop.

34
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.300
And actually there are going to be two loops.

35
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.830
And again I recommend to try to beat me and make these lists before me.

36
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.320
That's an excellent practice.

37
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.760
The more you code the better you'll become.

38
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.270
But I'll start right now.

39
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.860
So 4 and so now what we want to do.

40
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.080
Well we want to sort the questions and the answers by the length of the questions.

41
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.960
So what we'll do is we will get a loop variable that is going to go from one which is the shortest length

42
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.710
of a question or an answer like for example Y or yes or no.

43
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.490
You know these are important questions or answers in the conversation.

44
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.760
So we're going to have this new variable that is going to start from 1 and then that it's going to be

45
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.130
incremented by one to be equal to two and three and four.

46
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.260
But then we will make it stop at a certain length because we don't want to include the questions that

47
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.970
are too long like for example some big text.

48
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.090
This will not help the chad but to learn how to speak.

49
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.240
It's like if you're training a child to speak English or French will you not teach him English with

50
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.990
long sentences you will start with some short sentences.

51
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.020
Otherwise the child will get overwhelmed.

52
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.870
So the idea is going to be the same here we just want to include the questions and the answers that

53
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.930
are not too long and by not too long I mean a length for example up to 20 or 25 so we'll choose 25.

54
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.020
If this is too long for you you can always reduce it.

55
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.590
If the training takes too long you can always reduce it.

56
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.180
So I'll go up to 25 here we'll see what happens.

57
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.440
Don't worry if we don't get good results we'll always go back in our code to improve the check.

58
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.510
But in the end.

59
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.070
So there we go.

60
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:24.570
I'm taking my loop variable that I'm calling LAN and that will go in the range from 1 the shortest length

61
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.760
of a question the shortest question up to 25 plus one and adding the plus one here because remember

62
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.630
that upper bounds in ranges in Python are excluded.

63
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.320
So in order to go up to 25 we need to add 25 plus one.

64
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.620
But you know this is arbitrary so we could always go up to 24 and not include the plus when he actually

65
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.500
let's do this it's proper.

66
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.200
Feel free to do it if you want.

67
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.920
All right so then Cullen and we were ready to go inside the for loop and the next step is to start a

68
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.040
second for because now that we loop over the different possible length of the questions we'll be dealing

69
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.540
with.

70
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.070
Well now for each of these questions having that length we're dealing with right now.

71
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.700
Well we want to get two important elements.

72
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:23.020
The first element is the index of the question and the second element is the question itself the text

73
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.710
because then we will need the length of that question.

74
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.150
So the trick to get these two elements at the same time is to use the numerator function and so that's

75
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.950
exactly what we're going to do we're going to enumerate the questions into a list.

76
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.550
So I'm going to show you what it means to questions into a list.

77
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.610
Is this one.

78
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.220
Yes this is this list.

79
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.800
And by taking the enumerate function what will happen is that the loop variable is going to get two

80
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.630
elements.

81
00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.990
First is the index of the question and these questions into a list.

82
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.540
And the second element is going to be this question itself translating into integers and that's exactly

83
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.890
what we want because we need to keep track of the index to add it in our future sorting questions list

84
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.960
and then sorting answers list.

85
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:24.220
And also we need this because we need the length of it to sort the questions we will get the length

86
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.560
and see if it is equal to the length of the loop starting from 1 and then be equal to 2 3 up to 25.

87
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.160
So we need these two elements.

88
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.010
And the trick to get these two elements to index and the question is to use the enumerate function.

89
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.250
So there we go.

90
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.110
Let's start the second for loop four.

91
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.250
Then we can choose any name for the new variable and we will call it.

92
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.220
It's the usual name when using any right for I n n numerate.

93
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.740
That's the function.

94
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:03.160
And questions into it and CULLEN And let's go inside.

95
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:12.560
So for example the first I is going to be equal to the couple of zero and this question then at the

96
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.250
next step of the loop i is going to be equal to the couple of one.

97
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.620
And this question then at the next step the couple to answer this question.

98
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.410
So you see how this works by using this we get the index and the question itself.

99
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:33.090
That's prefigure going to understand very quickly why it's important for us to get these two elements.

100
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:40.490
And so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to check if the length of the question I'm dealing with

101
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:46.960
right now in questions into it is equal to the length we're dealing with right now in the first four

102
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.630
loop.

103
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.910
Remember this length starts at 1.

104
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:56.540
So if the question that we're catching here in questions into it has a length of one.

105
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.020
Well we will include it first in the sort of questions.

106
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.870
That's the idea of what we're doing here.

107
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:08.900
And then when lines will be equal the two will catch all the questions in questions and two that have

108
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:14.830
a length equal to two and then etcetera and that's how we managed to sort the questions and answers

109
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:21.110
by the length of the questions because now in this for loop we will just add first and if condition

110
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.690
to check if the length of the question is equal to the length we're dealing with right now and if that's

111
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:33.500
the case we will append this question to our of clean questions and our sort of clean answers.

112
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.040
All right.

113
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:42.410
Let's do this let's make this if condition if the length of the question we are dealing with right now

114
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:51.410
in this second for loop and this we can get it by I bracket one because remember I's a couple and the

115
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:56.450
first element of the couple is the index of the question and the second element of the couple is the

116
00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.420
question itself.

117
00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:06.570
So now we were checking if the length of the question itself is equal to the length of the first for

118
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.110
loop we're dealing with right now.

119
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.550
And that starts at 1.

120
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:17.030
So if the length of the question is equal to this length then what's going to happen is that we will

121
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:25.070
have to bend this question to the sort in questions list because this length starts at 1 and therefore

122
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.480
the length of the question is equal to 1.

123
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.090
And therefore this is the shortest question.

124
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:41.870
All right so we take our sordid core clean on those core questions list and to this list we have append

125
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.400
that question that has the length one.

126
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.210
All right.

127
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.820
And how can we get this question.

128
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:56.520
Well we take our questions on that score into the score and huge list and then to catch this question

129
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.740
we need to catch it by taking the index of the question we are dealing with right now and the index

130
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:08.790
we have it because this is the first element of I because I remind a couple containing the index of

131
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.090
the question and then the question itself.

132
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.940
So to get that index we need to here.

133
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.550
I zero.

134
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.950
And that gives us exactly what we want.

135
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:19.950
All right.

136
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:25.740
And remember that we also want to sort the answers by the length of the questions.

137
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.820
And why is that.

138
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.550
That's because we want to align the questions and the answers we want to make sure that at a specific

139
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:38.580
index the answer of that index is the answer to the question of that same index and therefore that's

140
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:44.270
why we have to choose something to sort the questions and answers by.

141
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.200
And we're choosing to sort them by the length of the questions and therefore what we need to do now

142
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:58.670
is directly to append the answer of that same index 0 here to our sordid clean answers list.

143
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:05.520
And therefore what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this page here.

144
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:17.610
Replace sorting questions by sort of clean answers and append of course answers into list of zero because

145
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:28.470
answers into list of zero contains exactly the answer of index zero which is the answer to the question

146
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.900
of index 0 in the questions into end list.

147
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:38.340
So that makes sure everything is well aligned here so perfect.

148
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.510
Oh my goodness.

149
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.650
We're done with data processing this feels so good.

150
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.870
I'm super happy to eventually get to part two.

151
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:55.900
But before we do that let's have a look at the beauty of what we just made with these final two lists.

152
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.070
Sorting questions and clean answers.

153
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.720
So I'm going to ask you this.

154
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.250
I hope I didn't make a mistake and let's execute.

155
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.210
There we go.

156
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.160
Fingers crossed and amazing.

157
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.610
Now I can tell you that the data processing phase is done and is done actually because now we're going

158
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.450
to get to deep learning which is much more exciting.

159
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:24.420
So let's have a look at our sort of questions and our storytelling answers which are right here.

160
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.910
So sorting questions first and what we should see is yes exactly that.

161
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.490
That is the first question is containing only one element.

162
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:40.060
So this corresponds to the encoded number that results from the encoding things to our previous dictionary.

163
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.710
Questions were to ends.

164
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.260
So these corresponds to one word questions.

165
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:51.890
And if we scroll down well we should get two questions with more elements.

166
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:59.180
So we should get from questions with one element two questions with two elements in any second.

167
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.660
Well there are actually a lot of questions with one element.

168
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.670
I wonder what these kinds of questions are but soon enough we should get two questions with two elements.

169
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.560
There we go.

170
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.600
They are right here.

171
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.020
That's the questions with two words.

172
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:21.530
Like I don't know like what's up now what what would be what is.

173
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.190
So there would be three words question but that can be for example.

174
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.220
How come.

175
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.170
Are you OK.

176
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.930
I don't know.

177
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.900
Well you know these are questions from movies.

178
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.170
This can be anything.

179
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.920
And then soon enough we should be able to get to three words questions.

180
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.870
Let's see.

181
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.520
There we go.

182
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.210
Three words.

183
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.710
Question here.

184
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:42.430
What's up.

185
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.030
Is a three word question.

186
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.120
I'm sure there is a what's up somewhere.

187
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.080
Anyway this is exactly what we wanted.

188
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.430
That's perfect.

189
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.740
I'm going to close this.

190
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:56.250
All right so now we can move on to part 2.

191
00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:03.000
Building the set to morrow and if you're still there with me I want to congratulate you very much for

192
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.780
staying with me along this huge data processing phase.

193
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:12.520
I hope this wasn't too overwhelming but this is compulsory and deep natural language processing.

194
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:18.930
And on a more general note keep in mind that the work of a data scientist or machine learning scientist

195
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:26.700
is 70 percent on data pre-processing but I tried to make it as efficient as possible and now things

196
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.900
are going to get exciting.

197
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.390
We're going to get into tenths of flow we're going to start using terms of flow and we're going to create

198
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.820
the encoding layer and then the decoding layer in the SEC like morrow.

199
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.150
I can't wait to start.

200
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.270
And until then in Japan I'll be.
