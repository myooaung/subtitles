00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:06,170
Hi guys and welcome to Pardes zero installing Anaconda and getting the data set.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,390
So in this for Statoil we will install the Anaconda ID which contains spider on which will implement

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:12,800
our Chad.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,370
But.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,150
So just like me go to right now and then type in the research bar Anaconda.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,190
Here it is.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,960
You take the first link and I go on the cloud.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,450
And then here you click on download an icon.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,070
All right then you will end up on a new page.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,670
And on this page I need to find your system Windows Mac OS or Linux.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,970
I am on my quest so I'm in the right tab and you need to click on download here for Python 3.6 and not

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,550
Python 2.7.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,400
So there we go let's click on download then the download will not take long just wait for it to be completed.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
And once that is the case you're ready to install Anaconda.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,900
So the download will probably go to your download folders.

16
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,790
That's where I'm going to go right now.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,580
Here I am.

18
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,380
That's an icon that installation files.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,760
Double click on it and then very easy.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,430
You just need to click on continue continue continue agree and install for me on the continue.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,860
And there we go install the installation is on its way so it should take a couple of minutes so I'll

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,660
see you at the end of the installation.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,230
It will go without any issue.

24
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,980
Perfect.

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,320
The installation is done so now just press close and then if you want can move the installation file

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,420
to the trash.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,730
So I'm going to do it.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,680
And there we go.

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,460
Anaconda is now installed and now we are almost ready.

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,630
What we need to install is tense afloat because tenso flow is not already integrated in the neck under.

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:51,270
However I know that some of you work on a specific environment that you wouldn't want to interfere with

32
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,170
this course.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,330
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a virtual environment.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,780
And besides it's important to do it because tests flow has some issues with Python 3.6.

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,300
So we're going to create a virtual environment with Python 3.5.

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,180
So we're going to downgrade to Python 3.5.

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,960
And inside this environment we will install tens of them.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,370
So to do all this we need to open either a terminal for Mac and Linux users or the anti-canuck prompt

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,700
for Windows users.

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,260
So for Mac and Linux users what you need to do is to open a terminal so I'm not here so I'm going to

41
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,350
open it from the spotlight search terminal.

42
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,160
There we go.

43
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,060
For Linux users please open your terminals as well.

44
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,500
And for Windows users what you need to do is go to the bottom left corner of your screen.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
Click on the windows button here.

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,570
Then in the list of programs you have to find Anaconda and inside an icon there you just need to find

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,280
Anaconda prompt and that's the equivalent to the terminal.

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,210
So click on Anaconda prompt.

49
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,960
This will open it and then now we are on the same page.

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:05,220
We are ready to enter some commands to create this virtual environment with Python 3.5 inside which

51
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,910
we will install transfer.

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,400
So let's do this to create a virtual environment in Anaconda.

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,330
What we need to start with is Condor.

54
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:23,160
Then we add create and then minus and and after that we need to give a name to this virtual environment.

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,500
And so we will call it chat but.

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,200
All right Chad.

57
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:37,340
But and so inside this virtual environment we want to install Python 3.5 so make sure to enter Python

58
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:45,650
equals 3.5 and then Anaconda that's to specify We want to create it in Anaconda and then that said you

59
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,740
just need to press enter.

60
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:54,500
All right so now it's going to take a while it's going to install several packages with Python 3.5 inside

61
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,390
Anaconda.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,510
So it should take a couple of minutes.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,810
As you can see here you just need to press y for yes enter.

64
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:09,230
And now as you can see it's installing all the different packages that you will need to implement the

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,190
chat but and executes different code.

66
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,220
So it's going to take a while so I'll see you once the installation is done.

67
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,790
All right perfect.

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,310
Now the chat but virtual environment is created.

69
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,410
And so now what are we going to do is we're going to go inside this environment.

70
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,740
We're going to activate it.

71
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,910
And then inside of it we will install tens of flow.

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,930
So to activate it you need to use the activate command.

73
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,880
However for Mac Linux users you will need to start with source activate and for Windows users you will

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,970
need to start with only activate.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:52,040
So for Mac Linux users you need to type here source activate then you need to enter the name of the

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,140
virtual environment which is shut.

77
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,320
But and that's it.

78
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:03,240
And for Windows users you need to just type activate without the source and then chat.

79
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:11,860
But all right so here since I am on Mac I need to start with source before activate and there we go.

80
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,700
Now you just need to press enter.

81
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,420
All right so now as you can see I am inside my virtual environment Chad but.

82
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:21,830
Right.

83
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,440
Perfect So now I'm ready to install tens of flow inside this virtual environment and to do this.

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:37,640
Well that's very simple we need to answer the IP then install sensor flow double equal one point zero

85
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,390
point zero.

86
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:44,130
We are installing this specific version of tens of low that's important for implementation.

87
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,460
Right and then you just need to press enter and there we go.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,070
This will collect sense of flow 1.0 zero.

89
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,210
Downloading it and then installing it inside the virtual environment that we called Chat.

90
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,610
But I had perfect successfully installed tens of floor 1.0 plans are great.

91
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,050
Now you can just close the terminal and now eventually we're ready to go inside under.

92
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,880
So for Windows users you can find an icon then the list of programs and for Mac or Linux users same

93
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,700
I'm going to use the shortcut here I'm going to open from the spotlight search and conduct navigator.

94
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,840
There we go.

95
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:30,200
Found that Anaconda is opening and now I'm going to show you what you have to do.

96
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,540
That's very important.

97
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,180
This is now this we're going to connect to the virtual platform that we captured.

98
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:38,830
And to find it in it to go to applications on here.

99
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,320
Then click on the arrow here and you'll find chat.

100
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,930
But Judd but which is our virtual environment that we just created.

101
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:54,130
And then you just need to click on lunch here on Spider the spider window here because this is the I.D.

102
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,230
in which we will implement our Chad.

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,690
But this is for me the best especially when you're beginning because this is like a studio with many

104
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:08,760
features many cool tools and everything at your disposal to implement them are all the deeper any application

105
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,580
or nay.

106
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,120
This is very practical.

107
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,020
Then another one that I highly recommend is Jupiter notebook.

108
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,690
And that's especially if you want to add some let's ask you know if you want to write some mathematics

109
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,060
especially if you are writing a report.

110
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:30,070
I wrote all my papers and research projects on Jupiter because I included some mathematics but we won't

111
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,300
include the mathematics here.

112
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,340
So Spider will be perfect.

113
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,990
So let's open our studio spiders 3 inside the chapbooks virtual environment.

114
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,200
Perfect.

115
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,520
Now welcome to spider.

116
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,370
For those of you who are discovering it for the first time so I'm going to quickly describe it.

117
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,390
This is the editor.

118
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,220
This is where we will implement the code.

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
This is the console.

120
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,710
This is where the code will be executed.

121
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,600
So for example in the end when we test Shadbolt Well we will see the questions that will answer here

122
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,200
in the council and the chair but answers as well.

123
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,730
All right.

124
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,390
And then here you have another window that welcomes three features.

125
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,670
Explorer which contains all your files.

126
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,310
That's important we'll see the second variable Explorer which will contain all the variables that you

127
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:26,260
create during the implementation and help to get some help about the different objects we use or create.

128
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,010
All right.

129
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,320
So the first thing we're going to do now and that's very important is to get rid of this term that fell

130
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,800
by opening at the top you click on file and you file so you open a new file and then you get rid of

131
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,430
this by clicking on close tab here.

132
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,980
All right then what you're going to do is you're going to go to fully explore and I recommend to create

133
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,530
a new folder in desktop.

134
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,600
That's what I did.

135
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,770
I created the deep end LP is that folder.

136
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,730
You can just go deep in and if you want or any other name but that will be the folder that will contain

137
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,270
the python files that will implement.

138
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,030
Basically that's the father that will contain the checkbook.

139
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,210
And also very importantly this folder will contain the data set that we will download in the next tutorial.

140
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,010
So let's open it.

141
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,060
There is nothing inside because I'm starting from scratch with you.

142
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,840
We're going to do the whole implementation from scratch together.

143
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,070
And therefore that's why it's empty right now.

144
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,970
So what we're going to do is save this new python file that we just created and we're going to call

145
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:39,390
it shut but that way and this will be the file that will contain the whole implementation of the child

146
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,920
the four parts of the Shadbolt including how we build it how we train it and how we test it.

147
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,550
All right.

148
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,720
And so this voucher that you will you will of course save it in your deep end LP is that for them that

149
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,870
you just created.

150
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:02,100
So that's why and going into it deep in LP is that and then you just need to click on safe.

151
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,830
All right.

152
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,690
And there we go.

153
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,160
Now you're ready to start.

154
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,120
So we can remove all this.

155
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:20,780
We can give a nice title to our file we can call it building a chat but with deep and I'll be all right

156
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,450
you can click on Save and there we go.

157
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,280
Now you're ready like me to start the implementation.

158
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,140
Now your folder contains the shadow that I fell in which will implement the whole model and now what

159
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,630
we need of course is the data set on which will train the checkbook.

160
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,080
And that's what we'll get in the next tutorial.

161
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,020
And until then and depend on the.
