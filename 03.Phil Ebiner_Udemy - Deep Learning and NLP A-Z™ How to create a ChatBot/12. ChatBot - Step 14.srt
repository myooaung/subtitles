00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,790
Highs and welcome to this new tutorial and this one which is going to be quick and easy we're going

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,010
to create the inverse dictionary of the answers were in dictionary.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,340
Why do we need to do that.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,420
That's because we will need inverse mapping from the integers to the answers words in the implementation

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,820
of the sectors like model.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,960
And we actually just need for the answers words in dictionary and not the questions word.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,160
So this will be very quick.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,030
And the other reason why I wanted to make it a separate tutorial is that in Python you have to know

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,330
the trick to Inv. a dictionary that is to get the inverse mapping of a dictionary and put that in the

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,060
dictionary because you will need to do that a lot whether you are doing deep learning an LP or other

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,690
kind of coding.

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,330
You need to know the trick to Inv. a dictionary.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,840
And so since we needed here I think that's perfect for you to get the trick.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,900
So let's do it.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,080
It's actually going to take one line of code it's very easy to do once you know the trick.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,150
And we need to start by choosing a name for that dictionary because we're creating a new dictionary

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,620
which will be the inverse dictionary of the answers words to in dictionary.

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,740
So well you can guess what this name of the dictionary is going to be since we're doing the inverse

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,880
mapping we're mapping from the answers integers to the word and therefore we're going to call that dictionary

20
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,460
answers.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,040
And two word.

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,780
All right.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,510
That's our new dictionary.

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,440
And the trick now to invert a mapping is just to do this.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,150
Dictionaries are always in brackets like that.

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,490
But then we're going to make a for loop inside these brackets.

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,110
And so what we're going to do is introduce a new variable here which will be one of the loop variables.

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:53,280
Then I'm going to call w underscore II because it corresponds to word integers.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,070
So that's going to be the integers of the word.

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,720
In this new dictionary.

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,670
So w underscore I call an then W. which will correspond to the word.

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:09,820
And now it's important to understand that w underscore I corresponds to the values of the dictionaries.

33
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,480
And w here corresponds to the key and the fires to this new dictionary.

34
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,060
All right.

35
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,290
And then we need to start to follow up.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:30,360
So we are here for then we need to take our words again w Cunha R word integers w underscore I and these

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,470
guys we're going to take them from our previous dictionary that we're trying to inverse the mapping

38
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,000
and that is the answers words to and dictionaries.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,290
I'm going to take that here.

40
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,110
Copy and paste that here.

41
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:53,460
Answers words to it but then be careful to make sure we get w that is the words which are the key identifiers

42
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:00,930
in the previous dictionary and the words integers W. underscore I which are the values of the same Brydges

43
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:01,990
dictionary.

44
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:09,900
Well we need to get them by adding that items and parenthesis by adding that items parenthesis we will

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,840
get separately the words.

46
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,540
That is the key identifiers and the words integers that is the values of the dictionary are right and

47
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:24,390
then that said you now know how to inverse the mapping of a dictionary by creating and one which is

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,010
the inverse dictionary.

49
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,860
So perfect let's execute this.

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,030
There we go.

51
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,620
Executed and now we have our inversed dictionary for the answers we can have a look.

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,470
Where is it.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,950
It is actually write here answers in two word will look and perfect this is exactly what we want.

54
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,850
As you can see now the keys are the integers.

55
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,110
And for each of these keys we have different words.

56
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,340
So we clearly have a mapping from unique integers to unique words.

57
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,760
So that's perfect.

58
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,100
We now got where we wanted which will I remind be useful for the implementation of the sectors.

59
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,140
So we're done with this new step.

60
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,980
Now we're going to move on to the next step.

61
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,740
It's almost over we have three or four steps left.

62
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:19,790
We now need to add the end of string token the iOS that we created in the previous tutorial.

63
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,170
This one here to the end of every answer.

64
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,660
And that's very important because that's for the decoding part of the SEC the SEC and the decoding part

65
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,970
of the SEC the SEC 22 and the decoding with this POS token and the string.

66
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,350
So we need to add this to the end of every answer we'll make a quick follow up for that.

67
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,300
That will be easy.

68
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,460
And then we'll move on to the last two big steps of this data processing part.

69
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,470
And by the way this natural language processing part because we're clearly doing some natural language

70
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,280
processing that will considerably improve the training process.

71
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,110
So we'll do that in the next tutorials.

72
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,900
And until then and the penalty.
