00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.830
In the last couple of videos you were able to place the car above the concrete in this demonstration.

2
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.130
I want you to focus on the car and the way I'm moving my device if I orient my device to the left and

3
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.590
start the car the car is wheels oriented to the left and move in that direction.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.130
If I orient my device to the right and start the car the car as wheels orient to the right and move

5
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.470
in that direction as well orienting and moving the car's wheels is based on how you orient your Felon.

6
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.830
And this is accomplished with the help of an accelerometer chip that's inside of your film.

7
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.820
So inside of X code the Klare a function called set up accelerometer funk set up accelerometer

8
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.400
with no argument type and no return value.

9
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.950
And call this function inside of you did load.

10
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.340
So right here just right.

11
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.570
Self does set up take Celera.

12
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.350
Back to your function.

13
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.730
What does an accelerometer even do.

14
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.630
I'll explain this in a bit but just know that to know how our phone is oriented we need accelerometer

15
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.170
data to access the accelerometer data.

16
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.210
We need a motion manager.

17
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:33.520
So first import or motion and declare a constant motion manager let Moshin manager is equal to CM motion

18
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.120
manager inside of your set up accelerometer function right.

19
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.270
If Moshin manager is accelerometer available this is pretty self-explanatory.

20
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.100
If there is an accelerometer available on your device if your device even has an accelerometer then

21
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.210
proceed with this block of code.

22
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:11.300
Otherwise else prints expense block print accelerometer not available.

23
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.870
You can air handle this any way you want.

24
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.880
I'm just going to leave a print statement.

25
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.600
Now assuming that we do have an accelerometer I'm pretty positive that my device does.

26
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.920
What does an accelerometer even do.

27
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.350
So in this Fillon there is an accelerometer chip the accelerometer chip measures acceleration that's

28
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.200
caused by motion.

29
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.510
Right now the phone and myself are standing still.

30
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.810
There is no acceleration that's being caused by motion since the phone is not moving.

31
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:51.380
However there is one acceleration that's being applied to the film and the acceleration that the accelerometer

32
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.950
is detecting right now is the acceleration due to gravity.

33
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.910
Here's how it works.

34
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.370
Right now the phone is straight up and the force of gravity goes straight down.

35
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.810
So 100 percent of the force of gravity is being applied in the y direction of the foam.

36
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.280
The vertical direction.

37
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.520
So the accelerometer will conclude that gravity is pulling down on the film such that the phone has

38
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.200
an acceleration due to gravity.

39
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.350
That's completely in the y direction in the vertical direction.

40
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.240
If I rotate my phone 45 degrees such that it's not up but it's halfway up.

41
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.030
And it's also halfway down.

42
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.220
Gravity comes down on the phone at an angle.

43
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.130
So the accelerometer inside of the film will conclude that gravity is pulling down the phone such that

44
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.750
the phone has an acceleration due to gravity.

45
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.250
That's 45 degrees in the wind direction and 45 degrees in the x direction.

46
00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:04.130
If I rotate my phone a full 90 degrees such that the film is now completely horizontal 100 percent of

47
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.790
the gravitational force is being applied in the x direction of the phone.

48
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.940
The horizontal direction.

49
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.610
So just think of this part as the vertical direction and this is the horizontal direction of the phone.

50
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.650
The horizontal part of the phone is where gravity is being applied.

51
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.900
So the accelerometer will conclude that gravity is pulling down on the phone such that the phone has

52
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.050
an acceleration due to gravity that's completely horizontal in the x direction and there is nothing

53
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.420
going on in the y direction.

54
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.520
So how do we observe this that 2 x code.

55
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.390
First we want the accelerometer inside the phone to start detecting acceleration that's applied on the

56
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.230
phone.

57
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:54.910
In our case acceleration due to gravity to do the right motion manager does start accelerometer updates

58
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.090
to is going to be the main thread.

59
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.240
Everything is going to happen on the main.

60
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.920
Q With hÃ¤ndler call the first argument accelerometer data and the second argument is the error that

61
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.500
occurs if there is an error.

62
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.880
So if there is an error if error is equal to error then print error or adult localized description

63
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.270
you can handle this any way you want.

64
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.010
Again I'm just going to leave a print statement and return.

65
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.200
So if there is no error and the accelerometer starts detecting the acceleration on the phone it's going

66
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:44.110
to update us on what the acceleration is in the form of accelerometer data.

67
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.830
So by reading motion manager got an accelerometer a day interval

68
00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:02.970
is equal to one over 60 this function will get triggered 60 times a second to prove that right here

69
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.190
print accelerometer

70
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.770
is detecting acceleration run the up

71
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.840
this print statement keeps getting triggered and it's happening 60 times a second.

72
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.630
The accelerometer is detecting and updating us on the acceleration 60 times a second.

73
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.890
So back to X code whenever this block of code gets triggered.

74
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.680
So whenever the accelerometer updates us on the phone's acceleration we need to use this data.

75
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.590
So we declare a function called phunk accelerometer the change with argument.

76
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.410
Acceleration of type C and acceleration.

77
00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.110
It's not going to have a return value.

78
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.310
And call this function inside of your block by writing self accelerometer in past your accelerometer

79
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:14.290
data by writing accelerometer data acceleration and inside of your accelerometer change function.

80
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:22.220
Print the acceleration acts as well as the acceleration dot Y and leave an empty print statement right

81
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.440
after.

82
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.140
So acceleration X is going to equal how much gravity is being applied in the horizontal face of the

83
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:36.110
film the horizontal direction of the film if acceleration x is equal to 1.

84
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.190
That means all the gravity is being applied in the x direction.

85
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.690
So the phone is completely horizontal if it equals zero.

86
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:52.100
That means no gravitational force is being applied in the x direction the horizontal direction acceleration

87
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.550
not y is going to equal how much gravity is being applied in the vertical direction.

88
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:04.910
Once again if the acceleration y equals one that means all the gravity is being applied in the vertical

89
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:11.900
direction the y direction if it equals zero that means there is no gravitational force being applied

90
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.590
in the vertical direction.

91
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.030
So run the app to see this in action.

92
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.990
And I'm getting an error which is telling me that this is an optional type.

93
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:28.350
So just unwrap it and rerun the OP right now.

94
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.750
My phone is completely vertical so the gravitational force is being completely applied to the vertical

95
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.860
face of the phone.

96
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:43.190
The why and notice in the debugger how the Y acceleration is very close to negative 1.

97
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:50.980
It's basically negative 1 However there is no gravitational force that's being applied in the horizontal

98
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.930
direction.

99
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.250
And notice how the x acceleration is very close to zero.

100
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.890
It's basically zero.

101
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.000
So all the gravity is being applied to the vertical part of the phone.

102
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.940
And there is no gravity being applied on the horizontal.

103
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:13.060
Now you might be asking yourself why is this negative one and not one.

104
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:20.020
I did say before that if the acceleration up y is equal to one that means that all the gravity is being

105
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.310
applied in the y direction will all the gravity is still being applied in the wind direction.

106
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.930
The negative you see right now simply means a change in direction.

107
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:37.900
The accelerometer changes the direction of how the phone is experiencing gravity based on how the phone

108
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.290
is oriented.

109
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.090
If I rotate my phone just died it's upside down.

110
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:49.910
The phone is still completely vertical and we're still experiencing a full gravitational force in the

111
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.770
vertical.

112
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:56.080
It doesn't matter if the number one or the number close to 1 is negative or positive.

113
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.750
Notice in the debugger the horizontal acceleration is very close to zero.

114
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:08.000
Since the phone is completely vertical if I rotate my phone such that it's completely horizontal.

115
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.020
The gravitational force is being applied completely to the horizontal part of the phone and nothing

116
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.600
on the vertical part.

117
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.650
So I notice in the debugger the x acceleration this time is very close to one.

118
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:27.090
So all of the gravitational acceleration is being applied to the x direction of the phone.

119
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.920
The fire rotate my phone 45 degrees.

120
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.510
So about half way

121
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:42.320
half of the gravitational force is being applied in the x direction and the other half is being applied

122
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.140
to the vertical part of the phone.

123
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:53.540
Notice both the x and y accelerations have very similar values almost equal.

124
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.510
If I rotate my phone closer to the vertical

125
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.360
more gravitational force is being applied to the vertical part of the phone and less is being applied

126
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.860
in the horizontal.

127
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.920
Notice in the debugger the vertical acceleration is very close to negative 1 whereas the horizontal

128
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.720
one is 0.3 more close to zero.

129
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:26.660
If I rotate my phone closer to the horizontal but not completely horizontal there is more gravitational

130
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.720
force being applied in the horizontal part of the phone than there is in the vertical.

131
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:38.100
Notice in the debugger how the horizontal acceleration is point 8 which is very close to 1.

132
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.880
And how the vertical one is very close to zero.

133
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.790
So the trend is very simple.

134
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:51.610
The closer your phone is to being vertical The higher your vertical acceleration the closer it is to

135
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:57.040
being horizontal The higher your horizontal acceleration.

136
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.580
I hope you've memorized the pattern by now.

137
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.710
So now we're able to detect how the phone is oriented based on the force of gravity that's being applied

138
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.510
on the phone.

139
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.580
Now remember this demonstration.

140
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.090
I explain that if I orient my film to the right the phone moves to the right.

141
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.940
So on and so forth.

142
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.850
So now that we know how the form is oriented at all times we can now move the car according to how we're

143
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.570
orienting the phone.

144
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.380
We'll do that in the next video.
