WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.890
And the last video we created our room into which the user will go inside.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.780
Once he enters the portal in this video we're going to create the illusion that the user is going inside

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.580
a whole new world.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.600
First off we must place our room on a horizontal surface now placing an object on a horizontal surface

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.090
that sounds like something we did for the Ikea OP.

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.580
In fact that was a huge portion of our Ikea hit testing.

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.680
The idea was that whenever the user top on the horizontal surface the object would appear on that surface.

8
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:47.620
So before going into your next challenge let me just declare a type gesture recognizer top gesture recognizer

9
00:00:49.780 --> 00:01:00.790
is equal to UI type gesture recognizer with Target self and the action function to be triggered will

10
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.410
be handled top.

11
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:13.540
So phunk handle top with arguments center of type UI type gesture recognizer and no return value back

12
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.160
to your action right selector Hendel tap

13
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.410
and make sure to expose handle top to Objective C for this to work.

14
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.860
And finally just write yourself a scene view don't add gesture recognizer top gesture recognizer.

15
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.260
So every time you tap the scene view this will get triggered.

16
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.720
Now here's your challenge.

17
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.090
This is something you've done before inside of the handle top function.

18
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.650
Do a hit test.

19
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.170
If the user clicks on a horizontal surface a print tapped on a horizontal surface.

20
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.290
Otherwise it should print top nothing.

21
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.000
Pause the video and give this one a try.

22
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:14.630
So first off declare the scene view that the user tapped on by card letting scene view is equal to is

23
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.290
equal to sender view as far as s see and view.

24
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.570
Now check worthy user top on the scene view by reading light touch.

25
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.070
And I seem to have forgotten to put my else return across.

26
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.640
So after declaring the scene that you tap Tallin let.

27
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.540
Touch location is equal to sender that location inside of the seam that you touched.

28
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.340
So now do a test that checks if the touch location the top location matches that of a horizontal surface.

29
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.780
By writing a hit test result is equal to seen view.

30
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:10.700
Hit test touch location types dot existing plane using extent this chucks.

31
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.540
If the location that you touched in the scene view matches the location of a plane a horizontal surface.

32
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.020
If the touch location doesn't match the location of an existing plane then this test array will have

33
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.810
one element of results.

34
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.320
That element being the result of what you touched so if hit test result is not empty.

35
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.870
Make sure to add the exclamation mark to reverse the boolean check such that if it does result is not

36
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.120
empty.

37
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:53.340
So if we do have results then we're going to add our where otherwise else and we don't really need this

38
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.250
statement.

39
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.500
I'll just leave it as a reference.

40
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.320
So if there are results if we indeed touched a horizontal surface we need to load our scene exactly

41
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.540
where that surface was detected.

42
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:16.980
So make a function func add portal with argument.

43
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.190
Hit test result of type a.r.

44
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.340
Hit test result

45
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:35.530
and pass your test results right here by writing self portal test result.

46
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.560
So if the results array is not empty if we did indeed touch a plane we're going to add the portal to

47
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.180
that plane to add the portal first.

48
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.900
The portal seen by writing let portal seen.

49
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.390
I seem to have an error and the air is that after I passed the element of results that we got from our

50
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.070
head test.

51
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.220
And we should be good to go from here.

52
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.690
Now if you're confused about head tests in any way make sure to revisit the Ikea section.

53
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.570
We went over them in great depth anyway.

54
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:20.390
If we do indeed detect a plane let portal's seen is equal to see and seen and the name of the scene

55
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.010
is simply the following portal.

56
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:32.570
CN but there is one thing we forgot to do is the scene must be in a folder and as and assets folder

57
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.820
for us to be able to load it.

58
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.650
We explain that in the top the jellyfish section anyway.

59
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:48.460
I add a new file to our project and try to find the CN assets folder which would just be the acid catalog

60
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.820
and call this portal so this is our portal door.

61
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.460
I see an assets not X-C assets.

62
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.570
Change the name of that and drag your portal.

63
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.160
For some reason it crashed on me

64
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.700
what we should be get to go right now drag your portal dot scene into your portal dot se and assets

65
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.770
and back into your view controller.

66
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.740
Right.

67
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.870
Let portal scene is equal to ICN scene.

68
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.670
Named to access our scene.

69
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:34.950
First go to your portal dot CN asset folder slash our portal dot seen such copy and paste this portal.

70
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.830
I see it now that we loaded our scene.

71
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:45.480
We need to load the node that's inside of the scene and the portal is an immediate child of the scenes

72
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.360
root node.

73
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:58.130
So back to our view controller right left the portal node is equal to Portal seen a root node child

74
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:04.510
node with that name the name of our node is I think just portal's.

75
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:12.110
So just copy and paste that into your name and recursively will be false since the portal is an immediate

76
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.760
child of the scene views the root node.

77
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.100
Now that we loaded our node we need to place the know to right on top of the plane that we detected.

78
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.170
How do we know where that plane is located while it's in our test results.

79
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:36.480
So right let's transform is equal to hit test result that world transformed.

80
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:44.170
This test contains a transform matrix world transform which encodes the position of the planar.

81
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.560
Now right let plain exposition.

82
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.720
So the exposition of our surface the positions are all encoded in the third position of the transforms.

83
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.600
So right transform the three.

84
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:10.050
So the third column that X left plane y position is equal to transform dot 3 dot Y and let plane Zad

85
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:16.600
position is equal to transform three dots on.

86
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.300
And I seem to have made an error.

87
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.910
It should be transformed.

88
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.060
Columns 3.

89
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.540
So do that for every single one.

90
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.160
And where should we get to go anyway.

91
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:35.070
Position the portal exactly where the plane is located by writing portal node.

92
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.980
That position is equal to A C and a vector of.

93
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.410
The exposition will be the position of the surface that we detected at the horizontal position.

94
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.200
The same thing for the vertical and these that position.

95
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:59.940
Finally just add our known to the scene view by writing self does scene view the scene root node and

96
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.310
child node portal node and make sure to unwrap it.

97
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.150
Since I am sure that the node is named portal run the app

98
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:19.250
wait till the world origin loads once your world origin loads trying to attack the horizontal surface

99
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:21.190
right here.

100
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.770
No tap on that surface.

101
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.530
And there is our room.

102
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.120
This is pretty cool.

103
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:35.460
Right here inside of this room we're going to display our virtual world.

104
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:48.800
So if I go to Google right here on Google Chrome and I type Kuban up right onto Google images these

105
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.720
are all images that if you cut them up into pieces six pieces one two three four five and six they will

106
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.490
cover the dimensions of a cubic room.

107
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.290
The Cube map that I used for my portal is this one.

108
00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:12.790
So if you were to print this picture and cut off all the white and fold this cube up it would form a

109
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.120
perfect cube which is essentially what our room is.

110
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.950
It's a cube.

111
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.950
So once you find the cube map you want to use.

112
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.720
We're going to use this one after we finished our portal app you should try and use other cube maps

113
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.710
to fit the dimensions of your room like this one is really cool.

114
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.630
Or that one to do all that.

115
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:38.640
Once you download your cube map whichever one you choose you would put it into Photoshop or sketch and

116
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.380
cut it into pieces.

117
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.990
Then you would resize those pieces such that they fit the dimensions of your room.

118
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.740
Now this is not a photoshop or sketch course so I already did all that for you using this cube map.

119
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.420
It's in your resources folder.

120
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.150
So make sure to access it once you download your folder.

121
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:03.960
Make sure to open it up and I'm going to drag all of these image folders right under the CN assets folder

122
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.410
in our ex-coach project.

123
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.970
So just drag them all right on to here.

124
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.540
And there you go.

125
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:21.460
Now how did I know that this image would represent the top the ceiling and this would be the image that

126
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.020
occurs on the side.

127
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.290
Well if you're not a very visual person here's what you do.

128
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:33.610
Print this into an actual piece of paper cut off the white and fold this into a cube.

129
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.090
Now rotate your cube such that your sky is on top.

130
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.710
Which makes sense since the sky should be on top and your patch of grass right here is on the bottom.

131
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:50.150
Then according to the cube that you folded you can then label which part of the cube is on the side.

132
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.240
Which part of the cube is in the back etc..

133
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.850
And once you've identified which part of your cube map will form the ceiling which part will form the

134
00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.730
bottom etc..

135
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.720
Then you can go into Photoshop.

136
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.830
Start cutting them up etc..

137
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.240
So first off I want to start with the ceiling and the floor.

138
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.690
We're going to add these images to our floor and ceiling.

139
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:25.570
So back to your view controller make a function called IDE plane phunk plane with argument node name

140
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.780
of type String portal node of type.

141
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.040
I see a node and image name

142
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.400
of type string.

143
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:52.660
Call this function inside of portal by writing self dot plane and the first note that we want to add

144
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.440
an image to is our roof.

145
00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:01.360
So go to your portal dot seen to know the name of our node that is a roof and the name is simply your

146
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.100
roof.

147
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.730
So copy and paste that right here.

148
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.570
The portal node itself is simply the portal node.

149
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:17.730
Unwrap it actually would I unwrap it right here and simply write portal node in the image name we're

150
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.880
going to give the roof.

151
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.300
Is this one right here.

152
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.540
So top is the name of our image.

153
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:32.860
Now to give this function some logic and I still have an air port on Node is still an optional.

154
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.840
So make sure to forcefully unwrap this as well let's remove these as well since it's not an optional

155
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.030
anymore and we should be good to go.

156
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.200
OK.

157
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:48.030
Now we want to give the floor its image so right self don't add plane the node name of our floor.

158
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:54.950
I'm not too sure what it is solemnised go back to my sig file and the name is simply plain.

159
00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:03.590
But let me just make sure that this is the floor that I'm pointing at play play back to our perspective

160
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.760
and it is indeed the floor.

161
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.400
Let me Arrhenius the floor.

162
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.250
Copy and paste this name right into my no name.

163
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.820
The portal node is the portal node itself in the image name of our floor will be bottom.

164
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:19.730
This one right here.

165
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.970
This patch of grass OK.

166
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.700
Now let's give this function some logic inside.

167
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:37.140
Let child so the child of the portal whether it's the roof or the floor is equal to Portal node child

168
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:44.540
node with name no name whether it's the name of the roof or the floor.

169
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.530
And what should recursively be true or false.

170
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:55.110
While the floor and the roof if you go into your portal scene there are not immediate children of the

171
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.070
portal their immediate children of the red carpet.

172
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:06.810
So place recursively as true since we wanted to check the entire subtree of the portal node in order

173
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.620
to identify the roof or the floor.

174
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.860
Once you load either the roof or the floor which ever one of these is getting triggered.

175
00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:23.990
Set its image to be its respective image name by writing child geometry.

176
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:33.130
The first material diffuse dark contents is equal to you eye an inch named.

177
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:42.230
I'm not sure where it is right here and now accessed the images by first going into the folder portal.

178
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.690
Don't see any assets.

179
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:54.630
Since our images are inside the folder and from there put in your image name whether it's top or bottom.

180
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.320
Punji

181
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:05.770
and we're done with the roof and the floor should now be given their respective images.

182
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.220
Run the up.

183
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.580
Wait till the world origin loads.

184
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.790
Start detecting a horizontal surface and there is a portal.

185
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.110
Walk into your portal

186
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.000
there is our sky in our grassland.

187
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.170
Now we need to fill these walls.

188
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:43.270
So back into your view controller copy and paste this function and instead of it being called a plane

189
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.120
call it a waltz.

190
00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:53.640
Since we're going to give the walls their respective images and inside of portal Let's start adding

191
00:16:53.730 --> 00:17:02.570
the images for the walls so self taught was the first node name were going to change is I guess the

192
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.650
back wall.

193
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:09.400
So get the name of the back wall which is just back wall itself.

194
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:16.770
Copy and paste the node name the portal notice simply the portal node itself the image name we're going

195
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.980
to give for the back wall is back up Yunji.

196
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.950
So put back

197
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:33.210
now I should change one of the sidewalls so self don't add walls the no names of the side wall.

198
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.820
I'm not too sure what they are.

199
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:44.050
So let me just go to my scene and side wall a for example is what we should change the portal node is

200
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.550
simply the portal node the image name for side wall.

201
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.210
I chose to be side of this image right here.

202
00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:02.760
Now for a side wall b is just going to have the image name side B.

203
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.800
And finally to change the images of either side doors.

204
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.680
Let's just see what they're named in our seen file.

205
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.980
So a side door and side door beat.

206
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.110
And we just copy side door a first.

207
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:22.790
So self-taught walls side door a portal node itself.

208
00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.120
And the image name is just side

209
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:39.870
and now do the same thing for side door B simply change it to be here and here and before running the

210
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.650
app this should be side door a North Side.

211
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.190
This should be side door B.

212
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:52.480
Ok so now we've successfully filled every single part of our room with a cube map image.

213
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.940
We're finally done.

214
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.110
So run the app.

215
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.450
Wait till your world origin loads.

216
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:06.120
Once the world origin loads try and detect a horizontal surface der's one right here.

217
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.750
Press on it and the portal pops up.

218
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.490
Now let's go inside the portal

219
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.650
and it's like I'm inside of a new world.

220
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.610
Notice how all of the images blend so well.

221
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:31.610
There are many different kinds of worlds that you can create with the portal you could create the illusion

222
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.910
that the user is going inside of a new city or something.

223
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.330
You would have to make the room a lot bigger.

224
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.740
And make or find a cube map which embodies the background of a city.

225
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.110
There are a lot of possibilities with this.

226
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:50.440
Even with the portal we have right now you could have made the room a lot bigger which would have better

227
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.580
represented this world in the sky.

228
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.000
But for now I'm going to leave the dimensions the same since they're easier to work with.

229
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.240
You can resize it any way you want.

230
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:06.010
After we're done with the app finally we need to create the illusion that the user is going inside of

231
00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.320
a portal not a room.

232
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.130
So we need to make these walls invisible from the outside.

233
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.980
We'll do that in the next video.
