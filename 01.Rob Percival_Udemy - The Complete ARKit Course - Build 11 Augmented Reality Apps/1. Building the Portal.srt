1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:05,650
In this section we're going to make our portal.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,480
This is one of the cooler AAPS right in front of me at the moment is a portal.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,060
If I go into the portal I'm inside of a whole new world.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,360
To start making you school project create the project.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,170
A single application called the project a our portal press next.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,360
And create like always the first thing you want to do is go to the main storyboard and to your initial

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:50,120
view controller and scene if you expand the arcade scene view to the edges of your controller and once

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,290
you do that pin it to the bottom top leading and trailing space

9
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,310
you should already know how to get this kit.

10
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,420
If you working once you are on the up.

11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,950
We've done it plenty of times for the sake of practice.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,530
Pause the video and you try setting it up.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,480
Assuming you've tried it this is what you should have done First off open up the assistant editor and

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,780
link to a kit scene.

15
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,450
View to your Wii controller with an outlet called Scene view.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,480
Import A-R kit to use the air framework.

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,460
Once you do so close the assistant editor and back to your view controller.

18
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:40,910
Declare a constant configuration equal to a world tracking session configuration.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,150
Now you must run a scene view session with that configuration by writing self-taught scene view the

20
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,380
session run configuration.

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,260
We've done this a million times and another thing we've done a million times is adding debug options

22
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:03,590
to our scene view by writing self-deceit view debug options is equal to an array type of debug options.

23
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,640
They are seeing debug options that we want to show the world origin.

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,460
So we want to know where our starting position is at all times.

25
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,410
And we also want to show feature points last week go to year end for the list and declare the property

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,650
privacy camera or use that description to display an alert to the user prompting him to enable the camera

27
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,070
and give de-lurked a descriptive message by writing.

28
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:39,400
You need the camera to display cool cat conta.

29
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,080
Now that we're done with all of this let's get to the good stuff.

30
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,830
I just reran the final version of this up.

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,110
If I keep tapping the phone the portal never shows up.

32
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:57,210
However if I detect a horizontal surface then tap on that surface the portal shows up right on top of

33
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,530
the surface.

34
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,100
So first off you need to set up the configuration such that it can detect horizontal surfaces.

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
Small hint.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,010
It's only one line of code.

37
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,960
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

38
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,940
OK we've done this before.

39
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,310
It's as simple as writing self configuration.

40
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,870
DUP plane detection is equal to the horizontal.

41
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,470
Now we're detecting horizontal surfaces.

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:33,030
Now to the main storyboard I had a label on top of the kids seen kid view right over here.

43
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:45,260
Align the label horizontally and position it below 40 pixels from the top called the label plane detected.

44
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,100
Or give it a text of plain detected and in the attribute inspector.

45
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,250
I'm just going to give the label a font of Avenir next.

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:04,520
So keep it as plain and go to your font family Avenir next right here and the style will be a bold font

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,090
with a font size of about 30.

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,910
Or this is a little too big maybe 25 or 22.

49
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,520
There you go.

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Done.

51
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,130
Open up the assistant editor and connect the label to the view controller with an outlet.

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:30,750
The label will be called plain detected close the assistant editor and back into your storyboard make

53
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:40,000
the label hidden first so only when we detect a horizontal surface we want to unhide the label and show

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,010
it for only 3 seconds.

55
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:49,360
This is something we already did in our Ikea up thanks to a special delegate function so paused the

56
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,700
video and try to do this one yourself.

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,010
OK assuming you've tried it first off.

58
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,470
Inherit from S and every delegate.

59
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:14,250
Once you do this call the delegate function did add anchor in the plains section of this course we discussed.

60
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:21,870
Whenever an anchor is added this function gets triggered an anchor is simply information.

61
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,200
This information as we discussed before encodes an orientation position and size of something in the

62
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,260
real world.

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:36,420
More specifically if this anchor that was added is a plain anchor then it would give us the orientation

64
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,780
position and size of a horizontal flat surface in the world that it just detected.

65
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,170
We don't care about the position size and all that.

66
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,850
All we care about is did we detect a planet or not.

67
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,360
So just right guard anchor is of type A are playing anchor.

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,150
Else return

69
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,950
so if the anchor that was added is a plain anchor if we discovered a horizontal plane surface then unhide

70
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,850
the label.

71
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:13,910
So self the plane detected is hidden is equal to false

72
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,840
and after three seconds hide the label again.

73
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,540
So just write dispatch.

74
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:33,220
Q Dot main dot async after and the deadline will be done now plus 3.

75
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,530
So after three seconds then execute whatever is inside of here.

76
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,200
And what we want to do is just hide the label again.

77
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,980
So is Hedden will be true.

78
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,260
And finally did add get triggered on a background thread.

79
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,590
So you have to make sure that any UI updates happen on the main thread such as this one.

80
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,090
This one needs to be on a main thread so right dispatch.

81
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Q Does it mean that a sync and put the hidden function right inside of it.

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,940
This one is already happening on a main thread so you can just leave it as it is.

83
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,630
And one more thing to do before running the app is writing self scene view.

84
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,840
Delegate is equal to self for this function to get triggered whenever we detect the plane.

85
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:30,300
So run the app start detecting a horizontal surface as soon as you do your label shows up.

86
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,230
Everything is working out great.

87
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,080
So back to your Wii controller lets start making our portal.

88
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:43,690
So right click on your projects folder click on new file and scroll down until you find the seen file.

89
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:49,380
For some reason mine has already highlighted so press next and I'm going to name the scene file portal

90
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,820
dots on now into your machine file.

91
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,670
First off delete this camera.

92
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,560
Node we don't need it in an empty node to your scene.

93
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,610
Call this empty node portal and into your scene inspector.

94
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:12,030
I'm going to change the background from gray to white.

95
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,410
First off we're going to add the red carpet which leads into the portal.

96
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,110
But before doing that let me just place this exactly in the middle of the scene since it will be easier

97
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,370
to view when navigating between perspectives.

98
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,080
Click on your front perspective.

99
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,000
It's always good to see how something looks like from the front.

100
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,310
Their eyes are empty now.

101
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,480
Right now this is just an invisible node where we're going to add the red carpet to it.

102
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:47,570
Now the red carpet is simply a straight surface a plain straight plane and the plane to the scene.

103
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,900
The material inspector give the plane a diffuse color of red

104
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,110
now paused the video and try to rotate the plane such that its horizontal

105
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,380
so as you learned in the introductory section of this course to rotate something vertically and make

106
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,390
it horizontal.

107
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:25,250
You need to rotate it across the x axis so rotate it 90 degrees and make the plane a child of your note

108
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,860
your portal.

109
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:39,030
Now make sure your red carpet is aligned exactly with your node 0 0 and 0 for the X Y and so now the

110
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,750
plane is aligned horizontally vertically and in depth with our empty node.

111
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:53,420
Finally in the attributes inspector just give the plane a width of 0.5 metres and a height of 2 meters.

112
00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:02,130
This looks much more like a carpet to me name the plain red carpet and our portal essentially is going

113
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,460
to be a small room with our red carpet leading us into that room to make our smaller room.

114
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,330
First we need to make a door opening to make the door opening.

115
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,180
We need two walls surrounding the opening of the door.

116
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,340
We'll use boxes to represent our walls.

117
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,670
So write box and drag two boxes right into your scene.

118
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,280
Give one box let's say a color of green

119
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,020
and give the other box a color of red.

120
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,650
Doesn't matter what color you give it you can give it any color you want.

121
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,070
I'm just giving it colors because it's easier to identify than the default white color which blends

122
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,100
with the scene.

123
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:56,700
And we went in the attribute inspector give each box a word of 0.75 metres a height of two metres and

124
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,930
a length of zero point zero or three metres.

125
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,630
Do the exact same thing for the other box.

126
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:11,430
A what 0.75 metres a height of two metres any length of zero point zero or three metres.

127
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,980
Now position one of the boxes relative to the red carpet by making it a child of the red carpet.

128
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,570
Let me just start with the green box by dragging it under the red carpet.

129
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,090
Now it's a child.

130
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,810
And now let me in just a line.

131
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:32,580
The green box the green wall with all of the red carpets dimensions by just making every one of its

132
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,760
positions 0 0 and 0.

133
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,520
So now the green wall is perfectly aligned with our red carpet horizontally vertically and up.

134
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,510
I need to place this wall to the side of the carpet to what's left.

135
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:57,480
Having done the math earlier if I simply moved the green wall 0.6 to 5 meters to the left of the red

136
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,810
carpet that should be I did it to the right to make sure it's a negative.

137
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,740
It should be exactly beside the carpet.

138
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:15,930
Now as soon as I made this wall a child of this carpet it's X Euler angle was automatically rotated

139
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:24,480
therefore reversing our two axes meaning the blue arrow which represents the y axis and the green arrow

140
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,310
representing the x y and z axis pointing up in the y axis pointing away from the origin.

141
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:38,640
This would suggest that the Zed axis is responsible for vertical positioning whereas the y axis now

142
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,110
is responsible for positioning the node N-words and networks.

143
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,980
Well as soon as we made the wall a child of the carpet it automatically rotated our Greenwald 90 degrees

144
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,460
since its parent node The carpet was also rotated 90 degrees.

145
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,070
So now if I want to position this wall vertically I have to use the z axis for example right now I want

146
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,430
to vertically align the bottom of this wall to the red carpet.

147
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,070
So increase the Zad by 1 metre and it looks like the orientation was reversed as well.

148
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,240
So change this to negative 1 to move it up and there you go.

149
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,370
Now changes in axes and orientation is a bit annoying to work with but it's just one of the things you

150
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,870
have to deal with when working with the editor.

151
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,350
So try to adjust while you can.

152
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,360
Now I need to place the box at the end of the red carpet which is one metre away from the red carpet

153
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,310
center.

154
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:39,680
And weirdly enough to change the y position to move the wall inwards behind the tarpit again it's only

155
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,760
because the orientation of the pivot point was completely reversed do the exact same thing for the otherwhile

156
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:53,750
position at zero point sixty five meters actually before we do any positioning.

157
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:02,280
Make sure it's a child of the red carpet and positioned this wall 0.6 to five metres to the right of

158
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,050
the red carpet.

159
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:12,440
And it was I believe negative 1 meters in words and asked for the Zad negative one metre upwards.

160
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,170
There you go.

161
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:29,540
So right now in the middle of these two walls will be our portal call this box side wall or side door.

162
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,800
And call this box side door B.

163
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,680
These are the signs of our door of our portal.

164
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,800
Essentially for these walls you could have just used planes and everything would have looked fine.

165
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,750
It doesn't really matter.

166
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,030
I'm just diversifying for tutorial purposes.

167
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,900
In fact the roof of the room is going to be a plane.

168
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,580
So right plane and make this plane a child of the red carpet.

169
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,750
It's also going to be positioned relative to the red carpet.

170
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:12,980
And the material inspector give the roof a color of black a diffuse color of black licorice and in the

171
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,370
attribute inspector give it a what of two metres any height of two meters as well.

172
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,540
Call the node roof.

173
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,920
Let me just fix this positioning.

174
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,660
OK.

175
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:35,300
So now move the roof two meters upwards so change the Y to two.

176
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,680
And it looks like the axes were reversed for this one as well which makes sense.

177
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:48,110
So instead of changing the Y to to change the Zad to two and looks like orientation was reversed as

178
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,440
well since the plane went down.

179
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,370
So make sure to put negative to right here.

180
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,560
Negative 2.

181
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,270
And there it is right on top of our portal.

182
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:08,240
And to move the roof two meters inwards behind the red carpet put a negative two for the Y and there

183
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,080
you go.

184
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,230
There is our roof right on top of our walls.

185
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,430
Now we need a floor

186
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,050
now we need our back wall.

187
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,310
So add another box to the scene in the attributes.

188
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:32,110
Inspector give the box a width of two meters a height of two meters and the length of 0.03 a depth of

189
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,290
0.03 to make it thinner and now make it a child node of the carpet.

190
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,540
Give the box any color you want.

191
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,520
I think I'm going to choose a color of lemon yellow and align it with the carpet.

192
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,310
So align it horizontally vertically and in depth.

193
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:04,430
Again the orientation of this box is reversed the way value will be used to move in words whereas the

194
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:10,630
Zed axis will be used for vertical position so move it in words such as three meters behind the red

195
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,860
carpet.

196
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,770
And finally one metre above its current position so negative one.

197
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,020
OK.

198
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,730
There is our back wall perfectly aligned.

199
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,950
Back to the front perspective

200
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,610
before proceeding let me just read in the back wall and now for the for the floor just like the roof

201
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,410
is going to be a plane.

202
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,180
So right.

203
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,700
Plane and add it to our red carpet as a direct child.

204
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,800
The plane was automatically rotated for us which is perfect into your attributes.

205
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:58,370
Inspector make a plane with a width of two meters and a height of two meters just like our roof with

206
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:07,430
a color of black a line horizontally with the red carpet which it already is and align vertically exactly

207
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:14,510
where the red carpet is which it already is and have the Wib to such that the floor is 2 meters away

208
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,260
from the red carpet center.

209
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,410
So negative 2.

210
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,400
There you go.

211
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,950
Now finally we just need the walls on the side so I add two more boxes.

212
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:36,840
Box number one in box number two give the box a with of two meters a height of two meters and a length

213
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:42,050
of 0.03.

214
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,790
Give it a distinct color.

215
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:51,160
I think this time I'm going to go for something like light blue or cyan whatever this colors and make

216
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,280
the box a child of the red carpet as well.

217
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,950
We need to rotate the box horizontally normally to do that.

218
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,700
We would rotate it across the y axis but remember the y and z axes were reversed.

219
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:14,510
So rotate it 90 degrees across the said axis to make it horizontal now place this wall 1 meter to the

220
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,680
left of the red carpet.

221
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,470
So right here you put negative 1 and it should be exactly to the edges of these walls.

222
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,490
Now place one meter above the red carpet so negative one.

223
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:33,490
And as for the white Make sure it's negative 1 meter inwards from the red carpet.

224
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,540
That didn't work out it looks like half of it is out of place so make it two metres in words and there

225
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,560
you go.

226
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,980
Let's do the exact same thing for this wall.

227
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:50,950
A waste of two metres a height of two metres and a depth of zero point zero three meters.

228
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,510
Let's give this box a color of let's say gray silver

229
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:07,070
no make this box a child of the red carpet and rotate the box by 90 degrees horizontally.

230
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:16,920
Place it one metre from the x to the right and two meters in words just like our other wall and one

231
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:25,760
meter upwards and our box should be perfectly aligned with everything and it is rename these both to

232
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,720
side wall a the right will be sidewall.

233
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,390
And the left box will be side will be.

234
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,820
And if I just look at this from the front perspective this looks really good.

235
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:49,230
We're finally done building the blocks of our room and the next video we're going to display this portal

236
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:55,500
in the camera view and create the illusion that the user is going inside an entire new world.
