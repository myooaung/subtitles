00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.660
In this video we're going to look at rotations.

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.110
There are three types of rotations that you can apply to your notes.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.550
There are rotations being pitch ya in row.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.430
So from this picture when you rotate something around the x axis that know that you rotate it rotates

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.630
vertically around itself.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.450
When you rotate something around the y axis that node you rotated rotates horizontally around itself.

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.640
And if we were to rotate a node around its axis that node would rotate clockwise around itself so to

8
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.480
start this off I'm just going to delete all of this code.

9
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.160
We're not going to use it any more.

10
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.610
Do come and tell the code that we made for our house we're going to use it later on in this tutorial

11
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.470
and from scratch I'm going to make a pyramid node so that pyramid is equal to.

12
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.660
I see a node with a geometry of NSC and pyramid such that it has dimensions of 0.1 metres

13
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.570
give it a color of blue by writing pyramid dot geometry stuff for Tiriel thought diffuse contents is

14
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660
equal to you white color blue.

15
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.470
And finally position the pyramid pyramid node position is equal to SDN vector 3.

16
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.940
And we're going to position at it 0.3 meters behind the origin of these that axis.

17
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.110
And finally edged and the pyramid to the senior self does seem view that seen a root node dot child

18
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.540
node.

19
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.070
Pyrmont

20
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.220
So I'm hoping that by now you already know what a pyramid looks like.

21
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.020
Well we're going to do is rotate this pyramid around its x axis.

22
00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.210
The main property that's involved in rotations is called Euler angles right pyramid dot orderings Euler

23
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.640
angles control nodes orientation expressed as pitch and roll.

24
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.370
So make it equal to s c and vector 3 and a rumor that s c and vector 3 simply refers to a three dimensional

25
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.660
vector such that your values are X Y and set fields.

26
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.890
So if I put a value right here then I would be rotating the pyramid around its x axis based on the value

27
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.340
that you put if I put a value for the y axis then the pyramid would rotate horizontally around its y

28
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.470
axis based on the value that you put for the y value.

29
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.320
So on and so forth.

30
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.840
So what if I wanted to rotate this pyramid 90 degrees around itself vertically.

31
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.890
You would think that you would just write 90.

32
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.770
However it doesn't quite work like that.

33
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.470
To rotate the pyramid 90 degrees vertically around itself.

34
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.170
You have to convert this to radians.

35
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.430
So in your resources folder this extension can be used to convert from degrees to radians.

36
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.700
So what this does is that it multiplies the integer that you put in by pi and divides it by a 180 to

37
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.210
convert it to a radius.

38
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.280
All you have to do now is back in your SDN vector 3 right 90 degrees to radians and this converts it

39
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.960
into a double value.

40
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.770
We need it to be a float.

41
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.050
So put it as a float.

42
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:31.380
And now our pyramid is going to vertically rotate 90 degrees around itself to observe this run the app.

43
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.140
And so if I add the pyramid it should be rotated by 90 degrees vertically.

44
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.300
And check it out.

45
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.680
The pyramid was indeed rotated by 90 degrees such that the top of the pyramid is now facing us.

46
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.110
Here's a challenge.

47
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.810
Try and rotate the pyramid such that it's upside down paused the video and give this one a try.

48
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.680
So you've probably done this in high school when you O-Tay something vertically 90 degrees it goes sideways

49
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.510
when you rotate it 180 degrees it goes upside down.

50
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.480
When you rotate it vertically 270 degrees it's sideways as well.

51
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.700
And if you rotate something 360 it just comes back to its original position.

52
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:29.020
So if we rotate it 180 degrees our pyramid should be upside down run the app.

53
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.840
If I add it it should be upside down.

54
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.360
And indeed it is.

55
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.520
And that is all for rotating something vertically around itself.

56
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.150
X code.

57
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.550
Now as we discussed before rotating something around the y axis gives a horizontal rotation.

58
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.310
We rotated our perimeter around the x axis and indeed it gave us a vertical rotation.

59
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.940
Now we want to rotate our node horizontally.

60
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.860
However it's a bit hard to observe horizontal rotation with a permit.

61
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.590
So instead of rotating a pyramid we're going to rotate an SCA plane so give it a geometry of an A C

62
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.390
and plane with a width and height of 0.3 meters instead of calling this pyramid.

63
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.410
Just make it node instead.

64
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:22.710
No geometry no dot position no doubt all our angles and our child know pyramid leave the X rotation

65
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.580
at zero.

66
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.840
We're just going to focus on the pitch rotation the Y rotation.

67
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.020
Now before rotating the plane let me just run the up.

68
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.040
So you're already aware of what a plane looks like.

69
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.140
It's just a vertical surface.

70
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.160
Fire rotate the plane horizontally by 90 degrees.

71
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.490
What do you think will happen.

72
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:57.650
So let's try to put 90 degrees to radians run the app and your plane and there is our plane rotated

73
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.840
90 degrees.

74
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.930
Notice first the plane was facing us and now the plane is facing this direction since we rotated it

75
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.240
by 90 degrees and the wind direction.

76
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.690
Now we're going to look at a Zad rotation the said rotation as we discussed before refers to a clockwise

77
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.220
rotation.

78
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.310
The easiest way to observe that rotation is by declaring a cylinder.

79
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.880
So back into your X code right let plane is equal to A C and cylinder.

80
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:34.520
Remove these arguments and add the C and cylinder arguments give the cylinder a radius of 0.1 metres

81
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.080
and a height of 0.3 meters.

82
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.290
And now the cylinder if I just go to the documentation I see in cylinder you can clearly see that the

83
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.470
cylinder first is facing upwards.

84
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.120
So here's your challenge.

85
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.970
Try and rotate the cylinder clockwise using the Zed field such that the cylinder is sideways.

86
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.660
Pause the video and give it a try.

87
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:08.000
So visually I know that if I rotate the cylinder clockwise by 90 degrees it should go sideways

88
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.440
and run up get 5 cylinder it should be sideways.

89
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.660
And indeed it is.

90
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.350
We just rotated our cylinder clockwise using our Zed field.

91
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.600
So now we looked at rotating nodes in the x y and z axis and now there is only one more thing we have

92
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.870
to look at which is relative rotation relative rotation is very important and it's something we're going

93
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:46.760
to use in many of our apps and this of course most notably the planets up so to our ex-cult project

94
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.990
what if I gave the cylinder a child.

95
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.070
So first off let me just rename all of this so in there since we're not using the plane any more let's

96
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.170
cylinder.

97
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.460
And there you go.

98
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.750
So what if I gave the cylinder a child node.

99
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:14.270
Declare a new node of let's say a pyramid so that pyramid is equal to I see a node with a geometry

100
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:25.690
of n s c and pyramid with width of point 1 height of point 1 a length of point 1 as well.

101
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:32.080
Give the pyramid a color of red by writing pyramid geometry the first material that diffused contents

102
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.250
is equal to you white color red.

103
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.810
And now we're going to make the pyramid a child of the cylinder.

104
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.840
So whatever position we give it is going to be relative to our cylinder.

105
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.950
So pyramid up position is equal to seeing vector 3.

106
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:54.450
We're going to align the pyramid horizontally and vertically to our cylinder.

107
00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:01.560
But we're going to place it zero point five meters behind the cylinder.

108
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.710
Now make the pyramid a child of the cylinder by running cylinder.

109
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.640
Child node Pyrmont.

110
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.760
Before I run the up I'm just going to under rotate the cylinder and make it a little bit smaller a height

111
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.140
of point 1 meters run the up OK.

112
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:27.190
If I have my cylinder in pyramid right now the cylinder is zero point three meters away from the world

113
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.980
origin and the pyramid.

114
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.220
Is there a point five meters away from the cylinder.

115
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.760
Now what would happen if fire rotated the cylinder vertically.

116
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.530
Would this affect the positioning of the pyramid at all.

117
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.760
The answer to that is yes.

118
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:51.220
If you rotate the cylinder node the pyramid which is positioned relative to the cylinder has to preserve

119
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.800
its orientation to the cylinder.

120
00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:01.660
So if you rotate the cylinder vertically by 90 degrees the cylinder is going to rotate 90 degrees around

121
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:10.330
itself and the pyramid is actually going to rotate 90 degrees around the cylinder to preserve its relative

122
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.370
orientation to the cylinder.

123
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.130
So back and next cold we are going to try.

124
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:24.190
So if we rotate the cylinder 90 degrees vertically so flow 90 degrees to radiance and the assumption

125
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:31.020
is that if we rotate the cylinder by 90 degrees 1 the cylinder is going to rotate around itself vertically

126
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.190
by degrees.

127
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:38.740
But at the same time the pyramid which has to preserve its orientation to the cylinder is also going

128
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:44.210
to rotate by 90 degrees but not around itself around the cylinder.

129
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:50.730
So try to soak go in to add my nose and check it out.

130
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:56.310
We rotated the cylinder 90 degrees vertically so that rotated 90 degrees around itself.

131
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.770
And now where is the pyramid.

132
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.480
It's not behind the cylinder like it was before.

133
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.540
Guess what.

134
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:10.900
To preserve its orientation to the cylinder the pyramid had to rotate 90 degrees around the cylinder.

135
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.300
So here's the rule of thumb.

136
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:18.820
If you vertically rotate your parent node around itself the child node is going to vertically rotate

137
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.620
around the parent node to preserve its relative orientation to its parent.

138
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.950
Now what would happen if we rotated our cylinder 90 degrees horizontally.

139
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.650
Well first off it's hard to observe horizontal rotation with a cylinder.

140
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:40.300
So I'm going to convert this to an S CN plane so that the plane has a width of 0.1 metres and a height

141
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:48.570
of 0.1 metres is one meaning the plane every single instance.

142
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.140
And now we're not going to have any plane rotation at all.

143
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.630
We're just going to see how the plane and the pyramid look like without any sort of rotation to kind

144
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.850
of have a before and after.

145
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.980
So run up.

146
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.960
So I'm going to add the two notes.

147
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:12.820
And right now our plane is right in front of us and the pyramid is 0.5 meters behind the plane.

148
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.680
What would happen if I rotated the plane horizontally by 90 degrees.

149
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:25.510
Where would the pyramid be to our X Project rotate the plane horizontally by non degrees by writing

150
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.360
floats 90 degrees to radians.

151
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.570
Now we're going to observe the results.

152
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:40.850
I drew two notes and you can barely see the plane because the plane has no depth and it's facing this

153
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:41.520
way.

154
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.940
There is our plane.

155
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.720
And so the plane rotated 90 degrees around itself.

156
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:55.070
And since the pyramid is a child of plane a pyramid rotated none in degrees around the plane and it's

157
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.490
right here.

158
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:03.120
So another rule of thumb that if you rotate the parent node by a certain angle horizontally the child

159
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.570
node is going to rotate around the parent node at that same angle.

160
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.910
Here is a challenge.

161
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:17.180
Put the plane back to what it was before and try to have it such that the pyramid is under the plane.

162
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.560
Pause the video and give it a try

163
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.590
if you're a visual person you would have concluded the following.

164
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:38.390
If we rotate the plane 90 degrees downwards and the pyramid is going to rotate 90 degrees downwards

165
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.130
around the plane positioning it right under it.

166
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.780
So give this a try of by putting negative 90 degrees to radians.

167
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.000
Floating negative 90.

168
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:58.270
And so the plane is going to rotate vertically negative 90 degrees downwards which is going to have

169
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:06.970
the pyramid to rotate 90 degrees under the plane run the app your to nodes.

170
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.420
We can't see the plane because as we said before the plane has no depth.

171
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.060
And right now the plane is completely horizontal.

172
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.890
So if I go like this there is a plane and right under it should be our pyramid.

173
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.040
And there you go.

174
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.270
Now we're done with relative rotations in the x and y axis.

175
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:33.880
How would a relative rotation work if we rotate the parent node around it said Oxus while the axis differs

176
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.710
from the x and y axis.

177
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:43.680
If you rotate the parent node around it's axis it's going to rotate around itself at the same angle.

178
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:49.840
So put this back to zero and it's hard to observe Zayde rotation with a plane.

179
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:57.240
So put this back to a cylinder right cylinder is equal to C.A. with an S C and cylinder.

180
00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:03.290
Remove these arguments in place the correct arguments for the cylinder such that we have a radius 0.1

181
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.520
metres and a height of about 1 5 meters.

182
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:16.010
We're going to rotate our cylinder by 90 degrees 90 degrees to radians make that into a float.

183
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.680
And now here's what should happen.

184
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:25.610
The cylinder is going to rotate by 90 degrees clockwise around itself.

185
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:32.660
And since the pyramid is a child of the cylinder to preserve its orientation it's also going to rotate

186
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.960
90 degrees around itself and make sure to just replace wherever it's just plain cylinder to get rid

187
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.970
of these errors.

188
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.590
We should be good to go run the EP.

189
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:56.260
I'd like to know is the cylinder rotates 90 degrees around itself and is thus now a horizontal cylinder.

190
00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:03.840
And if I look at the pyramid right behind it it rotated around itself by 90 degrees as well.

191
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.620
Back to your actual project.

192
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.760
Delete the code we have for the cylinder and the pyramid.

193
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.750
Put back the code that we made for our house.

194
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:20.250
What would happen if five vertically rotated the pyramid by 180 degrees such that the pyramid the roof

195
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.930
is upside down.

196
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.090
Would the house just end up looking completely out of shape.

197
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.570
Well we're going to test this by actually placing the pyramid upside down.

198
00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:38.340
Do that by reading node which is what our pyramid is Euler angles is equal to a C and vector 3 and to

199
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:46.890
rotate it vertically we're going to rotate it across x axis by 180 degrees and we're not going to rotate

200
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.180
it around the y axis.

201
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.710
We're not going to rotate horizontally and we're not going to rotate it clockwise either.

202
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.960
So if the pyramid is rotated 180 degrees what will happen.

203
00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.520
We're going to find out.

204
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:07.150
Going to wait to my world origin loads and as soon as it does add your nose and check it out the roof

205
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.660
rotates vertically 180 degrees such that it's upside down.

206
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.220
But our house is still intact.

207
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.450
Why is that.

208
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:16.660
Well think about it.

209
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.290
The pyramid is the parent node of the box.

210
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:26.660
And as I said before the box needs to preserve its relative orientation to the pyramid.

211
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:32.200
And so if you rotate the pyramid by a hundred and eighty degrees the box is also going to rotate by

212
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.460
180 degrees.

213
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:40.750
But around the pyramid to preserve its orientation there for preserving the shape of the house and that's

214
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.500
it for rotations.

215
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.840
Now we're finally done with the introductory part of the course and we can start making some really

216
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.540
cool apps.
