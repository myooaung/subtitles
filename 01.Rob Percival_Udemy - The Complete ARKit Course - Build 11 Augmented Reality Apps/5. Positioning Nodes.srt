1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,710
The last video you were able to set up world tracking system.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,080
The phone always knows its position and orientation as well as its starting position.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,700
In this video you're going to display a box in the physical world such that it's positioned zero point

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,200
three meters away from the starting position the world origin.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:30,160
So first off go to the main storyboard and to the initial of controller add a button to the bottom left.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:39,450
Call the button add and pin it to the bottom left by about 20 pixels from the leading space and from

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:48,160
the bottom space with a width and height of about 80 pixels before constraints.

8
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,210
And I seem to have placed the height of 800 where I should have placed 80 instead.

9
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,210
Let me just fix that in my size inspector and it looks good.

10
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,630
Now back to my attributes.

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,470
Inspector let me place a background color of white OK.

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,340
Open up the assistant editor and link your button to The View Controller with an IAB action called the

13
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,650
IAB action and make sure it's an action not an outlet connect the action.

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,840
Close the assistant editor and back to your view controller.

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,940
This I.B. action gets triggered every time you press the button.

16
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,930
So every time you press it declare a node by writing letter node is equal to C and

17
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,750
so a node is simply a position in space.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,300
It has no shape no size and no color.

19
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:55,800
Put the node inside of the scene view by writing self seeing view does see a root node child node node.

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,290
So the scene is what's displaying the camera view of the real world.

21
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,960
We want to position our node inside of the scene.

22
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:14,210
So this scene has a root node the root node also has no shape no size or color and it's positioned exactly

23
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,370
where your world origin is.

24
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:25,100
So exactly where your starting position is if you make this node A child of the root node then whatever

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,290
position we give this node it's going to be positioned relative to the root node.

26
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,650
OK so now the node is inside of the scene.

27
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,720
And as I mentioned before the node is not visible on its own it's it has no special attributes.

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,020
We need to give it those attributes.

29
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:53,000
So first give it a shape by writing node that geometry is equal to A C and box with a width height and

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,310
length of 0.1 metres and the chamfer radius is simply howl around the edges of your box or the higher

31
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,030
the value the rounder The edges will play with this in the future.

32
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,440
But for now I'm just going to leave it as zero.

33
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,360
So by giving this a value of zero the box will have firm edges because I'm telling the node to take

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,850
away 0 meters from the edges.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,090
Therefore don't take anything away from the I just leave it for now you should give the node A color

36
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:32,690
to do the right node dot geometry dot first material first material defines the appearance of the surface

37
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,490
of our node of our box.

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,660
For that matter I know right.

39
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:44,110
Diffuse the fuse represents the color that spread across the entire surface of our box.

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,590
I'm going to give it a color of blue.

41
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,620
So dark content's is equal to you white color dark blue.

42
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,310
Feel free to give it any color that you want.

43
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,130
So now you gave the Snoad a shape.

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,820
It's a box with dimensions of 0.1 meters and no chamfer radius.

45
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,810
It's going to be a firm box.

46
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,220
And you also gave the node a color that spread across its surface a color of blue.

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,970
The note is also inside of our scene's camera view.

48
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,350
You're only missing one thing.

49
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,910
The node sure is inside of the scenes camera view.

50
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,180
But where is it positioned.

51
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,750
That's right nowhere.

52
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,580
You need to specify the position of the node for going into this.

53
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,540
Let me just run the map and show you something.

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,430
So let me just wait till the phone recognizes its surroundings.

55
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,340
And as soon as it does the world origin should load.

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,180
And here is the world origin.

57
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,720
Remember how I said that the world origin your starting position is actually a coordinate system.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:02,450
While it is the red line you see right here is the x axis the horizontal axis and the green line is

59
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,400
the y axis the vertical axis.

60
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,760
The blue line right here you see is the Zed axis which refers to depth.

61
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,920
How far or how close something is to the origin to the starting position in words or outwards.

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,690
So back to X code we're going to position our node relative to the root node relative to the starting

63
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,650
position.

64
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:41,280
So right node position is equal to a C and vector 3 0 0 and 0 C and vector 3 represents a three dimensional

65
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,460
vector.

66
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,610
We need a three dimensional vector.

67
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:54,330
Since the nodes position is based on three axes the x y and z axes This represents the x value y value

68
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,090
and your side value.

69
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:03,000
So according to what we have right now I will root node is going to be 0 metres away from the x axis

70
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,300
0 meters above the y axis and 0 meters from the said axis.

71
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,000
So basically I were node should be perfectly aligned with our starting position.

72
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,420
Run the up to see if that's the case.

73
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,890
So if I just wait till the phone discovers the area and as soon as it does the world origin loads.

74
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,110
Now where do you think the box will be placed.

75
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,730
If I press add.

76
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,940
That's right the box gets placed exactly where your starting position is since that's what we meant

77
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,790
to do.

78
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:43,440
We placed zero meters from the X-axis zero meters from the Y and zero meters from the Zad making it

79
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,410
perfectly aligned to our starting position.

80
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,950
So now back to X code.

81
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:56,860
What if I were to give the field a value of negative 0.3.

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,630
What will happen is the box will be zero point three meters away from the origin behind it behind it

83
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,360
since we added a negative.

84
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:13,570
If we took off the negative the node would be zero point three meters in front of the world origin.

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,660
Run up.

86
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,880
Let me just wait till the device detects its environment and the world orange loads.

87
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,250
And right here is the world origin.

88
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,630
Now if I press.

89
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,780
What do you think happens.

90
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,590
And there you go.

91
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:39,130
The box is placed in zero point three meters 30 centimeters from the world origin.

92
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:46,820
Now if you look at the blue line like I said before that is these that axis and the said axis controls

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,250
how far or how close something is to the world origin.

94
00:07:51,850 --> 00:08:00,370
And it's pointing away from the box meaning that the box is indeed behind these that axis by 30 centimeters.

95
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,970
Now here's a challenge.

96
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:10,960
Try and have the box be 30 centimeters so 0.3 meters in front of the world origin not behind but in

97
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,480
front and below zero point two meters above give it a try

98
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:32,640
so here's what you would do 0.3 meters in front of these access that would just be a positive value

99
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
for 0.3.

100
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:40,590
And if you want to place something above or below the world origin what you would have to do is change

101
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,810
the y value.

102
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,470
We're going to position relative to the y axis.

103
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:52,300
So two places are point two metres above the origin just put zero point two for the field and you should

104
00:08:52,300 --> 00:09:00,680
be get to go run the app so I'm just going to wait till the phone detect its environment and as soon

105
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,920
as it does the world origin should load right here.

106
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,480
And if I press.

107
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,880
Where do you think the box will be placed.

108
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:15,770
So zero point two meters above the y axis and zero point three meters from the blue line in front of

109
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,260
it.

110
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:26,310
And there is Auerbach's zero point two meters above the y axis and zero point three meters in front

111
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,980
of the blue line the z axis.

112
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,170
Now try and place the box zero point two meters to the right of the world origin.

113
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,220
Pause the video and give this one a try.

114
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,580
So I believe the challenge was to place the box 0.3 meters to the right.

115
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,350
And what's responsible for horizontal alignment is the x axis.

116
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,330
So if you want to place something to the right or to the left of the world origin you have to change

117
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,400
this X field to place something to the right.

118
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,390
The value would be positive to put something to the left the value would be negative.

119
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,750
We want to place it to the right.

120
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,640
So just leave this as a positive and run up.

121
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,350
So as I'm running the app according to this the box should be 0.3 meters to the right 0.2 meters above

122
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,010
and zero point three meters in front of the world origin.

123
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,320
So let me just wait till the world orange and loads while it's detecting its environment.

124
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,040
And I think it just floated right here.

125
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,860
So if I add my box here is what should happen.

126
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,730
The box should be zero point three meters to the right of the world origin.

127
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,400
So let me move to the right zero point two meters above the y axis.

128
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,920
The green line so goes zero point two meters above.

129
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,220
And now if by five point my film is such that it's looking 0.3 meters to the front of the Zad axis.

130
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,790
There is Auerbach's.

131
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,730
So here is your next challenge.

132
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,180
Try and place the box zero point three meters to the left of the world origin zero point two meters

133
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,590
below and zero point five meters behind it.

134
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,860
Pause the video and give this one a try.

135
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:23,590
I believe the challenge was 0.3 meters to the left and what controls horizontal alignment is our X field.

136
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,860
So putting negative zero point three since it's to the left and what controls the vertical alignment

137
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,180
is our y axis the green line put in negative 0.2 for that once it's going to be below with the vertical

138
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,070
y axis and zero point three meters behind that axis.

139
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,590
Just put a negative 0.3 for this.

140
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,780
Actually I believe it was 0.5.

141
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,660
The challenge was OK so run the app.

142
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,730
Ok so let me just wait until the device has a good read on its environment.

143
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,110
As soon as it does the world origin loads.

144
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:08,250
And now if I press add the box should be 0.3 meters to the left of the X-axis 0.2 meters below the y

145
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,240
axis.

146
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,290
And look at 0.5 meters behind that axis right there.

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,150
And that's it for positioning nodes.

148
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,120
And the next video.

149
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,460
Let's look at resetting a scene view session.
