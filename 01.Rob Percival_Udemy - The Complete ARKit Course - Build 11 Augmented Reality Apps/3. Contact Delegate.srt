1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,180
And the last video we simply set up our up such that we place the eggs in the scene and bullets to shoot

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,320
those acts.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,080
Now when you do that when you shoot an egg the egg blows up.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,720
So first we need a way to detect when the egg and the bullet collide with one another.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,670
To do that we need the help of a certain delegate function to get the delegate function and we need

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:28,790
to inherit from C in physics contact delegate so do just that inherit from a C in physics.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:39,350
By inheriting from this delegate we can call the function physics world did begin contact this function

8
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,350
gets called whenever two physics bodies come into contact.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:52,850
Let's test that by putting a print statement came into contact and now to execute this delta-V function.

10
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:01,940
And if you did load right stuff that scene view seen scene physics world doc contact delegate is equal

11
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,670
to self run the app

12
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,020
just going to wait till the world origin Lote's soon as it loads your targets

13
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,980
should target and the print statement does not get called.

14
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,280
Nothing is happening.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:35,310
So to trigger this function we need to assign collision bit masks to each physics body.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,350
In other words I need to tell the physics world I need to tell the delegate function to watch out for

17
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,530
collisions between the egg and the bullet.

18
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,430
To do that first I need to categorize the egg as the target and the sphere.

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:02:01,090
I'm applying a force to the bullet to start the sauf let me just run the up and make an enemy bit mass

20
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,520
category will be the name of your enemy

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,470
category.

22
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,410
Of type integer with two cases.

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,190
Case bullet will equal our random integer Q And case target is equal to 3.

24
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,430
You can leave these integers as anything you want as long as they are different.

25
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,290
I'll explain this in a second.

26
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:37,930
And now inside of handle type when we are shooting our bullet give the bullet a category mask by writing

27
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,770
bullet dot physics body

28
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:55,080
category mask is equal to big mass category dark bullet don't raw value.

29
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,920
So all I did was I categorized the bullet and I gave it a value of bullet.

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:09,110
So a value of two bit mass category dot bullet and now do the same thing for the.

31
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,520
We're going to categorize the so right egg node

32
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:29,800
the physics body that category bit mask is equal to mass category the that we declared that target the

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,860
AG will be the target the raw value.

34
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,550
So we just categorized the AG.

35
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:43,340
We gave it a value of target a value of three so category a bit mask defines which categories that a

36
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,240
physics body belongs to.

37
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,550
The bullet belongs to the category bullet which is represented by the number two and the egg.

38
00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:00,660
We give it a category of the target which is represented by the number three.

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,020
So now we place the bullet node as well as the egg node inside of categories.

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,940
And so now that we placed these notes in categories I can now specify to this delegate function.

41
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,660
Watch out for collisions between the target and the bullet.

42
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:28,590
To do that further bullet right bullet does physics body contact Biton ask is equal to bitmaps.

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,170
Category

44
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,200
target the raw value.

45
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,110
So we're telling the physics world to watch out for any collisions for any contact between a bullet

46
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,500
and anything which has the target raw value.

47
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:52,720
And in our case the egg and if such a collision is detected trigger this delegate function and now do

48
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:05,820
the same thing for the egg right egg physics body contact bit mask is equal to pit mask category of

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,550
bullet dart raw value.

50
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,560
So we're telling the physics world to watch out for any collisions any contact between the egg and anything

51
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,600
which has the bullet raw value which is the bullet itself.

52
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,100
So if such a collision is detected trigger this delegate function run the EP

53
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,390
and your eggs shoot one of the eggs and the delegate function gets triggered and then gets triggered

54
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,580
many times because it's getting triggered for both.

55
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,370
And coming into contact with the bullet and the bullet coming into contact with the cat.

56
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:53,810
So now when the delegate function gets triggered blow up the egg into confetti.

57
00:05:53,810 --> 00:06:01,690
So we're given this contact variable and the contact contains the two notes that came into contact.

58
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:13,850
So right let no day is equal to contact data no day and right let no be is equal to contact.

59
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,590
That would be.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,320
And now node A could either be the bullet or the fact that we hit a node B could also either be the

61
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,230
bullet or the egg that was hit.

62
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,230
It's one of the nodes that came into contact.

63
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,210
But we want to only blow up the egg not the bullet.

64
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,470
So here's how to accomplish this.

65
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:41,030
On top of your controller right var target of type I see a node

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,150
and back into here if not a tough physics body doc category bit mask is equal to fitness category.

67
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,870
The ENM target the raw value.

68
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,990
So if node A has the big category of a target then we know it's the egg.

69
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:11,850
So self target is equal to node.

70
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:23,090
And now nowhere else if no be tough physics body category bit ask is equal to fitness category.

71
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,590
Target the wrong value.

72
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,800
So if no B is the target.

73
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,450
So we know that no B was the act that was hit.

74
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,980
So right self the target is equal to Node B.

75
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,930
So in our target whether or not node is the egg or node B is the egg target is going to be the egg that

76
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,820
was hit.

77
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,680
So now we want to blow up this target node the egg that was hit into confetti.

78
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,940
Adding a confetti animation requires a particle system a particle system manages the animation of small

79
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,670
images and high level simulations.

80
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:07,550
So animations like smoke rain confetti or fireworks to add a particle system.

81
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,450
Click on new file.

82
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,270
Scroll down until you find the particle system file.

83
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,730
This one will be a confetti particle system call the confetti and create it.

84
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:31,530
And I'm just going to place it right into my media as CNT assets file and delete these remove references

85
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,580
and we're good to go.

86
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,400
Now when you click on this you're supposed to see an animation of confetti.

87
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,620
But for some reason it doesn't show.

88
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,430
So for example if I add the fire particle system so let me just scroll down to this if I add the fire

89
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:56,820
1 press next and call this one fire and notice that the fire animation shows.

90
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,110
I'm not sure why the confetti one doesn't show it.

91
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,050
It must be a simple X bug.

92
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,940
But let me just put this right into my media.

93
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,900
I see an asset file and remove the references for this one.

94
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:17,670
And now that we have a particle system animation let's access it by writing let confetti is equal to

95
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:26,870
s c and particle system named the name will simply be us accessing the particle system.

96
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,160
So media c sets slosh.

97
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:41,890
We want the confetti one for now slash confetti dot s c and p seen particle system and directory leave

98
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:51,310
this as no since there are no subdirectories that we need to access and write confetti that loops is

99
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,540
equal to false.

100
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,750
We don't want the confetti animation to last forever we only want it to happen for four seconds so right

101
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,870
confetti dot particle lifespan is equal to four.

102
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,040
So now it will last four seconds.

103
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,270
And now the confetti animation is going to take the shape of the egg.

104
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:23,260
So right confetti dot emitter shape is equal to target geometry.

105
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:31,530
So basically in the boundaries of the egg you'll see all the confetti flying now declare a confetti

106
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,000
node.

107
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:42,670
So like confetti node is equal to a C and node and Deacon free animation the particle system to that

108
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,500
note by writing confetti Noad

109
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,430
dawn and particle system confetti.

110
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,060
And make sure to unwrap this place the confetti.

111
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,180
Exactly where the collision occurred.

112
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:10,990
So any contact point by writing confetti node position is equal to contact contact point.

113
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,370
So exactly where the bullet came into contact.

114
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,440
The confetti animation will occur.

115
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:24,110
And now finally just the confetti to the scene of you by writing itself to us seeing you seen the root

116
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:30,320
node child node confetti node run the up

117
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,030
going to wait till the world origin loads soon as it loads the targets.

118
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,460
And if I shoot one of the eggs the confetti animation occurs.

119
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,380
However we need the box to disappear as soon as the animation occurs.

120
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,770
To give the illusion that the box is blowing up into confetti.

121
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
So to your controller.

122
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,160
Right target which is the egg that was hit the target.

123
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,180
Remove from parent node.

124
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,620
We're on the up

125
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,940
we're told the world origin loads than your targets.

126
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,370
Shoot one of the eggs and it looks like the egg blows up into confetti.

127
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,830
This is pretty cool.

128
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,350
One more thing I want to add is back into your controller.

129
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,440
We want to make sure that as soon as the bullet is shot it disappears.

130
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,590
After two seconds since we don't want a clutter of bullets forming into our scene if we shoot a lot

131
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:50,010
of them so to do that we need to give the bullet to se and actions when action such that the bullet

132
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,230
which two seconds and the other action is the bullet being removed from the scene view.

133
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,860
So right node or bullet for that matter.

134
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:07,410
Daut run action and we want to trigger a sequence of actions inside of this action.

135
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:17,430
So see an action sequence and the sequence of actions that are going to occur is first the node is going

136
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,410
to wait two seconds.

137
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:29,310
So wait a duration of 2.0 seconds and after the weight of two seconds we want the node to be removed

138
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:36,310
from its parent node sir as CNH action remove from parent node.

139
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,420
So what will happen is the node waiting two seconds after it was shot and after two seconds that will

140
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:52,470
be removed from my machine and just run the up to test this.

141
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:59,450
Let me just add the eggs and if I shoot one of the eggs everything still seems to work pretty well.

142
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:06,450
One more thing I want to try out is let's try the fire particle system.

143
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:15,100
So right here instead of loading the I and Pete let me try and load the fire particle system run the

144
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,790
app.

145
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,830
So if I wait till the world orange and LOTES and then add the targets if I shoot one of them it gives

146
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,300
a fire animation.

147
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,120
This is pretty cool.

148
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,880
Personally myself I'm a bigger fan of the confetti animations.

149
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,400
So let me just leave it at that.

150
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,250
And now we're done with our shooter up.

151
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:46,700
This was the last video you learned how to detect when two nodes collide and apply animations to these

152
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,750
nodes upon collision with all the apps you've made over this course.

153
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:57,020
I hope you found the confidence to build any kit up that you put your mind to.

154
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,790
It was a great pleasure teaching you.

155
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,990
Good luck.
