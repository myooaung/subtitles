1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,290
In this video you're going to learn how to use a 3D model.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,340
So instead of a box we're going to make it into a jelly fish.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,150
So I'm going to take you through how to download a 3-D model so the site I get 3D models from as Turbo's

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,020
dot com.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,130
This Web site sells 3-D models and gives some of them up for free.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,940
We're going to get one of the three 3-D models.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,920
So first you have to make an account with them.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm already logged in as myself.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,560
And once you do make an account type jellyfish

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,730
the a DA is the file format that 3-D models come in and you file.

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,630
And right here is the free 3-D model that we are going to use.

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,430
It's the jellyfish from SpongeBob.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,660
So click on it.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,910
This freedom model is free.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,140
So download it

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,060
close this check the box and press download

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,650
once you're done downloading it show it in the Finder

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,070
unlock the zip file and into your folder.

19
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,490
We want the file.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,070
So we're going to drag this to ex-coach But first opening up our project which was whack a jellyfish.

21
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:41,510
Minimize the project and find the folder where we set our EDAC file drag this DNG file into our tax

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,650
code right here.

23
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:52,530
Press finish expand the project back and this is the file that we're going to use to modify our jellyfish.

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,130
So this is basically the storyboard for 3D models.

25
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,630
This is where we can modify our models.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,400
So if you click on this button right here it shows us everything that we have in our scene.

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,480
So the model has been given a virtual camera.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,210
This is something you would use just for a Simca.

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,720
We have our own camera with a kids so we don't need this.

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,120
Make sure to delete it.

31
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,940
The blue and area are simply extra lighting that we don't need.

32
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,510
So remove those as well.

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:24,750
All right.

34
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,520
Now it's important to note that this is a node with a geometry of a sphere that has been modified to

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
look like a jellyfish.

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,110
If you click right here you can see that the jellyfish has been given a diffuse color of paint.

37
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,090
Remember that the fuse is the color or texture that's been spread across a surface.

38
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,790
So the jellyfish is spread with a color of pink.

39
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:56,070
However we've been given a diffuse texture so back into your folder right here is your texture.

40
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:06,240
Make sure to drag it into your next coat project like so create fuller references and finish spend the

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,500
project back and ferde the fuse instead of setting a color.

42
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,280
We're going to set the jelly fish dock PMG as the fuse.

43
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,990
So this texture wrapped and read its content all over the surface of the node.

44
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,160
And notice how the texture wrap itself around the jelly fish perfectly.

45
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,500
All right.

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,740
Now finally convert the DEA e-file to a scene kit format by going to editor and pressing on convert

47
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,650
to secret file and convert.

48
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,580
The reason we're doing this is because this is the recommended format to optimize ex-cult performance.

49
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,530
I'm going to keep the X code version and save anyway.

50
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,630
And now this isn't a C and file.

51
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,280
All right.

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,010
So a point to note that this entire thing is a sin and to be able to load this scene in our view controller

53
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,950
we need to have it in an asset folder.

54
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:16,010
So click on new file and scroll all the way down till you find the asset catalog which is right here.

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:24,770
Press on next call the asset catalog the following art dot I see and assets.

56
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:35,330
It's a point that you get the same right click create and use that as CN assets and now drag the same

57
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:43,060
file right into your assets folder like so and so now we can load the jellyfish into our scene.

58
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:50,080
So go to the controller and inside of our no comment all of the so

59
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,810
and then right.

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,250
Let jellyfish scene

61
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,100
is equal to see unseen

62
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:15,030
named and in the string navigate your sim file by writing art don't see and assets which is your assets

63
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,180
folder slash jellyfish

64
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,030
end which is your file name.

65
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,880
All right.

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,880
So now we have the entire jellyfish scene.

67
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,520
I'm just going to delete this first because it seems to be slowing down my tax code.

68
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,590
We want only the jellyfish inside of the scene.

69
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,130
And the reason why this has no specific defuse is because we moved our jellyfish does seem foul to a

70
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,050
new folder.

71
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,710
So we lost track of the texture.

72
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,590
So to fix that just reset the texture itself and we're good to go.

73
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,260
So back to the controller to convert the scene to a node just right.

74
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:08,890
Let jellyfish node is equal to jelly fish seen dot root node.

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,920
Remember that the root node is the parent node of all other nodes our jellyfish known as a child of

76
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,910
that root node.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:26,880
So just right child node with name the name of the child of the root node is fear call the child jellyfish

78
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,820
and.

79
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,050
And back to the Wii controller it just right.

80
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,430
Jellyfish right here.

81
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,910
And recursively.

82
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:39,220
So if this is not true it will search every single node that's in the root node subtree to find the

83
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,370
jellyfish node.

84
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,920
If it's false it will search only the root node.

85
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,850
Immediate children the jellyfish node is an immediate child of the root node.

86
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:56,600
So certain defaults we don't need to search every single node in the whole subtree OK now placed the

87
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,730
jellyfish right in front of us by writing jellyfish node.

88
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:07,490
The position is equal to a C and vector 3 horizontally and vertically aligned to the origin and one

89
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,000
metre away from the side access behind it.

90
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:19,180
And the jellyfish know that the seam view by writing self seen view does seen the root node on actual

91
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,590
node jellyfish node.

92
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,610
So now instead of a box we should get a jellyfish right in front of us.

93
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,950
So run the app and it's failing because the jellyfish node is an optional type.

94
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,650
The reason it's an optional type is because X code doesn't know for sure that the string you put is

95
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,930
an actual node.

96
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,710
So we know for sure that this is an actual node since we named it ourselves.

97
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:55,920
So just forcefully unwrap it and we should be good to go run the press play and it looks like the jellyfish

98
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,190
node is right behind this well the jellyfish is not actually behind us.

99
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,480
It's just that it's oriented the wrong way and the jellyfish itself is way too big.

100
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:16,450
So in our scene file we need to fix the orientation of the jellyfish sex which way it's facing.

101
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,770
So click on perspective and onto the front.

102
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:28,090
So if the jellyfish is in front of us according to this we would only be able to see its head.

103
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,220
We want to be able to see the entire jellyfish when it's in front of us.

104
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,400
So to do that we need to rotate the jellyfish 90 degrees vertically.

105
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,490
So remember Royler angles we use them in letra seven of the getting started section.

106
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:49,760
So if we rotate the jellyfish 90 degrees across the X-axis it will rotate vertically so just right 90

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,220
so it rotates vertically.

108
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,240
But the other direction.

109
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,880
So instead of 90 degrees put it back to zero and make sure you rotate it 90 degrees the other direction

110
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:18,450
by writing negative nine.

111
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,140
All right so now we can properly see the jelly fish when it's in front of us.

112
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,600
We were able to rotate it 90 degrees vertically around the x axis in the other direction by putting

113
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,380
the negative value.

114
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:38,330
If you're unfamiliar with Euler angles make sure to revisit the getting started section in lecture 7.

115
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,570
All right so now the orientation is good but the size of the jellyfish.

116
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,090
If you remember from when we were in the UP is still way too big the size is actually two point three

117
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,870
times one.

118
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:56,180
So two point three meters wide two point two meters long and has a depth of three meters.

119
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,260
So this jellyfish is basically the size of a smaller room.

120
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:08,890
So if you multiply all of these dimensions by point one so point one for the X point one for the Y.

121
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,750
This is kind of hard to click on

122
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:22,230
one for the Y and point one for the Zad.

123
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,220
Now we get dimensions of zero point two or three meters zero point two two meters for height and zero

124
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,620
point three four meters for that depth.

125
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,040
Since this is multiplied by the scale that we give it and this is a very fair size.

126
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,290
Also if you find it hard to click on these fields I'm using ex-coach nine data.

127
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,080
So for me this might not be a problem but if it is just right click on the fields that study highlights

128
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,290
and then left click to modify the field.

129
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:58,470
All right so now we can run the press play.

130
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,100
OK so the jelly fish is oriented the right way and it has the perfect size.

131
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,820
Notice how perfectly the texture wrap around our node.

132
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,670
This is looking really good.

133
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:17,270
We finally know how to load 3D models in the next video we're going to add animations to the jellyfish.
