1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,300
In this video we're going to position node's relative to other notes the main theme behind the lecture

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,120
will be parent nodes and child nodes.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,740
So let me just remove all of this.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,710
We don't need this code anymore and simply position the pyramid relative to the root node.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,530
So right now the pyramid is a child of the root node.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,660
And as you know from before the root node is basically a node That's position exactly where the world

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,560
origin is.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:36,030
And since the pyramid is a child of the root node it's going to be positioned relative to the node.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,530
So now position the pyramid about is there a point two metres to the right of the root node about 0.3

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:49,470
metres above it and negative zero point two metres behind it.

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,920
And your challenge is to try and place a cylinder zero point three metres to the left of the pyramid

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,060
point two meters above and point three metres behind it paused the video and give it a try.

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:14,610
So first off just declare your cylinder node cylinder node is equal to see a node the node is going

14
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,060
to have a geometry of n s c and cylinder with a radius.

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,180
I'm going to give it a small radius of zero point zero five meters and a height of five centimeters

16
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,800
as well.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,070
Going to give the cylinder a diffuse color of red.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,420
Remember that diffuse is the color that spread across the surface of a node.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,260
You like color dark red and the challenge was to place the cylinder zero point three meters to the left

20
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,940
point two meters above and point three meters behind the pyramid.

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,260
So right cylinder node up position is equal to A C and vector 3 and so to place the cylinder zero point

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,190
three meters to the left of the pyramid.

23
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:06,820
Here's what you would do you would see that hey the pyramid is 0.3 metres to the right of the world

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,720
origin.

25
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,630
So a fireplace the cylinder node is 0.1 metres to the left of the root node.

26
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,670
It will be 0.3 metres to the left of the pyramid.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:24,120
So if you put in negative 0.1 here and position the cylinder note relative to the root node by just

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,290
copying and pasting this and putting your solar node.

29
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,660
So by positioning our cylinder point 1 metres to the left of the root node it will be point three meters

30
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,350
to the left of the pyramid.

31
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,760
Now we wanted to position the cylinder zero point two meters above the pyramid node.

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:50,160
And so by placing the cylinder is 0.5 metres above the root node it will be 0.2 metres above the pyramid

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,760
node and we wanted to place zero point three meters behind that pyramid.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,880
And so by placing the cylinder node 0.5 metres behind the scene of use root node that it will be 0.3

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,060
metres behind the pyramid node.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,340
So this was a bit complex we had to do some math to position the cylinder node relative to the pyramid.

37
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,670
So let's run the app to see if this worked out.

38
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:23,440
Just going to wait till my world origin loads and as soon as it does add my nodes

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,190
our cylinder is there a point 3 meters to the left of the pyramid zero point two meters above it.

40
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:40,150
As you can clearly see and it's also behind by point three meters.

41
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,540
Now what if I told you we could have done this in a much easier way.

42
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:53,160
So the initial challenge was to place the cylinder node zero point three meters to the left of the pyramid

43
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,830
node.

44
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,670
So why not just write in negative 0.3.

45
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,610
So Point 3 meters to the left and now to place it 0.2 meters above.

46
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,600
Why not just raise 0.2.

47
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:11,680
And if you want to place it 0.3 metres behind the pyramid node wind up putting negative 0.3.

48
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,490
How will this work.

49
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:21,620
For example if the cylinder node is positioned 0.3 metres to the left of the root node then it's not

50
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,020
0.3 metres to the left of the pyramid it would be both 0.5 metres to the left of it.

51
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,280
What if I told you we don't have to position the cylinder node relative to the root node by making the

52
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,880
cylinder node A child of the pyramid node.

53
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:47,040
So by writing node our child node cylinder or node the cylinder is now positioned relative to the pyramid.

54
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,440
So now this should work.

55
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:55,350
The cylinder should be 0.3 meters to the left of the pyramid point two meters above it and point three

56
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,960
meters behind it.

57
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,020
This was much easier than doing all that math.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,380
So run the app to see if this works so just going to wait till the world orange and loads

59
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,230
and it works out perfectly.

60
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,140
And this was a lot easier.

61
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,400
And doing all that math

62
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,840
what I want you to take from all this is that at first the cylinder node was a child of the scene views

63
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,140
the root node and so to position the cylinder relative to the pyramid we had to do some pretty annoying

64
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,910
calculations.

65
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:38,600
However once we made the cylinder a child of the pyramid then whatever position we gave the cylinder

66
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,510
was relative to the pyramid.

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,030
Having done that it was much easier to position the cylinder zero point three meters to the left of

68
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:47,810
the pyramid.

69
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,950
Zero point two meters above and 0.3 metres behind it.

70
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,860
As you can see it took no calculations whatsoever.

71
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,880
All you had to do is declare it.

72
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,480
So now using relative positioning we're going to make a custom shape.

73
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:10,650
So instead of a cylinder No declare a box node with a geometry of an S C and box.

74
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,300
The box will have a whit of 0.1 metres a height of 0.1 metres any length of 0.1 metres as well.

75
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,340
Will they chamfer a radius of zero wherever it's still in their node or replace that with box node instead.

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,570
And instead of giving the box a color of red give it a color of blue.

77
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:37,280
Whereas the pyramid will have a color of red and yellow now the plan is to position this box right under

78
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,460
the pyramid to make a house shape.

79
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,270
So how do I place the box node right under the house.

80
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,960
Well let me start off with a default position of 0 0 0 and see what this looks like.

81
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:05,910
So if I just wait till the world orange and loans and as soon as it loads your supposed House and this

82
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,330
didn't work out so well here's my assumption.

83
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,570
It looks like the center of the box is positioned at the bottom of the pyramid and from the bottom of

84
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,670
the pyramid half of the box extends upwards.

85
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,880
And I can also conclude that the box is 10 centimeters long.

86
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:33,460
So if the center of the box is at the bottom of the pyramid and the distance between the center of the

87
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,280
box to the top is five centimeters.

88
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,130
If I place the box five centimeters downwards then the top of the box should be at the bottom of the

89
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,570
pyramid which is exactly what we need for us to form a house.

90
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,500
We need the top to be at the bottom of the pyramid.

91
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:58,010
So give this a try right now up position is equal to negative zero point zero five meters so five centimeters

92
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,660
downwards.

93
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,860
If I do this the top of the box should be at the bottom of the pyramid.

94
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,440
Now to get comfortable with positioning relative to other nodes it's basically just trial and error.

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,920
Start off with a default position like what I just had before is 0 0 and 0 make a conclusion with what

96
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,560
you saw in that default position and then fix that position accordingly.

97
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,810
We fixed that by placing the box five centimeters downwards.

98
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,090
Let's see if that worked.

99
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,780
Run up

100
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:39,350
if I press add and there is our house at the top of the box is right under the pyramid as I predicted.

101
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,290
Now what if I wanted to give the walls a door back to the school project.

102
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:54,750
Stop running me up in the right let door know is equal to see a node with a geometry of an S C and plane.

103
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,190
We looked at planes in the last lecture and we determined that planes are simply flat vertical surfaces.

104
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,880
So give the plane a width of about three centimeters and a height of six centimeters.

105
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,940
This should be a fair size.

106
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,350
Give the door node A color of brown.

107
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,400
So a door no door geometry the first material that diffused memory and the fuse is the color that spread

108
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,200
across the surface of a node.

109
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,170
We're giving that surface a color of brown

110
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:34,680
so I want to place the door node at the edge of the box where positioning the door relative to the box.

111
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,720
So what's the next step be.

112
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,670
Pause the video and give this one a try.

113
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,100
So I'm hoping you did the following.

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,920
Since we're positioning the door relative to the box make the door a child of the box so the box no

115
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,730
child node door node.

116
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,110
So now we want to place the door at the edge of the box.

117
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,910
First let me start off by giving the door node a random position.

118
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,020
So a door no doubt position is equal to C-n vector 3 0 0 0.

119
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,080
I didn't even put any thought into this.

120
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,350
And let me just run the app to see what this looks like at the moment.

121
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,840
So just wait till the world origin and loads and as soon as the world origin loads let me add my house

122
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,210
and you can't even see the plane.

123
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,480
The door was even added to the scene view.

124
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,440
Well it was.

125
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:38,620
It's just that the box node and the pyramid node they both have a coordinate system that's exactly in

126
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,710
their center.

127
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:46,960
So inside of the box node right at the center there is a co-ordinate system and we aligned that door

128
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,440
node perfectly with the coordinate system of the box 0 meters away from it.

129
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,500
And so since the door node is exactly at the center of the box.

130
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,520
First off we can conclude that the box has a depth of 10 centimeters.

131
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:11,260
So if the door node is exactly at the center of the box then that means that the door is 5 centimeters

132
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,430
away from the edge.

133
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,730
How did I conclude this.

134
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,840
While the box node has a depth of 10 centimeters and so that could only mean that the distance between

135
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,120
the center of the box to the edge is five centimeters.

136
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,900
So if I place the door node 5 centimeters away from the center of the box it should be right at the

137
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,770
edge.

138
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,700
Run the app.

139
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,850
If I just wait till the world origin loads and then add my house

140
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,520
the door node is 500 metres away from the center of the box which puts it right at the edge.

141
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,380
The reason why the door node is acting this way is because it is right at the edge of the box.

142
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,820
We need to place a little bit in front of the edge so that it stops interfering with the edges of the

143
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,310
box node instead of 0.05.

144
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,300
Place it a little bit in from the edge.

145
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,360
So put zero point zero five three or something three millimeters away from the edge.

146
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,750
And we should be good to go.

147
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,640
So if I just wait till the world origin load and then I add my house there it is.

148
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,370
Our door is right in front of our box about three millimeters away.

149
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:26,860
And now I can conclude that vertically the center of the node is vertically aligned with the center

150
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,450
of the box.

151
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:36,670
And so if I go back to my X code so the box node has a height of 10 centimeters so the distance from

152
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:44,860
the center of the box node to the bottom edge should be 5 centimeters the door node center is perfectly

153
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,800
aligned with the center of the box node.

154
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:54,480
So the distance from the center of the door node to the bottom edge of the box node is also 5 centimeters.

155
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,660
And so from the center of the box node the door node extends downwards by three centimeters.

156
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:08,260
So if I just do 5 centimeters and minus three I can conclude that the bottom of the door node is 2 centimeters

157
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,960
away from the bottom edge of the box node.

158
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:17,890
So if I move the door node downwards by 2 centimeters it should be right at the bottom edge of the box

159
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,090
and I moved it down 20 centimeters it should be 2 centimeters.

160
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,810
So let me run the app to see what this looks like.

161
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,800
If I just wait till the world orders and loads and then add my house.

162
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,840
There you go the door node is positioned right at the bottom edge of our house.

163
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,650
The last thing I can tell you is to be comfortable with making custom shapes with relative positioning.

164
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,340
You just have to keep practicing first.

165
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,450
It's going to be a game of trial and error but eventually you'll get the hang of it.

166
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,510
So if you want to make more custom shapes with the relative positioning.

167
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,690
Always start with a default position which in our case we used a default position at first of 0 0 0

168
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:05,320
0 and then from that position make conclusions on how you need to modify the position to get the custom

169
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,640
shape that you want.

170
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,560
And that is it for a relative positioning in the next video we're going to look at rotations.
