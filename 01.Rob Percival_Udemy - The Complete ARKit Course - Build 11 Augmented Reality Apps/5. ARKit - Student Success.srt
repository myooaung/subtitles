Hello everyone this is a brand from the future.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,230
I am pleased to announce the top three kit apps that were submitted this month by students of the course.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,750
The first thing I want to present is the A-R kick drum where you can actually display a drum in a cam

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,270
or a view of the real world and play it by tapping or swinging your phone.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:29,920
You can choose between 13 presets of kick drums and customize options like bass treble echo and reverb.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,980
This is very cool.

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:39,030
The next stop I want to show you is the hied messed up made by Jullian where you can create funny messages.

8
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,870
Your message will stay exactly where you left it for other users to see it through their app.

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,750
I have to say this is a very unique idea and I absolutely love the concept of drawing murals with other

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,860
people who have the app.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,110
This is a great use.

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,760
Of course location to actually have a drawing persist in a GPS location of the world and also a great

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,210
use of actually putting your 3D nodes on a database that can be observed by other users.

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,640
Great job Julian.

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:20,810
And the last one my personal favorite ghost hunt A-R which was released by Jeff Brown the sap I have

16
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,670
to say is extremely well done.

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:28,490
This is a perfect implementation of the last section of the course where we learn how to detect contact

18
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,490
between a bullet and a target.

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,430
But clearly Jeff Brown went above and beyond in creating his 3D models.

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,280
And so once again the OP's her ghost hunt hide message and A-R kick drum.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,980
I found those to be the top three jobs that were submitted this month and I'm very impressed with what

22
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,130
you guys have come up with.

23
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,930
I wish you the best of luck.
