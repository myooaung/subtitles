1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,220
In this video we're going to add some more planets to the solar system and position them all are relative

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,330
to the sun.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,020
So in the solar system scope website that we looked at in the last video download this texture for the

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,780
sun.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:24,210
Once you download it show it in the Finder and the dear ex-coach project in the assets folder make a

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,240
new image assets called Sun

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,370
diffuse the sun the fuse image to your X code project right into your assets folder and back to your

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:49,200
view controller not us file in view did appear less sun less sun is equal to C.A. with a geometry of

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,130
an SDN sphere since a sun has its physical shape and give it a radius of zero point three five meters.

10
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,920
I found that to be a good default radius.

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,640
So remember that the is the color or texture spread across the surface of the sphere.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,260
We're going to give the sphere of the sun texture.

13
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:18,290
So right so in geometry darf first material that diffused content's is equal to Sun diffuse.

14
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,580
So this image of the sun to fuse is going to wrap itself around the sphere so that the sphere can look

15
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:32,430
like the sun position the sun relative to the world origin one metre away from it by writing sun position

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,910
is equal to seeing that two or three leave it horizontally and vertically aligned with X and Y axis

17
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:46,820
of the origin and position at 1 metres away behind it to the seam view by writing self does scene view

18
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,310
thus seen a route know that dot child node the sign.

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,850
Now there is one problem.

20
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,400
The sun is going to be the central node in the solar system.

21
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,180
So all the other planets have to be positioned relative to the sun.

22
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,730
So instead of positioning earth relative to the scene view position relative to the sun by removing

23
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:15,970
this line of code in bright sun dot our child no old earth.

24
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,030
So now the earth is positioned relative to the sun one metre away behind the sun.

25
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,180
However instead of positioning it one metres behind the axis of the sun we're going to position the

26
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,640
earth one point two metres to the right of the sun since that will be easier to work with when we run

27
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,380
the up remove the earth's animation for now.

28
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,660
We're going to go into animation in more depth in the next video.

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:51,590
Run the way for the rural origin to load and everything to stabilize and right here is our son.

30
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,930
The image wrapped around the sphere perfectly the diffuse image.

31
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,290
And if I move around it to the right.

32
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,760
Right here is the earth is one point two meters to the right of the sun.

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,090
Now before I had the next planet back into your next project noticed that here every time you want to

34
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,680
declare a planet you have to write all of these lines of code.

35
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,950
Now imagine if you wanted to add the entire solar system that would become about 70 lines of code of

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,820
the same repetition.

37
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:32,310
So to avoid this mess make a planet function which has the argument geometry of type I see geometry

38
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,150
and argument the use of type II image specular as well emission

39
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:52,660
and the normal texture and it's also going to have a argument to know how it's position relative to

40
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,590
the sun or the scene view and what the distance is and have a return value.

41
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,410
I see no such that dysfunction is going to make every planet for us and we're just going to call it

42
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,080
in if you did appear.

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:15,390
So instead of writing all this remove equals to see a node instead left earth is equal to planets with

44
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:22,530
the geometry that we do that for the diffuse will remain the same Earth Day.

45
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,850
The specular as Earth specular respectively.

46
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,250
You mention earth.

47
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:39,400
You mention the normal Earth normal and its physicians at one point two metres away from the sun.

48
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:49,100
So as an actor three one point two metres to the right and I right now delete all of this code and noticed

49
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,840
how much cleaner everything else.

50
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,830
Now we need to make the snow in the planet function.

51
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:03,980
So inside the function declare a planet no less planet is he called to see a node with a geometry of

52
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:14,870
the geometry that we give it and planet geometry of first material dark diffuse dark content's is simply

53
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,840
going to be called the diffuse that we get it do the same thing for the specular value.

54
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:28,100
So replace the fuse with specular copy and paste stuff for the machine as well.

55
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:36,620
And lastly for the normal copy paste this and normal instead of the emission.

56
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,560
And lastly for the position right planet top position is equal to the position that we give it.

57
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,580
And so we have just returned the planets.

58
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,150
So now right here we're passing all of the info we need to the planet function.

59
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,470
It makes the planet for us and passes it back.

60
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,850
This is much cleaner.

61
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:04,850
Now instead of writing out all those lines of code I can just say let Venus is equal to planets with

62
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,870
a geometry.

63
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:12,930
Venus is going to equal a geometry of an S C sphere with a radius of zero point 1.

64
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,370
Since Venus is smaller than Earth and we don't have any images for it so go back to the solar system

65
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:26,720
scope website and right here we have the surface of Venus as well as the atmosphere down low.

66
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,570
Both of them show them in the Finder.

67
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,290
Now back to X code into your assets make two new image assets called Venus

68
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,650
surface

69
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,810
and Venus.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,720
Mr. and the atmosphere and surface to the respective assets folders

71
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,010
and you know what.

72
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:03,690
Before making our Venus planet we are going to just stick with the Earth planet for now and run the

73
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:11,200
app to see if the planet function worked work without any bugs so it rang me up.

74
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,250
So right here is our sign and to your right should be the earth.

75
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,790
So everything is the same as before.

76
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,040
There are no bugs and it's always a good habit to run the app every time you do something to make sure

77
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,790
that you're not building on top of erroneous code.

78
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,430
So back to the ex-coach project we were making the Venus planet and we added to our assets folder to

79
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,900
images the atmosphere and the surface.

80
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,980
Now to finish our constructor your challenge is to get the surface and atmosphere in one of these values

81
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,520
paused the video and give it a try.

82
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,000
So the fuse is when you want to cover the surface of the sphere where the texture we don't want to cover

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,990
the surface with the atmosphere.

84
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,730
We want to add the atmosphere on top of the surface not cover the surface.

85
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,840
However we do want to cover the surface of the node with the venous surface texture so that is I refuse

86
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,270
specular we don't have any textures that control the lighting.

87
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,210
In this scenario.

88
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,030
So leave that as no.

89
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,600
And for this to accept a null value we need to make this argument an optional type.

90
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,500
And do the same thing for any mission.

91
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,140
And normal since not all planets will have any mission and normal texture.

92
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,000
So the mission will be our atmosphere.

93
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,710
The reason being if you remember the mission is when you're emitting something on top of the surface

94
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,600
and the last video we emitted clouds on top of the earth's surface.

95
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,810
Now were you made it an atmosphere on top of Venus surface So Venus atmosphere and we don't have any

96
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,410
textures controlling the geometrical shape of each point in the texture so I leave that as No.

97
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:05,390
And as for the mission we are going to position Venus zero point seven meters to the right of the sun.

98
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,450
So it's that it's vertically aligned with the sun and 0 meters away from these that axis to position

99
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,260
Venus relative to the sun just right.

100
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:27,390
Sun does child know Venus and run the so just wait for the world origin to load and right here is Venus.

101
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:35,180
Notice how detail the atmosphere is right behind it is our Earth in the next video we're going to apply

102
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,640
a relative rotation to these planets.
