00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,190
Welcome to your first lesson in this course we're going to set up the camera so that it can track the

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,600
phone's orientation and position relative to the world around it.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,400
Ex code is the platform you'll be using to set up your apricot apps.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,260
So open it up create a new project a single application.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:28,310
Call the project world tracking press next and create the first thing you want to do is go to the main

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,140
storyboard

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:41,190
and to the initial controller and market sync if you the market view gives a camera a view of the real

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,550
world such that the user can display three dimensional content inside of this camera view.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,230
So expand the market scene get you to the edges of your purview and make sure to pin it to the bottom

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,080
top leading and trailing space

11
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:07,410
open up the assistant editor and make sure to link here kids seen you to the controller with an IBM

12
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,500
it called Scene view.

13
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,450
Connect the IAB outlet close the assistant editor and back to your view controller.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:24,250
Import a market to use the market framework and get rid of this error and declare a constant configuration

15
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,130
of type A-R role tracking configuration.

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,150
So the configuration is equal to our role tracking session configuration we're all tracking is used

17
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:40,210
to track the position and orientation of your device relative to the real world at all times.

18
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,640
This is very important because if the phone doesn't know where it's position relative to the world around

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,270
it then it wouldn't be able to effectively display three dimensional content in certain places of the

20
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,400
world.

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,750
So make sure that as soon as the view loads your scene he runs a session says that it has this configuration

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:07,580
to do that right itself does seem view that scene does session run configuration

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,590
now when the device is able to track its position and orientation at all times.

24
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:25,490
Now add debug options to the scene view by writing self does seem VM that debug options is equal to

25
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:32,720
an array type of debug options such that the same view is going to show feature points so C and debug

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,420
options that show feature points in the scene view is also going to show the world origin.

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,490
A R S C and debug options does show world origin

28
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,900
in the book options doesn't really do anything in terms of functionality.

29
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:56,600
It simply helps us debug the app by showing us if the world Orangemen was properly detected and if the

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,020
feature points are constantly being discovered the world origin is your starting position in the real

31
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,960
world.

32
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,610
So as soon as you launch the app world tracking detects everything in your environment and keeps track

33
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,750
of where you started the starting position is your world origin feature points are simply information

34
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,250
about features in the world around you that the device detected.

35
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,370
The device remembers all of that information to precisely pinpoint to your position at all times.

36
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,500
This will be more clear to you when I run the app but before running it there is one last step we have

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,400
to do which is to go to your food list.

38
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:47,370
Since you're using the camera you need the property privacy press on the plus one privacy camera usage

39
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,540
description.

40
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,960
This property displays an alert to the user asking him or her to allow the app to use the camera.

41
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,440
If you don't put this property your app will simply crash.

42
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:08,890
A descriptive message to that property saying you need the camera to display cool a arcade content.

43
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,450
This message is going to pop up to the user prompting him to enable the camera.

44
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,620
So run the app.

45
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:23,500
Notice the alert prompting user to allow the app to use the camera as well as the descriptive message

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,090
you give it.

47
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,190
You need the camera to display cool air get caught and so enable the camera by pressing OK and give

48
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,890
the device a few seconds to figure out its position in the real world.

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,850
So now if I move backwards you should notice this three dimensional coordinate system will go over this

50
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,430
coordinate system in more depth.

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,650
In other lectures.

52
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,340
But for now just know that this is the world origin and represents the starting position of the device

53
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,390
relative to the real world.

54
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,960
Once you launch the map the scene view runs a session such that it is configured to track the devices

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,730
orientation and position.

56
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:08,710
After a couple of seconds after it analyzes and it recognizes the environment around it it's able to

57
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,380
track where my starting position is.

58
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,380
If I move towards the origin walk around it or even rotate my device.

59
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,480
The device is still able to pinpoint where my starting position is.

60
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,960
In other words seeing these configuration is able to track where I started and this could only mean

61
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,630
that the phone is always keeping track of its current position and orientation.

62
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,370
This is awesome.

63
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,560
Now see these yellow dots.

64
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,790
These are called feature points.

65
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,530
One of the ways the device can always keep track of its position is by detecting features in its surrounding

66
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,750
environment as unique pieces of information that information is used to precisely pinpoint the current

67
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,660
position and orientation of your device in the next video you're going to display a three dimensional

68
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,300
virtual object in the physical world.
