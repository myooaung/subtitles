00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,420
Hit you guys before proceeding with the course I should warn you about some syntax changes.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,650
So as I was making the course I was using XCode 9 version 5.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,900
This right here is Version 6.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,460
By the time you watch this video it might be a very good 7 or 8 or whatever it is anyway.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:25,440
As you go through the course you'll see this a lot less configuration is equal to our world tracking

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,560
session configuration.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,520
Don't worry about what this is right now.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,070
I've explained that in the introductory section of this course once you get there you'll understand

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:43,670
it very well but just know that Apple renamed this variable to our world tracking configuration.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,000
So as you're following through with the course make sure to write erewhile tracking configuration.

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,910
Not our role tracking session.

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,950
And that is all.

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,610
I hope you enjoy the course.
