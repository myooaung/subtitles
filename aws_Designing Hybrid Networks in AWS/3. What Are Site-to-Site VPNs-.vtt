00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.470
[Autogenerated] Now we've seen some examples of hybrid network architectures.

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.640
Let's talk a little bit more about site site VPN.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.180
Fundamentally a site site, VPN is a ruby connection between network devices.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.120
These devices route traffic to each other over the public.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.010
Internet traffic that traverse is a sight sight.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.790
VPN is encrypted, endpoints,

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.670
authenticated and integrity checks performed on the

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.540
Pakistanis sent to create a site site, VPN,

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.410
where the white choice of protocols that we can use the

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.820
main protocol used and breasts his i p.

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.940
___.

12
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.240
When working with the pens, they're digress.

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.380
The first option we have is to deploy a customer,

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.600
manage the pen accustom, manage VPN in Ada grass involved.

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.840
You're deploying easy to machines.

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.300
They're based on Eva, one of your customized am eyes All the market place am I?

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.040
These customized 82 machines will then act as a veep in termination point,

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.330
the traffic coming from on premise because these type of VPN,

19
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.700
because we managed,

20
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.420
is the customers responsibility to provide high

21
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.250
availability if they're VPN service and to make sure the

22
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.340
easy to machines provide VPN service, stay up.

23
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.710
The second option is to use an aide West manage 3

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.710
p.m. With an air US manage VPN, we deploy a due west manage gateways.

25
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.540
At this point, a device is responsible for the high availability.

26
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.770
I'm maintenance of those gateways on.

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.480
We use a VPN connection component to collect those gateways to one premise.

28
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.340
Today, our thought process should be.

29
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.320
Let's use the address,

30
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.500
manage components unless they don't meet our particular needs.

31
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.480
Glove Mannix have several captivity scenarios they would like us to look at.

32
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.160
In the first scenario, they have applications deployed to a tigress on customers.

33
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.840
Collect these applications using public I p addresses.

34
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.440
In the second scenario,

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.760
Globe Mannix has business applications deployed to address

36
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.430
that only access by Globe Mannix employees.

37
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.190
In this third scenario,

38
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.640
Globe Mannix has on premise deployed applications using

39
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.950
Amazon s three for remote storage.

40
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.640
Have a think about those three scenarios.

41
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.940
Which of these three globe manic scenarios were benefit from a site site VPN.

42
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.380
If you need to this point,

43
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.930
rewind the video and have a look at those snappers again are pause the video.

44
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.990
Why have a little think off the three globe manic scenarios?

45
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.820
Is the business application deployed toward a grass access by glow?

46
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.440
Monix employees would most benefit from a site site VPN.

47
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.860
That way,

48
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.020
the employees working at Globe Max locations will be a connecting line

49
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.060
of its application securely through the Internet.

50
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.060
At the time of writing this calls site site VP ends cannot be used

51
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.440
to directly access at ST on the application.

52
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.000
Access by our customers is using public I P addresses so doesn't acquire a site site, VPN.
