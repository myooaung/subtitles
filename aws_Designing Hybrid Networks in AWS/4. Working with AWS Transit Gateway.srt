00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,840
[Autogenerated] in the final section of his model.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,970
Let's discuss a divorce.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,960
Transit Gateway Transit Gate was a manage device that

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,000
we can deploy toe anade West region.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,860
Once deployed,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,750
we can use that transit gateway to create attachments to VP sees BP ends We

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,690
can use appearing to connect it to over transit gateways.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,540
And we can use transit gateway to collect to our direct connect connections.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,440
Once we create these attachments, we can use VPC route tables,

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,840
control the flow of traffic towards the transit gateway.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,570
I'm accused a transit gateway route tables to control the

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,040
flow of traffic between the attachments.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,580
Transit gateway allows us to build hub and spoke apologies with the

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,990
transit gateways the hub on the attachments of the spokes.

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,440
We can then enable transitive ruin between the attachments.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,430
In this example,

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,690
we've got three VP sees deployed to the EU west one region in a dress,

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,850
each free PCs to some nights on.

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,440
We want results.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,490
It deployed tweets subject to be a communicator each other.

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,520
So, to that end we deploy a transit gateway in the U West.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,240
One region will then create 33 PC attachments.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,810
We would adjust the VPC route tables on the transit gateway route table.

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,620
And with that in place,

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,740
traffic will be a route between all these different subjects.

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,500
Just like with VPC pairing bear in mind we're talking about VP

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,000
sees here with non overlapping I P ranges.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
If the I P ranges did overlap, ruin wouldn't work.

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,440
We could also use transit Gateway too connected to our own premise locations.

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,040
Here we've got headquarters and to branch offices,

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,350
and each one has got customer from this device that

32
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,140
connects him to the Internet.

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,480
Weaken the new transit gateway to configure VPN attachments.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,290
In this example, we would need three VPN attachments 12 week office again.

35
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,210
We did just the appropriate route tables and now traffic could be fully

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,540
ruit from our VP sees try physical locations on back.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,620
We can also use the fief in attachments to route

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,600
traffic between brunch one French too, and headquarters as well.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
In this example, we're using to Ed West regions us one.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Any us too.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,490
We have a V p c deployed to each eat three PCs to sub nets and

42
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,400
you can see I've deployed to transit gateways here transit

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,270
gateways of deployed to a region they cannot make VPC

44
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,180
attachments outside of their region, but we can do.

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,740
It's quite a appearing connection between the two transit gateways.

46
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,990
By creating this pairing, connection results is deployed to V.

47
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,150
P.

48
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,330
C.

49
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,180
One would be a route to result It deployed to V.

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,240
P C two transit gateways got lots of great features.

51
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,730
These include the N s a part so that we can provide de

52
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,260
NS resolution across the attachments.

53
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,490
Equal cost multipath ruins apart with e c M.

54
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,260
P.

55
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,600
If a transit gateways got multiple pass to a destination

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,890
on those paths offer equal metrics, then transit gatewaycan.

57
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,530
Use that in an active active fashion transit.

58
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,280
Gateway has a default table who can also configure customer tables.

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,740
These beings,

60
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,900
we have different route in policies for different

61
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,340
groupings of attachment transit.

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,900
Gateway supports both static and dynamic ruin.

63
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,030
If you choose to stack ruin, it's your job to maintain the routing tables.

64
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,040
Dynamic ruin uses bi G p.

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,900
The more complex your design, the more attachments transit gateway has.

66
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,180
The more likely you are to use dynamic ruin.

67
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,510
Also,

68
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,110
it's worth pointing out that transit gatewaycan be shared between

69
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,160
accounts so you can deploy our transit gateways to a shared service

70
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,030
account and then make them available for all the accounts inside and

71
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,240
outside of your organization.

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,640
It's resource access manager that used to share results is

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,010
between a dress accounts resource actually manage can share

74
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,660
transit gateways sub nets.

75
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,600
Route 53 Resolve rules as well as a host of of results,

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,760
is the accounts we share with could be inside or outside of your

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,540
address organization on By using resource Access Manager,

78
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,480
we're more easily able to create centralized results.

79
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:07,000
Is monitor the centralized resources while easily making them available toe over a dress accounts that need them.
