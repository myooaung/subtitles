00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.250
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration,

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.240
whether it be deploying an age West Transit gateway,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.910
we're then gonna use resource access Manager to share that.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.290
A dress transit gateway with another a dress account.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.400
Throughout this demonstration,

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.680
we're gonna be working with the Aid West Consul on

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.870
full along this demonstration, you'll need an aide Wes account.

8
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.040
I'm back in the Old West Consul in the VPC dashboard.

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.230
But this time in the island region, if I scroll down a bit,

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.640
I'll bet find the transit Gateway section from that section I choose

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.460
transit gateways and then to create turns to get where I select create

12
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.210
transit Gateway kind of a standard farm here.

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.590
So you fill in the name and description and then if I scroll down a little bit,

14
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.340
I could see the rest of the transit gateway configuration.

15
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.740
All of these settings are there defaults?

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.460
We can choose to find out on autonomous system number.

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.440
I'll leave axe default saying,

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.930
which is using the autonomous sister number that's been

19
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.440
assigned to the glove manning three p.

20
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440
C.

21
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.820
DNF.

22
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.640
Support is enabled, as is equal cost multipath ruin.

23
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
We could also see that the default route Table Bay So civil No, attachments.

24
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.540
I would default route table propagation enabled.

25
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.610
It means dynamics is en route from attachments will

26
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.040
be shared with the default table.

27
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.300
The one option not selected is the option to

28
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.310
automatically accept attachment requests from VP.

29
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.850
Sees another account.

30
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.440
I'm gonna take.

31
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.130
This option would have been selected.

32
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.600
I choose Create transit Gateway.

33
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.460
It'll take a few minutes to create the tons of get where I once created.

34
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.540
We should see the state as girl from pending too available.

35
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.340
Now that we could see that transit gateways available,

36
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.660
let's create some transit gateway attachments.

37
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.430
So if I select transit gateway attachments and then

38
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.940
create transit gateway attachment,

39
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.480
the first time I need to do is choose the transit gateway that

40
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.610
we're trying to create attachment with and then cite the type of

41
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.840
attachment vpc VPN appear in connection.

42
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.640
We would use pairing connection.

43
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.910
It won't appear a pair of transit gateways in different regions.

44
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.940
This allows the pair of transit gateways to stop

45
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.680
ruining formation of each other.

46
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.310
Ah normally route traffic between the two different regions.

47
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.000
We collect VPN If we wanted our transit Gateway to collect

48
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.720
on premise device using site site VI pin collection with the

49
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.860
veep in example Transit Gate,

50
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.910
where your place is our virtual private gateways We're gonna quit

51
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.040
VPC attachment So if we leave VPC selected,

52
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.350
I would give the touch with the name we choose.

53
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.500
We want d N s support on I p six apart for this attachment And then in the

54
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.200
V p c i d section we select the VPC we want to create attachment with and

55
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.230
he can see the globe Mannix Island vpc so well slept that now he's like to

56
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.540
the VPC We scroll down a little bit.

57
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.940
We construct the sub nets that we want to use this attachment

58
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.960
here I can leave all three sub net selected.

59
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.440
I can disable this of nights that I do not want to use attachment

60
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.500
I'm halfway this sofa scroll down a little bit more I can say great

61
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.000
attachment He'll take a minute or two to create the attachment But

62
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.040
once the attachment is ready, its status should say available.

63
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.640
I'll add a couple more VPC attachments.

64
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.380
Here we can see three attachments with the attachment the Globe Mannix VPC

65
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.940
selected and all three attachments are available If I select transit

66
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.740
gateway route tables and then slit the roots tab.

67
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.940
Here you can see three routes in the root table,

68
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.100
one for each of our VPC attachments.

69
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.680
These roots were propagated,

70
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.920
which means they were shared their roots able from the attachments.

71
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.390
If we click on the propagation is Tab,

72
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.690
we can see a list of the attacks once that proper get in

73
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.440
their roots with this default route table.

74
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.750
Remember,

75
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.570
Route Propagation was one of the options we left selected

76
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.640
when we created the transit gateway.

77
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.810
Now,

78
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.410
although the attachments are propagated their routes to the

79
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.610
shared roots able in the transit gateway,

80
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.440
you'll find the VPC route tables might not being updated.

81
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.740
If I select one of mine VPC route tables,

82
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.290
I expect to the root table for the globe.

83
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.840
Mannix VPC.

84
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.390
If I say edit roots here, we just have the local rue entry.

85
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.140
If I say I drew,

86
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.840
I can add a route that sends all 17 to 16 traffic to the transit gateway.

87
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.880
I don't need to add a route for eat to the side of blocks that conferred

88
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.440
on the VP sees they're attached to our transit gateway.

89
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.670
If I'm happy, my roots, I say save roots.

90
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.750
I will now need to go to the root tables off.

91
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.440
The VP sees that attached to my transit gateway update their route tables.

92
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.290
The final feel want to show you here, then,

93
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.940
is the ability to share our transit gateways between AWS accounts.

94
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.540
So we'll leave the VPC dashboard on go to remote access Manager.

95
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.290
This is remarks manager and from here, I can select create a result share.

96
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.970
We provide a name and set the type of results I want to

97
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.840
share in our case Transit Gateway.

98
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.500
We choose the friends of Gateway from the list.

99
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.340
Then if I scroll down,

100
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.090
we can choose who you want to share this transit gateway with No,

101
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.700
it's a tick box here that allows it to share the

102
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.460
transit gate with external accounts.

103
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.080
So if I knew your 12 digit account, I d.

104
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.060
I could share this transit gateway with you in this model with disgust,

105
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.440
Dennis and hybrid network environment.

106
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.440
We've discussed him, worked with groups of three traffic policies.

107
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.030
I'm a disgusting worked with ADA West Transit Gateway in our next

108
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.980
module will be discussing aid us manage site site V,

109
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:41.000
p N's and two other technologies cloud hope on client VPN endpoints. So join me there and we'll continue on our Head West Hybrid networking journey
