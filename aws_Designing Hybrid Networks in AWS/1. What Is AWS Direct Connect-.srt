00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,430
[Autogenerated] Hi there.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:03,550
Ah,

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,800
welcome this module and are designing a due West hybrid network

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,540
architectures cause my name's Mike Brown on in this module.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,540
We're gonna look at designing hybrid network ____ touches

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,450
using Ed West Direct Connect in this model where first go

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,400
try and answer the question.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,860
What is a depressed direct connect where they're gonna go on to look us

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,530
in the components of a direct connect circuit before going on to discuss

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,840
how we can make direct connect Resilient.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,230
Finally,

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:34,140
we'll finish off by introducing new to direct connect her see connections.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,040
So start off by discussing what is a US direct connect.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,940
So, following that configuration,

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,080
glove Mannix have been using site site VI pens to

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,380
collect their offices to AWS Globe.

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,410
Mannix has not fallen.

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,090
Facilities are many small offices dotted around the globe.

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,540
One of the paramount concerns for glove Mannix.

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,730
He's making sure that all day that flows between their

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,560
offices on AWS is encrypted like Globe Mannix.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,940
Most of us will view site site VP end at some point in the past,

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,540
but what's in the drawbacks of using sites Ivy pens?

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,670
Well, for starters, traffic is sent across the public Internet.

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,990
This limits some of technologies you might want to use and

26
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,070
introduces security concerns that some of our compliance

27
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,830
auditors might not be under percent.

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,640
Happy wave.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,610
When using sites like VPN is revered,

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,540
breasts are virtual private gateways are limits 1.2 gigabytes of fruit.

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,240
This may not be in a family for your needs.

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,440
Because we're using the public Internet for our site site connections,

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,450
we can get unpredictable.

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,320
Followings depends on how busy the different network notes out that

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,340
we're going through the mighty periods of congestion.

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,010
Another drawback to using sites IVP ends across the public in

37
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,340
that is that bandwidth is not guaranteed.

38
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,530
Hello.

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,720
Mannix has found some problems when using site site free pens collected.

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,140
I digress, firstly, that larger offices don't have the performance they need.

41
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,640
They did not get the food put required when used in sight, sight, PP ens.

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,750
This, in turn, has limited.

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,440
The amount of service is the globe.

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,770
Mannix is using any breasts.

45
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,140
They're trying to conserve bandwidth for key systems.

46
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,580
Also,

47
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,490
glove Mannix I still can't into s3 on double service is

48
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,940
using their public endpoints of Internet.

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,730
This traffic is not going for their sight sight

50
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,940
connection with those problems in mind.

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,040
Globe Mannix is considering the use of a D West Direct Connect.

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,390
Direct Connect is used to establish a dedicated connection between

53
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,720
your office on AWS through the Direct Connect connection we can

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,840
connect about free peces on public service is,

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,940
I guess three.

56
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,340
Because we use that connection that dedicate for us,

57
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,450
we should get a more consistent network experience using direct

58
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,940
connect when compared to VPN connections.

59
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,340
Direct Connect provides a dedicated private on always own connective, eh?

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,340
There are lots of use cases for direct connect.

61
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,200
For example,

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,440
if you got large data sets and you try and transfer those large

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,640
data sets over sites like VPN connections,

64
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,040
that could take time and can be expensive.

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,980
If you're trying to copy a large amounts of data,

66
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,780
all of your sight sight v P N's.

67
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,730
It's probably taking up a lot your bandwidth.

68
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,710
And while you're using it,

69
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,100
that bandit cannot be used by over business units in your organization.

70
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,130
Using direct connect will speed up the data transfer and

71
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,750
leave my bun for available for over uses.

72
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,020
Real time data feeds such as voice and video come benefit from Direct

73
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,510
Connect Direct Connect provides a little antsy and consistent network

74
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,440
performance that really time data streams need.

75
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,060
Also think compliance because of direct current

76
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,240
connection is a dedicated private connection.

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,090
We're keeping all our traffic away from the public Internet that

78
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,020
might help satisfy compliance standards were trying to certify

79
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,240
against when working with direct connect.

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,340
Those two types of direct connect connections that we can configure,

81
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,870
first of all, is a dedicated direct connect connection.

82
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,610
These are built by you through a local direct connect location

83
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,140
provided by one of the address partners.

84
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
When create a dedicated connection,

85
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,340
we consign it for one gig are tanking part options.

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,940
Our second option is a hosted connection.

87
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,560
Instead of establishing the Direct Connect connection ourselves,

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,740
we choose one of the AWS Direct Connect parentless

89
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,900
will help us set up our connection.

90
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,350
One of the benefits of a hostage connection is that

91
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,240
we have more bandwidth choices.

92
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:28,000
We can send it for connections from 50 megabits all the way up to 10 gigabits, so her see connection might fit your budget a little bit better.
