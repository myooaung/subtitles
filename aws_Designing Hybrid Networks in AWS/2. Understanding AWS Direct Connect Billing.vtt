00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.740
[Autogenerated] Now I understand a little bit more about sight sight, really.

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.520
Let's have a conversation about the building associate ID with a due

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.650
West Direct Connect Firstly with air to Esther,

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.400
it connect.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.140
There's no minimum fee.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.640
You only pay for what you use.

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.440
You be charged for Paul Hours four hours of based on your connection type,

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.410
whether it's a dedicated connection or hosted connection provided

9
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.340
by a foot by on the capacity of that connection.

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.370
So, for example, is that one big part or 10 big part that you've purchased,

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.780
like a site site connection.

12
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.620
You'll also be charged for outbound data transfer on

13
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.540
just like site site connection.

14
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.240
This will incur per gigabyte fee if you go for dedicated connection,

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.430
the maybe additional cost to connect you from your on

16
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.240
premise into the car location for silly.

17
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.340
If you go for hurting connection,

18
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.840
the maybe additional fees incurred if the horse that

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.700
connection provider has to put their equipment into your

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.770
data centers for dedicated connection.

21
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.440
Most regions have consistent pricing the exceptions Japan,

22
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.340
where they have different park collection fees.

23
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.040
He'll have examples of long gig and 10 big part fees

24
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.640
for any region that isn't Japan.

25
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.610
So if we purchased a direct connect connection in the U West too,

26
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.740
we asked for a wounded part on that part was up 30 days.

27
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.590
How much would it cost us again?

28
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.520
If you do the mess around that he should work out $216 for the 30

29
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.890
days when working out outbound data transfer costs.

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.630
The cost will be dependent on the sauce.

31
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.640
A dress region on the direct connect location you've chosen.

32
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.670
You are building a dollar per gigabyte basis on his example.

33
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.140
If you're in the U and you've chosen eh quinyx as your

34
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.880
direct connect location provider and you're transferring

35
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.590
data out often you based region,

36
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.340
then it would cost you about two cents per gigabyte.

37
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.980
So if those factors in place and we're transferring out 500 gigabytes per month,

38
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.330
how much would that cost us?

39
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.700
Well again, if you do the maths that should work out around $10 in this example,

40
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.310
then the data transfer out is much less than the park

41
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.410
connection fees we saw on the previous slide.

42
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.920
But you might be transferring out much more data than this.

43
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.810
And don't forget,

44
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.990
these costs will change if Instead of transferring

45
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.440
data out of any you best region,

46
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.000
we'll try and transfer the data out of a enough America region. These figures would go up.
