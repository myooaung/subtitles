1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,140
[Autogenerated] So let's begin by trying to answer the question.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,620
What is a hybrid network?

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,440
Architecture?

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,940
If you asked to describe a hybrid network and stature, what would you say?

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,890
I'm sure there's lots of things he could write down.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,380
They might include connecting on premise network to a V P.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,690
C.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,150
I guess.

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,940
Fundamentally, that's what hybrid network after through all about.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,440
When discussing hybrid network arc touches,

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,440
you might have a conversation about throughput.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,270
Does your collective it need to be high speed and always on Oh,

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,350
can you route traffic over it?

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,540
And that when describing hybrid network contentious,

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,340
you might also have a conversation about security?

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,240
Does traffic needs be encrypted?

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,790
Doing point seemed to be authenticated.

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,240
A lot about security today is provided by I B SEC,

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,070
but your design might use a non i p ___ base protocol.

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,140
The choice of protocol might impact the features that we can use inside ed.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,540
Worse, to create a hybrid network architecture,

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,590
hybrid network architects and Eddie breasts well most often

23
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,090
involve a connection from on premise into your V p.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,840
C.

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,670
But these hybrid network architectures could also provide transitive ruin

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,540
capabilities so traffic can flow between your offices.

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,330
So when asked to describe hybrid network architectures to a colleague,

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,240
your conversation might involve these talking points on more

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,920
when connecting to results is deployed.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,240
In a digress,

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,190
we can use the public i p address of those resources public I Pierre does.

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,240
It can be attached to 82 instances, too low balances.

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,580
We can also connect to the public endpoints of products.

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,600
I guess three on dynamodb the second option when connecting to results.

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,890
There did Wes.

36
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,080
It's collect their private appearances.

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,700
This will involve creating a VPN connection or dedicated

38
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,070
circuit using any West direct connect.

39
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,660
In this example, we have a free PC deployed to our Aid West account.

40
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,440
This VPC contains two subjects and has a gateway device attached.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,040
We then have a good cause with the network crew with connective its Internet,

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,720
and we use our ruler to collect the get where device

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,740
needed breasts to quit VPN connection.

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,660
Everything going across this VPN connection will be encrypted.

45
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,950
The two endpoints Rudolph any kid reach over on the devices

46
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,450
commit configured the check the integrity of each packet

47
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,770
sent with this be pen collection.

48
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,040
Place results is 2.20 Wes on resulted to fight headquarters.

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,740
We'll be able to route to each other.

50
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,090
This is a typical example of hybrid networking.

51
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,740
In this next example,

52
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,230
we've got a Web tear deployed to AWS the servers in that Web tier

53
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,280
of accessible through a low balance that hates.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,100
Q.

55
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,680
We got applications here on a day of it.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,540
This is a typical example of a military application.

57
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,110
The unique thing here is respected.

58
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,880
Tears between us on on premise.

59
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,010
To allow the different parts of application to communicate.

60
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,020
Reach over.

61
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,980
We'll create a VPN connection so that the Web tear can communicate

62
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,220
application to and debt best securely on the outside.

63
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,880
Then we got a customer who's going to use a friendly

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,320
name of application and have that name.

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,090
Result fruit D N S o N i.

66
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,730
P Address D.

67
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,670
N s Will result that friend the name the public I P.

68
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,340
Address of the AWS Low balance.

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,430
In turn, the lower balance that will lower balance.

70
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,540
I request to the weapon here.

71
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,320
If the Web here needs to communicate with the applications,

72
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,600
here are the database the Web T will send that requests over the VPN

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,630
connection with this hybrid Rockets Design How Web taken Take

74
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,750
advantage of the scalability on elasticity.

75
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,040
The Aid West offers, while we can keep them, are sensitive.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,310
Parts of application on premise fall under our control.

77
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,000
This type of architecture is also used. Joe migrations into a digress.
