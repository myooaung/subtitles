00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.690
[Autogenerated] Now we've got a new review site.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.220
Syfy Pens.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.440
Let's try on the question.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.540
What is age West?

5
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.440
Direct Connect 80 West Don't Connect provides private,

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.040
dedicated, always own collective, eh?

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.280
So we no longer use the public Internet to send out

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.540
traffic from on premise into the cloud.

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.040
When using direct Connect, we rule out traffic through a Col occasion provider.

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.460
These echolocation providers provide connectivity between

11
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.980
arm promised network on the local aid.

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.340
West Region Direct Connect is available in multiple bandmate choices,

13
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.140
depending on your performance requirements on how much money have to spend.

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.990
You can buy one gig are 10 gig dad can't connections,

15
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.970
and if you go for a hosted connection,

16
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.440
you can buy bandwidth from 50 megabits and up.

17
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.880
We'll talk more about bandwidth choices and now,

18
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.500
direct connect module, let on the cause.

19
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.570
One thing that we should keep in the forefront of our mind

20
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650
when using direct connect is that Direct Connect does not

21
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.840
provide encryption for our packets.

22
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.390
If you require encryption,

23
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.840
we can create a VPN across the top of our direct connect circuit,

24
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.200
and again,

25
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.770
we'll talk more about that in a direct connect module

26
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.480
littering the course in this example.

27
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.730
We have our local address region and we have a V P.

28
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.940
C deployed to that region.

29
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.390
We could also see service Is that public endpoints such as s3 and dynamodb,

30
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.740
the host in that region as well?

31
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.930
On the right inside here we have our headquarters and in

32
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.620
the middle we have a code location.

33
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.390
Silly AWS would've placed direct connect equipment in the cooler cache of Cilic

34
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.540
and connected that equipment to the local ageless region.

35
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.540
You will make a connection between your offices on the cola and then

36
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.150
you'll request the direct connect circuit from a divorce On based on

37
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.390
the details that Edwards provide you,

38
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.940
the car location facility will quit a cross connect

39
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.340
connecting your equipment in the car location of Scylla

40
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.540
with the direct connect equipment.

41
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.740
Once this collective it is established,

42
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.770
we can create virtual interfaces to allow results.

43
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.050
Is deployed on premise to collect the results in R V.

44
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.250
P.

45
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.340
C.

46
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.510
I'm Kent Public Service like s3 through the direct connect connection.

47
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.460
Remember our three globe manic scenarios.

48
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.930
Familia have a little think about them on which of these

49
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.320
three globe Monix scenarios will benefit from a direct

50
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.640
connect connection well off the three.

51
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.980
The line of business application deployed to AWS access by the

52
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.240
Glow Max employees and also the on premise deployed application

53
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.540
using X three for a most college.

54
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.640
Unlike a site site, VPN,

55
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.440
we can now access these public s 10 points all fire ______,

56
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.980
Connect connection.

57
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.840
Instead of having to use into that,

58
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.480
both of these applications will benefit from the

59
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.240
dedicated bandwidth and high fruit.

60
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.220
Put that direct connect office again.

61
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.930
Our custom applications deployed 20 breasts wouldn't benefit

62
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.000
from direct connect cause that customers a vaccine application through public endpoints.
