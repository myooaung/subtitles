1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,970
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration, we're gonna configure an aide to us.

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,740
Manage repair.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,540
We'll be working with the aid US console and you

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,890
want to follow Miss Demonstration, You will need an address account.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm in the AWS Consul specifically in the VPC dashboard in the London region.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,590
On the left inside, I'm going to scroll down to the VPN section.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,440
The first component I'm gonna configure is the customer gateway.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,040
So if I select that and then I'll select create customer gateway.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,390
Hey, we have a standard phone that we can fill in.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,130
We provide a name fits customer get where?

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,620
So I've chosen global hit Q device.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,970
We choose the ruin method I want to use across this connection.

13
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,670
We're gonna be in static ruin this site site VPN and then the public eye.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,310
Pierre, just that we're going to use to connect to this customer device.

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,270
Optionally if we want to use a certificate of authentication, we comply.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,100
The details here on details of device itself,

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,440
such as manufacturer I'm happy with the second have configured.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,840
So I select great customer gateway.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,450
It shouldn't take long to create and it will then appear on

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,200
this customer gateway list the Nets component I'm gonna create

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,870
is the virtual private gateway.

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,330
So if I slept that I then click create virtual private

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,950
gateway no lot to configure here, just the name for the gateway.

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,450
And we can also choose how autonomous system numbers

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,890
provided even by Amazon off a custom sn autonomous system

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,500
was a part of our BDP configuration.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,710
I'm with the entire B G P module coming up later on.

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,340
This calls if we're happy with the configuration choices we

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,110
click create virtual private gateway.

30
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,870
In no time all our virtual private gateway will be created.

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,710
I can see mine here.

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,940
I could see it stay as detached.

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,140
What we need to do is attach his gateway to our V p.

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,040
C.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,060
So the gateway selected we choose actions on attached to V P.

36
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,690
C From the VPC drop down list.

37
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,870
We choose the VPC that we want to attach the gateway to If we're happy,

38
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,090
right choice, we say yes.

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,540
Attach on again in no time at all.

40
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,940
The gateway's attached to a V p.

41
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,520
C.

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,740
And we could see the attachment status here.

43
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,200
You know, I just meant you to this virtual private gateway.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,550
We'll need to adjust the route tables.

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,860
Five vpc Let's go find our VP sees route Table This is the

46
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,090
route table for our globe Mannix Free PC We find under route

47
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,800
table so of the route table selected, I say Eddie roots and then add route on.

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,080
We type in the root details.

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,540
So here I've added the route and what were turned The

50
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,100
route table is to get to this network.

51
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,620
Send the traffic to this virtual private gateway.

52
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,450
This network address represents our network ahead bars.

53
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm half with these roots,

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,670
so I select save roots with the roots have adjusted I'm

55
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,670
gonna scroll back down to the VPN section.

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,090
The final component then of aid to a Spanish VPN is

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,280
the site to site VPN connection.

58
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,840
So I'm gonna slit that and then click create VPN connection.

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,440
So here we provide a name for our VPN connection.

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,120
We select love.

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,990
This VPN connection will connect with virtual private Gateway Transit

62
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,850
Gateway We want virtual Private Gate was selected.

63
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,140
Let me choose over to a buyer a gateway from the dropdown list.

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,320
We've already configured a customer gateway so we leave

65
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,990
existing selected and choose our customer.

66
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,940
Get away from the dropdown list.

67
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,370
So where?

68
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,300
Configuring the VPN connection to link this virtual

69
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,480
private gateway with this customer gateway.

70
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,060
If I scroll down a little bit more again,

71
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,480
we have the option of choosing the ruin that want to use across this connection.

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,490
I'm gonna to stake and we provide a list of each network

73
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,640
that could be found at headquarters.

74
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,480
Scroll down a little bit more and we find options for configuring at 11 points.

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm happy, my sayings.

76
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,140
So I click create VPN connection.

77
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,480
Now, this will take a few minutes configure.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,270
So I'm gonna pause the video here and come back once

79
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,870
the VPN connection is created.

80
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,990
That took a few minutes, but now I can see that a VPN connection is available.

81
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,340
If I could contain all details,

82
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,140
we can see the 2 to 11 points the outside I Pierre just there in points on the

83
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,040
address space that's gonna be used inside the tunnel itself.

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,510
Right now, both East tunnels are down.

85
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,400
And that's because we haven't configured the on

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,920
primitive Aisha to connect these tunnels.

87
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,540
Tell post configure those on premise devices.

88
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,440
We have the option here to download a configuration file if I

89
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,900
select that I can choose from a series of vendors,

90
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,880
and I can download a configuration file too much,

91
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,540
my vendor and platform.

92
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,540
If you choose Microsoft from the list,

93
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,840
you could download a configuration file for Windows Rock Princeton.

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,000
So if you deploy a 2012 hour to machine,

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,940
for example, into one of the VPC, perhaps in a different region,

96
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,300
you can give that device a public I.

97
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,890
P address,

98
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:05,000
installed the route through my access service and then use this talented configuration file to establish the VPN connection.
