1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,940
[Autogenerated] So now we know what direct connect it can do for us.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,770
Let's spend a few minutes chatting about summer.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,840
Direct Connect components will need to configure our direct connect circuits.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,440
However, we decide to work with Direct Connect,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,840
we'll need to choose a direct connect location.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,910
AWS has partnered with various organizations around the world that

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,540
provide hosting for their direct connect equipment.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,130
Each of the partner sites that horse direct current equipment have highly

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,300
available lowlands can't have a into eight West regions.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,340
When we're creating our director that connection, we will choose one.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,280
These partners and we will connect from our own premise location.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,220
In fact, direct connection location.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,170
When we set up a dedicated direct connect connection where perching apart

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,540
the two part speeds enough for a one gig are 10 gig.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,620
Once we bring up our look, we then build virtual interface.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,250
Is these votes interfaces allow us to identify our traffics,

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,200
traversing the direct connect network Private a face is connected to our VP.

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,240
Sees public interface is connected to public service is like us three.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,330
We can establish any private verse interface with any virtual

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,030
private gateway that's in the same region.

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,800
Was a direct connect collection.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,340
If you wanna create a private version of face to a V P C in a different region,

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,770
then you're gonna need a direct connect gateway.

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,600
These gateways allow those connections across regions.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,660
They also allow us to stop associations with transit gateways.

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,210
So if you use a transit gateway, I want to connect that To direct connect.

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,250
You will need a direct connect gateway with a dedicated connection.

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,840
Are two part speeds a wounded in 10 gig?

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,850
But what if you need to get our three gig all 20 gig well

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,840
in congregating could help with that.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,890
Lynn congregation allows us to aggregate connections so it can combine

32
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,440
the bandwidth for multiple parts to give us more fruit.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,750
So imagine binding two wounded parts together using link obligation

34
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,500
to give us the equivalent of a two gig connection.

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,600
There's actually three types of version of face we can

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,540
create when work with direct connect.

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,680
The first is a private virtual interface.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,470
We used these to connect Ravi Peces using private I P addresses.

39
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,140
The second is a public virtue and vice.

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,300
We use these to collect Public service is like us three.

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,540
Using public, I p addresses.

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,420
And finally, we have a transit virtually no face.

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,660
We have transit boats interfaces when connecting to a transit gateway

44
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,380
through our direct connect Gateway Transit gateways.

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,180
Then allow us to access the private dress base of every peces.

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,440
There's a few steps involved in creating direct connect connection.

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,840
Here we have a high level overview of those steps.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,940
First, he'd can't your location to your chosen aid US Direct Connect location.

49
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,840
There's dozens and dozens of these to choose from around the club.

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,740
You're probably choose one that's in the same jug fears you

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,940
you'll speak them directly about establishing connection from

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,240
your location into their silly.

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,340
We can then go and request a direct connect connection

54
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,840
through the console once requested.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
We don't love this laugh.

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,440
This letter includes all information about your part Allocations on the air

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,420
Due West Direct Connect equipment in your chosen aid,

58
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,020
US direct current location.

59
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,490
The idea is that you pass this letter on your direct current location

60
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,060
provider and they will configure a cross connect.

61
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,780
The cross connect is to establish connection between your

62
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,870
equipment in the direct connect location on the direct cake

63
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,740
parts that being assigned to you.

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,650
You'll have to make sure that your age of West components are prepared.

65
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,940
So your VP sees, for example, have the right route information.

66
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,030
Well,

67
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,970
the appropriate security groups and knuckles have been

68
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,700
adjusted to allow the new traffic through,

69
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,690
and then we can crack about.

70
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,840
Clinton faces handling congregations again.

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,870
These the overview steps involved each one of these were involved.

72
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,930
Multiple steps to achieve the overall goal of establishing

73
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,670
your direct connect circuits in this example were buried The

74
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,820
West on left inside with the U.

75
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:44,950
S.

76
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,660
Public service is like us three and then your v p c with

77
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,020
virtual private gateway in the middle.

78
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,260
We have a direct connect location on the right.

79
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,240
Inside, we have head office.

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,150
I can see a depressive already placed a pair of direct

81
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,670
devices in this part location well established.

82
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,740
Connective it back to the local aid West region.

83
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,040
We will speak the partner on establishing connection into their facility.

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,950
This might involve was buying our own equipment and Stalin in the facility,

85
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,730
or renting Rackspace from the provider Well,

86
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,700
then go through the process of establishing direct connect

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,960
connection with the end result being that cross connect,

88
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,040
catch will be established between our equipment on the direct connect equipped.

89
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,640
Once the cross cracks in place, the part will come up.

90
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,880
And now we can create our private gifts on our public.

91
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
This with these 15 place traffic,

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,140
can now be ruined from our promise into red dress.

93
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,720
Here we got slightly different example on in this example.

94
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
We haven't drawn in head office,

95
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,580
but that would be off to the right of the screen.

96
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,440
We've got the direct Connect location and we've got across Captain Place.

97
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,740
This time in the Midwest.

98
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,270
We've got three.

99
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,270
VP sees each one in a different region.

100
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,660
Each one has a virtual private gateway on I wanna

101
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,690
establish connections to each these re peces.

102
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,610
It's with this example.

103
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,020
Then when we deploy direct connect Gateway each job is to allow us to

104
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,800
quit direct connect connections the VP sees in different regions and they

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,180
could see the connection's established reach.

106
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,790
Vpc on backed one premise.

107
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,740
Think about the previous side.

108
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,010
How many private fish would you need that configuration and

109
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,740
how would don't connect to be a differentiate the traffic

110
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,210
intended for different VP sees Well, we'd need three private.

111
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,910
This one freaked VPC verts interfaces identified using villain ID's so

112
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,590
each of affray VIPs would need a unique feeling i d.

113
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,800
When traffic is sent from head office to V.

114
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:35,960
P.

115
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,160
C.

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,940
One, it'll be attacked with a via an i d for v p.

117
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,120
C.

118
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,660
One by using real and ideas.

119
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,970
Direct connect can identify the traffic going to and from each re PC on

120
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,060
our traffic won't be sent in the wrong direction.

121
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,760
In this example,

122
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,030
we've got three VP sees this time all in the same region you west one I deserve

123
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,040
using virtual private gateways were using a transit gateway.

124
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,750
This reduces the number of virtual gateways we have

125
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,630
to pay for that Manage again.

126
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,650
We've got head office connected to the direct connect

127
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,370
location on a cross connecting place.

128
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,040
In this example, we need a direct connect gateway again.

129
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,440
Whenever we want to use a transit gateway without direct connect collections,

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,400
we need a direct connect gateway.

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,920
The direct connect gateway then facilitates the connection

132
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,410
from head office through to the transit gateway and ultimately

133
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,140
onto our virtual private clouds.

134
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,240
What about if we want to use transit gateways across regions?

135
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,640
We've already seen Ellen the cost that transit gateways that region specific.

136
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,140
Well, in that scenario, we would use multiple gateways.

137
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,650
So we deploy a gateway to each region that we have.

138
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,970
VP sees.

139
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,670
I don't we configure a pairing connection between those gateways.

140
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,110
That way,

141
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,050
we should bet route package from office to any of the

142
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,740
VP sees across any of those regions.

143
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,300
If you don't appear the transit gateways that you can connect the direct

144
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,140
connect gateway directly to each transit gateway individually,

145
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,940
Direct Connect is very free to rich,

146
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,160
but one of the things it doesn't give his encryption the day you send

147
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,840
across the direct current collection is not encrypted.

148
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,900
If you want encryption for your data that you would establish our direct

149
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,340
connect collection and then quite a sight sight connection of the top of it

150
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,290
when work with direct Connect be GP is a requirement.

151
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,790
Unlike site site, VP ends,

152
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,350
we have a choice of steak or dynamic ruin with direct connect.

153
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,840
We have to use ____ accruing.

154
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,980
If you want to monitor your direct connect connection.

155
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, good news. Your direct connect connection is integrated with cloudwatch
