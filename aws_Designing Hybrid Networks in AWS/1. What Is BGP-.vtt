00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.740
[Autogenerated] Hi there.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.070
Welcome this module and are designing Ed West.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.430
Hybrid networks costs my name's Mike Brown,

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.740
But in this module,

5
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.030
we're gonna be looking at using B G p to provide dynamic ruin in this module.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.540
We're gonna start off by trying to answer the question.

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.230
What is bi g P where they're gonna move on to this guy's using B g p

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.240
with direct connect on site site deep in connections.

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.340
Before going for a quick demonstration, we'll be working with B G P in Head West.

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.460
Let's start off then, by trying.

11
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.530
Answer the question.

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.040
What is B G P?

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.380
Well, first things first.

14
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.130
B g p stands for the board to get with protocol body Gary

15
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.540
Protocol is an example of an exterior Gary Protocol and Ruin

16
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.790
Xterra get the protocols are designed to swap,

17
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.750
ruin and reach a billy.

18
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.100
Information between autonomous systems on Ultima System is a

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.480
collection of I P networks or prefixes, usually under one admission control.

20
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.110
Inside, not on the system.

21
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.040
We will use interior, get re protocols, protocols like your SPF Andi I,

22
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.490
Joppy to swat route information and keep internal ruin tables up.

23
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.390
Today,

24
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.970
this collective internal rulers on their I p

25
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.700
prefixes form autonomous assistance.

26
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.170
The body get a protocol is considered a path vector protocol interior.

27
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.630
Get re protocols usually have some form of metric,

28
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.950
like a hot count value that's divided from the bandwidth on

29
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.350
your networks that they can share between rulers so that

30
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.840
rules commit their ruin decisions.

31
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.610
A change in bandmates somewhere might cause you internally.

32
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.180
Brewers drop dead their ruin tables path vector protocols like B G P.

33
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.290
A.

34
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.920
Controlled by the administrator.

35
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.840
The administrator sets attributes and sets ruin policies.

36
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.840
It's changes to these policies by the administrators.

37
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.040
The influence of the incisions.

38
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.400
One of the fundamental components of B G P networks are autonomous systems.

39
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.670
Autonomous systems are represented by number

40
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.940
historically has been a 16 bit number,

41
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.070
but today there's a 32 big numbering scheme as well.

42
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.730
There's lots of categories of autonomous system.

43
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.390
Number two of those categories are public out on the system

44
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840
numbers on private autonomous system numbers.

45
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.850
You have to register for public ___ numbers just like you

46
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.440
have to register for public I P addresses.

47
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.140
If you can register for a public ___ number,

48
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.740
you can use that number to replicate your autonomous systems on the Internet,

49
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.860
Private asked numbers.

50
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.810
I like private appearances.

51
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.590
They're designed for.

52
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.390
Internal use ought to be shared with neighbors off a private collections.

53
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.740
They're not to be used for public advertisement on the Internet.

54
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.540
The 16 bit private numbers range from 65,512.

55
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.590
65,005 in the 34 If you're connecting to AWS, I'm using B G P.

56
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.840
For that,

57
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.860
I'm a crew in that you can use Eva public or private numbers for

58
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.710
your connection with that connections of sight,

59
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.440
sight, VPN or direct connect, as well as representing your Thomas system.

60
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.730
Artemus system numbers have also used as part of the

61
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.340
neighbor relationship between bdp rears.

62
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.140
In order to swap route information to be GP, rulers must peel of each other.

63
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.540
They must form a neighbor relationship.

64
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.560
Part of four minutes named Relationship is dropping autonomous sister numbers.

65
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.290
These numbers then allows to identify our neighbors

66
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.440
from communicating them later on.

67
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.260
In this example,

68
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.320
we've got 80 West on the left on glove Mannix on the right and headed west.

69
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.640
We got VPC using the 192 once exact address space.

70
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.480
I mean, God, Mannix.

71
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.400
We got address space of 10 000 In order to swap fruit information,

72
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.560
the two rulers will have to form appear in relation.

73
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.730
To recover, they will have to become neighbors.

74
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.870
As part of that pain relationship, they will stop autonomous sister numbers.

75
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.100
Once the relationship is established, they will share prefixes.

76
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.240
The Globe Money True event would advertise a prefix 10

77
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.370
000 slash A on AWS would advertise.

78
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.670
The VP sees address space to global manic No, it sounds.

79
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.360
Advertisement includes the prefix is being advertised

80
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.380
on the autonomous system number.

81
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.180
In this example,

82
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.640
we still have a dress on her left hand glove Mannix on the right.

83
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.160
But we also have another company and as well as

84
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.630
farming a B G p relation very digress.

85
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.190
Globe Mannix has appeared with another company as well,

86
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.610
and it's dropping ruin information with that company.

87
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.790
That's part this relationship.

88
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.720
Another company will advertise its prefixes to glove Mannix.

89
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.030
In turn, globe magnates can advertise the prefixes from another company.

90
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.070
AWS.

91
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.520
Again.

92
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.060
Take a look at the prefix is an autonomous numbers in this advertisement,

93
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.870
where advertising the 17 to 16 prefix.

94
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.180
But we've now include the full autonomous system path that way.

95
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.890
The B g P rulers aws know exactly where this prefix came from.

96
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.170
On the autonomous systems that packets would have to

97
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.140
travel through to get to that network.

98
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.880
Let's complicate things a little bit.

99
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.400
Let's say that another company forms a BDP relationship with their de Bresse.

100
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.940
Now AWS will learn about prefix 17 to 16 in two different directions.

101
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.080
I guess the question is,

102
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.350
which path would address used when trying to send

103
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.540
traffic to the 17 to 16 00 network?

104
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.940
Well, in B g p, the shortest ___ path winds.

105
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.890
So in this example,

106
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.330
AWS would send traffic directly to another company to

107
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.940
get to that 17 to 16 address space.

108
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.840
Because that was not the shortest day of path that contains just one s number.

109
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.870
I'm not the two ___ numbers the glove Mannix advertised.

110
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.540
There's lots different ways that we can influence through decisions made by BTP.

111
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.540
In this example, we've got a dress on the left and Globe banks on the right.

112
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.110
This time club manager has a pair of rulers who are both appeared with AWS on.

113
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.550
Because these rumors come from the same autonomous system.

114
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.340
They're using the same autonomous sister number.

115
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.270
Another attribute we can use to influence through

116
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.440
incisions is called the Morgue Exit.

117
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.740
Discriminate.

118
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.860
This is a number that could be attached to the prefix

119
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.790
is that we have a ties in this case, the address.

120
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.150
Here we've got one Drew advertising a med of 10 on the

121
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.840
second rule of advertising in med of 20.

122
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.990
So again, the question is,

123
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.000
which path would aid Wes use to get that 10 address space?

124
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.540
Well, in this example, the lowest Met value wins.

125
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.330
So look at this down.

126
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.650
Come again because the top is send the med value of 10 on the

127
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.990
room at the bottom and send a med value of 20.

128
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.240
The path through the roof of the top to get to Network 10 would be the

129
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.330
preferred path we've discussed to Path attributes.

130
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.500
Surf are autonomous sister number on multi exit.

131
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.750
Discriminate here for the art of the System number

132
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.590
show his path wins for the med value.

133
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.290
The lower value wins.

134
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.280
BDP uses what's called its Best Path album.

135
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.750
The Best Path album is used to describe the best path to a given.

136
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.370
Prefects depend on your platform there's 10 plus

137
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.170
attributes that you can use for paths.

138
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.890
Election.

139
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:52.000
Some of these attributes affect local decisions on others. Influence the decisions on the B G p neighbors.
