1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,520
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration whether we're working with B G,

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,520
p and sites like v P N's throughout the demonstration where you've been

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,640
working with the aid US counsel on to follow along this demonstration

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,640
and we do encourage you to follow along,

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,140
you'll need an aide to US account.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,840
I'm in the address console specifically the VPC dashboard.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,990
If I scroll down a bit, find the VPN section in the VP in section.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,310
I'm going to slap customer gateways and then create custom a gateway.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,440
We create custom gateways in a previous section.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,680
So in here you provide a name for Gateway the public I p address on the

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,540
previous excise we selected steak this time limits like dynamic.

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,780
By selecting the dynamic readable,

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,640
we're asked to provide an autonomous sister number.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,240
No, it's here that autonomous sister numbers being suggested for US 65,000.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,990
Now you can use this default,

16
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,930
or you can use an autonomous system number that

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,040
matches your on premise configuration.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,880
This could be a private autonomous system number you've chosen to use or

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,840
public Autonomous is the number that you've registered for.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,550
If you're happy with the air, send choice select,

21
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,510
create customer gateway the next thing,

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,140
we're gonna look at the site site VPN connection.

23
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:25,140
So if I select sites like VPN connections and then click create VPN connection,

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,740
he'll find a name.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,690
The details of the virtual private Gail Transit

26
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,840
gateway on a customer gateway selection.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,460
And again, we get a choice of ruin Options.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,100
Even static are dynamic this time.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,040
We'll leave it set to dynamic.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,180
If I scroll down, there's nothing else that we have to configure.

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,340
Here.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,070
You can configure Go on Total Sense, sir,

33
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,940
including the I P addresses used for the tunnel connections.

34
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,770
Appreciate key.

35
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,210
Use, little connections.

36
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,740
And if you click the advanced radio balloons,

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,780
you'll also be a configured The eyepiece exceptions as well.

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,140
Have a play around with them if you need.

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,840
If not, click create VPN connection.

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,340
We'll take a little while that VPN connection to be created.

41
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,250
You can see here it's still pending, but over them what?

42
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,680
We've seen the van over B G P settings First configure

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,040
on the west Side of relationship.

44
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,740
Now that a VPN captain is available,

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,440
we can select the download configuration options.

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,820
If I slept that and choose my vendor and platform,

47
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,200
I can download a configuration file for my own promise device.

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,940
If I was, like downloads, download the file and then open it.

49
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,060
Here is the downloaded configuration file and specifically

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,990
have scroll down to the B G P section.

51
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,240
This is the configuration for Cisco Cloud Service Ruler.

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,670
We can see the command that starts the Ruby GP

53
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,460
process on this autonomous system.

54
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,330
Number 6 5000 Is that on the sister number off the

55
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,340
on premise side of elation ship.

56
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,010
Well, then get the neighbor details on these.

57
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,530
The details off the West Side relationship, including the I P.

58
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,670
Address off the air.

59
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,170
Depressed neighbor device, andi autonomous sister number used.

60
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,840
Collect that neighbor.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,240
Your configuration might look a little bit different for your on premise device,

62
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,540
and it might take a little bit of editing,

63
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,210
but these configuration files were great.

64
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,340
Start enough point on, if used correctly,

65
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,940
will lead to fewer errors in this model.

66
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,280
You learn what BDP is.

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,640
I went through some of his key features.

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
We discussed using PGP with sites,

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,040
ivy pens and direct connect on gave you a quick demonstration of using

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,140
B G P recite site connections in our next module.

71
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,410
Well done, second billing for direct connect in sight.

72
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,240
Side VP ends.

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,170
I'm take a look at a cost summary going through some the

74
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,540
key points for the last two hours.

75
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:01,000
So join me there. I will continue on AWS hybrid networking journey.
