00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.310
[Autogenerated] Let's spend a few minutes,

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.040
then discuss in B G p for direct connect and site site VI pens.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.570
The first thing we should say then is that B g p is optional for v p n's based.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.330
Required for direct connect both free pens and ____ it.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.340
Connect support public and private autonomous system numbers.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.140
Both of them allow us to use A s path pre pending to influence ruin decisions.

7
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.240
And we can use BTP community attacks to influence through incisions,

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.240
specifically the local preference B g p community attack.

9
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.150
With this tag weaken set one of three values.

10
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.960
This first value will be considered low preference.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.130
The second community value a medium preference on its

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.280
third community value high preference.

13
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.050
So if we have to pass into our network on we want aws, use one path of the over.

14
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.180
We can advertise the high preference community strings in one direction

15
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.980
on low preference community strings in the other.

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.800
Oh,

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.890
if I wanted to lower bounds traffic into my network

18
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.430
that I could advertise thesis,

19
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.840
aim community tug in two directions to aid arrests,

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
forcing them to love balance across my two links.

21
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.640
PGP uses TCP part 179 So we've got to make sure that's enabled

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.100
for ingress and egress for our networks.

23
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.040
In AWS, BDP piers cannot be more than one.

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.440
Hop away from each other if you'll be GP Connection is shown his idol

25
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.240
and check the I P addresses of local mope ears.

26
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810
Make sure they're correcting your configuration files.

27
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.410
Check the local, not be GP Autonomous sister Numbers on again.

28
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.030
Make sure you use the appropriate ones and your

29
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.770
configuration files and also check the password.

30
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.410
The password was generated by a dead Wes.

31
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.370
And just like that, I p address is not on the system.

32
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.400
Murders.

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.910
Make sure you've used the right password in your configuration in

34
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.740
order to help us get our configuration correct.

35
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.310
Both sides cite V P N's on Direct Connect support

36
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.790
download in a configuration file.

37
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.190
This configuration file contains everything we need to configure

38
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.290
the on premise side of the B G P relationship.

39
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.470
If you're using B G p across your sight sight connection,

40
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.140
make sure the veep internal is okay.

41
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.480
If it's a girl is not up or if it was flapping,

42
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870
the B G P relationship might not get established.

43
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.230
It's also worth remembering that for the Midwest manage VP ends the veep

44
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.440
internal connection has to be in the shape of on premise.

45
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.950
If your BTP states his idol,

46
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.540
nothing can check is the number of routes advertising PGP

47
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.240
relationships and headed west support a maximum of 100 troops.

48
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.140
If you're trying to advertise more than 100 routes,

49
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.290
consider even advertising default route are using roots organization in this

50
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.340
example of a dress and left on Globe banks on the right.

51
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.000
I'm gonna be GP peering over the established I want to see the bomb.

52
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.040
There is advertising that 10 prefix.

53
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.750
Now I want that to be the preferred path for traffic coming backing to God.

54
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.090
Mannix.

55
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.640
I don't want the roof top to be used in the event of a failure.

56
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.570
So this an example of when we can use a U.

57
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.350
S path pre pending when they're at the top advertised the 10

58
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.040
prefix we can obviously extend the S path length,

59
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.880
make it less desirable as a route towards network 10.

60
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.770
In this example, our route was a globe Mannix.

61
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.870
I received information about the 19 to one's excite

62
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.540
address space from two different directions.

63
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.650
Glove Mannix wants to make sure that traffic traveling

64
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.520
through 192168 network girls for the route with the bomb

65
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.240
and not the route with the top.

66
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.600
Now these two globe Monix rulers have also formed a B G P relationship.

67
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.080
So a stopping BDP information that's part of that internal

68
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.350
relationship we construct what's called a local preference.

69
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.610
Local preference could be used to influence the path that

70
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.080
globe manage sticks the 192 once exact network when

71
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.980
working with local preferences, the highest local preference winds.

72
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.430
So in this example, by setting a preference is 200 on the bottom.

73
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.540
Rouer I'm on 50 for the talk.

74
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.750
The Mannix will prefer the path for the bottom ruler to get

75
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.830
the 192168 network influence in past decisions is complex

76
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.080
and will take time to master, and we're just looking at a few attributes.

77
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.540
The Bt piece apart.

78
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.940
If you want to influence the path traffic takes coming into your network,

79
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.560
use path pre pending or the local preference.

80
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.440
B g P community attack off the to the B G P to attack is newer,

81
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.380
but path pre pending is still supplied if we want to influence

82
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.990
the route traffic checks out of our network,

83
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.490
then use local preferences.

84
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.340
Some systems support an attribute call wait value,

85
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.750
but local preference should be supported by all.

86
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.370
Be GP implementations here.

87
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.170
We've got slightly different configuration for Globe Mannix network.

88
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.770
This time we got Globe Mannix H Q on club on its branch.

89
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.840
I'm Hate Crime Branch for using different autonomous system numbers.

90
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.950
They have a B G p paid, unless you each other under peer relationship.

91
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.740
We've had grass.

92
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.140
Use the information the previous slide.

93
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.970
Try and answer the following questions.

94
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:05.610
If you need,

95
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.040
you can rewind this video and take a look at the previous slide again.

96
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.940
So question one.

97
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.840
When traffic is traveling from a dead west to the 17 to 16 prefix,

98
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.440
which path will it take?

99
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.040
Question, too.

100
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.980
We chat a bit with you,

101
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.820
read it and on which route in order to change the path to the

102
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.700
17 to 16 prefix and finally question three.

103
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.040
If the pairing connections down between hitch coup on, I digress.

104
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.340
What might you check?

105
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.340
Take a minute.

106
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.240
Got down a couple of answers, so your answer's my have included the question one.

107
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.630
The powerful girl for the Globe on its branch because Global Branch will

108
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.440
be sending a Charlotte s path length than hates Q word.

109
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.240
If you want to change that,

110
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.440
then you did just the path a tribute on the branch office ruler.

111
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.440
By changing the puff attribute,

112
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.340
we can make it longer unless attractive as inbound path.

113
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.520
The 17 to 16 network and question three.

114
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.600
Well, there's lots of things you can check but a game.

115
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.790
Make sure the VPN connections up.

116
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:18.000
Make sure the parts of open on that using the correct I P addresses passwords, and I taught him a sister numbers.
