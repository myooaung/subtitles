00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.320
[Autogenerated] in this demonstration.

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.680
Weldon, deploy a client VPN en pointe.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.740
We're gonna be working with the A.

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.560
D s consul throughout on the front.

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.780
Follow Miss Demonstration.

6
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.000
And we do encourage you to follow along.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.140
You'll need your own aid to Wes account.

8
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.540
I'm in the 80 West Consul specifically the VPC dashboard in the London region.

9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.900
If I scroll down Albert have found the VPN section in the VPN section.

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.070
I want client VPN points.

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.240
So if I select that and then I'll click create client VPN en pointe

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.540
and again my face with a standard form fill in.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.070
So first of a fighter named the VPN in point on

14
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.380
description and then the guy PV four sided look that's

15
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.640
gonna be used to give our i p addresses.

16
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.820
The clients connected into this client VPN point return it short.

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.040
This side of look is not being used anywhere else in our network.

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.440
Nah, nah.

19
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.580
VP sees unknown premise If the side of luck overlaps

20
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.990
with oversight of locks in use,

21
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.640
then we'll wanting to ruin difficult is laying around.

22
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.440
The next thing to consider is authentication.

23
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.140
We need to provide a service certificate,

24
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.660
so I construct a certificate bodies and drop down list.

25
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.970
This certificate will be used to authenticate the same point to the client,

26
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.600
and it needs to be a certificate this big issued by Amazons.

27
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.640
Difficult manager.

28
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.080
If you don't have a civic er,

29
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.850
go to Amazon Secret manual first on request one Amazon

30
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.440
city manager is region specific.

31
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.740
So make sure you request a certificate in the same region.

32
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.140
You're deploying your client VPN en pointe.

33
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.090
We can now choose our authentication method.

34
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.590
Mutual authentication will require digital certificates to

35
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.140
be installed on the client machines.

36
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.640
I'll use the best often occasion if I select user based authentication.

37
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.140
He asked me for details of an active directory tenant.

38
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.040
So from the dropdown list, I consent my active directory service.

39
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.800
This active duty service commis simplicity,

40
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.200
Amazons managed Mike's off active directory service.

41
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.540
Or, if we confused, Eddie Connector could be our own premise Directory service.

42
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.240
Scroll down a little bit and we can configure Logan.

43
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240
We can configure DNF server properties.

44
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.560
We can configure the transport for a call and you have

45
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.640
an option to enable spit tunneling.

46
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.840
We can also choose the vpc that this client VPN point gives access to.

47
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.190
If you're half of your configuration, then select Create client VPN en pointe.

48
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.370
The end point will only take a couple of minutes configure and when it does,

49
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.900
it will appear here to finish off our configuration.

50
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.040
We had association.

51
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.870
If I select the association's tap, I'm click associate events like my VP,

52
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.840
Sense of net and then click associate.

53
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.360
You can have several associations so you can go for those steps

54
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.140
several times he can say I've run for that associate with it twice

55
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.240
and I've got to submit association.

56
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.840
We can also configure security groups,

57
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.970
route tables and authorization using authorization we can control which

58
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.640
users that can connect this client VPN en pointe.

59
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.940
All we have to do now is configured the VPN client software

60
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.520
on our users laptops to help us with that where this download

61
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.440
client configuration options.

62
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.610
If I slept that then I construct download and we end up

63
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.200
download in an open V P M package.

64
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.950
This package can then be used to configure people's laptops to

65
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.440
connect this client VPN point In this model,

66
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.540
we've introduced you to aid us manage VPN.

67
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.250
We discussed static and dynamic V pins and we created

68
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.540
to follow along without VPN demos.

69
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.540
We also introduced Cloud Up and client VPN en Pointe.

70
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.840
In our next module.

71
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.040
We'll take a look at software site site V.

72
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.000
P N's. So join me there and we'll continue on AWS hybrid networking journey.
