1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,430
[Autogenerated] before taking a look at site site VI.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,340
Pens on air to West Direct connect in much more detail.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,640
I just want to try and answer this question.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,580
What is a transit VPC in this example?

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:13,900
Glove.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,840
Manning's has got three.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,240
VP sees each VPC is deployed to a different region.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,530
Globe Mannix requires collective it between these three peces on.

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,740
One option they have available to them is a feature called VPC Peering.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,320
VPC.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,560
Peering allows us to connect,

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,240
VP sees without having to deploy any gateway devices.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,540
So in this example,

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,840
glove Mannix VPC one on glow mark three pc to come appear together.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,090
By creating the paving connection,

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,780
I'm making the correct adjustment to root tables and knuckles.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,050
Easy to machines deployed to e V P.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,040
C.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,740
We'll be able to communicate region.

20
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,780
We could also Pierre glove Mannix vpc too.

21
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,340
On glove Manning's VPC three Again once development,

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,940
brute tables and knuckles have been adjusted,

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,900
we should find that results is deployed to V.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,050
P.

25
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,240
C.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,150
Two can route to results of deployed in V P C.

27
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,840
Three on vice versa, but with this period in place,

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,090
can result is deployed to BBC one roots results is deployed to V.

29
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:17,230
P.

30
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,410
C.

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:24,440
Three on the answer here is no in AWS transitive ruin like this is not allowed.

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,000
We cannot send traffic between two vpc Zvi referred.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,470
Of course.

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,840
In this example,

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,080
we could establish a VPC peering connection between VPC one on V P.

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,260
C.

37
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,650
Three and with the appropriate adjustments, Mazar is deployed to e V.

38
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:39,810
P.

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,940
C would be able to route to each other,

40
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,470
and that's finds the quite basic scenarios.

41
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,110
But the more VP sees you have, the more pairing connections you have,

42
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,740
the more complex this type of room becomes a transit VPC provide transit ruin.

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,460
In this example,

44
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,260
we have two VP sees each one has a deployed virtual private

45
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,220
gateway on we have our headquarters location ana in neck

46
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,000
planted ruler sat between them with a V p.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,740
C.

48
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,340
Where we've deployed marketplace devices.

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,440
These might be Cisco in a great service, rulers.

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,760
Or they might be customized E.

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:15,930
C.

52
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,810
Two instances that you create yourself evil way.

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,360
These devices in the transit vpc are fully into your control and your

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,740
responsibility to manage and maintain these devices.

55
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,660
Quit beeping connections to the virtual private get within

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,090
three p c onto the route from premise.

57
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,750
With this architecture in place, traffic from headquarters controversy,

58
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,840
the transit VPC on be sent on to any of the VPC that we are connected to.

59
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,540
This type of activity was commonplace, and he still use a lot today.

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,540
But as we'll see in a late model,

61
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,560
Aid West has released everyone managed device called a transit Gateway Face

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,970
designed to replace these marketplace devices on transit,

63
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,170
VP sees in this model we introduced Glove Mannix on we

64
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,090
discussed hybrid network connectivity options.

65
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,210
We introduce site site,

66
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,270
VP ends and Aid US Direct Connect and you introduced to Transit.

67
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:19,400
VP sees the goal of this Montel was to know only interest issue to the cause,

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,790
but also introduce you to the service is that we'll be

69
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,160
discussing in much more detail in the month.

70
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,340
ALS that's come in our next module we're gonna discuss some of

71
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,640
the supporting service is that site site,

72
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,260
VP Ends and Direct Connect will use will discuss the annex for hybrid a dress.

73
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,920
Deployments will discuss Route 53 ruin policies on how they could be

74
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,140
used to route traffic toe on premise in the cloud,

75
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,140
and we'll introduce you to air to West Transit Gateway,

76
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,270
which is the Aid West manage replacement for transit VP sees.

77
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:59,000
So join me there. I will continue on AWS hybrid network and journey.
