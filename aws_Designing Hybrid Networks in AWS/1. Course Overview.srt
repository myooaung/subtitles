00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,540
for Aid West Hybrid Network.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,090
By the end of this cause, you have detailed knowledge of aid US hybrid networks.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,940
They'll make you a valuable member of any 80 West networking team.

integrating a dress networks with application service is I hope you'll

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:26,000
join me on this journey to learn hybrid network designs in eight of us with designing hybrid networks, and Eddie West coughs up a little sign
