[Autogenerated] Hi there.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:03.740
Welcome to this.

3
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.320
Portal site costs designing hybrid networks in AWS.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.890
My name is Mike Brown Eye in this module,

5
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.740
we're gonna be introducing youto hybrid network architectures.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.720
We're gonna start off this bottle with a quick course overview German,

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.840
which will discuss why this costs important to you.

8
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.060
Well,

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.000
then give you a quick Montel overview before jumping right in

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.480
to discuss hybrid network architectures.

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.980
This will include a first introduction to site site VPN on AWS Direct Connect.

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.440
So let's begin with a cause overview.

13
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.770
The two subjects will become the most detailed for the

14
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.790
course will be sites I v p N's Andi, the West Direct Connect.

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.690
These two technologies are the foundational elements of hybrid network activity.

16
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.230
Will also discuss service Is that used to support our site site V.

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.050
P N's.

18
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.740
I need the Western Connect.

19
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.140
We'll spend the entire module, talk about static and dynamic ruin,

20
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.430
and in particular, how dynamic route is configured inside aws on front,

21
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.900
the course will talk about billing.

22
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.310
One of the questions that might be on your mind is

23
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.640
why is this cost important to you?

24
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.900
Well, most deployments, their dus involved deploying Amazon.

25
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.790
VP sees on.

26
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.310
Most projects I work on involve architect in captivity

27
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.640
from on premise into those three peces.

28
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.330
When thinking about hybrid connectivity, we've got lots of choices.

29
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.840
So understanding those choices on which choice the best forgiven situation

30
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740
will mean that you get the best out of a dress networking.

31
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.690
So who should view this costs?

32
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.070
Well,

33
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.770
if you design deploy hybrid network connections if you're

34
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.840
interested in highly available hybrid connectivity.

35
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.020
If you're stood in for the Midwest advanced networking specialist ification,

36
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.370
then this course is for you now.

37
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.340
Although anyone can benefit by attending this cause,

38
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.410
the vast and prerequisites you might wanna look at

39
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.930
first before starting this cause,

40
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.420
so familiar cloud concepts on a basic understanding of

41
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.140
cloud computing will be very beneficial.

42
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.890
Understanding Cloud Service models on the feature on

43
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.090
offer by AWS will really help.

44
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.560
There is a pliable site costs fundamentals of car computing,

45
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.440
and that's well worth having a look at before attending this course.

46
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.360
Also,

47
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300
there is the designing and implementing Age West

48
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.440
networks call from playful side.

49
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.240
This course covers basic and advanced VPC design

50
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.240
subjects that we're not going to touch it.

51
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.000
As I said, though, even if you don't meet the prerequisites.

52
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.500
The knowledge you gained by a tennis costs will be invaluable for your age.

53
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.920
West projects throughout this cost wagon.

54
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.830
The work of our customer Globe, Mannix, Globe,

55
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.220
Mannix,

56
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.590
the global health care organization who will be moving their key

57
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.940
systems to wear to dress As part of their move.

58
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.940
They'll be deploying resources Simon's a VP sees,

59
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.940
but they'll also be retained in their own promised networks.

60
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.290
We have been asked to provide hybrid network connected.

61
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.930
The options for Globe managed to consider any options that

62
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.300
we present must be highly available,

63
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.400
and we're also expected to provide the nerve of you of the supporting service

64
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.540
is needed when configuring hybrid connective In this model,

65
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.150
we'll be covering Hybrid network are touches on overview of sight sight v.

66
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.000
P. N's on the No view of direct connect
