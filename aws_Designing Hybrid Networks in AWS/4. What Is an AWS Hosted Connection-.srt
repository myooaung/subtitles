1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,980
[Autogenerated] in this section will try and turns the question.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,670
What is a direct connect hosted connection when

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,470
working with force The connections.

4
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,940
We work with a partner that's a member of the Direct Connect Partner program.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,180
This partner will help us establish a direct connect connection between

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,960
our locations and address one of the benefits of her.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,720
See connection is the part speech choices we don't have to accept.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,740
A one gig are tangled connection.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,790
We can set off a 50 megabits and work up in increments

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,840
when we purchase hosted connection.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,760
We're buying a virtual interface,

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,290
so Eat Hosted connection will connect is Eva to a V P.

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,240
C.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,300
Our public aid were service by allowing us to create a public life.

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,640
Our private Biff.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,150
Like most things in life,

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,640
there's both benefits and drawbacks to use in her see connections.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,040
One big benefit.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,960
If you get a lot of help in establishing a direct connect circuit,

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,090
it may be a simpler book, an appointment paying a fee on a given day.

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,930
The pattern will show up at your location and plugging some equipment,

22
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,290
and then you'll see the horsey connection established in

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,410
the direct connect console for you to accept because we

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,980
have more bandwidth choices.

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,290
We can choose a band with that suits our requirements

26
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,810
rather than having to go for one day.

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,580
Got anger circuit.

28
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,680
This can reduce the cost of a circuit,

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,140
but also we're not wasting bandwidth on money on through Put that we don't need.

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,940
Also, some hosted collection providers offer Marvel silly instructions,

31
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,740
which we might not be a get over Ford with a dedicated connection.

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,170
One of the drawbacks of her sick connection is the fact that

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,190
each connection is a single virtual interface.

34
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,190
So if you want more perverts interfaces,

35
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,140
you have to bind mobile connections, and this could increase your costs.

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,940
The more vicious you need, the my life you are go for dedicated connection.

37
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,380
Also,

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,030
the additional partner costs taken to account for the work

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,110
they're doing to establish connection for us.

40
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,250
If your organization only two single biff and definitely if

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,120
you need less bandwidth than one gigabyte,

42
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,150
then hosted connections might be the way to go.

43
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,640
Remember afterwards and connections configured,

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,840
it appears in your connection pain.

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,540
In the direct connect dashboard,

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,320
you must accept the connection before you can start

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,850
routing traffic across it status punctual.

48
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,820
We talked about from the problems that glove man face it,

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,030
and I think that connects solves those problems.

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,580
For starters,

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,030
the larger offices will take advantage of the increased

52
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,870
bandwidth on the particular performance to give them the

53
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,480
farm's improvements they need.

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,100
This, in turn,

55
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,950
means that Globe Mannix can start using more Reed West service is on move in,

56
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,040
move there on Premise Service's into eight of us.

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,510
It also means that traffic that was taken a bandwidth on their

58
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,140
standard in that connection is now moved away.

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,510
Freeing up that bandwidth for over service is also because we got a

60
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,180
direct connect connection will now be communicating with s3 and over

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,840
80 West Public Service is across that link.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,570
Keeping that traffic away from it as well are making our

63
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,230
compliance people happy and finally, to satisfy the encryption requirement.

64
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,740
Globe Monique's house Well established European connections

65
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,840
over top of our direct connect circuit,

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,690
encrypting traffic from on premise into our VP sees we don't have to worry

67
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,340
about using encryption when connecting to service is like s3.

68
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,440
Those connections use Hey, https endpoints.

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,300
So the traffic of there is always encrypted in this module.

70
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,690
We've discussed the benefits of using a due West Direct Connect.

71
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,840
You've learned about the different components that used

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,040
to create a direct connect connection,

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,370
and you've learned about some of the silly assumptions we have

74
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,840
when we're establishing direct connect circuits.

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,160
We finish this model by discussing direct connect her

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,940
stick connections in our next module.

77
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,830
Well, because in Diamond Crew in with B G.

78
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:34,000
P. So join me there and we'll continue on AWS hybrid networking journey.
