00:00:00,110  -->  00:00:01,020
<v Narrator>Hello and welcome,</v>
2

2

00:00:01,020  -->  00:00:03,340
to the step two of data pre-processing.
3

3

00:00:03,340  -->  00:00:05,572
So in this step, we will be importing the dataset,
4

4

00:00:05,572  -->  00:00:09,290
with which we will work in this data pre-processing section.
5

5

00:00:09,290  -->  00:00:11,720
So, as you understood, the tool we need
6

6

00:00:11,720  -->  00:00:14,710
to import any data sets is Pandas.
7

7

00:00:14,710  -->  00:00:17,020
The Pandas library, and so that's exactly
8

8

00:00:17,020  -->  00:00:20,060
what we're gonna use to import our dataset.
9

9

00:00:20,060  -->  00:00:22,720
So we're gonna put our dataset, which by the way
10

10

00:00:22,720  -->  00:00:25,310
is data.csv, into a new variable
11

11

00:00:25,310  -->  00:00:27,293
that we're gonna call dataset.
12

12

00:00:28,530  -->  00:00:31,020
And this is now that we use Pandas,
13

13

00:00:31,020  -->  00:00:36,020
we take our shortcut pd, that we gave here and then dot.
14

14

00:00:36,090  -->  00:00:38,070
And then we're gonna use one of the functions,
15

15

00:00:38,070  -->  00:00:40,149
of Pandas, because Pandas is a library
16

16

00:00:40,149  -->  00:00:43,730
that contains many functions and some classes.
17

17

00:00:43,730  -->  00:00:46,230
And now we're gonna use on of these functions.
18

18

00:00:46,230  -->  00:00:47,530
And the function we wanna use,
19

19

00:00:47,530  -->  00:00:49,859
is the function that imports any datasets,
20

20

00:00:49,859  -->  00:00:54,080
and this function is called read_csv,
21

21

00:00:54,080  -->  00:00:55,310
you have it right here.
22

22

00:00:55,310  -->  00:00:58,154
Read_csv and now we add some parenthesis,
23

23

00:00:58,154  -->  00:01:01,290
because we have to input some arguments.
24

24

00:01:01,290  -->  00:01:03,418
And in fact we only need to input one argument
25

25

00:01:03,418  -->  00:01:06,200
and that is the name of our dataset.
26

26

00:01:06,200  -->  00:01:09,400
Which we have to put in quotes, like this.
27

27

00:01:09,400  -->  00:01:11,050
And now what we simply need to write
28

28

00:01:11,050  -->  00:01:15,017
is the name of the dataset, that is Data.csv.
29

29

00:01:16,550  -->  00:01:20,222
As simple as that, this will import the dataset.
30

30

00:01:20,222  -->  00:01:24,767
We can check, if I select this line and execute.
31

31

00:01:24,767  -->  00:01:27,923
My dataset is well imported, we can check it out
32

32

00:01:27,923  -->  00:01:31,700
in variable explorer and here it is, that's the dataset.
33

33

00:01:31,700  -->  00:01:35,170
So, let's quickly explain what this dataset is about.
34

34

00:01:35,170  -->  00:01:38,030
Well first, this dataset is just an example of
35

35

00:01:38,030  -->  00:01:41,150
how datasets work in machinery, and so don't pay attention
36

36

00:01:41,150  -->  00:01:43,120
to the little size of the datasets.
37

37

00:01:43,120  -->  00:01:46,070
Of course later we will work on much larger datasets,
38

38

00:01:46,070  -->  00:01:50,370
but this is just to explain how datasets work in machinery.
39

39

00:01:50,370  -->  00:01:52,830
And so here we have some information of customers,
40

40

00:01:52,830  -->  00:01:56,246
these informations are the country, the age and the salary.
41

41

00:01:56,246  -->  00:01:59,250
And based on these informations we would like to predict,
42

42

00:01:59,250  -->  00:02:02,440
if the customer purchased a certain product.
43

43

00:02:02,440  -->  00:02:05,280
So the value of the dependent variable purchased is no,
44

44

00:02:05,280  -->  00:02:07,270
if the customer didn't buy the product,
45

45

00:02:07,270  -->  00:02:10,360
and yes if the customer bought the product.
46

46

00:02:10,360  -->  00:02:13,180
So the first thing to understand that is very important,
47

47

00:02:13,180  -->  00:02:16,570
is that most of the time, we have our features
48

48

00:02:16,570  -->  00:02:20,280
in columns and our observations in lines.
49

49

00:02:20,280  -->  00:02:22,428
So here we have 10 observations.
50

50

00:02:22,428  -->  00:02:25,490
Then the second very important thing to understand is,
51

51

00:02:25,490  -->  00:02:28,520
the difference between the independent variables
52

52

00:02:28,520  -->  00:02:30,290
and the dependent variable.
53

53

00:02:30,290  -->  00:02:32,920
In most datasets, in supervised machinery,
54

54

00:02:32,920  -->  00:02:34,870
you will have independent variables
55

55

00:02:34,870  -->  00:02:37,410
and one dependent variable, that you want to predict.
56

56

00:02:37,410  -->  00:02:39,250
So what is the difference between the two?
57

57

00:02:39,250  -->  00:02:42,020
Well, the dependent variable is the variable you
58

58

00:02:42,020  -->  00:02:45,110
want to predict and the independent variables,
59

59

00:02:45,110  -->  00:02:46,454
are the variables you want to use
60

60

00:02:46,454  -->  00:02:49,060
to predict the dependent variable.
61

61

00:02:49,060  -->  00:02:51,503
So in other words, the independent variables
62

62

00:02:51,503  -->  00:02:54,960
are the predictors and the dependent variable
63

63

00:02:54,960  -->  00:02:57,170
is the variable to be predicted.
64

64

00:02:57,170  -->  00:02:58,990
So that's very important to understand.
65

65

00:02:58,990  -->  00:03:01,390
And now, now that we understand this difference,
66

66

00:03:01,390  -->  00:03:03,060
well that leads us to the third thing
67

67

00:03:03,060  -->  00:03:04,400
important to understand.
68

68

00:03:04,400  -->  00:03:07,728
It's that, in Python we need to separate two arrays,
69

69

00:03:07,728  -->  00:03:10,840
one array that will contain the independent variables
70

70

00:03:10,840  -->  00:03:13,490
and one array that will contain the dependent variable.
71

71

00:03:13,490  -->  00:03:16,040
So that means that for now we have one dataset,
72

72

00:03:16,040  -->  00:03:18,620
in one same DataFrame, but in Python
73

73

00:03:18,620  -->  00:03:21,580
we don't work with DataFrames and we work with arrays.
74

74

00:03:21,580  -->  00:03:24,548
And that's why we had to import the numpy library here.
75

75

00:03:24,548  -->  00:03:26,490
Because it I with this library,
76

76

00:03:26,490  -->  00:03:28,430
that we will work with arrays.
77

77

00:03:28,430  -->  00:03:31,050
So now, what we have to do is to create
78

78

00:03:31,050  -->  00:03:33,040
the matrix of features, that is the matrix of
79

79

00:03:33,040  -->  00:03:36,225
independent variables that we will put in one separate array
80

80

00:03:36,225  -->  00:03:39,760
and we will create another array, a one dimensional array,
81

81

00:03:39,760  -->  00:03:43,450
which will contain the dependent variable in one vector.
82

82

00:03:43,450  -->  00:03:45,780
Okay, so let's create these two arrays.
83

83

00:03:45,780  -->  00:03:48,630
I'm gonna press okay and I'm gonna move onto
84

84

00:03:48,630  -->  00:03:51,530
the next line, to create these arrays.
85

85

00:03:51,530  -->  00:03:54,470
So the first array that will contain the features
86

86

00:03:54,470  -->  00:03:58,530
and we call it the matrix of features, we will call it X.
87

87

00:03:58,530  -->  00:04:02,400
X equals, and now we need to extract from the dataset
88

88

00:04:02,400  -->  00:04:04,920
the three first columns, because the three first columns
89

89

00:04:04,920  -->  00:04:06,530
are the independent variables.
90

90

00:04:06,530  -->  00:04:10,152
So since we're extracting these columns from the dataset,
91

91

00:04:10,152  -->  00:04:13,547
we start by taking our dataset, that same variable
92

92

00:04:13,547  -->  00:04:16,720
that we created here, then dot.
93

93

00:04:16,720  -->  00:04:20,150
And now we're gonna use another function from Pandas.
94

94

00:04:20,150  -->  00:04:23,500
That will take the indexes of the columns we want to extract
95

95

00:04:23,500  -->  00:04:26,480
from the dataset, that is the three first columns.
96

96

00:04:26,480  -->  00:04:28,770
And this function is iloc.
97

97

00:04:28,770  -->  00:04:31,810
And so now, in brackets we need to input the indexes
98

98

00:04:31,810  -->  00:04:33,650
of the columns we want to extract.
99

99

00:04:33,650  -->  00:04:35,916
And so, what are these indexes?
100

100

00:04:35,916  -->  00:04:39,261
Well, indexes in Python start at zero, as you can see here.
101

101

00:04:39,261  -->  00:04:43,010
So this first column here has index zero,
102

102

00:04:43,010  -->  00:04:44,700
this second column has index one
103

103

00:04:44,700  -->  00:04:46,420
and the third column has index two,
104

104

00:04:46,420  -->  00:04:48,370
and this has index three, so basically
105

105

00:04:48,370  -->  00:04:51,430
we need to take the indexes from zero to two.
106

106

00:04:51,430  -->  00:04:54,750
And there is a trick to get these indexes faster,
107

107

00:04:54,750  -->  00:04:57,000
well it's to take all the indexes
108

108

00:04:57,000  -->  00:05:00,400
of the four columns here, except the last one.
109

109

00:05:00,400  -->  00:05:01,640
And so, how do we do that?
110

110

00:05:01,640  -->  00:05:04,610
I'm gonna show you, so in the brackets first
111

111

00:05:04,610  -->  00:05:06,750
we need to input the lines first.
112

112

00:05:06,750  -->  00:05:08,180
And we wanna take all the lines,
113

113

00:05:08,180  -->  00:05:10,410
because we want to take all the observations.
114

114

00:05:10,410  -->  00:05:13,980
So basically, we'll take the ten observations here.
115

115

00:05:13,980  -->  00:05:15,987
And to take all the observations we need to input
116

116

00:05:15,987  -->  00:05:19,050
a column, that will take everything.
117

117

00:05:19,050  -->  00:05:22,140
And now we want to take all the columns except the last one,
118

118

00:05:22,140  -->  00:05:23,880
and the trick for that is to use
119

119

00:05:23,880  -->  00:05:27,201
a column and minus one, why is that?
120

120

00:05:27,201  -->  00:05:31,210
It's because minus one is the index of the last column
121

121

00:05:31,210  -->  00:05:35,000
from our dataset, so minus one is the index of this column.
122

122

00:05:35,000  -->  00:05:39,060
But in ranges in Python, because actually this is a range,
123

123

00:05:39,060  -->  00:05:41,610
well the upper bound is not included.
124

124

00:05:41,610  -->  00:05:45,240
So this minus one here that represents the last column,
125

125

00:05:45,240  -->  00:05:47,790
the dependent variable will not be included,
126

126

00:05:47,790  -->  00:05:49,250
because this is the upper bound
127

127

00:05:49,250  -->  00:05:53,240
of this range here, from zero to the last column.
128

128

00:05:53,240  -->  00:05:56,130
An therefore, a column minus one will take
129

129

00:05:56,130  -->  00:05:58,400
all the columns except the last one.
130

130

00:05:58,400  -->  00:06:00,705
Alright and then, to get all the values
131

131

00:06:00,705  -->  00:06:03,180
in these lines and columns we're extracting.
132

132

00:06:03,180  -->  00:06:07,880
We need to add here dot values, that's just how it works.
133

133

00:06:07,880  -->  00:06:11,370
And now, lets extract the dependent variable vector.
134

134

00:06:11,370  -->  00:06:15,110
So, lets check it our, I'm going to execute, here we go.
135

135

00:06:15,110  -->  00:06:17,740
X is created, and to have a look at X,
136

136

00:06:17,740  -->  00:06:21,750
we can enter it in the console, here it is, we have our
137

137

00:06:21,750  -->  00:06:25,370
10 observations and only the three first columns,
138

138

00:06:25,370  -->  00:06:28,060
country, age and the salary.
139

139

00:06:28,060  -->  00:06:29,560
Perfect and now we need to create
140

140

00:06:29,560  -->  00:06:32,240
the dependent variable vector, that we will also put
141

141

00:06:32,240  -->  00:06:35,135
in an array and that we will call Y.
142

142

00:06:35,135  -->  00:06:38,170
Common practice to call it Y, the dependent variable vector
143

143

00:06:38,170  -->  00:06:42,760
and machinery, so why equals and now that's
144

144

00:06:42,760  -->  00:06:47,500
exactly the same, we will take the same syntax as for X.
145

145

00:06:47,500  -->  00:06:49,380
So, I'm going to place that here
146

146

00:06:49,380  -->  00:06:51,660
and same we're going to take all the lines,
147

147

00:06:51,660  -->  00:06:53,920
so we use the column here but then
148

148

00:06:53,920  -->  00:06:56,070
we only wanna take the last column.
149

149

00:06:56,070  -->  00:06:57,850
And there is another trick to do that,
150

150

00:06:57,850  -->  00:06:59,170
maybe you guessed what it is.
151

151

00:06:59,170  -->  00:07:01,730
It's to take on the minus one,
152

152

00:07:01,730  -->  00:07:04,690
because as I just explained, minus one represents
153

153

00:07:04,690  -->  00:07:07,200
the index of the last column in an array.
154

154

00:07:07,200  -->  00:07:10,490
So minus one is the of the dependent variable vector.
155

155

00:07:10,490  -->  00:07:13,540
So let's check it out, I'm going to select this line
156

156

00:07:13,540  -->  00:07:16,910
and execute, alright Y is created,
157

157

00:07:16,910  -->  00:07:19,980
let's actually enter it in the console Y.
158

158

00:07:19,980  -->  00:07:23,350
Here we go, we get why Y with all the outcomes whether
159

159

00:07:23,350  -->  00:07:27,050
the customers bought, yes or no, this specific product.
160

160

00:07:27,050  -->  00:07:30,929
Perfect, so now we did everything we had to do to import
161

161

00:07:30,929  -->  00:07:33,610
the datasets, we imported the dataset
162

162

00:07:33,610  -->  00:07:36,030
as a DataFrame with this first line.
163

163

00:07:36,030  -->  00:07:39,260
We created the matrix of features with this second line
164

164

00:07:39,260  -->  00:07:41,523
and we created the dependent variable vector
165

165

00:07:41,523  -->  00:07:43,810
with this third line, perfect.
166

166

00:07:43,810  -->  00:07:46,420
So now, second step done, we're ready to move
167

167

00:07:46,420  -->  00:07:48,352
onto the third step, which will be about
168

168

00:07:48,352  -->  00:07:50,480
taking care of missing data.
169

169

00:07:50,480  -->  00:07:52,040
So, I'll see you in the next tutorial
170

170

00:07:52,040  -->  00:07:53,953
and until then enjoy machine learning.
