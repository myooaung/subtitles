<v Instructor>In the previous tutorial,</v>

2

00:00:01.123  -->  00:00:02.920
we talked about the linear regression
3

3

00:00:02.920  -->  00:00:05.860
being a trend line that best fits your data.
4

4

00:00:05.860  -->  00:00:08.700
Today we'll find out how to find that best fitting line
5

5

00:00:08.700  -->  00:00:11.630
or in fact, how the simple linear regression finds
6

6

00:00:11.630  -->  00:00:13.080
that line for you.
7

7

00:00:13.080  -->  00:00:16.670
So, here's our simple linear regression, the same chart,
8

8

00:00:16.670  -->  00:00:18.300
salary versus experience,
9

9

00:00:18.300  -->  00:00:20.140
we've got these red dots
10

10

00:00:20.140  -->  00:00:22.900
which represent the actual observations
11

11

00:00:22.900  -->  00:00:25.010
that we have in our data
12

12

00:00:25.010  -->  00:00:26.890
and we've got the trend line
13

13

00:00:26.890  -->  00:00:29.190
which represents the best fitting line
14

14

00:00:29.190  -->  00:00:33.100
or the simple linear regression model.
15

15

00:00:33.100  -->  00:00:36.450
So, now let's draw some vertical lines
16

16

00:00:36.450  -->  00:00:39.230
from the actual observations to the model
17

17

00:00:39.230  -->  00:00:42.040
and let's look at one of these specific examples
18

18

00:00:42.040  -->  00:00:44.250
to understand what we're talking about here.
19

19

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:46.710
So, here you can see
20

20

00:00:46.710  -->  00:00:51.390
that the red cross is where that person
21

21

00:00:51.390  -->  00:00:52.980
is sitting at in terms of salary,
22

22

00:00:52.980  -->  00:00:55.830
so let's say this person with 10 years of experience
23

23

00:00:55.830  -->  00:00:57.430
is earning $100,000.
24

24

00:00:57.430  -->  00:01:01.731
Well, the model line, so the black line at the bottom,
25

25

00:01:01.731  -->  00:01:05.480
it actually tells us where that person should be sitting
26

26

00:01:05.480  -->  00:01:07.570
according to the model in terms of salary
27

27

00:01:07.570  -->  00:01:09.790
and according to the model, it should be a bit lower,
28

28

00:01:09.790  -->  00:01:13.780
it should be somewhere where that green cross is
29

29

00:01:13.780  -->  00:01:17.003
which is about maybe let's say $80,000.
30

30

00:01:18.150  -->  00:01:20.593
So, now the red cross is called yi,
31

31

00:01:21.603  -->  00:01:23.200
so y of the subscript i
32

32

00:01:23.200  -->  00:01:25.450
and that is the actual duration,
33

33

00:01:25.450  -->  00:01:27.050
the green cross is called yi hat
34

34

00:01:27.940  -->  00:01:31.300
and that is the modeled observation
35

35

00:01:31.300  -->  00:01:34.960
or the modeled value, so basically with that level
36

36

00:01:34.960  -->  00:01:37.420
of experience where would he be,
37

37

00:01:37.420  -->  00:01:39.420
where does the model predict that he would be earning?
38

38

00:01:39.420  -->  00:01:40.670
And so, the green line therefore
39

39

00:01:40.670  -->  00:01:43.020
is the difference between what he's actually earning
40

40

00:01:43.020  -->  00:01:44.170
and what he should be earning,
41

41

00:01:44.170  -->  00:01:47.930
or not should be, what he's modeled to be earning,
42

42

00:01:47.930  -->  00:01:50.350
so therefore the green line,
43

43

00:01:50.350  -->  00:01:52.550
it will be the same regardless
44

44

00:01:52.550  -->  00:01:54.880
of what dependent variable you have,
45

45

00:01:54.880  -->  00:01:57.630
whether it's salary or it's grade at school, whatever,
46

46

00:01:57.630  -->  00:02:00.320
so it's the difference between the observed
47

47

00:02:00.320  -->  00:02:01.490
and the modeled
48

48

00:02:01.490  -->  00:02:04.410
for that level of independent variable.
49

49

00:02:04.410  -->  00:02:07.780
Now, to get this best fitting line,
50

50

00:02:07.780  -->  00:02:10.020
what is done is you take the sum,
51

51

00:02:10.020  -->  00:02:12.210
you take each one of those green lines
52

52

00:02:12.210  -->  00:02:14.820
or those distances, you square them
53

53

00:02:14.820  -->  00:02:17.620
and then you take the sum of those squares.
54

54

00:02:17.620  -->  00:02:19.356
Once you have the sum of the squares,
55

55

00:02:19.356  -->  00:02:21.890
you gotta find the minimum.
56

56

00:02:21.890  -->  00:02:24.480
So, basically what a simple linear regression does
57

57

00:02:24.480  -->  00:02:28.530
is it draws lots and lots and lots of these lines,
58

58

00:02:28.530  -->  00:02:30.820
these trend lines, this is like a simplistic way
59

59

00:02:30.820  -->  00:02:32.250
of imagining it,
60

60

00:02:32.250  -->  00:02:37.250
the linear regression draws all possible trend lines
61

61

00:02:37.340  -->  00:02:40.680
through your data and counts the sum
62

62

00:02:40.680  -->  00:02:42.570
of those squares every single time
63

63

00:02:42.570  -->  00:02:47.560
and it records it somewhere in a temporary file
64

64

00:02:47.560  -->  00:02:48.393
or something like that
65

65

00:02:48.393  -->  00:02:50.580
and then it finds the minimum one,
66

66

00:02:50.580  -->  00:02:52.960
so it looks for the minimum sum of squares,
67

67

00:02:52.960  -->  00:02:55.740
it finds the line which has the smallest sum
68

68

00:02:55.740  -->  00:02:57.710
of squares possible
69

69

00:02:57.710  -->  00:03:00.330
and that line will be the best fitting line
70

70

00:03:00.330  -->  00:03:03.870
and that is called the ordinary least squares method.
71

71

00:03:03.870  -->  00:03:06.600
So, that's how the simple linear regression works
72

72

00:03:06.600  -->  00:03:09.300
and I look forward to seeing you on the next tutorial.
