1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,710
In this video are going to learn how to use cue or to find and discover really good headlines for blog

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,280
posts or even YouTube videos that you want to create.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,740
So what you want to do is come into the search bar in cure and just type in the topic that you want

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,280
to create a blog post or a video bag.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,640
So it's just typed in instagram.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:31,320
Now what I want to do is just click on the word to search an up I'm going to see all of the most popular

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,230
questions for that topic head of can't I consume kise.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,140
Can you see who views your instagram.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,490
Now what we're really looking for are those questions that have a lot of answers because we can see

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,350
in the search results how many answers those questions have.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,830
And if we open this up then that gives us an indication of the popularity so we can see almost 3 million

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,370
views on this post.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,470
So how do we turn this into a headline.

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:06,750
Well all you need to do is really add a how to in front of the question to turn it from a question into

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,110
an educational type posts.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:18,430
So if we go to how to see who viewed your instagram we can see that there are some articles about it

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:25,420
but maybe not the exact language that people are really searching for here and that's a proven question

18
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,660
that a lot of people are clicking on and even you could maybe write a blog post on that or as you can

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,500
see a video here if you wanted to rank in the search engines even for that.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,910
Let's have a look at this video

21
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,980
37000 views.

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:51,690
Very simple video less than two minutes long and I mean that's how easily you can find a headline for

23
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,210
your blog posts or video that people are searching for a lot and are going to want to click on now in

24
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,180
terms of even if you don't even know how to answer this question and create a video or blog post on

25
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,350
this headline what you can do is come down.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,040
Read the answers and take maybe the top three answers.

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,120
Build a list of bullet points and you can use those bullet points or steps to explain to people how

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,120
to check is read your Instagram and you can even use that same line for maybe a video as well.

29
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:34,380
So the key point is here that Corra is not only a great place to drive website traffic it's also a fantastic

30
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,670
place to do research because these are real questions that your target audience are asking.

31
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,500
So if you create educational content or maybe a blog post or videos then you're going to get a lot of

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,170
views on those that content outside of curagh as well.

33
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,310
So let's have a look at another example here.

34
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,680
Why aren't hashtags working on Instagram.

35
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,240
So if we just copy this we could actually even use that as a title for a blog post.

36
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,520
But let's have a look down here.

37
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,260
Instagram tips how to fix an Instagram hashtag problem.

38
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:19,150
So that's something you could easily do to turn it from a question into a more how to post and even

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,240
we could probably make it quick with you on this.

40
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,290
Hashtags don't work solution.

41
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:33,040
So this is back into 2014 you maybe do an updated version of this again.

42
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,210
It's only a minute on 24000 views.

43
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,760
So there's definitely room even though there is a video here on it to improve on this.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,020
This is this is three years old it was four years old.

45
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:55,500
So don't be don't be put off if you do see there's one or two blog posts or one or two videos because

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,540
there's such a demand for answers to a question like this.

47
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,480
You can see these 32 answers 300000 views.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,290
So if there's room for 32 answers here there's definitely room for more than three or four blog posts

49
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,360
and three or four videos.

50
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:20,040
So that is how you use curagh not only to drive traffic but also to find and discover headline ideas

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:29,520
and even mordent not to really quickly create content by using the answers there as guidelines for how

52
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,090
you can put together your content as well.

53
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:40,800
So now that you understand how to discover those headline ideas come into your search for a topic and

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,740
start to have a look at those some of those headline ideas and turn them from questions into how to

55
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,570
headline's.
