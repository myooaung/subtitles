00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.180
One thing that I really like about the power tool is that it really lends itself to easily structuring

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.020
and thinking about split testing.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.730
If we go back to the alternative which is the odds create tool will remember that you just set your

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.350
campaign objective your sets on your ads before your campaign can really appear in your ads reporting

5
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.400
to go live.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
So it's quite a process it's all bunched together in one.

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.600
And that can be OK if you've just got one on set and whatnot but if you're trying and think about multiple

8
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.910
ad sets testing different audiences testing different placements testing different budgets and changes

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.600
it can be quite an overwhelming process.

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.390
But inside the power tool it's a lot lot simpler and I'll just give you an example to show you the difference.

11
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.770
So to create a campaign in power added or what you do is just click on Create campaign here.

12
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:02.280
Now I'm going to select the campaign name as just video views here and match it up to my campaign objective

13
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.890
and you'll see that all the campaign objectives here are the same that we've seen previously in the

14
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260
ads created a song.

15
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.590
Change that to the views you'll see here that the big buying type is just auction for some of those

16
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.140
objectives you may see the option for a fixed price CPM buying type.

17
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.770
Now if I want to create this campaign I don't have to go ahead and create an ad set yet and think about

18
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.440
all that stuff I can do is create a campaign button.

19
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.140
Now what pops an overview of the campaign and the objective.

20
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.520
I can just click that to close it again.

21
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.200
But what I can see now is that I have my campaign objective now inside here I can see one on set and

22
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870
this is where it starts to get interesting.

23
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.240
What I can do is actually duplicate this handset and split this audience up pretty quickly.

24
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.310
So I come up here click on the dropdown duplicate and I can see split audience.

25
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.990
So what I've got here is a set for 18 plus male and females.

26
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.350
And what I can do is actually split this audience into two and test between males and females.

27
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.210
Now instead of having one headset I've got two sets very quickly and I'll be able to test males versus

28
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.200
females for my campaign and you can see that pop up there now as well as just doing that quick split

29
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.930
audience that you can do and is built in as a button here.

30
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.440
You can also just select one of the sets and you can duplicate his.

31
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.200
See you can see that this is the duplicated Adsit here.

32
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.830
And I could change this come in and edit it and maybe then change the budget.

33
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.140
This in the shadow.

34
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.720
Maybe I could try a custom audience versus a normal audience different placements cetera.

35
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.330
And we can go into later on and the exact things that you could maybe test.

36
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.520
But the point right now is it's very easy to duplicate things.

37
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.990
And that makes it much easier to create various onsets very very quickly into a campaign now.

38
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.210
Equally you can do all of that same stuff at the level you can duplicate hods you couldn't duplicate

39
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.410
them and then change one thing like a call to action button learn more versus shop.

40
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.570
Now you can change the images and it's much easier to set up here quickly.

41
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.970
And I think get a clear overview of exactly for each campaign how many sets you have on how many apps

42
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.910
etc..

43
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.470
So what I recommend you do is come into your power editor just set up a campaign try to duplicate and

44
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.180
onset and maybe some odds and then you can always come back in here and just delete it once you're done.
