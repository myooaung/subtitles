1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,340
In this video you're going to learn how to build up a list of questions that you can answer in order

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,520
to get traffic back to your Web site.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,000
And I'm going to show you a secret strategy.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,380
So get your pen and paper out because this is really going to save you a huge amount of time.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:22,680
So what you want to do is come into your profile and then you want to come in to the topics that you've

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,130
added that you know about and click on.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:32,070
So for this example I'll click into Facebook ads and really what you want to do is come across to the

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,180
most viewed riders.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,990
Now this is really going to accelerate the process for you and help you identify those questions that

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,810
you can get a huge amount of answer views on.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,970
So what we're seeing here is the most viewed riders in this topic that's going to be the same for any

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,400
topic you click into.

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,870
And I can see that top 10 riders are the 10 riders with the most answer views in the last 30 days.

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,820
So really what we want to do here is identify those questions where they're getting all of these answer

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,890
views from and then we want to go ahead and answer them.

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,630
So let's click into this guy's profile and really answer the questions that he's answered and you can

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,930
see that by default it shows you the most recent answers and that is answer.

18
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,870
But we really want to click into that 30 day view so we can see how is he getting so many answers or

19
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,140
answer views and we can do that by sorting it by 30 day views.

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:37,710
So if we open this we can see that he's the top answer and that's really where we want to be as well.

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,700
We can see that this question only has 10 answers on it.

22
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,470
So that's a low amount of answers for a question.

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,560
That means it's easy to get to the top vote for it.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,680
And if we come down we can see that this question has over 200000 views so that is why this guy is getting

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,220
so many views on this question because there's not many answers but it's getting a huge amount of views

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,540
and supply and demand basically.

27
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,190
That's why he's getting so many honest views because it's not very competitive.

28
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,590
So what we can do is really save this to answer for ourselves and because it gets so many views and

29
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,020
there's not many answers and it's easy for us to get to the first spot if we answer and structure our

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,580
question well where even for us to get into that second or third position.

31
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,920
It's going to be pretty easy.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,800
And when you're looking at these questions you can also have a look at not just the number of answers

33
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,330
but how good is the answer.

34
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,990
And could you do it better than that that they've done and also something you might want to note as

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,760
the number of votes now an up vote is just when somebody reads a question or an answer if they like

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,680
it they'll up voters and that helps to really push good answers to the top that 13 is not much but we

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,890
can even rank maybe the second question with the low number of votes.

38
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,250
So an up three up votes is very low.

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,880
And so even if we have no votes on transfer we're still going to be able to get into that position pretty

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,440
easily.

41
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,060
So I batted that answer in.

42
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,070
Now let's just go to the second question that he's got the most answer views on in the last 30 days

43
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,290
and we can see he's not number one on this.

44
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,240
He's number two here and he's got 15 up votes.

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,090
But this question again only 11 answers and it's got 50000 views.

46
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,770
So again that's a pretty good question that we could answer.

47
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:45,770
Now let's continue on and maybe return to some of the other top riders from our group so let's click

48
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,750
into this.

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,120
Again we don't look at his most recent answers and look at his 30 day views to see where he's getting

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:03,500
all those views views from so he can come in here at 11 answers on this question 13000 views so that's

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,300
a good one.

52
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,340
And once again you need to be picking questions that you think you could answer and that would make

53
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,480
sense for you to link back to your product.

54
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,290
But 13.

55
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:20,940
It's not too much and even the second and only to school we could easily get that second spot and maybe

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,110
over time get to that first spot.

57
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,650
Let's go back and maybe have a look at another question here.

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,890
So any three answers on this question 60000 views.

59
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,090
He's the number two with only four up votes.

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,860
So again this is a great question that I could potentially add to my list.

61
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,970
And you don't have to think about it too hard.

62
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,900
You can just begin to build up less.

63
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:54,640
Answer questions and see how you rank so you could go to and through the top 10 here see what is the

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,660
question that they're ranked that they're number one on and getting all those fees from.

65
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:07,840
So let's just do one more 30 day views were my first Facebook messages being delivered 50 answers and

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,670
a million views.

67
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:08,970
OK.

68
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,510
So this is going to be more competitive.

69
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,630
Again I would I would encourage you to stick to that.

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,540
Maybe 10 answers and what you can do is if you see that this is a good question but it's too competitive

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,690
you could maybe look at the related questions in the sidebar here.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,120
And maybe you could answer these one so let's click into this.

73
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,040
There's only 10 answers.

74
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,310
There is 46000 views.

75
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,910
I can see the question in the top 1 has really no images in it.

76
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,220
It's not formatted Well it's not very eye catching.

77
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,050
It only has three votes on it but there's 50000 views.

78
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,750
Almost 46000.

79
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,630
So I can answer this later and really stick to that.

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
Less than 10 answers.

81
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,650
Loman's of up votes in the top answer.

82
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,130
And more than a thousand views and the higher the better.

83
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,690
You're always looking for that higher views with a low amount of answers.

84
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,870
And that's really how you're going to get ton of answer views very very quickly on cure.

85
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:21,210
So as you go through and look at those top riders and even maybe identify those related questions too

86
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,890
to those questions you're going to build up a list pretty quickly and you can come back.

87
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:32,830
Then click on answer and you can see these questions that you have selected to answer later.

88
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,740
And that is how you build up a list of questions to answer very very quickly.

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,980
So go ahead and try that for yourself in order to build up your list of questions.
