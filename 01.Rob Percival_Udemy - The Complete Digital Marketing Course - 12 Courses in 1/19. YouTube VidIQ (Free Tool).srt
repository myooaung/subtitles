00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,030
In this video you're going to learn how to use video IQ to grow your channel.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,540
So firstly what is video IQ.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:16,440
Well it is a browser extension for Chrome and it shows you a ton of extra stats about your own videos

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:24,810
right on the watch page and also gives you an incredible insight into competitor YouTube channels and

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,050
videos and there's a huge amount of information here.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,380
I'm going to walk you through some of the pieces of information that I find most helpful.

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,540
But firstly how do you get it.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,480
Well as I said it's a free Chrome browser extension.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,870
I'm going to put the link to this in the description of this video.

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,780
And essentially you can just go ahead and take that put to add it to your chrome browser.

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,810
And once you do that and reload the page on YouTube you're going to see all of this additional information

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,800
next to any video that you open up.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,620
And there is a ton of cool information here.

14
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:08,820
I just want to dig into some of the ones that I find most helpful when creating videos in order to grow

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,960
the channel and really get more views.

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:20,310
One of the best pieces of information here is video tags so I can see for this for this video which

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,030
I'm thinking to make a similar video on.

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,110
I can see the tags or keywords that this video is ranking in the search engine for it.

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,330
So if I type in how to use YouTube analytics

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,020
I have to use YouTube analytics I can see that this video is coming up.

21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:54,590
Number one as it says here if I just go ahead and type in youtube analytics I can see that the video

22
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:55,850
is number one.

23
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:02,810
So this shows me really the ranking of this video for these particular keywords.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,000
Now how is this useful.

25
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:10,290
Well if you were to create a video you want to make sure that your ranking for these tags is well and

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,150
include these tags as part of your video when you're optimizing and uploading your video.

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,040
Also you can use this information to put together a title that's really going to match up exactly with

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,240
those terms.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,080
So you could make a video like here like how to use YouTube analytics to grow your channel.

30
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,330
That ties in exactly what people are searching for and it is a compelling title and it's different to

31
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,900
the competitors title as well so these tags are incredible just for getting an insight into what search

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,110
terms a competitors ranking for.

33
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:51,320
You can use that information to help optimize your own videos and you can also see what your ranking

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,330
for this information will come up for your own videos.

35
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:01,100
And you can maybe adjust your title slightly to make it fit better with the tags that it's already ranking

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,550
for.

37
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,370
And that'll help you get more click through is now as well as the video tags.

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,670
Another thing that I really like about video IQ and how it helps me to grow my channel is by looking

39
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,500
at the referrers here.

40
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,490
So getting social shares is a key part of getting those initial views on your videos especially if you've

41
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,630
very low audience.

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,550
You do want to get that promotion out there and things that you can do for example by looking at these

43
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:37,640
referrers is come up and open these up and maybe you could tweeze add this particular U2 profile or

44
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:46,190
Twitter profile here and say you know hey I've noticed you shared out a similar YouTube video in the

45
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,770
past.

46
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,460
I've made a version of myself.

47
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,930
Maybe you want to share it with your followers.

48
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,160
You can also do that with other people who shared it on their Web site.

49
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,410
So if we look at this referrers again we can look at the Web sites where it's been shared.

50
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,320
We could maybe email them and say hey you know I've created a similar video to what you've shared in

51
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,030
the past.

52
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,490
Maybe you want to share it as well.

53
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,410
So that's another cool thing that you can do as well as looking at this information on the watch page

54
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,590
of videos.

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,550
There's a lot of information about you know the channel here as well and which monthly revenue it earns

56
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,880
or type of stuff.

57
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,780
And but another interesting thing is if you come in and search for something you can give you an indication

58
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,820
of how competitive this keyword is and the relative search volume.

59
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,370
So you really want to be creating videos around search terms that have a high search volume but low

60
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,370
competition and you can see it gives you an overall score here 71 out of 100.

61
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:53,960
So that is a pretty good keyword to make a video about because there's high search volume and low competition.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:02,180
So that is how you can use video IQ to grow your channel by spying on the competitors and seeing what

63
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:09,260
their ranking for using that information to run your home videos and also help pick the topics for the

64
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,780
videos that you're going to go and make.

65
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,240
So now it's your turn.

66
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:20,090
Go ahead and click the link in the description so you can add that IQ and use it to help grow your YouTube

67
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,620
channel.
