00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.840
In this video you're going to learn how to create an email campaign with MailChimp so that you can promote

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.640
your blog post to your email lists so you can promote plaudit products market surveys etc..

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.620
The process is all the same and it's really really simple to do.

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.270
So what you want to do is log into your MailChimp Kent and then go ahead and click Create campaign.

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.760
And we want to select Create an email campaign or what you want to do then is put in the campaign name.

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.340
Now I always recommend that your campaign name be the same as the subject line that you're going to

7
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.990
be using for the e-mail.

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.190
So I will just put in an example here that capture emails.

9
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.300
What I had a Web site and click Begin and I'm going to by default this will show and send it to your

10
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.380
entire list and I'd recommend that you do that if you've the smallest if you've a very big list.

11
00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.240
You can start to segmented and if you want and send Tony this e-mail to certain segments of your audience.

12
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.460
Look for the most part you'll probably be sending it to the entire list and you can leave that selected

13
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.730
and then click next.

14
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.490
Now in here we want to fill out a little bit more of the campaign info.

15
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.770
So as I said I'd recommend that you use the campaign name the same as the subject line.

16
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.840
You can do that at those if you want.

17
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.560
Next thing you want to add some previous tags and this snippet will appear in the inbox after the subject

18
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.630
line.

19
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.130
So what you might do is if you've quite a long subject line this probably won't even show in the inbox.

20
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.110
But if you've got a very short e-mail sit reclined you can add this in.

21
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.430
And again you want to think about this in the same way as the subject line.

22
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.900
Is this going to help people open the e-mail.

23
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.620
That's essentially what you want to do.

24
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.510
So I can say learn a really simple way

25
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.980
to capture e-mails

26
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.670
eating a Web site.

27
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.770
So again kind of encouraging people to see the benefits and then I'll show them how to.

28
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.030
Once they open the e-mail then the from name.

29
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.260
And this is my kind of personal e-mail list solidus leave it as my name but it could be the company

30
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.830
name you want to put in your From address as well.

31
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.890
And then here you can see that there's number of tracking options.

32
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.700
Probably the most important one that you want to enable is Google Analytics tracking it will walk you

33
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.010
through the steps here to set that up.

34
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.410
But if you haven't what you can do is go ahead and click save an excess and then you can come say to

35
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.620
your dashboard in a new tab.

36
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.520
You can come up to I can't integrations.

37
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.710
And then you can just connect to Google Analytics there.

38
00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.350
And the advantage of doing this and enabling this integration for this email campaign is that in your

39
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.040
Google Analytics reports in the campaign reports you're going to be able to see how many people actually

40
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.050
click through to your Web site from this specific e-mail.

41
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.400
And that is incredibly important to know.

42
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.830
So you can check maybe the next day OK how many people actually ended up on my site because of this

43
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.450
e-mail.

44
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.600
So that's really important to Nabl if you want to track that.

45
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.080
Now once you've got that done you can click Next on in here.

46
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.200
And there are a ton of templates that you can select.

47
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.630
There are some really fantastic professional looking ones you can drop images in.

48
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.180
You can do all sorts of stuff.

49
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.680
For example you can use either.

50
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.350
I'm just going to use a simple text and to be honest this is the type of e-mail that I send that most

51
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.920
often as well I think it just is a little bit more casual seems a little bit more personable.

52
00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.990
So what you want to do is maybe adjust the first line in the you know and this can often be just the

53
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.190
subject line again.

54
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:13.930
And then what you can do is just the text as well so I can say something like Click below to learn how

55
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.100
to set up.

56
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.260
So what I've said there is click below to learn how to set up a free learning page.

57
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.670
MailChimp so you can collect emails right and any web sites.

58
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.150
Now what I want to do is make sure that I put the link on what I can do is just actually paste a link

59
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.180
in there if I wanted to.

60
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.570
So I'll just say

61
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.810
what we really want to do now.

62
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.940
Is.

63
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.570
Just make sure that we actually put the link in there so insert the link

64
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.320
and insert that there that goes blue.

65
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.380
So we're all good to go down here below will actually be the information that you've put on your MailChimp

66
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.720
account in terms of your physical address.

67
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.010
And this is required just for anti-spam measures and that's why MailChimp has included it there.

68
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.740
Also you can see the option for people to subscribe which is I think required it's definitely best practice

69
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.960
because you don't want to annoy people make it easy for them to unsubscribe if they want.

70
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.270
And once you get that done you can seek a quick save and close and what you can also do is actually

71
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.520
input any of these buttons.

72
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:47.110
For example I could put a button there and change the text here and say something like learn more from

73
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.720
what I can also do then is just actually put in

74
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.330
I can put in the link there as well.

75
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.840
Maybe I'll do that because it just grabs the attention a little bit more.

76
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.840
So save and close that and I will just need that or text again just remove that.

77
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.190
And then what we want to do is click save and close.

78
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.000
Now we can click Next on.

79
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.730
Looks like we're all set to go now.

80
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.780
We can see we've got the green ticks against all of the different parts.

81
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.790
Now a very important thing that you want to do before you go ahead and send that any e-mails is just

82
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.410
make sure that everything looks OK.

83
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:33.300
So what I'd recommend you do is go ahead and send a test email and you can send that to your own personal

84
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.440
accounts and really you just want to look at this e-mail from the perspective of somebody who's going

85
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.230
to get it into their e-mail account.

86
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.020
So to do that you want to log in.

87
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.420
Cheere e-mail account

88
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.010
and then you might have to wait a couple of minutes for this to come through.

89
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.610
And you can see it there it says test here but it's not going to say that in the real e-mail and how

90
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.280
to capture e-mails with a Web site.

91
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.740
So ask yourself what I open that is that a goodness subject line should I maybe changes.

92
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.570
You can see the snippet text here as well.

93
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.580
Is that being cut off.

94
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.530
Is there more important information that could move to the start of that again really ask yourself would

95
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.260
you open this e-mail because if you're saying I don't know or maybe not well then maybe can come back

96
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.570
and work on this because that's critical to people even clicking through your Web site.

97
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.480
So once you're happy with the subject line or have spotted something you can improve.

98
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.730
You can open the mail.

99
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.930
Check the spelling maybe read it aloud a couple times.

100
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.250
Make sure the information here is accurate.

101
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.160
And most importantly make sure this link is working.

102
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.590
Now I just put in an example in there which you want to make sure that it's going to the right page

103
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.150
because that's one of the most important things.

104
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.840
So if there are any things that you feel you could improve upon or need to it you can just come in and

105
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.440
edit different sections there and once you're happy you can actually go ahead and Schenkel the e-mail

106
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.530
if you want.

107
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:10.460
So when you're thinking about sending out your e-mail you want to think about OK who are your audience.

108
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:16.640
If you've a global audience you want to send that at a time that really hits the maximum amount of people.

109
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.660
For example I'm in Dublin Ireland.

110
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.240
Usually I send my e-mails about five o'clock in the afternoon that's usually about 9:00 o'clock in San

111
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.480
Francisco by lunchtime in New York and that allows me to cover the maximum amount of people that I can

112
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.980
from my audience.

113
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.000
You don't want to be sending your e-mails when everybody's in bed etcetera.

114
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.560
So if it's hard for you to manage the time you can schedule ish or you can go ahead and click send now

115
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.570
and then you can just go ahead and click send to send that.

116
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.890
And that is really how you create an email campaign in MailChimp.

117
00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:01.350
It is a really important thing to do if you want to drive Web site traffic from your email list or drive

118
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.230
sales.

119
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:07.560
So it's a simple process and it's really the same for whatever objective that you have.

120
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.810
And the most important thing once again that I would recommend is that you go ahead and send that test

121
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.220
email every time.

122
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.810
I guarantee you you're going to spot a couple of things that you could improve upon or a couple of mistakes

123
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.230
at added before you click the final send button.
