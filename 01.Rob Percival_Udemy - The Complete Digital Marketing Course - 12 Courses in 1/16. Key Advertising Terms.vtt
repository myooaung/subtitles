Before you start to analyze your advertising reports it's important that you understand the terms and

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.440
acronyms that you're going to see there in this video.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.600
We're going to do an overview of the six most important ones SUNO and also show you where you can see

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.880
a glossary of all of the terms used by Facebook.

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.310
Now clicks are the total number of clicks actions in your ad and depending on what you're promoting

6
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.750
this kind include clicks to our Web site page likes event responses or app installs.

7
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.300
Click through race or city or refers to the number of clicks you receive.

8
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.870
Divided by the number of times an ad was shown on Facebook and the higher this number the better your

9
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.170
art is performing because it means that more people who see your ad really click through.

10
00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.510
Next up we have CPM or cost per 1000 impressions and this is the average cost that you paid to have

11
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.970
1000 impressions of your ad.

12
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.440
An impression is any time an advertisement is shown on the screen and that's an important player occasion

13
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:20.010
to make an impression doesn't guarantee that the users saw it just that the ad appeared on their page.

14
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.670
Next up we have average CPC or cost per click for these ads.

15
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.020
This is calculated by the man spent divided by the number of clicks received.

16
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.050
So even if you're paying for in-and on a CPM basis you'll also see the CPC calculated and typically

17
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.750
you're aiming for the lowest CPC that still returns the results that you want.

18
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.800
Next up we have frequency and this refers to the average number of times each person received an impression

19
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010
of your advertisement.

20
00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.510
Advertisers often want to set a limit on this and to cap this at a certain rate to prevent fatigue or

21
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.750
people just seeing your ad over and over again and the last time you'll see often is reached.

22
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.730
And this refers to the number of unique people who saw your.

23
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.100
So for example if 100 people saw your ad then your reach would be equal to 100.

24
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.560
And if you had a reach of 100 with a frequency of four.

25
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.790
Well that would indicate that 100 people Soyer out four times which means you would have 400 impressions

26
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.280
for that campaign.

27
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.020
These six terms that you have learned will help you determine which ads are performing well and which

28
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.040
ones needs some refinements.

29
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.640
