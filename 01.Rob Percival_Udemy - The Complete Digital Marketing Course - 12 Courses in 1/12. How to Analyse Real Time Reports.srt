00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,170
In this video you're going to learn how to use real time reports to monitor activity as it happens on

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,310
your Web site or up to access your real time reports.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,290
Just log into your Google Analytics account and open up the sidebar so that you can click through to

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,070
the real time reports.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,600
Then there are six reports here.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,640
Overview locations traffic sources content events and conversions.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,810
And if we start by looking at the overview realtime report we can really get a summary of most of these

8
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,700
reports.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,290
So let's have a look at some of this data and then we can discuss some of the use cases of it.

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,270
So this is pretty cool.

11
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,700
We can see right now how many people are active on the site and you can see those numbers go up and

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,410
down on even the devices that they're logging onto the site from we can see where they're spending their

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,950
time.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,210
The top active pages we can see the breakdown of active users.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,300
This is really interesting to see in real time where people are on our site.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,560
We can also see some of the top web sites that they've come from on any social traffic if they've come

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:18,110
from those traffic sources like Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter Instagram etc. Some kinds can see the

18
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,040
top keywords that they've accessed our site on.

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,810
So they may have typed in something to the Google search engine and come through that way.

20
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,680
Often there isn't a lot of information coming through here but it can be useful if it is provided.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,130
Perhaps one of the most interesting real time reports to look at is the locations where people are coming

22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:46,060
from and it's just really interesting to see where people are logging in from.

23
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,550
And it can really bring the whole experience of Google Analytics to life and make it real and see all

24
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,110
the changes and people moving around on the site.

25
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,670
Up here we can see the page views per minute and this is really just showing us the number of page views

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,810
per minute.

27
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:09,010
Over the last 30 minutes you can see that's 30 minutes and really up to now.

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,780
So what are some of the use cases of this data.

29
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,400
Well first of all if you're seeing data here you know that you're tracking code is working on your Web

30
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,460
site or up because information is coming through onto your Google Analytics.

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:31,730
It's also useful use these real time reports to monitor whether newer change content on your site is

32
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,100
being viewed.

33
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,660
So it can just be good if you've sent out a blog post to see how many people are actually coming through

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,850
to have a look at that could be an e-mail or blog post that you promoted by e-mail or maybe on social

35
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,970
media and you can really check if people are coming through from those social channels.

36
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,210
It can also be pretty cool if you've got a one day promotion or a sale on and really see our people

37
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,160
coming through from that.

38
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,610
When are they on the active pages that you want them to be on.

39
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,850
Now another thing that you can use these real time reports for is if you've made any changes to the

40
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:17,660
conversion process or the check out process to really just make sure that people are actively going

41
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,420
through those pages and there's not something broken off teeth made any changes there.

42
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,430
So these real time reports are pretty cool.

43
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,330
They're even just interesting to come in and have a look at especially see where people are logging

44
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:39,140
in from and they can be very helpful just to check that everything is working and to keep your finger

45
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,250
on the poles of any campaigns that are active right now.

46
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:50,740
And for the most part we will be analyzing historical data to guide our long term Web site strategy.

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,710
But there are some clear use cases for these real time reports coming into your demo accounts or your

48
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,840
own Google Analytics account and check out these real time reports for yourself.
