1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:07,500
In this video you're going to learn how to add a channel icon and also how to add a description to your

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,060
YouTube channel and add links to your other social media profiles.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:19,360
So to get started you want to just click on customized channel after you've created your channel and

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:27,730
then you have the option here to add your channel icon so add on can just click on the Edit button and

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:34,260
click on edits and then you really want to upload your channel icon.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,810
Now for this example all this upload a picture of myself here.

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,160
But really you want this picture to be something that is either a closeup of your face if it's a personal

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,900
channel or the logo for your company and you want to keep this as simple as possible because this will

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,940
be shrunk down and appear underneath your videos.

10
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,220
So you really want to keep it simple and use the same logo that you might be using on other social media

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,440
platforms as well.

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,510
So once you have created your icon and I did that in and you want to come back and start to add a channel

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,090
description now it may take five or 10 minutes to actually get that icon to show up.

14
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,230
So don't worry if it doesn't show up straightaway.

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,950
It just takes a little bit of time to come through.

16
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,900
And then let us have a look at the really about page.

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,810
This is where we really want to add in some information about the company or your own channel so you

18
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,460
can see the first option here is challenge description sort of click this open you really want to write

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,580
a little bit about your business here on what you're all about.

20
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,170
Now I know this can be hard to do especially if you're just starting out.

21
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,600
So one of the best things that you can do is just come in to YouTube and have a look at the description

22
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,450
of similar businesses to you.

23
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,660
So let's have a look at this.

24
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,200
Look see here compering.

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,060
And if we come across to their bite page we can see their description here.

26
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,770
So obviously they mentioned what they're about we love hair and so they create tutorials kind of describing

27
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,580
what their channel is about and at kind of describe what all the videos are better.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,880
It's not just the company but also water the videos really abide and make it clear in the first couple

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,850
of words they've done here.

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,830
What is the key word that could be Instagram if you're teaching Instagram could be digital marketing

31
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,610
could be law Cobi whatever real estate.

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,250
So really get get make it clear what you're all about.

33
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,220
Right from the start and then like they done here this is a good idea if you want to promote some of

34
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,090
their social channels you can do that.

35
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,330
So the best thing to do is really have a look at a couple of similar similar channels.

36
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,400
And if you don't know who those channels are just start to type in some of your key words into YouTube

37
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,800
and you're going to find their videos pretty quickly.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,140
And then you can click through to the About section.

39
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,960
So after you've heard your description you have some other details to fill here.

40
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,410
You cannot in an e-mail so people can contact you directly through YouTube for business inquiries.

41
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:24,160
You can go ahead and select your country there so just change this to Ireland.

42
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,620
And then here you can also add in links to your different social media profiles or web sites or if you

43
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,540
click and you can really just paste the URL if you want.

44
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,080
So for example

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,170
and if I click add here I actually do need to specify a name.

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,540
You can just say Web site and you can see this shows of his web site and actually underneath here the

47
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,060
channel arch it shows up as well.

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,850
So if we look at our example we can see they get luxury hair extensions that's actually a smart thing

49
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:09,370
to do to show people exactly what to do and what they can get by clicking here.

50
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,550
And then you can also see that they have links to their other social media profiles as well which they've

51
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
put in here.

52
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:23,070
So now that you know Heidi you are a channel icon and a description email and links to social media

53
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,110
profiles.

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Go ahead and do that for yourself and use existing channels as inspiration and to help you speed up

55
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,050
this process.
