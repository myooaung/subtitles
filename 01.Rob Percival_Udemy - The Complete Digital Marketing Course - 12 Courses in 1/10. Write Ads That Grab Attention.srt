1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,490
Once you set up your group or groups then you can create your ads.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,030
Now these are the ads is actually what's going to appear in Google either on mobile or you can see on

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,180
desktop here.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,320
And so we really want to create these so they grab the searchers attention and that they're going to

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,120
click through.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,690
Now as they recommend here you should create at least at least three ads that closely relate to the

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,490
theme of your keywords and the reason that you'd want to do that is so that you can test out a couple

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,180
of different headlines descriptions and see which one really performs the best.

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,480
And when this video is set up want to really walk you through the process of it and you can go ahead

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,060
and create a couple of extra ones for yourself.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,030
So the first thing that you want to put in here is the final you are l and this is really the landing

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,460
page or the page your Web site that you will be sending people to.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,890
So for example for me that could just be my web site for Slash the product page name and you can see

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,760
that this is being updated in here.

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,250
Next thing that we want to put in is our headline which is appearing here headline one headline too

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,370
and the description that's appearing underneath and this can be a little bit intimidating to do.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,630
What I would really recommend is rather than reinvent the wheel just come into Google really tie being

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,780
your product or service and just have a look at the ads already appearing for that underneath some of

19
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,960
your keywords.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,380
What you really want to do is have a look at some of these ads and really have a look.

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,510
What are the headlines that they use.

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,670
Are they catching your attention.

23
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,600
Are they really.

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,240
Do they really make you want to click through.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,810
What are some of the things that are really catching your attention.

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,910
81 percent were promoted after the quarter so that's a pretty good metric.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,110
I'm not sure if I could use that personally because I don't measure that but there are some interesting

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,220
things here.

29
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:04,600
Now oftentimes you're not going to CNN that may be perfect so what you can do is look at a similar product.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,500
And for me for example this could be if I don't see any ads that I like here and I don't find any good

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,980
headline ideas I could do something like.

32
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,390
Type in ethical hacking.

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,720
Of course online.

34
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,020
So essentially it's still an online course but it's a different product.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,900
And by just changing the search terms slightly I can look at how other similar products but different

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,510
topics are being advertised.

37
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,190
So now I can see a couple of better headlines that I could use for myself.

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,670
So I like this layout here.

39
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,930
I'd say headline one marketing course.

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,380
So it is a great idea to put your product name directly in the headlines that when people look at this

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,700
ad they can go.

42
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,490
Yep that's exactly what I was looking for.

43
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,110
Now you've got the headline too.

44
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,300
I think this is pretty good.

45
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,960
Enroll today and get 20 percent off.

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,300
So roll today.

47
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,040
Get 20 percent off.

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,520
So again no need to reinvent the wheel.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,280
Just use what's already there.

50
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,650
And then what you can also do is really you can see that there's 30 characters here that I can use for

51
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,990
this headline too.

52
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,930
And you can think about how could I use those last six characters to maybe squeeze more at that.

53
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,240
Then you have your display of the world so you can see that I've put in my new world that I want to

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:40,770
send people to and I can really decide I can really just take this and put that in there.

55
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:48,120
And that can appear here in the search terms and you can see that this is a little bit too long.

56
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,250
So what I can do is am marketing course maybe just leave it at that.

57
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,870
So there I had to play around with it a little bit to try and make sure it fit it in.

58
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:06,060
And also you can come and look at the other guys are setting this up as well and see if you can fit

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,740
it in the same way as then.

60
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,190
So it can be a little bit tricky to fit everything in.

61
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,000
But you can just play around with it until you do.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,350
Now here in the description we've got 80 characters to play with.

63
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,610
So let's come back to some other odds and see if we can get a couple of ideas here.

64
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,570
So what I could put in is learn digital marketing

65
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,350
let's say go from beginner to advanced.

66
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,920
I think that would be pretty appealing to people.

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:51,320
Maybe something like 30 day money back guarantee could include and that's pretty much hitting the a

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,680
character limit so you can play around with that as well.

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,000
To really find one that's good and then you can go ahead and cook.

70
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,900
Done.

71
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,440
And then you're ready to go ahead and click save and continue.

72
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,990
And then if you come up to odds and extensions you can actually see or add here and you'll see that

73
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,460
status is under review.

74
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,920
So this won't go live automatically.

75
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:20,770
Actually Google needs to manually approve the ad that you put out and that can easily take one day.

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,330
And of course for your campaign to go life you do need to add your billing information on Tuesday that

77
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:34,430
you can come up here and then come to Bill billing and payments and then you can re out a payment method

78
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,840
in there in order for your campaign to go live.

79
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,080
And that really wraps up the process to set up your Google Adwords campaign.
