00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.530
If you want to take the look and feel of your Wordpress Web site to the next level then something you

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.780
should seriously consider are premium teams.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.560
Now if we come then into our site we can see underneath our teams here the team that we're using right

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.210
now which is the 2017 team.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.160
It is the free PMA comes when you download Wordpress and I think it looks pretty good and it's definitely

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.630
all you need to have a fully functioning Web site.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.530
But if you do want to take it to the next level then definitely consider getting a premium team and

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.570
there are lots of places where you can get premium world press teams.

9
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.350
But really the shop that I would recommend is my shop dot com and you can see they've over almost 400000

10
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.140
happy customers.

11
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.800
I use them exclusively and because they have great teams but particularly because their support is incredible

12
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.660
and that's really important for non-technical people you can see some of the questions that I've asked

13
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.330
here.

14
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.330
Just things I didn't really know what to do or couldn't figure out and they really helped me and they

15
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.810
always come back within 24 hours and that is really necessary if you're not that technical.

16
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.690
It's really really helpful and it's definitely not something that every team shop offers.

17
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.350
So that's why I would recommend these guys.

18
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.870
Now in terms of the teams there are loads of options and they have over 100 different teams here and

19
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.380
they're all broken down by categories.

20
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.970
You can come in and have a look at these if you want.

21
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.510
For example they have really good e-commerce teams as well.

22
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.140
So you can see this one.

23
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.950
You can essentially get this size by just getting downloading this team and you can see that something

24
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.100
like this looks extremely professional.

25
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.000
It's a lot different to this.

26
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.470
And instead of you coding it or hiring a developer you can just buy this team and have all of that functionality

27
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.390
look and feel built in.

28
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.750
So instead of spending hundreds or thousands on a developer to get the site you want you can just buy

29
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.780
one of these teams for less than $50.

30
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.890
Now I do know there is a price tag on these and you might be thinking Is it worth it.

31
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.980
But I can guarantee you this is a tiny investment that you could make to really make yourself a professional.

32
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.780
And I think you would earn the money back pretty much straight away.

33
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.600
So a couple of things that I like I'd recommend for e-commerce.

34
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.540
If you're just looking for an upgrade on the blog.

35
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.040
One theme that I've used in the past is the schema theme.

36
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.780
It looks great and when you click into all of these themes as well you can get a full demo of them to

37
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.490
really get a sense of you know what they look like before you go ahead and purchase these click in here

38
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.750
and all of these come with a 30 day money back guarantee as well so you can always just try them out

39
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.410
for not happy return.

40
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.490
So scheme a team really fast really friendly as well as why these in the past.

41
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.800
And another one that I would recommend and that I'm actually going to use for this example is the corporate

42
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.480
team.

43
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.120
Here we go and I think this is a perfect team.

44
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.000
If you are setting up a company web site you can see it looks great.

45
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:26.350
I mean our team services our work or portfolio different experience that we have plans in pricing cetera.

46
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.330
So it looks extremely professional and it also has a blog and everything you can do your content marketing.

47
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.120
So even if you're building web sites for people I recommend you know buy the team and you can deliver

48
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.780
a very professional looking Web site in a very quick time frame.

49
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.620
So I'm going to go ahead and get this team.

50
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.400
And even if you want to get a different team the process is going to be the same for installing it.

51
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.850
So they should go ahead to check it and get this one.

52
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.310
So I'm going to proceed to payments.

53
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.930
I'm going to pay with debit card.

54
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.330
I'm going to pop in my details here and then click.

55
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.990
I'm ready.

56
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.720
Then load.

57
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.980
So now all we need to do is just go ahead and check our e-mail to get the download instructions.

58
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:22.450
So log in to your e-mail and come to your folder and get your download link.

59
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.490
Just click on the link and then click on download instructions.

60
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.160
We want to click on download files and then we're going to follow these steps here.

61
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.100
So we'll just download this zip file them what we want to do is go to appearance teams uploads.

62
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:55.670
So if we come back in to our dashboard and we come to appearance teams and then the new team and then

63
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.530
it becomes upload team choose file

64
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.690
and choose the team then we can click Install now.

65
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.480
And then what we can do is activate the theme.

66
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.780
Now once you can see that team is active for you you might want to do is just come up and visit the

67
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.840
site to see any of the changes and what we can see here is that not a lot is happening this is not really

68
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.000
what we want to get.

69
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.700
But don't worry all you need to do is just one further step come down and two team options and then

70
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.590
then the end you're going to see the import export option and this will be the same steps no matter

71
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.990
what.

72
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.640
My team shop team that you buy and you can see here that you have three options import the team options

73
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.380
import up team options and widgets import team options widget and content.

74
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.500
So you want to select this option here if you want your site to appear exactly like it appears in the

75
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.190
demo.

76
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.080
And if you want a reminder of what that looks like just click that open and you can see that if you

77
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.620
want your site to look exactly like this would all this demo content and all the pages and menus laid

78
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.260
at exactly the same.

79
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.100
Then you can just go ahead and select that option which I'm going to do to import the team options widget

80
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.810
and content and just click OK could take a couple of minutes for all of this to load up and once that's

81
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.920
done we can click OK.

82
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.310
And then we can come again now and visit our site to see the changes so that we can see that the team

83
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.780
and all of the sample content has been loaded up on our domain.

84
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.120
And I think it really looks fantastic.

85
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.010
Now obviously this is only going to be sample content in here.

86
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.460
So we're going to want to customize this and update it for ourselves.

87
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.840
But it's very simple it's just drag and drop it's click.

88
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.750
It's just copy and paste.

89
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.060
But I think it looks really really good.

90
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:57.610
And also say if we come across a blog we can change the post we can on publish posts etc. We can change

91
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.110
the widgets we can change the pages.

92
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:07.690
So to do that we can come back in to our site and there is an additional tab here now under our appearance

93
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.960
theme for our my team shop team called Team options.

94
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:19.750
And this just makes it really easy again to change your team that you've downloaded.

95
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.160
So if we come to general settings for example I'll come back to the home page.

96
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:30.190
We can change this logo and this fiber can these small images here just by uploading them very simple

97
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.320
to do.

98
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.650
And if we come then to our home page here we can see that we can change the home page layout.

99
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.860
So if we want to put team above features on our home page we can just drag and drop that and move that

100
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.360
around.

101
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.230
No coding required.

102
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.960
If we want to come to our intro and change the text and image in our home page and where that links

103
00:07:52.960 --> 00:08:02.200
to we can change all of this information here in this section and we can change the button we can change

104
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.150
what it says and change where it links to etc..

105
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.850
So very easy to send it to say your services page rather than your portfolio.

106
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.450
We'll keep on moving then just have a look at a couple of other things and meet our team.

107
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:22.180
So right now you can see that they have kind of sample text here and you obviously want to update that

108
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:28.660
for your own team or your own team and you can just click in change the photos change things change

109
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.350
the descriptions etc..

110
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.180
So very simple is just drag drop.

111
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:38.910
It will take a little bit of time to update the site with your own content but it's very simple to do.

112
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.820
And let us come and have a look at pages as well if you want to say remove some of those pages that

113
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.340
come with the team and the sample content you can do that easily.

114
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:57.210
You can just select the page you can edit it you can move it trash.

115
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.820
You can do it in the same way.

116
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:06.130
If we come back guys we can actually select a bunch of pages that one selects a bold action like move

117
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.790
to trasher edited.

118
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.690
And what is often a good idea is you don't maybe want to move it trash.

119
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:19.660
So what you can always do is edit the page and we can actually do a quick and we can unpublished the

120
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:26.950
page move to draft and so that will be there if we want to reinstate it later but it won't appear on

121
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.960
our side so we can move any pages to draft that we don't want.

122
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:38.600
Similarly if we look at posts we if we come across to our blog we can see that there are quite a few

123
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.570
posts here but a lot of sample content.

124
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.720
So what I would recommend you maybe do is just you can move those to draft.

125
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.360
You can update that.

126
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:56.990
And for example they will be removed from the blog but you can use those templates for later and you

127
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.190
can do that for multiple ones as well.

128
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.130
Now in the sidebar for bloggers Well we can see we've got some widgets we might have sponsors we might

129
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.720
know this image et cetera.

130
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.520
So once again very simple just come into perience widgets and we can just change things around.

131
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.940
Now the cool thing about this theme is that it comes with different widgets as well so we can see that

132
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.720
we have a link to all our social profiles.

133
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.930
Now we don't have all these social profiles what we can do is just remove the sample links here soldiers

134
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.290
for example take at Facebook and we can see Facebook here.

135
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.900
And what we can do if I say that take out the link you can see that's removed.

136
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.130
Now you will want to put in the links to all of your own profiles here if you want to delete that completely.

137
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.280
You can just delete that.

138
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.330
That will disappear.

139
00:10:53.190 --> 00:11:01.170
And if you want to reinstated what she can do is come down here we should see social profile icons

140
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.930
and we all just need to put in maybe a little harsh or our own links in here.

141
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:21.400
So let's say I Pinterest Instagram Linked-In Twitter it's probably all you have click save and they're

142
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:22.910
all going to come out there.

143
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.700
So you can see it's very easy to customize your team with your own content.

144
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.720
Once you have downloaded.

145
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.800
Now one final thing you might want to do is change your team at some stage or upload a different theme

146
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.570
or activity different theme search to that come back to appearance teams and you can see if you did

147
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:47.470
want to reinstate that team that you had previously you can firstly get a live preview of it.

148
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.320
And just to see what that looks like.

149
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:58.360
And really to see the difference between this free team and this paid team that we have spent a small

150
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.860
amount of money on I think this one looks way more professional.

151
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.060
Hopefully this has opened your eyes to the value of premium teams.

152
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.720
And so if you want to go get one for yourself I would recommend my team shop.

153
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.220
That process is the same.

154
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.600
Just downloaded it and then upload that file into the theme and activate the theme.
