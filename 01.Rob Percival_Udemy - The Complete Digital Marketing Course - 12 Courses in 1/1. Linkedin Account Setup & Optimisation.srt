1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:06,310
In this video you're going to learn how to create a linked in profile that converts I'm not going to

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,410
walk you through five key things that you need to do if you want to use LinkedIn is a powerful marketing

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,120
tool to generate leads and drive Web site traffic.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,550
So the first of those five things is really just to set up an account and you can do that by going to

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,600
Linked-In dot com and just joining the network.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,560
It's fairly simple and they're just going to walk you through a couple of steps.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:36,580
And once you sign up you're going to start having to add certain things to your profile on the first

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,400
and the most important of those is a profile image.

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,770
So I'm going to walk through this elements of the profile and a couple of couple of others and show

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,940
you some best practices on them.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:54,100
So your profile image is extremely important not only does it show up on your profile page here but

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:01,660
also if I come into my feed in news feed which is essentially like the feed on Facebook you can see

13
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,810
that the profile images here as well.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,170
So you really do want to have a clear image that people can recognize you by.

15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,480
And that really has a profile image you'd actually be surprised.

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:20,320
A lot of people if I look at say my connections here they don't have profile images and there's no way

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,360
that they're going to be successful in building a network and generating leads on linked in if they

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,350
don't have a profile image.

19
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,310
So it seems like a fairly basic thing.

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,510
But you would be shocked at how many people don't even bother creating an image.

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:43,730
Now in terms of the image itself you can see if I go back here to mine it's quite a close cropped shot

22
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,180
of my face.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,230
There's nothing really distracting in the background there.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,140
And I think hopefully you can recognize that's me fairly easily even if I was in the news feed here

25
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,030
where the images smaller or even smaller again.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,660
I think you could recognize that as me.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,060
And one thing that I've done here is I've kept this consistent across all of my social media profiles.

28
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:12,740
So Twitter Facebook etc. it is important to keep in consistence now in this image here you can see it's

29
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,840
kind of a yellow background and kind of blond hair.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,230
And so it's not jumping off the page as much.

31
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,810
Maybe she can improve upon that a little bit.

32
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,580
You can look into my network here.

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,290
Let me get you a couple of other examples.

34
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,540
You can see this white background pops.

35
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,590
The person pops off for quite a lot.

36
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,920
So a single colored background can often be good.

37
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,600
You can see here there's quite a lot going on in the background which may not necessarily be bad but

38
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,550
it doesn't pop out as much as just a single color background.

39
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,820
As you can see also you can see a background here with lots of writing in this.

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,820
And I don't think that's a good idea because again it's hard to recognize a face when it's so small

41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,560
like that.

42
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,510
And also the writing in the background is just distracting and you can actually see it very well I think

43
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,630
can agree here.

44
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,690
When it's like that.

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:11,850
So for Jawan here maybe what she could do is have a much get much closer to the camera how a plain background

46
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,620
and then it be easier to recognize her and even just recognizing who someone is is the first step in

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,950
order to connect with them.

48
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,160
So the profile picture seems fairly basic but you can see a lot of people do make mistakes on it so

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,750
it's just worth pointing at.

50
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,110
Now after you've uploaded your profile image the next thing you want to do is create a headline and

51
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,140
this is something that I can even work on now and then and show you a couple of other examples.

52
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,140
So I've just said here Margaret are an online instructor.

53
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:47,540
Now actually the best thing to do here is not to focus on just who you are or what you do what the what

54
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,090
the job title is.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,610
But actually to show how you can add value to people.

56
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,360
So let me show you a couple of examples of this.

57
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,240
So we've have most stuff here.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,670
He works in Microsoft and you can see he says digital wizard helping you in a rapidly changing digital

59
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,180
world.

60
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,350
Let's connect.

61
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,550
Now I think personally he could maybe improve upon that a little bit and get a little bit more specific

62
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,250
about how he was helping people.

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,450
But he focuses on helping you in a rapidly changing digital world.

64
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,600
So that is a good headline because it shows that things are constantly changing.

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,320
It is overwhelming to keep up with the constant change and this is a guy who can help me keep up.

66
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,450
So that is an attractive value proposition.

67
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,610
It's not just his job title but he's actually saying how he can help you.

68
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,240
And also here I think this is a great call to action to include Let's connect and that's something that

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,510
can help you increase your connections automatically because you're giving that call to action and inviting

70
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,730
people to connect.

71
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,670
And also you've given that value proposition of why they should connect in the first place.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,310
So they're saying why they should connect and then you're saying let's connect.

73
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,470
And then there's a good chance that I'm going to do it.

74
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:10,940
Now remember that this headline is probably the single sentence on your profile that's going to get

75
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,860
the most amount of visibility.

76
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,720
People are not going to scroll down all the way read through everything 80 percent or 90 percent of

77
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,230
what people are going to see is just on this single line alone.

78
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:30,020
So it is worth giving a little bit of thought to let's have a look at another example of a good headline

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,680
here.

80
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,570
So helping find stay secure by hacking them for as before malicious hackers do.

81
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,470
So that is a great value proposition as well.

82
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,780
He's helping Klein stay secure by hacking them first before malicious hackers too.

83
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:54,440
So that's a great reason to get in touch with him or to connect with him or to hire him because he can

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,550
help you stay secure before the bad guys do so.

85
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,880
Nice value proposition.

86
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,830
Have a look at another example here.

87
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,920
You can still include the role inside sales at Microsoft empowering people every day in the U.K. market

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,240
to achieve more.

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,780
So this is a good one because it says the role.

90
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,370
So it's clear exactly what they are.

91
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,380
And it's even more specific in terms of the market.

92
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,320
And you know what they're helping people to do so those are three different examples of how you can

93
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,390
think about that headline.

94
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,390
One have a clear call to action and create a value proposition for that.

95
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:41,060
The other is to kind of give your value proposition again and show the negative effects of maybe not

96
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,620
reaching out to this person.

97
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,530
And then the other is do a kind of a combination to show the role.

98
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,200
So it is very clear what exactly your role is.

99
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,460
And then even maybe get some specifics in terms of the marketplace.

100
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:03,120
Now if you want to edit your headline very simple you can just come in and you can go ahead and edit

101
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,450
it there.

102
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:08,900
OK.

103
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,870
So I'm just taking a look at some of those best practices and examples of data my own instructor eata

104
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,040
me a parrot and pairing small businesses.

105
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,430
To grow with digital marketing might be a bit long.

106
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,660
Let's say this and see how this looks.

107
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,840
I can just click OK.

108
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,220
So I think that looks pretty good there for a first draft.

109
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,120
Maybe I'll come back and try and get this down onto one line but you can see I think that's a lot better

110
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,080
done was before where it was just essentially while my role was on there wasn't much of an incentive

111
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,780
for people to connect or to reach out to me.

112
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,350
And because they didn't say exactly how I could help them.

113
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:54,380
So I think that's a lot better and I would take these best practices into account for yourself.

114
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,170
So we've talked about creating your can't we talked about the profile image we've talked about the headline

115
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,770
and then let's talk about the summary.

116
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,190
And this is something that I could work on as well.

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,940
And one of the cool things that I've noticed on Linked-In is that they have actually once you started

118
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:17,930
to update your profile a little bit where you've worked they have actually pulled together a summary

119
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,590
for me.

120
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,030
So writing a summary can be hard.

121
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,510
That's why we've created one for you to get started.

122
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:29,660
So if I look at this summary it says experienced instructor with demonstrated his working in an industry

123
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,660
skilled in marketing management negotiation business planning sales e-commerce strong education sessional

124
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,650
growth troit.

125
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,120
OK.

126
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,430
So some of that is accurate and actually surprisingly good summary that they've pulled together through

127
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,650
artificial intelligence I think.

128
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,620
So I can if you have that option you can use that in to get started.

129
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,680
Now I will need to edit this a little bit again.

130
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,130
And before I do I would recommend you have a look at some examples again now to see how I can improve

131
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,830
this.

132
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,930
Let us look again at these examples to see what we could do better.

133
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:16,160
So if we look as our staff here OK so he is talking a little bit more about himself here now.

134
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,010
And I would even say if he focused more like he did in the headline here where he did on how he can

135
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:29,530
help you then not is going to keep people reading and reading them.

136
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:35,730
But the interesting thing that he's done here is he says how to reach him reach me on Linked-In message.

137
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,690
He gives his phone number and he gives an e-mail.

138
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,850
And he says the call to action if you get to endorse my skills so this is I think the most interesting

139
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,660
part of this profile here is something that you could just copy and paste and put on your profile as

140
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,360
well.

141
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,250
Use a little bit of background in terms of what he's done.

142
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,990
But then this is very interesting reach me on say the Linked In message so I can open up an address

143
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,230
my summary again.

144
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,770
I'll have to change that number.

145
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:22,140
But this is a great idea because if the purpose of your linked in profile is to generate leads and connections

146
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:29,640
and potential customers then make it easy for them to reach out to you and give them specific instructions

147
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,320
about how to do that.

148
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,850
You could even narrow that down to one and say best way to reach out is through LinkedIn or by e-mail.

149
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,650
So I'll just leave that there for the moment.

150
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,500
I think that was a good idea from that profile.

151
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,150
Now let's look at Terry here to see what he's going to come in to.

152
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,620
Again you can see call me directly and he's actually put in a little symbol which is actually a pretty

153
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,590
cool idea and something that I could do.

154
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,180
Call me directly.

155
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:03,840
That's even a nice thing to put in because it shows that you know there are going to be talking directly

156
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,110
to Terry.

157
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:14,260
Here's another great example for the book of free consultation with me great idea please visit for media

158
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,270
interviews visit Terri blah blah blah.

159
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,290
So what I like out of this is let us take this again.

160
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,070
And this is the key point that I want to get across is right you don't have to reinvent the wheel just

161
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:36,000
look at people who are already doing it well and take the best of what they're doing.

162
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,830
And then you can use it for yourself.

163
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,300
Call me directly ask.

164
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,450
OK.

165
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,020
Fill that in later.

166
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,030
OK so tidy that up a little bit then.

167
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,880
So this is another option that they could do book me for free 30 minute consultation for media or speaking

168
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,970
engagements places that so that's actually a great little line in there as well because it shows that

169
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:08,810
you are open to doing interviews and speaking engagements and that's even a lot clearer than just saying

170
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:16,010
something like send me a LinkedIn message or phone me because it's showing you know essentially why

171
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,000
they should call you.

172
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:26,040
And even here book a 30 minute consultation and even if you could say you know specifically about why

173
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:34,520
book a 30 minute consultation to learn how to protect your business in the case of maybe Terry here

174
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,570
because he's focused on cybersecurity.

175
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,920
So let's have a look at this final profile doesn't have a summary right now.

176
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,580
So it is something that maybe she could include.

177
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,290
So those are just some ideas and examples for what you can do in your profile.

178
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,770
I would suggest you don't focus on eye because you can see in the auto generated linked in profile here

179
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:08,030
it doesn't mention I once it kind of just says your experience am and you know what are the things that

180
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:16,210
you're experienced in and then I think after you do that you can add in some specific call to actions.

181
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,930
And I think we saw some good ideas there just even reach me on LinkedIn where if you want to get more

182
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,920
specific I think these were brilliant ideas.

183
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,540
Book a free consultation for media interviews and speaking engagements visit me on whatever web site

184
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:35,030
you can link directly that to call me directly on that as well.

185
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,320
So I'll save those for the moment.

186
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,620
Just to show you how that's going to appear and you can see it's pretty short.

187
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,770
But I think we'll get straight to the point.

188
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,640
And I think that is a great way that you can enhance that summary and use that summary to generate leads.

189
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,440
They're going to read the headline and they're going to move then.

190
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,840
And so it is important to remind them to connect or just keep moving in the page to read more about

191
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,750
you.

192
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,540
Now we've already looked at three of the five things that you can do in the profile image headline summary.

193
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:13,740
And now we're looking at the fourth thing that you can do to generate more leads or grow your presence

194
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,970
on LinkedIn.

195
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,020
And that is to create a custom your l.

196
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,130
So I've already done it here but you're going to find this option in the sidebar under your contact

197
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,700
and personal information.

198
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:32,730
And then here you can create a customized URL for your linked in profile and this is great because you

199
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,700
can put it on business cards and it's not just a long string of random numbers and letters but you can

200
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,310
edit that for yourself.

201
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,410
But that on business cards it looks great on a Web site.

202
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,720
It's a short link that you can paste anywhere and it just is a great thing to do.

203
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,730
Similar to what you might do on Facebook or YouTube.

204
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,570
You can create a custom mural very very handy and you can just added it in there.

205
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,240
Your your own name might not be available.

206
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:07,170
So luckily mine was just first name surname if you your name isn't available one great tip is just to

207
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,260
put your middle initials my middle name is Michael.

208
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,900
So I would just have put Darra and Walsh and probably that custom thumbnail would have been available

209
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,420
so use your middle name as a middle initial If your first name surname is not available.

210
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,770
Now the filing that you can do to build a profile that converts is also on your Web site you or L..

211
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,170
You can also put your phone number in here as well and your e-mail here as well.

212
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:42,240
So we have said that we will put this in this information in our summary but not everybody looks to

213
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,570
the sidebar here but it's great to have this information here as well and that will help you get more

214
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:56,340
contact from people and also get more traffic to your website because it's listees here and you can

215
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:03,660
set that up to either goes directly to maybe an email or sign a form where they get a free PTF you don't

216
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,600
just have to send them to your profile you can be quite creative with that.

217
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,900
And that's something you can actually do in your summary as well if you're linking off to your Web site.

218
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,400
You could say you know get it instead of a free PTF consulate or a free consultation.

219
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:24,510
You could say get a free PTF about the most important things in cybersecurity for today's and an 18

220
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,210
as an example.

221
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,570
Then they go there.

222
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,330
They have to put in their e-mail address and then you send them the PTF.

223
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:39,090
But that's a great way to not just put a link necessarily to your home page but also use it as a way

224
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,210
to Gesh actually emails from Linked-In.

225
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,440
So now we have covered the five steps to build a profile that converts.

226
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,540
Go ahead Tillington dot com.

227
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:56,910
Set up your cans and implement these five strategies that you can generate more website traffic and

228
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,830
leads from Linked In.

229
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,920
It's the first step to really starting an.
