00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,380
In this video you are going to learn how to create a page for your company on Cura.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,910
And the advantage of doing this is that all of the questions about your company will be grouped under

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,010
one page.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:22,090
And it also then enables people to follow your topic or company so that they can be notified any time

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,400
any question is added by your company so you can see here for you to me.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,660
They have 37000 people following their topic or company.

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:39,430
And then any time the questions us about you to me all of these 37000 people will be notified which

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,420
kind of keeps that company in the brand in the minds of these people.

9
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:50,020
And also if you create your own page then you can follow the topic and make sure you're being notified

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,150
every time as somebody creates or has a question on your company.

11
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,840
So to do this it's actually very simple.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,900
What you need to do is actually create a topic for your company so it's not really like creating a page

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,570
that you go and set it up like a Facebook page.

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,750
All you really need to do is create a topic so what.

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,510
To get started what you want to do is search for your company name so I will just say

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,350
my awesome site.

17
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,000
Now if I search for that there's no results for that.

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,180
So what I can do then is otic question and say something like is my awesome site good.

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,180
So I just really want to otic question first.

20
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,050
And then what I can do is edit the topics

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,890
and what I want to do is create a new topic.

22
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,800
So I'm creating this topic I know I can click on.

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:14,630
So what I can do is I've created essentially a topic around my company name and now any time that somebody

24
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,320
mentions this I say is my awesome site good.

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,990
How much does my awesome site cost etc..

26
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,010
Just answer your your company name there.

27
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,890
Then the person who's asking the question will have that option to this topic.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,300
Then that question will appear here under this company page or topic.

29
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,780
So it's a little bit of a new way to create a page I guess on cure a little bit different than maybe

30
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,000
something like Facebook but the idea is still the very same.

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,240
You create a topic every time someone adds a topic to a question.

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,710
The question will appear here under your page if you follow your own topic then you will get notified

33
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,580
every time there's a question.

34
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,920
And it also enables people to follow your company and keep updated with questions other people have

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,070
a baddish So that is how you create a page for your business on.

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,230
Q Where once again is very simple.

37
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,830
Search for your company.

38
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:21,290
If it's not there out a question and then create a topic to make sure that your brand name is the topic

39
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,240
created.

40
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,970
So go ahead and test that for yourself.

41
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,660
If you want to create a page for your business on q or.
