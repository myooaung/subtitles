1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,890
In this video you are going to learn about Instagram odds and how you can reach 150 million daily active

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,620
users on Instagram through the Facebook platform.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,600
We'll start by understanding a little bit more about instruments and when and where you can use them.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,040
They're not available for every single objective so that's worth just reviewing quickly.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,790
And then we're just going to start jumping into some case studies and looking at how some real life

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:37,080
businesses are using Instagram as part of their campaigns and I've got a number of examples here to

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,280
go through quickly and then we want to finish up looking inside the ads create to about how you can

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,180
select for your campaigns to appear on Instagram and some of the requirements and restrictions that

9
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,730
you think about an order of your content if you want to do that.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,340
So let us start by looking at the Facebook guide here which is always a great place to start to understand

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,450
different formats and objectives.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,350
And the key thing to understand straight away about Instagram is that Instagram ads are not a completely

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,870
separate thing.

14
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,830
You don't have one particular objective if you want to use an Instagram account.

15
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,790
They are really just one of the five places where your Facebook ads can appear and where you can choose

16
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,010
for your Facebook ads to appear.

17
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,570
So here are the five here your mobile news feed on Facebook your desktop news feed for Facebook.

18
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,280
The right hand column on Facebook on Instagram as well and the audience networks.

19
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,290
So those are the five different places.

20
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,320
Remember Instagram is just one of the five places you could create a campaign where your ad only appears

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,540
on Instagram.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,100
But if you want to do that just remember that you can't use Instagram as a placement option for all

23
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,380
of the out objectives and I want to quickly go through that with you because there are some limitations

24
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,850
on that.

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,410
So in terms of if you wanted to promote app engagement you can do that on Instagram as well.

26
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,550
There's no problem.

27
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,520
Opon.

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,230
Great place to do that on Instagram and as possible clicks to Web sites.

29
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,160
You can get people to click on a link in Instagram and go to your Web site.

30
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,810
Here's where here's a couple of examples where you can use Instagram as a place to show your ads lead

31
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:39,180
generation for now and lead ads are only available in the Facebook dustoff news feed in the Facebook

32
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,830
mobile news feed.

33
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,770
Now this will probably change over time.

34
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:51,270
So always good idea to come back into the Facebook's guide and just type it into Google to find it to

35
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,810
check if Instagram is available for the ad objective that you were really aiming for.

36
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,160
Another place where Instagram is not available as a placement for ads is Page Likes.

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,810
And this is probably pretty obvious.

38
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,800
But if you want to get more likes for your page you're going to be much more successful doing that on

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,730
Facebook itself and you can see that those are the options right now just for that.

40
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,050
You want to get web site conversions and drive people to the store.

41
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,470
You could do that on Instagram as well.

42
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:30,670
So good to know some of the limitations for Instagram and using it as part of your odds.

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,140
Now that we understand those ins and outs let's have a look at some case studies and really understand

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,670
how people are using Instagram as part of their campaign.

45
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:50,130
So we have put a video bracelets here and we can come down and see the ads here on both Facebook and

46
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,400
Instagram.

47
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,090
And if we scroll down a little bit there is quite an interesting quote here from the CEO and co-founder

48
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,470
who says that they use lookalike audiences to reach people like our Web site visitors.

49
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:12,140
So they're using custom web site audience and they want to reach people on both Instagram and Facebook.

50
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,120
And here's really the interesting part for you.

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,510
Our cost per order for instruments is the same as it is for Facebook ads.

52
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,910
So in fact Instagram has expanded our ability to drive orders and revenue from our website visitors

53
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,440
and new customers.

54
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,590
So that's the key thing to understand the advantage in this case of instruments was not that they're

55
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,030
10 times cheaper or anything like that.

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,660
It's that they allow you to extend the reach of your campaign to that massive Instagram audience.

57
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,480
Let's have a look at another example to see how people are using Instagram ads as part of their campaigns.

58
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:58,620
You've got wonder here which is a app and they wanted to accelerate sign ups in the Philippines.

59
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,130
Now once again you'll see here that they didn't use Instagram in isolation.

60
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,740
It was really part of a bigger campaign.

61
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:13,700
And you can see here that the team extended the campaign to include Instagram ads and the audience network

62
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,450
which allowed them to drive sign ups beyond Facebook.

63
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,630
And you can see that they use a lot of different type of ads like carousel.

64
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,610
They use the conversion trapping video ads so you can use that as part of your instagram placement.

65
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,970
Let's have a look at another example here.

66
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,030
Mentor Danmark which is a Danish tutoring company.

67
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:44,030
What these guys did is they really focused on video arts to raise awareness about their tutoring company

68
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,120
and then to support these.

69
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,760
They used photo wants on Instagram to showcase some of these personal bonds so you can see them here.

70
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,910
So in this case once again you can see that the Instagram was more of a supporting role for this bigger

71
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,930
campaign.

72
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:10,490
Let's finish up in the ads created here crystal clear on how to include or exclude Instagram from your

73
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,660
campaigns.

74
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:20,680
I'll select the example of creating a campaign to get some video views continue with this and then we

75
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,280
come into the Azza level and this is the place where you really decide where your ads will be placed

76
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,370
under the Plaisance section here.

77
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,700
Now what may surprise you is that by default your odds will actually appear on Instagram.

78
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:42,850
You can see that by default all odds are placed automatically which is recommended mean that your odds

79
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:49,120
will automatically be shown to your audience in the places they're likely to perform best and the places

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,680
where they will appear are those five places that we saw at the beginning of this video.

81
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,580
Facebook feeds the right hand column Instagram on the audience networks.

82
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:05,600
So by default your ad is appearing on Instagram if you select this option.

83
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,570
Now you may be surprised I would say hang on I don't have an Instagram account so how is that happening.

84
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:19,250
What Facebook will actually do is pull the profile image from your Facebook page and the name and present

85
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,210
that as an Instagram account on Instagram in an ad so you don't have to do anything to start advertising

86
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,650
on Instagram which is really handy.

87
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:34,960
Now if you want to exclude Instagram from your ad campaigns or focus on it alone you just need to comment

88
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,480
edit placements.

89
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,450
For example I can remove Instagram.

90
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,280
Soon my ads won't appear there.

91
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:48,040
I can select Instagram and remove everything else and then my adult only appear on Instagram.

92
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,050
Now if you select that option or you want to include Instagram There are a couple of other things that

93
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,640
you need to look out for and that really is in relation to the content of your AD.

94
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,170
So for example if I select a single video that I want to promote here's one thing you want to watch

95
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,060
out for.

96
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:12,020
If you want to use a video in your campaign on Instagram it can only be 60 seconds max.

97
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,620
So if you want to promote a video on Facebook on Instagram make sure it's just 60 seconds so it can

98
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:25,420
appear in both places and that's simply it very simple to include Instagram as part of your campaigns.

99
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,230
Remember it's not a stand alone odd that has a unique objective.

100
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,240
It can fit into almost all of the objectives with some of the restrictions we talked about and it's

101
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,950
just one of the five places your odds can appear so now that you understand much more about Instagram.

102
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,460
Think about how you can use them as part of your next campaign.
