00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,040
In this video you're going to learn how to get your first followers on Twitter.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,340
And this is going to be genuine followers that are going to engage with your profile and before you

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,090
go ahead and do this remember that you should have does your profile image created a bio filled out

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:24,280
your website etc. and created a base of content on your profile maybe five or 10 posts this is just

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:31,310
a demo can have everything but really you should be at that stage before you begin to try and get followers.

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,600
The reason is because when people come to your profile you've got everything set up.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,450
It's a real act if it can't and that creates a much higher chance for them to follow you.

8
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,880
So how do you get the followers.

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,430
Well once again you want to open up the influencer accounts that you have started following.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,800
And really what you want to do is funnel followers from their hands to your account.

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,950
So the way that you do that is open up.

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,320
One of the influencer can sit your following go to one of their posts and now you want to start to follow

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,790
people who are actually engaging with content that they might have a lot of followers on their profile

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,390
but not everybody is going to engage.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,770
And so as a new Twitter profile you really want to focus and try and build the relationship with those

16
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,380
people who are engaged.

17
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,720
So if you click on a post you can actually see anybody who's commented on the posts and you can begin

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,830
to follow them and you can just keep keep moving then.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,190
So you know these people are quite engaged.

20
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,800
And you might have to do a bit of clicking around to make this work.

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,980
But essentially this gives you the opportunity as well to see exactly who are these people who are engaging

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,090
with your influencer and you can see the size of their accounts here.

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,670
You can see their bio on so you can start to get a sense of who they really are.

24
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,520
So we can really just keep going and following them and what's going to happen is a lot of those people

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,950
are going to get this notification that they have they have been followed by you.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,530
And then once they see that notification they're going to want to check you out.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,230
And then in most cases if they see that your profile is relevant to what they're into which you should

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,320
be if you are following people on a cancer that are similar to yours then they're really going to come

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,940
and follow you back.

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,600
So it is a bit of a manual process but I really recommend you do this to get started.

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,590
So you can really see the exact profiles of these people really understand even some of the conversations

32
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,090
that are happening here.

33
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:58,400
And it's a way to attract people to your profile that are really engaged on Twitter and not just against

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,670
them maybe would have followed a while ago.

35
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,080
So if you want to attract engaged followers This is the best strategy.

36
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:12,650
Just come to influencer accounts and look at the comments of people and really start to follow them

37
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,160
and then they're most likely going to follow you back.

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,600
You can also start to engage your own comments replies on.

39
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,380
Not again.

40
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,300
They're going to get a notification of that.

41
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,660
And as a result they're going to come and check your profile.

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,140
So we have set up a Byard five influencer accounts here and so you can start to go in and maybe start

43
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:45,360
to follow maybe up to 200 people a day maybe just take 10 15 minutes to do that.

44
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,080
I think it's really going to help you understand what type of engagements on Twitter and it will really

45
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,970
help you attract those initial followers to get things kicked off.

46
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,970
So now that you know how to attract your initial followers on Twitter go ahead and try that for yourself

47
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,860
or just put it in your back pocket for later.
