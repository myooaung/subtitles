In this video I'm going to give you a quick tips so you can easily pin content from around the Internet

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,890
in just one click.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,620
So before I show you how to do this I just want to remind you what the normal process is.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,430
So you can pin content to your voice from.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,320
From Pinterest itself and the search engine here or you can also go and pin stuff from around the web.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,030
And if you want to do that you click this option from around the web.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,900
You have to say get the your L of the article you want a pin or image you want to pin paste that in

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,590
and then you select the image here that you want to pin and appears and then you add it to the board

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,720
so you can see the lobe bit of a manual process.

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,190
You have to copy and paste that you were all in in the first place.

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,080
So to speed up the process a great tool to use that's absolutely free.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,190
Is this Pinterest browser button from Chrome.

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,230
Now this does only work on the Google Chrome browser.

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,730
So if you don't have Google Chrome you can just download that for free.

15
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:11,520
Just type in download Google Chrome to any browser and then use one click get browser button and you

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,750
can just type this interview goes well I will put this link in the description in the video so you can

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,900
click right through.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,980
Then you just want to click add extension and now I'll show you really how this speeds up the process.

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:32,910
So say you're browsing online you're catching up with some news from your industry and now you can really

20
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,680
have this browser extension button here.

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,220
And so if you're reading an article like this just as you do for your own personal you know keep yourself

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,260
updated and you might think on that would be great if I just added that into my Pinterest to can't.

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,480
And so my followers can benefit from it as well.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,890
So what you do is then click the icon that might need to reload the page here.

25
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,010
And then we can select the image so we don't need to type in your l manually.

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,430
And then we can just select the board that we want to add it to and then we can go ahead and see it

27
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:08,780
now.

28
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,340
So you can see it's a lot less friction to add stuff to your Pinterest account.

29
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,100
And I think the key thing is while the key benefit is that just as you're reading articles or news and

30
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,990
you want to add them to a board it's very easier to do rather than remembering to go into your Pinterest

31
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,230
account open it up picked up or not pin paste you are Ellen.

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,530
So it just makes it a lot easier to add content quickly to your Pinterest account.

33
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:43,240
Now here's another tip that really takes this tool to the next level and that is to get your team mates

34
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,670
or even freelancers to install this tool as well for you.

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,890
And what you can do then is when you've created a board you can add them as a collaborator.

36
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:02,290
Just type in their email there send them the invite tell them to download this extension as well and

37
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,270
then they can just start pinning content as well automatically to there to that account.

38
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:15,010
So not only does it make it easier for you to add content but if you just tell your teammates or even

39
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,230
instruct a freelancer to do this for you they can very quickly add a lot of content to your Pinterest

40
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,990
account and that will help you really grow your falling much much faster.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,040
