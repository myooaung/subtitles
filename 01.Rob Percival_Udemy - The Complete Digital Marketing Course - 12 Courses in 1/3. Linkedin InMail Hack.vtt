In this video I'm going to show you a fantastic Hoxsey you can message anybody for free on Linked-In

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.850
is gonna save you up to $260 a year.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.790
So to highlight the value of this I want to show you how this set up is normally so say Marven here.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.240
I'd like to send him a message.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.130
I'm not connected with him directly.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.800
You can see here he is the third connection so he's kind of a connection of a connection and you can

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.850
see here that there is no option to send him a message.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.450
All I see is his option to send an e-mail.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.400
And if I click on this you can see Linked-In is then pushing me to upgrade to their premium product

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.280
because this is a premium feature to message people who are not correct connected with directly and

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.580
then even if I select the lowest price plan you can see that's about 200 or $22 about $260 a year.

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.760
So I'm going to show you hey you can save that fee just by using the simple trick.

13
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.340
So what you want to do is come back to Linked-In then you want to come in to work here and then you

14
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.430
want to click into groups and then you want to click into the groups that you've joined.

15
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.680
Or you could set this up afterwards.

16
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.260
And now what I can do is I can message anybody in this group absolutely for free.

17
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:27.060
So Marvin here for example I can come back and reply directly to him and now I can message him for free

18
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.000
just because we're in the same group together.

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.750
So that's a way that you get around that field.

20
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.090
You don't have to pay for in mail.

21
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.920
All I have to do is join the groups who are your target audience are now one handy thing that you can

22
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.220
do is say if you're not sure what groups to join you can come to somebody whose profile may be a perfect

23
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.600
ideal customer.

24
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.600
You can scroll scroll down to the bottom and then in here you can see some of the interests or groups

25
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.700
that they're a member of.

26
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.610
So if I open this up then I can ask to join this group.

27
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:08.760
And then you could see that in here there's 234 times and people that I could message for free now.

28
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.820
So that is a simple trick.

29
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.550
The way to get around paying the price for this premium feature just go in and join the groups where

30
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.130
your target audience are already members of.

31
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.740
And once again if you're not sure what groups those should be to scroll to the end of the profile and

32
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.380
find those groups who had huge amount of members so that you can join those groups and their message.

33
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.850
All those people for free.

34
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.040
So go ahead and try that in mail hack for yourself right now or put it in your back pocket for later.
