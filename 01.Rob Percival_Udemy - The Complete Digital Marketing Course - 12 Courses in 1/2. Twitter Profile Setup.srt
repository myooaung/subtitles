00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,430
In this video you're going to learn how to create your account on Twitter.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,680
So to get started go to Twitter to come on.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,320
If you're brand new we really want to be filling up this box here that says Sign up.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,250
So if you are signing up for a business account Well then you really want to put it in your business

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,070
name.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,720
I'll just put in demo for the moments and then you want to put in your business email address and then

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,550
you really want to go ahead and create a strong password for yourself.

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:37,240
So we've got our details here then we just click sign up then you'll be asked to fill in a phone number.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,940
You can do that if you want or go ahead and click skip the next step then is to choose a username and

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,890
the great thing is that you can always change this later so don't worry about it too much but you may

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,630
see this option here if you put in your own name or a business name that this user name is already taken.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,960
So you may need to be a little bit a bit creative here about how to adjust this.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,720
You will get some suggestions down here but it's probably best to ignore these because you don't want

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,850
a big string of numbers in your username so you can try it a different thing.

15
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,810
Couple of things you could maybe put in something like the official afterwards that may be taken.

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,100
You can put it in things like Q Or you can use maybe another word at the start to the end until you

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,040
find something that is really going to be free.

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,130
So once you're happy with your username you can just click next and remember again you can always change

19
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,220
this later on.

20
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,910
