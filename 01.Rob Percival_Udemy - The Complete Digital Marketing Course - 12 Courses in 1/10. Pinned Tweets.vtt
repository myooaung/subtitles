In this video you're going to learn a simple trick to grow your Twitter page.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.750
I've got an example of it here on my account and I'm also going to show you examples from two other

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.740
cats as well.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.240
So this is a strategy you can definitely repeat over and over again.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.220
And the strategy is to pin a tweet to the top of the page but not any tweet a tweet that is really going

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.720
to get retweeted by your audience.

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.070
So you can see that this tweet has been retweeted 36 times meaning that someone has come to my page

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.710
has re tweeted this quote to share with their audience.

9
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.000
And the advantage for me is that that puts me in front of their audience which helps expose me to their

10
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.920
audience in turn that helps grow my channel.

11
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.230
They may follow me.

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.600
They may see this message like it as well and it just continues to grow.

13
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.510
So the key strategy here is that not only do you pinnate tweet which you can do at any tweet on Twitter.

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.780
Just click on the little Darnay or here and click Penta profile.

15
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.640
But do you want to leave a tweet there indefinitely and that the reason you do that is because any time

16
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.320
anybody comes to your page if they agree with the message that you're saying here it could be a quote

17
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.880
a belief or something like that.

18
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.710
Well then they're going to want to read tweet it.

19
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.250
And that just helps give you constant exposure every time it comes to your page you can see I tweeted

20
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.180
this in over a year ago now and it's still there at the top because people still retweet it.

21
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.680
61 likes and nine comments.

22
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.130
Let's look at another example of this.

23
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.970
This guy's audience is a lot bigger.

24
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:45.110
He's got four times and read tweets six thousand likes 234 comments and again he's done the same strategy.

25
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.260
Best way to sell something down the line.

26
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.730
Earn the awareness respect and trust of those who might buy.

27
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.590
So that is a belief that he has.

28
00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.040
And if his audience or anybody who sees that believes the same thing then they can retweet that and

29
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.810
once again the advantage for this guy is that it exposes him to those other people's audience.

30
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.310
That's the beauty of the retweet and the real power of it or why you want to set something up like this.

31
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.790
It's an automated way to get read tweets on your account as have a look at it.

32
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.350
Another example of this strategy this time slightly different but again it's something that is timeless.

33
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.160
Your regular investing reminder keep calm and stay the course.

34
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:37.390
So no 172 read tweets 317 likes 51 comments so that is something that they could just leave there indefinitely

35
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.400
your regular investing reminder it's not something that goes out of fashion and it's kind of funny.

36
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.800
And then if you were following their profile Well you might retweet that and expose them to your audience

37
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.290
which again helps them grow.

38
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.110
So this is something you could definitely do for yourself.

39
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.670
Find a quote from somebody else or from yourself.

40
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.560
You believe in or even make an image like this that you can just put up.

41
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.200
That's easy for them to share to their audience and that is a very simple way that you can grow your

42
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.470
Twitter audience quickly by getting other people to retweet this and getting yourself in front of their

43
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.870
audience.

44
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.150
So try it out for yourself or put it in your back pocket for later.
