00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,040
In this video you're going to learn how to add an admin to a Facebook page that you have created.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,500
So to do that you want to come up to the settings in the top right hand corner and then you want to

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,980
come down into Page roles and the left hand side bar and it's in here that you can really assign a new

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,160
page RIL.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,820
And this is very simple to do you just pop in their email and then you select the different type of

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,120
page URL and you can do this and to add colleagues to your Facebook page to share the workload with

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,040
them of managing the page you can add in the business owner.

8
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,240
If you have created a page for them and you want to hand it back then you can assign them as an admin

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,360
and then they can later remove you as an admin if they wanted to as well.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,630
And you can also add in freelancers if they're going to help you run ads or respond to comments or even

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,060
just straight up to to advertise on your Facebook page.

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,740
So there are six different options and you can select them here and you can even get a short description

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,070
once you select an option underneath a bite.

14
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,650
What it does so it's it's quite clear on what the different options are.

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,370
But if you do want to see them side by side you'll see there's a little learn more section here at the

16
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,260
top which will bring you to the Facebook help center.

17
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,870
And then you can see a side by side comparison here of the six options on exactly what they allow you

18
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,810
to do.

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,130
Now for the most part not been if you were handing a page back to business owner you just make them

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,990
anatman than they could remain as an admin.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,700
And if you're working with someone as a freelancer to kind of help manage your page you could sell them

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:57,010
as an editor and then they can even begin to edit the page itself delete posts go live.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,540
Or you can start to restrict those options.

24
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,750
So as you can see admin has the most amount of rights.

25
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:11,880
And then as emu's then the rights become less and less so for example unlist they can view your insights

26
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,610
for your Facebook page and see published as the page so they can give you.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,100
That's a really an analyst role.

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,110
Maybe this is only something that's going to exist in a much bigger company where they're actually just

29
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,060
analyzing your page and maybe many other pages as well.

30
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:37,170
So it's incredibly simple to are these page rules in but it is important to know how to do it because

31
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,450
you can really share that workload as soon as possible and get a number of different people working

32
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,260
on your Facebook page so you can really grow much faster.

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,860
Two heads are always much better than one.

34
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,050
So come into your settings section under page rules and in any colleagues or freelancers that you may

35
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,320
need to add in in order to help you out.
