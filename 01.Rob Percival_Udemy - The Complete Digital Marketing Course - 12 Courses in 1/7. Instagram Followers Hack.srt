00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,310
In this video you're going to learn how to get your first followers on Instagram.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,000
It's a pretty cool strategy and I'm going to tell you about it just in a second.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,430
Before we get into that I do want to answer a common question that does come up is can I just buy my

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,320
Instagram followers to get some social proof.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,160
Just what I'm getting started.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,400
And yes of course you can you can go to Crome or your browser or type in by Instagram followers.

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,720
You can see they look great like a great ad and he can get them for 799 or for whatever you want.

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,720
Now the reason that I wouldn't recommend you do this is number one.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,160
Numbers aren't really important on Instagram.

10
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,280
It's not about the number of followers.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,930
It's really more about the engagement that you have on each post.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,200
So if you look at some topic cance No it's not really the number of followers that is important.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,740
It's really the engagements that those posts get.

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,620
That's the real signal that people are engaging with your content.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,320
So if you buy a lot of followers and they don't actually engage your content then they're basically

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,210
worthless.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,740
Now the other reason you don't want to just buy a lot of followers is because that's going to mess up

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,310
your own lyrics later on.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,130
It's not going to give you a clear indication of the age the demographic of your audience.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,450
And that can cause problems and for misunderstanding your audience are or if you want to retarget your

21
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,890
Instagram audience what have Facebook God et cetera.

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,490
It just messes up everything.

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,620
So it's really not worth doing although those advertisements online etc. are quite attractive and it

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,450
looks like a pretty good shortcut.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,220
So I would advise not to buy by Instagram followers.

26
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,630
That would be my advice.

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,300
So how do you get them then for free and that are going to be real people in a targeted way.

28
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,650
Are going to watch you want to visit your web site or buy a product or service.

29
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,490
Well the first thing you want to do is find those big accounts that have the audience that you want

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,330
to really engage with.

31
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,020
And just for example I'm just going to open up this account here.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,280
This guy is kind of helps people get added that he's essentially a financial planner but he has his

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,070
own app etc. that does that.

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,110
Now I wanted to funnel his audience back to my Instagram account.

35
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,910
This is what I would do.

36
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,440
I would start to come in to each post.

37
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:45,410
And I would start to look at the comments and what I would do is start to actually go ahead and start

38
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:54,610
to follow the people who have engaged with the content and I go ahead and follow those people and then

39
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,490
they're going to get a notification on their account that I've followed them.

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,290
And once they get that notification they're probably going to want to check.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,940
Well who is this person to follow who followed me.

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:14,710
And then they're going to click through to my profile here and if I have a good bio if I have a good

43
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:22,480
profile picture if I have maybe 3 to 5 posts that show that type of content that I'm putting out and

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:30,130
if that's relevant to them and it should be if I funneling them from a similar top account on instagram

45
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,740
then they're going to go ahead to follow me back.

46
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,570
So that is a very simple way to get real genuine followers.

47
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,710
It is a good manual but I can guarantee you it's just going to help you understand even by going through

48
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:53,050
even going through these influencers of cancer what is the type of content that gets so much engagements.

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,220
So let me come back to some of those topics.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,600
So if I was trying to do something similar to Tim first by going through each post I'm going to notice

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,520
which ones are the ones that get the most amount of engagements so that's the first thing I'm learning

52
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,930
by doing this then I'm not just copying his followers or automating a tool to do that.

53
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,840
I'm actually following the most engaged part of his audience on Instagram which are the people that

54
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,170
are actually commenting and then I'm going to either follow them directly or just go ahead and reply

55
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:36,070
and start to engage with them and slowly over time then aton of his audience are just going to funnel

56
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,590
back on start following my account.

57
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,710
And if there was more than if there was three to five topics like this that had a similar audience mine.

58
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,960
This is just something I can do every single day maybe take half an hour follow maximum maybe 50 people

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,860
in that half an hour and then you're just going to slowly build up your kind.

60
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:04,880
Not only are you going to get the followers you're going to get reengaged followers and also in the

61
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,700
process you're going to learn what is the content that really gets these topics.

62
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,210
So much engagements and you're going to learn that through this process as well.

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,010
So that is how you get your first followers on Instagram.

64
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,300
Identify those top influencers who can't follow that people are engaging with their content.

65
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,300
Reply to them and then they're going to funnel back and start falling again because they're going to

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,390
see that notification that you follow them they're going to check out your profile and what is really

67
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:41,300
important before you even start this whole process off is that you've optimized your bio your profile

68
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,770
picture or call to action buttons.

69
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,830
Now you've got at least three to five posts.

70
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,980
They can see OK well this is available.

71
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,910
I can't it's active.

72
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,740
It has good content and I'm going to follow and keep updated with them.

73
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:01,370
So go ahead and use our strategy to get your first Sensurround followers funnel them really from the

74
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,450
top accounts.

75
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,370
That's really what it sums up to.
