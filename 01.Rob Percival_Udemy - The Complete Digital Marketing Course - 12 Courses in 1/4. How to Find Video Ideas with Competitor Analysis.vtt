00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.600
In this video you're going to learn how to create a list of 20 video ideas in less than five minutes

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.050
just by doing some competitor research on YouTube.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.620
So if you'd like to get this spreadsheet that you can see on screen I put the link to it in the resources

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.260
section of this video and you can come in here just click file and make coffee so that you can get a

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.370
copy that you can edit for yourself.

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.500
It's a pretty simple spreadsheet to be honest.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.710
So you could probably just make this up yourself.

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.400
The point is that we want to fill this out by looking at our competitors on YouTube.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.230
If you're not sure who your competitors are what are you going to do is type in a product name topic

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.400
name or service name.

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.770
So for example let me just take as an example our product.

12
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.020
Beard oil.

13
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.380
No I personally don't have a beard but I think it is kind of an interesting topic to look at.

14
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.310
Now while we can see here are a list of videos of people who've created videos of bad beard oil.

15
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.830
And I think this is a great way to start thinking my video ideas because you can really see already

16
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.160
that type of videos that people have created around this product name or key word.

17
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.430
So just simply water is beard oil and how to apply it.

18
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.110
122 thousand views.

19
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.470
I mean that's a pretty simple video that you could make and attract potential customers.

20
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:37.230
So what I'm going to do is just really take the title of this video and just start to paste it into

21
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.250
my list.

22
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.670
Now I'm not going to be definitely copying these videos Exactly.

23
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.950
The purpose of this exercise is just to get a sense of the type of videos that they could make.

24
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.920
Now you can see that this is kind of an educational video rather than an entertaining one or a story

25
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.030
brand telling video.

26
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.690
And so we can start to get a sense of what are the type of videos that we could make now.

27
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.010
Great tip is once you find a channel that you think might be similar to what you're doing is you can

28
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:15.120
come in to the channel have a look at all of their videos and come in and sort those videos by the most

29
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.240
popular.

30
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.820
And now all of a sudden you've got even looking at the top two rows 10 guaranteed video ideas that you

31
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.500
could use to talk about your product or talk to your target market.

32
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.070
And I would be interested in that type of product.

33
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.490
And once again you can look through this maybe not every single one of these videos is going to be something

34
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.500
that you could do.

35
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.150
But when there is one you could really just am you know head trauma at home.

36
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.740
This is educationalist tutorials time type video.

37
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.980
I think something I could easily do if I was getting into this type of business.

38
00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.470
And so it's good just to take that you role then as well so you can come back and look at this later.

39
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.850
Now let's have a look at another example.

40
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.750
Just to really show how easy this is to get a ton of video ideas from competitors.

41
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.410
So let's take another product.

42
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.150
This is actually something I was looking for or something I was looking on YouTube for and it's just

43
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.810
wall filler it's something to fill a hole in a wall with it and you can see that there are some a lot

44
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.060
of areas where this head to fill holes in the cracks and walls preparing walls her painting to fill

45
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.050
a crack in the wall to fix small holes so you can see again these are educational type videos where

46
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.630
people are showing the target audience how to do something and then once again the product is kind of

47
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.860
central to that.

48
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.940
They say no if you want to get it pick it up in the store or click the link in the description.

49
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.940
So once again for this type of product we could just take this once again we don't want to copy these

50
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.060
videos exactly we just want to get a sense of what are the type of videos that we could make and you

51
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:14.650
can come into the channel once again come into the videos type come in to sort by most popular and you

52
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.410
can see some of the other videos that are related that could pull that audience.

53
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.180
And if you have products or services or knew about that topic like that and actually you can just copy

54
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.040
those in so you can see.

55
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.130
Most likely here these are the same product being featured but just showing how to do two different

56
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.510
things with it or really appealing to different things that people will be typing in to YouTube.

57
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.260
So it's very simple educational style videos and let's have a look at something completely different

58
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.760
maybe our product maybe like more like a just an online tutorial.

59
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.170
So let's have a look at photoshop.

60
00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.570
So again you can just type that in a pop to channel straightaway photoshopped toils Ignus how good these

61
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.010
guys come into their videos.

62
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.480
Come in to nice popular.

63
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.740
Now each row has five videos.

64
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.070
You can see one two three four five six seven eight nine.

65
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.830
I mean you this 50 probably 100 video ideas here that you can just take notes and in your spreadsheet

66
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.390
and all of a sudden you have got your video ideas mapped out for the next year or so.

67
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.600
So coming in looking at competitive Challen channels I think it's just the greatest way to quickly understand

68
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.590
what are the types of videos that you could make that are proven to get views because the video like

69
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.280
this gets 2.9 million views.

70
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.170
You can be guaranteed that if you make a video on that topic you can maybe add your own twist.

71
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:03.900
You can focus on maybe a particular feature of that something that you can do a little bit different

72
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.530
can really pick up a huge amount of use as well gets you ranking the search engines and attracting all

73
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.290
of those potential customers.

74
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.300
So now it's your turn.

75
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.910
Come into YouTube.

76
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.810
Paste in your topic name your product name or your service name into the search bar.

77
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.870
Have a look at those competitors that come up in the top of the search results come into their channel.

78
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.740
Have a look at their videos and sort by the most popular so you can get a ton of video ideas in less

79
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.570
than five minutes and pop them into that spreadsheet.

80
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.710
If you want to note them down.
