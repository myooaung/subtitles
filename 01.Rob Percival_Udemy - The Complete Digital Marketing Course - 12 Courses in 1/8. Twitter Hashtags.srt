And that is a key thing that Twitter wants to do really to organize conversations and to group them

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,730
together.

15
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,390
And these hashtags are a key way to do this.

16
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,040
So you can not only Use these hashtags to be easily fanned through the search but you can also create

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,780
your own hashtags.

18
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,530
If you were running a certain campaign and you wanted to search and see how many people were talking

19
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,980
about your campaign online you'll probably see this often on TV shows.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:53,320
They have the hashtag for the TV show and that enables people to tweet to include that hashtag.

21
00:01:53,410 --> 00:02:00,550
Then the TV show can find those tweets easily on Twitter and then they're able to read tweet or engage

22
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,940
with them.

23
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,090
So it's the same strategy that other companies are using you can embrace that for yourself either create

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:14,260
a hashtag for your brand or for your individual company or just use these hashtags in order to group

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,840
your tweets into the larger conversation that's happening on Twitter.

26
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:26,590

27
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,970
based on your location and by seeing the hashtags for your location you can participate in these larger

28
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,640
conversations that are happening on Twitter and that will help increase your visibility because you're

29
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,010
