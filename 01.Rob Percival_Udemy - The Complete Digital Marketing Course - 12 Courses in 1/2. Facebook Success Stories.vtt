00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.940
Wouldn't it be great if there is a database of proven tactics and strategies tailored to your business

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.900
that you can take and apply to your Facebook campaigns.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.310
Well the great news is that there is Facebook has cataloged and organized a ton of case studies on success

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.410
stories here.

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.540
These are all real businesses getting real results would face for cards and you can access these.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.870
Any time you need to go to Facebook dot com forward slash business forward slash success and the great

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.930
thing is is that you can break these down by business size.

8
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.660
The goal that you want to achieve the industry that you're in the product that you want to test it on

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.580
Facebook and even the region that you are from.

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.570
So what I've done is really picked out for case studies and I'm going to walk you through them step

11
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.210
by step analyze them break them down.

12
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.240
And these are for completely different types of businesses.

13
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.720
We've got a local at retail business for the physical location.

14
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.340
Got an app business.

15
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.810
We've got a solo Perner online consultant and we have got an e-commerce business.

16
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.320
So we're going to go through each of these one by one looking at their objectives that targeting the

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.970
ad forment that they use.

18
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300
And of course the results as well.

19
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.980
I'll also show you one cool trick for how you can analyze any that pops up in your Facebook news feed

20
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.120
and how to create your own personal database.

21
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.310
These eye catching ads seek news and to inspire your own campaigns.

22
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.560
So be sure to stick around to the end for that.

23
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520
So let's kick it all off and have a look at case number one.

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.670
And it's for the vocal clinic.

25
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.930
And as you can probably guess from the image here this is case to the fore for a local business has

26
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.110
a physical location.

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.700
What I'm going to do is walk through this case study.

28
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.870
Pick out the important points and the keys to success that you need to focus on.

29
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.520
Give me a little insights along the way as well.

30
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.760
It's the perfect place to start and really where you should start any analysis or where you should start

31
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.790
thinking about your own campaigns is really understanding the goal.

32
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.310
So the goal for the vocationally clinic here was to generate interest.

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.190
They wanted to engage potential clients and more specifically they wanted to attract inquiries from

34
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.840
people interested in the clinic's services.

35
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.070
So notice here that they're not trying to get the sale directly from the Facebook ad they're just trying

36
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.020
to generate leads.

37
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.460
So now that we understand that their objective is to generate leads.

38
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.070
Let's have a closer look at what they actually offer.

39
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.550
So V-Vocal clinic is a business in Arland and this is a perfect case study to start with because I'm

40
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.930
from our end as well and they offer surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures.

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.370
So probably things like breast augmentation laser surgery Botox that type of stuff.

42
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.800
So we understand their objective is to generate leads with a better understanding of the business.

43
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.350
Let's take a closer look at their targeting.

44
00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.650
They targeted their ads and this is really key to their success to get click through those to get conversions

45
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.140
and three reduce waste as well.

46
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.610
So there isn't a lot of information about targeting here.

47
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.310
But if we move then we can see products used core targeting and I've opened this up here.

48
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.410
And courts are going to remind you is really using targeting options like location demographics interests

49
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.010
behaviors and connections.

50
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.110
And my guess here is that the vocal clinic probably targeted their ads by a certain location so a radius

51
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.690
may be around the clinic of people who could easily reach the clinic so they could come in for the actual

52
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.810
services and also by demographics.

53
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.690
My guess is that there are services primarily appealed to women and definitely women of a certain age

54
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.470
category as well who are legally able to do these type of surgeries.

55
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.800
So now that we understand the targeting a little bit better.

56
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.540
And what are the targeting options that they used.

57
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.600
Let's have a look at their budget.

58
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.860
It's another key to success.

59
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.630
And you can see that they started with a small advertising span of just €50.

60
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.540
So this is the right way to do it.

61
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.880
They started small and they really built up from there.

62
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.690
And actually if you see that they started about 50 years but they have now 10x their Facebook investments

63
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.160
so they're probably looking at 500.

64
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.670
I'm not sure if that's five hundred a month but you can see that they tested something it worked then

65
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.870
they scaled it.

66
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.230
And that's the that's the right way to do it with the budgets as well.

67
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.200
Then the next key to success is really the odd creative and we can actually see the ads that they used

68
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.970
here which is pretty cool.

69
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.480
We can see that there are two outs that they used here.

70
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.520
Two types of different copying.

71
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.150
And I think you'll agree that these are very visual very eye catching.

72
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:53.190
There is a great image here kind of black background white clothes and they're definitely relevant because

73
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.570
this is a woman here they're probably trying to attract the attention of a woman she's looking good

74
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.670
she's in her gym gear for overhears all pitchers are women as well.

75
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.080
So they're really appealing to the person that they're trying to attract they're looking fit and they're

76
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.110
really showing the success story as well.

77
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.460
This is why people want to look like you probably want their services.

78
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.020
So we know it's visually appealing.

79
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.950
We know it's relevant.

80
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.710
Let's have a look at the offer here.

81
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.620
So want to learn more abayas our treatments by our award winning team.

82
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.130
Just click get quote and we'll be live to answer your questions.

83
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.630
So the offer here is will answer your questions.

84
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.090
You will call me back.

85
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.480
Free of charge.

86
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.850
And so that's a pretty good offer.

87
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.060
I mean there's no risk there.

88
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.910
Just click through and we'll call you back.

89
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.420
And a final point to note is that the vote could clinic use a certain type of format.

90
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.490
It's called a lead right.

91
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.830
And then although you can see any real difference here the difference is after you click through here

92
00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:03.290
on the Get quote button lead out when you use this brings the person to a landing page with in Facebook

93
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.110
it's an enquiry form where their details are already pre-filled by the information they've submitted

94
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.070
to Facebook.

95
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.770
So that solves two big problems for advertisers one that the person doesn't have to fill in their details

96
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.560
because Facebook has already pre-filled it probably more importantly they don't need to leave Facebook

97
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.030
in order to give you their information.

98
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.740
They don't need to go off to a Web site that maybe don't trust or wait for it to load up in order to

99
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.700
give you information.

100
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.240
It just makes it really seamless and is probably a key reason.

101
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.000
This ad was so effective.

102
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.630
So let's wrap it all up and bring it to together here.

103
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:47.060
Even if you have absolutely no intention of setting up a surgical or nonsurgical cosmetic clinic where

104
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.220
you're not in that you're at that business at all.

105
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.070
There are some key takeaways from this case study.

106
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:58.340
One is that they got really clear on their goal and really everything led from there.

107
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.220
Their goal was to generate leads not get the sale.

108
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.870
That's probably perfectly suited to the type of business they're in because it's going to be very hard

109
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.290
to close four thousand five hundred euros sale from a face because they do the right thing to just focus

110
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.700
on generating leads.

111
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.060
They they created their ad to really promote that get a quote.

112
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.480
And they use this lead ad format in order to regenerate those leads quickly.

113
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.570
They use images that are visually appealing and relevant to the audience that have a good offer.

114
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.530
And they used CT targeting location demographics to really get time front to the right audience.

115
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.980
So you can see that everything kind of has to fit together and work together in order to create these

116
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.790
successful campaigns.

117
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.550
And you can see the results here that they really got an 90 percent lower cost per lead than any other

118
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.330
channel.

119
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.580
They've got a ton of leads coming from Facebook.

120
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.940
And as we said they 10x their investment after this.

121
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.700
So that wraps up case to number 16 number one.

122
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.720
Let's have a look now at Casely number two.

123
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.020
So let's have a look at case study number two now.

124
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.490
And this is for an op business and we're going to move through this case study and the remaining ones

125
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.570
a lot quicker.

126
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.490
So let's get straight into it.

127
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:13.890
Their objective with this campaign was really to get new app users so they want to increase up in stalls.

128
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.730
Let's have a look at what this app actually does.

129
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.550
It lets customers manage multiple and can send budgets from a single interface.

130
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.340
So really helping people with personal finance.

131
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.060
I think that's great.

132
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:30.080
There's a lot of people really struggle with that need help with that so the apps really solving a good

133
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.580
problem there.

134
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.840
Let's look at how they targeted their odds.

135
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.450
And you can see here that they used look alike audiences.

136
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:44.070
And if you remember this is really reaching people who are already similar to your customers or contacts.

137
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.120
So people are already using the app people to visit your web site.

138
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.170
People are already on your e-mail list or connected to your Facebook page.

139
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:57.470
So good strategy to really increase up in stalls so we understand the targeting now using look like

140
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:58.190
audiences.

141
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.690
Let's have a look at the ad created here to see if they take the boxes.

142
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.480
Well it's definitely visually appealing.

143
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.130
There's a nice picture here and it's relevance because we've got a girl here looking at her phone.

144
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.050
She's outside having a coffee.

145
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.480
Life looks easy.

146
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.350
And so this is a good success picture really paint and she's looking at her phone as also gives us that

147
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.510
clue that something related to your phone.

148
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.330
There's a good offer here as well.

149
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.450
If you could predict your budget and never bet we find short at the end of the month that's translated

150
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.000
from French French but I get the idea.

151
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.710
You know it's going to help you not be sure at the end of the month.

152
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.110
No he likes that problem.

153
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.930
And this is going to help you do that.

154
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.710
Very clear call to action at the end again here.

155
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.140
Install now.

156
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.530
So taking a lot of boxes there for a successful are creative and let's have a look at the ad format

157
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.920
as well.

158
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:56.540
They used a mobile app install it and if we look at this when you click on this install Now button what

159
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.020
this does is linked directly to the App Store Google Play and Kindle Fire.

160
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:06.890
So depending on your device it will send you to the right place to download it so that people can download

161
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.490
it straight away.

162
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.620
And again it's just making it seamless.

163
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.780
Taking items unnecessary steps and that really helps advisors.

164
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.560
So again the key takeaways here are very clear on their goal.

165
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.730
They set up an ad that was really tailored to that.

166
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:28.070
And then they even tapped into lookalike audiences mobile app stores and video ads to bring that all

167
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.910
together and really make that work and let's have a look at some of the results.

168
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:39.400
Forty percent increase in op installations and 52 percent of active users generated by Facebook traffic.

169
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:47.060
So not only do people then load the app but they also became users of the OP as well which is very important

170
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.510
ultimately for the business as well.

171
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.810
So it wraps up.

172
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:57.200
Case number two let's have a look now at case number three in this case that is pretty interesting because

173
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.330
it shows how woman Nawabi company is using Facebook ads to grow her business.

174
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.240
Her name is Murka.

175
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:09.090
She's from the Czech Republic and she's into something pretty obscure which is astrology.

176
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.500
What she actually does is offer and prepare personalized horoscopes.

177
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:20.330
So I don't think you get any more knish or obscure than this and read the point of including this case

178
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:26.060
it is to show you that look you don't have to be a company to take advantage of Facebook ads and you

179
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.380
don't even need to be in to something that is a huge industry.

180
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:36.410
I don't think you get any more obscure than preparing personalized astrology reports.

181
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:42.090
And I think it's fantastic that she's taking advantage of Facebook ads in order to score a business.

182
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.200
So let's have a look at how she targeted people for her ads and really find people who are interested

183
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.580
in getting personalized horoscopes.

184
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:57.920
So what she did was use custom audiences from her Web site so probably retargeting people who had visited

185
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.300
her Web site but not taken that step to actually purchase the personalized report.

186
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:10.310
She also used that custom audience to create a look alike audience so that she is really targeting people

187
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:15.890
not only who visited a web site but people who are like those people and using that audience to really

188
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.190
drive sales.

189
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:22.600
So let's have a look at her odd creative here and look at see if it really takes the boxes.

190
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.530
So we can't really read the text here because it's in check.

191
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.480
But you can see that the images are definitely catching attention and I'm sure that you've got the word

192
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.440
for the horoscope here you've got some questions that are probably pulling you in and you've got the

193
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.450
call to action to really learn more so it's not a hard drive to to get the sale.

194
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.410
I'm sure it's leading them towards this page here on our Web site where there is the opportunity to

195
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:55.260
go ahead and buy the reports at a prison pretty reasonable price of 23 euros.

196
00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.480
So summing up this case study we can see that it's pretty you know an obscure business.

197
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.190
She's probably working from home.

198
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.700
She's making a big success.

199
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.330
She's getting a 3x return on her investments so that means she's putting in zero.

200
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.340
She's getting three years back.

201
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:17.420
And that is a fantastic place to be in because her business will never kind of stop making revenue.

202
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.460
She's a predictable way to make revenue.

203
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.560
Spend €1 on Facebook ads.

204
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.850
Get three years back.

205
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.570
Who doesn't want that.

206
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.330
I'd definitely take that any day of the week.

207
00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.060
Rupp's of case number three solo Perner person working from home.

208
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:38.070
Let us now look at the final case study for the Arab brothers which is an e-commerce business.

209
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:44.870
In this case study is particularly good for understanding how to use retargeting for an e-commerce store

210
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.390
or a retargeting in general.

211
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:53.320
So we can see that their objective was to raise their awareness but also to increase sales as well.

212
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.680
And if you come a little bit further down here that we can see that their objectives were to get clicks

213
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.060
to Web sites and to really get Web site conversions as well.

214
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.450
So some of the targeting that they did and this is probably the most interesting part of this case to

215
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:12.640
me here is that they split up their ads into three different groups and had really three separate objectives.

216
00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.950
One is target people who had added an item to their basket.

217
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.810
So probably reminding people to come and finish the process on really going straight for that low hanging

218
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:30.050
fruit getting people who had almost purchased but not quite finished through next level then really

219
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.880
targeting people who viewed specific items but never made it to the checkout process.

220
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:40.360
And then finally people who had visited the arm brother Web site so you can see that Halai preorder

221
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:46.490
is prioritises groups are starting with the people who are closest to making a purchase and then targeting

222
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.460
people who are the one step back from that.

223
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:53.630
And then again targeting people who are one step back from that again and these photo and video ads

224
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.000
that clearly show the problem popped in the news feed.

225
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.440
We don't have the examples here yet.

226
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.650
But really the objectives were get people to the Web sites and get people to convert and finish those

227
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.920
purchases as well.

228
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:13.080
And looking up at some of the results here they got a 13 x increase on their return on their outspends

229
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.670
of putting euro yet know 13 euros or dollars back.

230
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:24.900
And this is the amazing thing here 50 percent of their revenue directly generated by Facebook ads in

231
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.950
2016.

232
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:32.550
So they have built their business on the back of Facebook ads and that just shows I think is a great

233
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.270
metric to finish up these case studies on to really show how powerful that is.

234
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.170
If you really applied strategies and get them right and I particularly shows how powerful that retargeting

235
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:49.280
is as well when you go for that low hanging fruit and pick up those warm leads as well as Qasimi be

236
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:53.070
trying to get people to the Web site and do some brand awareness stuff.

237
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.090
Those cases are really helpful.

238
00:15:55.110 --> 00:16:00.180
But there's one thing that you can do on a daily basis that's going to make you a much much better Facebook

239
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.120
advertiser.

240
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.450
And that is to analyze the ads that pop up in your own news feed.

241
00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.150
You're going to know it's anon because it says sponsored here.

242
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.860
Here's one really cool trick that you can use.

243
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.330
You see that little drop down here.

244
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.000
Just click on that and you can click on this button.

245
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.400
Why am I seeing this sign.

246
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:21.360
And this is going to help you understand the targeting that the advertiser has set up for this campaign

247
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:27.870
so I can see here that Linked-In wants to reach people who have visited their web site or one of their

248
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:34.860
apps and more specifically they want to reach people who were ages 18 and older who live or were recently

249
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:35.610
in Ireland.

250
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:43.860
So I know that they are using a custom audience and also using those targeting features based on demographics

251
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.280
and location.

252
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:51.330
So that's a cool little trick that you can do to understand why you're seeing the ads in your news feed.

253
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.270
And also if you like these ads like this Saturday you can see that it's got a cool learn more potent

254
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.340
on the image and that does make me want to click that and if I want to replicate that in my campaigns

255
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:08.010
and make sure I remembered it what I can do is actually click here download the drop then again click

256
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:14.700
Save Link on what I'm going to be doing is really saving all of these ads creating my own personal database

257
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.250
of ads that inspired me that caught my attention and that's going to help me create much better ads.

258
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:26.430
Now if you want to save all these say or finally save dads it come across to saved here and you can

259
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:33.150
see a list of all of the ads you can click down to save from and you can see the original post here

260
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:40.950
won't appear like an ad which you can see and access that again so can help inform your own campaigns.

261
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:47.340
Sort of recap then in this lecture we looked at four case studies from four completely different types

262
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.360
of businesses.

263
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.160
You can see that all of them are using Facebook gods effectively to grow their business.

264
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.930
They're using different strategies.

265
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.840
And I hope that this shows you that tailor tactics and strategies that you can use for yourself.

266
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:06.780
Of course any time you can come in to Facebook TACAN for slash business for his success check these

267
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.220
cases for yourself.

268
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.500
Start to analyze them in the way that we've done in this election that you learn to do.

269
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:19.050
And also you've learned how to create your own database of ads you can really use to inspire your own

270
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.030
campaigns.

271
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.010
So I hope you find that next helpful.

272
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.560
I'll see you in the next lecture.
