00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.780
In this video we're going to take a close look at our acquisition reports in Google Analytics.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.610
And if you're a marketer you're going to love this because there are awkward acquisition reports allows

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.390
us to compare the performance of different marketing channels and enables us to really discover which

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.720
marketing channel is performing the best.

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.880
And then we can maybe focus in on that in order to grow our business.

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.400
So to get started come across into this side bar and let's take a look at the source media report that

7
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.800
when this report you're going to see the source of traffic.

8
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.540
So the individual Web site like Google dot com YouTube dot com.

9
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.660
And then the medium is really the way that they came from that web site to our site so we can see here

10
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.770
that they arrive organically.

11
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.800
So maybe they just clicked on a search results on Google dot com and that is different to maybe arriving.

12
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.610
If I had another row here through CPC or cost per click so that would have been a night.

13
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.560
So in this scenario we've got people arriving organically which makes up the largest segments of our

14
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.490
users to the site over the date range that we've set.

15
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.230
But they can also arrive via us here.

16
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.210
So that's why there is a distinction not only between the source of the traffic but all the also the

17
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.470
medium of the traffic as well.

18
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.430
And that's important to know because we could be sending users from one source in multiple different

19
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.610
ways organically through content that we create or via advertisements.

20
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.570
So if we look at this data table we can see really the marketing channels that are sending us the most

21
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.060
amount of users over our day range.

22
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.400
And as we said we can see that a lot of them 36 percent of them are coming through Google organic.

23
00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:03.030
So that means that are doing a pretty good job on our SEO but users know alone is not necessarily the

24
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.040
best indicator of the quality of that traffic and we really want to have quality traffic that is resulting

25
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.770
in conversions for the goals that we've set up and that could be sign ups to an email list or it could

26
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.780
be checked Garretts from our online store.

27
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.410
A great indicator of the quality of our traffic is balance Maret.

28
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.690
So if we come across to the site comparison feature here we have all the sources and mediums of our

29
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.940
traffic and we can really compare the balance rate of these sources of traffic compared to the side

30
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.910
average.

31
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.150
And this will really give us that indication of the quality of the traffic so we can see here from this

32
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.650
particular source and medium that the balance rate is very high compared to the site average.

33
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.890
So maybe we'd want to have a look at how people are coming from that from that web site to make sure

34
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.300
that they're landing on pages that might be more relevant to them.

35
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.120
For example here looking at our Google organic we can see that people coming organically from the search

36
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.510
engines are landing on very relevant pages because you can see that there is a very low bounce rate

37
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.120
compared to the side average as well as looking at the balance rate as an indicator.

38
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.960
If youve got your goals set up you can actually look at the contribution to actual revenue and that

39
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.370
you set up here so as well as maybe go completions if youve got revenue set up then you can see the

40
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.370
actual contribution of each channel to the revenue thats been driven over the last seven days or the

41
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.720
timeframe that you've set up here now as well as looking at the source medium report we can actually

42
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.760
go in and look at our referrals report to see those exact sites that have referred us traffic or sent

43
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.980
visitors from their web site to our Web site.

44
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.740
And if we click in here into the source we can actually see the individual pages on that Web site that

45
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.780
are sending those traffic which is really interesting to know because we know exactly where they have

46
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.740
linked to our Web site and if we want to even see which page on our Web site they are linking to we

47
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:36.960
can add a secondary dimension of a landing page and so now what we can see in this report is that they're

48
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.410
linking from this page on their Web site to this page on our Web site and we can really see the connection

49
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.190
that they made and maybe we could encourage them to do more of that or make sure that we are really

50
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.330
have the best page there that we could for that particular link that they're sending over to us.

51
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.270
So it's just really interesting to know where they're actually sending us traffic from and to so that

52
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.050
we can continue to try and develop more of those types of referrals from other web sites or from that

53
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.210
individual site.

54
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:21.540
Now looking up our acquisition overview report we can get a high level summary of really the different

55
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:29.820
groupings of the traffic so we can see organic search direct referral social affiliates paid search

56
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:38.640
and display and this gives us that high level overview on pie chart of this place in our different channel

57
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.930
groupings.

58
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.640
So what we would maybe want to ask ourselves and have a quick glance at is okay we're getting a lot

59
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.220
of traffic from organic search.

60
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.390
Maybe we should continue to do that.

61
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.720
And really what we want to ask ourselves is based on the investment that we're putting into these channels

62
00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.470
which one is paying off the best maybe we've got a full time person on social and that's not leading

63
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.370
to a lot of traffic or sales maybe we might reduce that and put some more working on organic search

64
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.480
if that is working well so that you know how to get insights out of your acquisition reports maybe come

65
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.910
in to your source media report and have a look at the quality of your traffic.

66
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.150
By doing that side comparison based on the balance rate.
