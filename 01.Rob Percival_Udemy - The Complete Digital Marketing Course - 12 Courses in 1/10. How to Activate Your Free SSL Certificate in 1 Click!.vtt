00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.750
In this video you're going to learn how to activate your free SSL certificate in blue host.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.290
It's very simple to do.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.940
All we need to do is really click this button to enable it.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.440
But before we go ahead and do that I do want to explain what is an SSL certificate and what is really

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.230
the benefit of it and how much would it cost you if you weren't getting it for free.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.840
So really an SSL certificate is very simple it makes your site more secure and you probably most commonly

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.700
see it here by having this little t t p s and in the browser seeing here that the site is secure.

8
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.470
So obviously blue hosts themselves have this SSL cert.

9
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.320
It's showing in my browser as a visitor to this site that this is secure.

10
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.460
Now let's compare this to my example site here.

11
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.630
You can see I do not have this secure symbol or the page DTP apps and if I click in I actually look

12
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.300
at the information here it says my connection to this site.

13
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.480
Me as a visitor now it's not secure and I shouldn't enter in any sensitive information.

14
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.880
For example passwords credit cards because it can be stolen by attackers.

15
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.620
So really there's a lot of technical stuff about waterin SL SSL certificate actually does.

16
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.450
But as a web site owner really the important stuff is is it really helps keep data secure.

17
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.370
It increases your Google rankings it builds and enhances consumer trust and it improved things.

18
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.200
Conversion rates because people can see OK this site is secure.

19
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.050
I won't fear about my information being stolen by hackers.

20
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.390
Now this is a business site that I set up here so it's not like people are entering credit card details

21
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.550
or passwords.

22
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.350
But still it just gives me that extra sense of security just by having this little symbol in the browser.

23
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.320
So obviously there are clear benefits to it here.

24
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.780
It can help you in these search rankings even though people are not putting in information on my site.

25
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.570
And it just builds consumer trust and increases those conversion rates.

26
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.430
Now how much would this cost you if you weren't getting it for free with blue hosts.

27
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.360
Well we'll look at Go Daddy here and you can see that for the first year it might cost you 55 56 dollars

28
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.860
and then $70 after that.

29
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.590
So getting it free is pretty cool.

30
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.570
And again this is just one of the advantages of its signing up.

31
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.560
And two blue hosts.

32
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.890
So as we can see here my site now does not have the certificates.

33
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.060
I'm just going to come into blue you come into home.

34
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.680
You can come into my sites you can come in to manage sites and then to get to that little button you

35
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.160
can come to security.

36
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.350
And then we can just click Enable there.

37
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.860
So now I can see that it's in progress.

38
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.390
And if I click in to see the information it says we're setting up your SSL right now.

39
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.090
It normally takes about an hour.

40
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.280
And if it takes more than four hours they will e-mail me asking for more information.

41
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.190
So I'm going to wait about an hour wait for this to show up on my side.

42
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.000
OK so back to my site now.

43
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.610
After a little bit of a wait and now I can see that the SSL cert has been activated.

44
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.980
I know that because here in the address bar its name showing the secure symbol and I can also see the

45
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.690
hates to deep space in green which looks fantastic.

46
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.380
So if you have any problems with this process I'd recommend you really use the live chat function on

47
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.980
blue hose.

48
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.870
Their support is really incredible.

49
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.690
So if anything doesn't happen or doesn't show up after that time period just get in touch with them.

50
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.530
So once again the benefits of getting an cells cert are that it keeps data secure between your servers

51
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.770
and your credit card information passwords can be hacked.

52
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.590
It also helps increase your Google rankings because you have that extra protection for visitors.

53
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.830
It builds consumer trust because it just looks great.

54
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.910
Then they know they're protected and it'll help improve conversion rates because they feel more confident

55
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.900
about signing up to emails or making purchases on your site because they know it's safe.

56
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:21.230
So the steps once again to activate your free SSL cert on blue hosts are to come into my site's security

57
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.360
and just click that button to get your free SSL cert activated.
