00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.320
Once you have selected your campaign time the next step is start to target your audience by location

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.670
and language.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.620
Now these are just two of the five ways that you can target your ads on words.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.280
You've got locations languages time of day device targeting some mobile tablet et cetera and keywords

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.750
and all of those are coming up.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.590
But in this video we're really going to focus on locations and languages.

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.480
And what I would really recommend that you do is you open up any available data that you have to improve

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070
the accuracy of your targeting here for a location in languages.

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
And there's two places where you could really get a lot of information if you have it set up.

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.820
One is Google Analytics.

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.000
So if you come then into the audience reports you'll see that there are two reports here.

12
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.660
Language and location.

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.150
So I can see what are the countries where I get most of my web site visitors from.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.640
And even if I break that down I can see the individual cities.

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.630
So starting at in your campaign you might not want to target too to the entire country which it probably

16
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.430
will be by default to really reduce your costs for your first campaign and to get much better results.

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.700
You can really narrow this down to maybe you were top city.

18
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.910
So for example I can just say Dublin here and put this in as a city.

19
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.680
And if I put the scene you can see that comes up.

20
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.750
And there that's where it's targeted to just people in my city are going to see the ads underneath their

21
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.400
search results.

22
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.540
Now what you can also do if you are a say e-commerce company and maybe you don't ship to somewhere like

23
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.250
India.

24
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.580
You could include that as a country.

25
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.290
And you know I just wanted to do this to make sure that I'm excluding this.

26
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.860
So instead of targeting it I could be excluded there.

27
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.500
So you can see in the location section here that you can include at locations and get very specific

28
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.940
even then further in cities if you want and you can also exclude countries regions etc maybe for an

29
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.920
e-commerce company and you don't ship there where you don't offer services there.

30
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.400
So location targeting very important it will really narrow down your audience and you can really use

31
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.770
the information from Google Analytics to that.

32
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.070
You can also use the same information from your Facebook page if you've got set up you can come across

33
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.510
the inside section and the people report and you'll see similar the country and the city and that you

34
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.030
can either target specifically so you are targeting those people who are really interested in your product

35
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.090
for your first campaign you really want to focus in on the most engaged people and then as your campaign

36
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.100
starts to generate revenue and get a return on investment then you can broaden it out.

37
00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.240
Now similarly with location you can also targeted to specific languages so you can see by default set

38
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.920
up in the language that I'm operating in and my country which is English and you can also look at Google

39
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.000
Analytics and the language report you can see English here and in the Facebook insights the language

40
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.710
is well and use that available data.

41
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.490
If you have it to really select the language.

42
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.950
Now if you do want to target different languages I would recommend you set them up as separate campaigns.

43
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.100
Right now we have set up one test campaign here am and we're just doing this for English.

44
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.310
Say if I was a company that wanted to target Spanish speakers in the U.S. as well then it's better to

45
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:48.540
set up a separate campaign so I can really set up a campaign to target those speakers and create keywords

46
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.250
etc. that would focus on them.

47
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.720
So if you do want to target multiple languages maybe it's better to set up two camps two separate campaigns.

48
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.090
So that is really the next step in setting up your outwards campaign.

49
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.100
Pop in the locations that you want to include or exclude and put in the main language that you want

50
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.920
to target.
