00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.260
Now that your site is set up there's briefly talk about WordPress security and also how to install WordPress

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.030
plugins which add additional functionality to your site.

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.180
So first thing in terms of keeping your site secure.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.460
One of the best things that you can do is just come into updates here in the sidebar and just make sure

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.420
that you have the latest version of Wordpress WordPress are constantly updating the software just to

6
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.820
prevent against any hackers or spam.

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.020
So the best way to stay protected is just to check that you have the latest version of Wordpress and

8
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.070
you can just check that here.

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.410
If you see a little notification to install this you can just click the button and go ahead and install

10
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.900
it.

11
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.420
And there are other things that you can do to protect your site.

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.800
And one is to install some plug ins with additional security feature.

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.750
So if we come and the plug in section here plug ins really allow us to add additional functionality

14
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.590
to our site.

15
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.650
And it's one of the key benefits of setting up a Web site with wordpress because you can really add

16
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.010
so much extra functionality very easy.

17
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.890
In fact if we come to the Wordpress dot org site we can see under plug ins here that there are about

18
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.980
50000 extra plug ins which we can easily just on into our site we can see how many people use them etc..

19
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.860
Now I want to show you a plug in that you can use to add a little bit of extra security to your site.

20
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.810
But before we do that we can actually go ahead and delete some of these plug ins that are pre-installed

21
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.880
on our WordPress site.

22
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.100
Now plug ins do take up a little bit of space on your side so if you're not using them it's probably

23
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.330
recommended that you delete them.

24
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.230
So for example we can see that this jetpack and hello dolly are by default installed on our site.

25
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.420
And what we can do is actually Firstly deactivate any plug in that we don't want first and then when

26
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.420
we can go ahead and do it select them and delete them.

27
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.620
So this is the process no matter what plugin you are using you can install them delete them test them.

28
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.120
And it's very easy to add them in.

29
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.890
Now in order to find new plug ins you can just click on Add new and then you can come up to the search

30
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.360
bar here if you want.

31
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.580
You can also see some plugins are featured here and there's also some of the most popular ones here

32
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.780
as well which you can come in and you can have a look at really what they actually do.

33
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.900
And if you think that's a political will to you you can just go ahead and install them very very easily.

34
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.530
Now I'm going to show you how to install a plug in.

35
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.290
And this is one that will just help a little bit with security.

36
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.200
It's called log in lockdown and it should pop right up.

37
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.220
And what we can do is go ahead and just install this.

38
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.760
Essentially what this will do is limit the number of log in attempts from a given IP range within a

39
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.100
certain period.

40
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.180
So say if somebody was trying to hack your site they're just putting a script on to try a load of different

41
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.220
passwords.

42
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.940
Will this little plug in.

43
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.570
We'll lock them out of the side for an hour so that they can't hack in.

44
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.780
So you need to do is click install and then we can see it's been installed.

45
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.390
If we come to our list of installed plugins.

46
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.630
We can see that it is here we need to activate it.

47
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.190
And that's all we really need to do to add that extra security in.

48
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.050
Now what you can do also is adjust the settings if you want to become to settings log in lock.

49
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.480
Then we can see that the number of failed attempts before they retry.

50
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.270
We can change that if we want.

51
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.270
How long they're locked out of you can adjust those settings easily.

52
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.700
For this plug in and for any plug in the very same way.

53
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.470
Once you download them are just going to leave it as it is.

54
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.340
It's that simple plug in and they no need to adjust the settings.

55
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.870
So that is how you add some additional security to your site.

56
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.720
Remember just to make sure you're always updating to the latest version of Wordpress you can add in

57
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.410
a slogan like log in like lockdown and you can also at any other plug into your Wordpress Web site.

58
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.440
In the very same way.
