00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,700
In this video you're going to learn why you should be focusing on building up an email list as a priority

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,750
and how it is actually the biggest asset that you're going to have as a business or personal brand.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:20,430
So you can see I have an email list here and essentially this is a list of emails for existing or potential

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,150
customers.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,860
Now why would I bother to do this.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,240
Why is this fall unable.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,040
Well with this list I can notify them every time I send out a blog post that gets trafficked to my Web

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,740
site any time that I've a market research survey for want to figure out what products to sell.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,530
I can e-mail the my e-mail list and help and ask them what they want and that really helps me reduce

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,030
the risk and create a positive product that people are actually going to buy.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,440
I can reengaging existing customers and say hey you know you bought the last product.

12
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,190
Here's another one that would really suit your needs as well.

13
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,120
And it's not just me that is saying that building an e-mail list is important.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,740
It's actually this great article seven experts on why building an e-mail list is so important.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,790
Neil Patel here a well-known marketer and he says Out of all the channels I've tested as a marketer

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,780
e-mail continually performs most of them not only does that have the highest conversion rate but as

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,610
you build up your list you can continually monetize by pitching multiple products et cetera.

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,230
It's a great example just look at e-commerce sites like Amazon.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,280
One way they continually get you to buy more products from them is e-mailing you offers on a regular

20
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,270
basis so perfect example for it.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,080
It's perfect for e-commerce.

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,900
You bought this why didn't you have a look at this.

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,820
You know so for a blog for an e-commerce site for services business it doesn't matter what type your

24
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,930
business is you have an email list is going to be your biggest asset because it can drive traffic and

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,040
sales and that's good.

26
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,220
And I think that was one of the good well known here.

27
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,200
Noah Kagan another very well-known marketer as he says after you wake up in the morning what's the first

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,160
thing you do.

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,020
I know it's for me it's checking email I'd have to agree to that.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,190
I check my emails first thing in the morning as well.

31
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,150
And he's a seven figure business and 90 percent of their revenue comes from e mails.

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,390
So if that rings true for you you check your e-mails a lot.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,060
I definitely read all of my e-mail subject lines even if I don't open them and I look at this a lot

34
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,170
more than I do personally in social media because there's so much content on social media.

35
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,280
And that's the maybe file reason you want to build up an email list as essentially an insurance policy.

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,980
Because on Facebook there is so much content being submitted that Facebook have to filter content and

37
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,150
so they're only going to show the most highly engaged content in someone's news feed.

38
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,990
So even if you build up an audience on Facebook you make a post.

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,930
Not everybody is going to see your posts because Facebook have to filter it and there's just too much

40
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,520
content they have to protect.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,880
The experience of the user not so with an email when you send an e-mail it's going to hit the inbox

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,030
of everybody on your list whether they open it or not they're going to see as an on on platforms like

43
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,770
Facebook.

44
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,790
They might not even be aware that you've created a post.

45
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:26,160
So in terms of visibility as well just the email is just trumps all of the other platforms because they

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,270
have to filter and contact that content is just too much there.

47
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,460
So if your content is not getting a lot of engagement your followers are not going to see it.

48
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,730
And that's why email is so so valuable it's still extremely useful to use Facebook and other platforms.

49
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,640
But just in case they decide to change the rules they limit the filter the content even more.

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,480
You might even get kicked off Facebook for breach of policy terms you could get kicked off amazon for

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,890
breaching their Terms of Service.

52
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,370
It happens and you don't want that to happen to you.

53
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,630
You have no backup plan.

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,530
And that's why even if you don't plan on sending a lot of e-mails it's just an a great insurance policy

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,730
to have an e-mail list built up that you fully control and that you can use to send e-mails and reach

56
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,040
your customers directly.

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,690
So hopefully us convince you why building up an email list is so important it's going to be the biggest

58
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,960
asset you have.

59
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,920
You can use it sell products drive traffic to blog posts drive traffic to YouTube videos get responses

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,960
to market research surveys.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,150
It's a fantastic asset to have.

62
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,220
Whether you are a personal brand or a company you need to focus on this as a priority to build this

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,730
up.

64
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,090
It's key to really growing your business.
