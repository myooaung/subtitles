00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.160
Now the first two steps to setup your very own Web site is firstly to get web hosting and then to register

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.300
your domain name.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.940
Now Web hosting would really allow you to store your Web site online so that people can access it all

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.330
over the world on your domain name will be for example your company name dot com and that's your web

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.660
address.

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
So people really know where to access your site.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.010
So there are plenty of places where you can complete these two steps.

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.040
But I would recommend Blue House dot com.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.290
They are the company that I use personally.

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870
They've never let me down.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.750
And also I've organized a pretty cool discount for you guys if you want to check it out.

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.700
The link is in the description you get a free domain which will save you about 15 dollars and then you

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.860
can also get a 60 percent discount on your web hosting.

14
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.970
So in the first year you'll probably save seventy five dollars if you click the link in the description

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.690
but you can feel free to use any web hosts you want and the steps that are going to walk through in

16
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.440
this video are pretty much going to be exactly the same.

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.210
So either click on the link and you're going to come to a page like this and then you can click get

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.770
started.

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.690
Now and then we need to select our web hosting plan.

20
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.540
And there are a couple of options here but I think for most people you're just going to going to select

21
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.960
the basic plan that's two ninety five per month with the discount and that means you can host one Web

22
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.870
site online.

23
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.210
Now the only other option you might be considering is the plus plan.

24
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.400
So for a little bit more you can have unlimited Web sites and host them.

25
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.320
And why would you want to do that.

26
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.240
Well maybe if you're thinking of setting up a couple of Web sites or maybe even you're creating Web

27
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.090
sites and managing them for people then this is a very affordable plan to select.

28
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.070
But I think for most people you're just going to want to be selecting the basic plan.

29
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.520
And I do want to explain a little bit further now.

30
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.880
Why do you even need web hosting in the first place if you've never set up a Web site.

31
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.280
It's a bit of an alien concept because we just post stuff to Facebook YouTube for free.

32
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.670
And actually those companies absorb that hosting costs themselves.

33
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.040
They have to pay for data centers with servers on them.

34
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.850
And so unfortunately they won't pay for it when it's our own site.

35
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.630
And that's why we have to pay for it.

36
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.890
Essentially we're buying here a little bit of space on a server in a database somewhere.

37
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.760
And that's why we pay when we set up our own Web site.

38
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.030
And we never pay when we upload TGP etc because they really cover the costs.

39
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.570
So I think I've had people find that explanation helpful.

40
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.090
And so now that you understand why you need hosting I think you know the plan to select go ahead and

41
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.550
select this basic plan here.

42
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.170
Now here comes the exciting part.

43
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.650
We need to get our free domain.

44
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.610
And so what you really want to do is think about your business name and type it in here.

45
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.330
So in terms of picking a domain name I would try and keep it as short as possible less than 20 characters.

46
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.800
You want it to be something that rolls off the tongue easily.

47
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.830
So if you set it in conversation they would remember that that was your web address and it's more important

48
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:25.540
to have a domain name that is brand able and memorable rather than a domain name that has loads of your

49
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.550
keywords in them.

50
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.350
Because actually having keywords in your domain name is not going to really help you rank in the search

51
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.080
engines.

52
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.170
It might give a clue about what your business is about to try and include them if you can but don't

53
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.400
have like 10 keywords stuck together.

54
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.000
People are never going to remember that.

55
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.410
They're never going to type that in.

56
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.020
So you wanted to keep it as short as possible.

57
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.060
So if you're creating a new domain you can type it in here or you also have this option if you've bought

58
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.240
a domain previously to go ahead and sign up.

59
00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:06.320
So I'm going to just put in WP So WordPress setup demo and then we get to select our domain ending.

60
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.660
You can see now it's on Dakota UK and I would try and get the dot com if you can if it's available.

61
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.530
That's what people remember the most it seems like the most trustworthy.

62
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.460
They don't have to think about what's the domain ending.

63
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.560
And but there are other options out there you can see them here at dot org is very popular for charities.

64
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.240
Darko is becoming more popular as well for startups and new companies.

65
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.940
But for now I'm just going to buy the dot com and then click next.

66
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.280
So now we need to go and fill out our account information.

67
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.710
So I'm just going to take a couple of moments to fill this all out.

68
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.080
So once you fill out your account information then you just want to review your package information

69
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.020
and you can see by default here there will probably be a couple of options selected by default.

70
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.970
So I'll just explain what each of these options are and then you can decide whether you want to leave

71
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.740
them enabled or not.

72
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.500
So the first one is main privacy protection.

73
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.640
So what is this about.

74
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.180
Well the reason you might want to keep this is because there is a site called who is dot com and I'll

75
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.180
just put in an example site here.

76
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.690
Growed stars dot com.

77
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:24.430
And on this site people can find as the phone number and the email that you would have put in when you

78
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.580
registered your domain name.

79
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.820
Now a lot of people though want that information public.

80
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.630
You might get a couple of random emails or maybe even a phone call.

81
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.310
So some people say like this domain is privacy protection options so they don't get that.

82
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.120
Now personally I don't mind if I get a random e-mail so I can save myself really a dollar just by doing

83
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.560
that.

84
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.430
Now site back a pro this is an option maybe you should leave enabled.

85
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.750
Essentially what this will do will backup your sites especially if you've a big site with a lot of content

86
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.720
on it and you may be changing content you may be editing the code something like that something breaks

87
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:12.820
on you need to get your backup version so that you can get your site back up and running for this demo

88
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.480
site that setting up I'm not going to select that but I think that is a good option for a lot of people.

89
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.170
Now site security again there's more information there.

90
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.090
Am I going to show you a couple of things to do to secure your site so you don't need that option.

91
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.890
Then once you're ready all you need to do is type in your payment information which I'm going to take

92
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.820
a minute to do now.

93
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.220
OK.

94
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.600
I've typed in my payment information there and then you just want to select.

95
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.000
I've read the terms and agreements and click submit.

96
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.980
OK so great.

97
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.760
Our purchase was successful and a confirmation has been sent to our email address.

98
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:58.470
Before we can log in as it says here we need to create a password next step then is just go ahead and

99
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.630
insert a secure password and it'll give you an indication of how strong that is.

100
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.870
So I would recommend you try and make that strong so your side stays secure and then you can just say

101
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.410
I've read the terms and agreements and click Next so they'll give us the option here to pick a theme

102
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.080
what we'll actually do is just skip this step.

103
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.930
Okay we're all done.

104
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:27.000
Now I am getting a notification here that they will update my domain automatically as soon as it's ready.

105
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.330
So that's good to know.

106
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.670
You might see a similar notification and then we can just go ahead and click start building.

107
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.650
So here we are now in the back end of our brand new Web site.

108
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.950
And if you want to take a look at what it looks like just come up to welcome come up to visit site and

109
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.370
we can see that this is what our site is really looking like now.

110
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.800
It's pretty basic so far not a lot of content on it but we're gonna be making this really look incredible

111
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.480
and adding content to it.

112
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.020
But that really wraps up the first steps to setting up your site.

113
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.680
Registering domain name getting hosting and installing WordPress.
