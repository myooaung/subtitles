00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,830
In this video you're going to learn how to set up e-commerce tracking in google analytics so you can

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:11,200
measure the number of transactions on revenue that your Web site generates.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,020
And the first step to setting up e-commerce tracking is to come down into the admin section of your

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,100
Google Analytics accounts come up into e-commerce setting.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,820
Just click to enable e-commerce and enhance e-commerce reporting and click save.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,470
And that wraps up the first step to setup e-commerce tracking in Google Analytics.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,540
Before we move on to Step Two let's just take a minute to explain the difference between e-commerce

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,470
and enhance e-commerce reporting.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:47,440
So coming into the developer guide here for Google analytics we can see that e-commerce tracking really

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,440
allows you to measure the number of transactions and revenue that your Web site generates.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,780
Now enhanced e-commerce reporting will really give you information about user interactions as such as

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,750
product impressions product clicks viewing product details adding a product to the shopping cart initiating

13
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,750
checkout process transactions and refunds.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:17,350
So that really goes beyond just the basic transactions and revenue and gives you a whole load of information

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,160
about the user's behavior leading up to the purchase.

16
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,140
So that is really the difference between e-commerce and enhanced e-commerce reporting in Google Analytics.

17
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,980
The second step to set up e-commerce tracking in Google Analytics is to add the tracking code to your

18
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:42,640
Web site or app to collect e-commerce data and send it to Google Analytics.

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,950
Now the great news is is that if you are using an e-commerce platform like Shopify or Magento you don't

20
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,920
need to do any additional steps here.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,640
They have built their platform so it's very easy to send not e-commerce data.

22
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,530
All you'll need to have done is really enable those reports and you're going to see that e-commerce

23
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,030
data in your Google Analytics reports.

24
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,960
So what I suggest you do is if you're using Shopify or Magento or woo commerce or another shop system

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:25,870
like that is to go ahead and check their help center to see the easy steps to really send that e-commerce

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,100
data to your Google Analytics account.

27
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:37,870
Now if you're not using a shop system like that you have to manually add in the e-commerce tracking

28
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,910
code to your Web sites and to complete this task.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,830
You need to be comfortable with editing HDMI all on coding in JavaScript or have help from an experienced

30
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,220
web developer.

31
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:00,130
So this is the type of additional code that you need to put into your Web site in order to track that

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,500
e-commerce and data.

33
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:09,250
So if you're not familiar with coding javascript and hatred UML than history look for a freelancer to

34
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,090
do this for you.

35
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:16,800
This is a fairly standard thing on all you need to do is find someone who's familiar with your shop's

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,890
system.

37
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:24,490
So what I'll do is put this developer guide in the description if you want to go through this detailed

38
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,710
guide and implement those steps for yourself to add the tracking code to your Web site or app.

39
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,900
Now the final step to really set up e-commerce tracking is just to come into your Google Analytics account.

40
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,540
Once you have completed those setup steps and just verify that it is working.

41
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,160
So where you're going to find these reports is under conversions e-commerce.

42
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,670
Once you have those setup and it's collected data for a couple of days then you'll be able to see things

43
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:02,350
like know how much revenue and conversion rates the order value the top products etc. In all of the

44
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,030
e-commerce reports.

45
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,340
So that wraps up the three steps to set up e-commerce tracking in Google Analytics.
