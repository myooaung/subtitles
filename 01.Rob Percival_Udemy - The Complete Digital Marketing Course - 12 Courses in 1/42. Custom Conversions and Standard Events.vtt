00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.140
In this video you're going to learn about custom conversions and standard events and how you can use

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.040
them to optimize campaigns for conversions.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.160
Remember that once you've got the Facebook pixel installed you can use it not only to create custom

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.280
audiences but also to optimize campaigns for conversions.

5
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.590
So if we come back into our ads create tool you can see here that there is an option for a marketing

6
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.850
objective for conversions.

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.960
And the reason that you would want to use this over just traffic is say you were sending traffic to

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.160
your website under this marketing objective.

9
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.100
You're not really optimizing those people to say sign up to your email list or to buy a particular product.

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.270
Whereas if you choose the convergence marketing objective and you've got the pixels set up then Facebook

11
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.090
is going to optimize and really help you meet that marketing objective rather than just traffic.

12
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.100
So it's a small shift but it's extremely important.

13
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.410
And if you want to drive more convergence is a little bit more work that you need to do with the Facebook

14
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.370
pixel.

15
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.040
The best way to probably go through this is come into the ads create two unbiased click on conversions

16
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.910
a walk through the process.

17
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.230
So I selected that as my marketing objective and now I can see here that I'm choosing a Web site where

18
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.670
I want to drive my conversions and now I need to really set up a conversion.

19
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.490
I need to tell Facebook what is the outcome that I want them to really drive with my Facebook ads so

20
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.140
I can just click on set up conversions here and here we see the two methods in order to do this.

21
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.170
And the first is custom conversions and the second is standard events.

22
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.710
So why are there two different options here.

23
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.400
What are the differences between them.

24
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.740
What we can see appear in this article.

25
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.360
It kind of breaks it down pretty well.

26
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.300
So custom conversions.

27
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.370
There is no extra code required.

28
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.320
They're usually much easier to set up if you're not comfortable working with code.

29
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.570
Then I would just recommend you use custom conversions.

30
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.910
However you have to just be careful in terms of setting them up and there aren't as much flexibility

31
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.930
and accuracy.

32
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:29.330
If you use them but by far and for most people this is more than sufficient to set it up with standard

33
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.720
events.

34
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.130
There are some advantages you can customize parameters aggregate reporting and they're much more compatible

35
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.510
with dynamic product ads which custom conversions are not.

36
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.840
So that's a big difference in terms of e-commerce businesses you're going to be using the standard events

37
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.320
for almost everybody else I think you'll be fine with the custom conversions.

38
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.870
So if we come back into the odds create to set up for this conversion tracking Let us just start with

39
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.180
the custom conversions the easier option to set this whole custom conversion tracking up.

40
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:15.770
So what we can do here is put in the URL of the page where people lie and when they have completed the

41
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.340
conversion.

42
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.990
So that could be the check add page or the purchase complete page.

43
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.950
In my case here I'm going to give you an example of measuring and optimizing a campaign her e-mail sign

44
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.640
ups.

45
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.730
So for my web site I have a thank you page that people reach once they have it.

46
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.750
My web site.

47
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.820
So for example they could click to download this PTF once they've gone through that process.

48
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.910
They're going to end up on this page here.

49
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.050
Thank you download.

50
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.140
And I want to measure how many people hit this page because that's really the outcome that I want people

51
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.230
to do if they've reached this page.

52
00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.020
I know I've already got three e-mail address and that's a new lead for me so I can use it in terms of

53
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.570
the world contains.

54
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.680
And that covers the top page plus all the variations of it.

55
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.020
I could also pick a specific you are l if I wanted in terms of the category and I'm just going to put

56
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.270
this as a lead and click next.

57
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.330
Now I can enter a name for this custom conversion and set a custom conversion value as well for an e-mail

58
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.690
sign up I'm not going to put down a value but for other product pages you might want to do that.

59
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.740
And then I can really set that up.

60
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.610
Now I've already got set up some just not going to go in there but if I click now down into this you

61
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.430
can see the e-mail sign up button.

62
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.200
And that's really the conversion that I'm driving towards.

63
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.160
Now one thing that you do want to do is when you've set up this custom conversion you can come back

64
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.610
in to your odds manager open all the tools you can click on custom conversions here and you just want

65
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.530
to make sure that this conversion is active and that it is tracking correctly.

66
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.340
Now let's go back and quickly talk about the other option for setting up conversion tracking which is

67
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.500
using these standard events.

68
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.410
Now as we said you probably aren't going to need to use this if you're in e-commerce.

69
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.060
And we want to do dynamic product that's that type of stuff.

70
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.490
The scenario here is slightly different.

71
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.650
You need to set up this tracking on your Web site.

72
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.570
And these additional pieces of code.

73
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:41.220
So for example let us say that we have this same code here for the same objective which is to track

74
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.060
the leads I need to take this piece of code and put it on my web site.

75
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:53.430
So for example here is the page him mail for the same clanky page that I showed you if I wanted to add

76
00:05:53.460 --> 00:06:00.810
in this tracking code I'd come down as to where it says Facebook pixel code and then I'd come down underneath

77
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:09.900
where it says here have BQ track and I'd pop this new current code in under neath it and that would

78
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.810
allow me to track conversions of people reaching this page.

79
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.560
So it's the same process as we saw before and just repeated over various different things that you want

80
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.130
to track and different pages that you want.

81
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.290
So I'll include these links in the resources section of this video so you can look at it in more detail

82
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.130
if you do want to set that up so that you understand that in order to track conversions with Facebook

83
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.990
ads you need to set up either custom conversions or standard events.

84
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.250
Go ahead and set it up for yourself following the steps that you've learnt in this video.

85
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.650
And don't forget to really check that everything is working by coming back into your custom conversions

86
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.850
tab in your ads manager.
