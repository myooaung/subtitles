00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,970
In this video you're going learn about business manager what it is why you would need to use it and

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,660
how to get set up.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,160
So what is business manager.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:16,140
Well it's a free tool from Facebook that really allows you to stay organized and have good business

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,220
hygiene.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,540
It allows you to manage Arcanes pages and people who work in them all in one place and it's completely

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,980
free as well.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,400
So who would need to use business manager.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,230
Well let's start by defining who wouldn't need to use business manager.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,800
So if you are a Facebook page owner you're the only person working on that page and you're also the

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,930
only person running ads in the attic and attached to that page.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,500
You're probably not going to need to use business manager.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,660
All you need to really do is understand what it is.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:58,380
Now if you want to become a freelancer or you want to hire freelancers to work on your Facebook ads

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,410
or you have employees working on various Facebook pages in a case where you're going to be working in

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,460
an agency with their business manager is going to be a tool that you will use on a daily basis.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,460
So it's important you're really familiar with this.

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,960
So why would you need a business manager.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,830
Let's look at some of the more detailed scenarios here.

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,560
So you need more than one account.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,230
If you want to create separate accounts for every client or business that you serve it allows you in

22
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,270
business manager to do that and you can pay for ads with different payment methods and organized by

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,690
objective for reporting.

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:42,480
You also need business manager if you want to request access to pages or accounts and you want to do

25
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,850
that if you've clients.

26
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,340
So you can get access to their pages and that accounts and run ads on behalf of them by becoming an

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,290
analyst or advertiser.

28
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,530
You'll also need a business manager to assign permissions to a lot of people working together so you

29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,560
can assign specific role based permissions to otic hands pages and other assets that your business manager.

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,860
So you might have people working on your team.

31
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,260
You want them only to be an analyst and analyst analyze reports it could be another person on your team

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,980
who is an actual advertiser and sets up campaigns and run them and has some control over the ad spend.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,220
So Inside Business Manager you can really assign all of those rules and permissions.

34
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,180
And finally a business manager will give you a business novel insights and reporting he can get a full

35
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,990
view over 200 different pages and that accounts out one.

36
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:40,230
Now if we come down here we can see a couple of images giving us an overview of a business manager a

37
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,030
kind and this one is good to look at because it's full.

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,880
Right now you can see there's a ton of applicants down here at the bottom.

39
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,750
So a little bit blurry.

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,880
I know but this is just to give you an idea.

41
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,710
You can see all of the pages added into this business plunger kind of the top ones some alerts and things

42
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,190
to look for.

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,660
You can see the rows and permissions being organized here are going to show you had to do that ton of

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,260
employees all different responsibilities.

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,810
And finally here we can see some of the audiences created in those can be managed there as well.

46
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,790
So how do you get started.

47
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,230
How do you create your business manager.

48
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,010
I can't.

49
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,620
Well the first thing that you want to do is make sure that you're logged into your Facebook page.

50
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,660
Once you've done that this is your personal profile.

51
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,430
Then you just need to click on Create it can't.

52
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,560
And this is where you give your business name.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:37,320
So if you are say a freelancer just working for yourself and you want to take on clients you can just

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:44,460
put it in your own name here or your personal name if you've come up with a name for that digital agency

55
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,760
you can pop in the name there or if you were a business like a normal business cycle like dot.com you

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,190
would just put in like there and click continue and really follow the steps.

57
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,730
Now once inside what you're going to see is something similar to this.

58
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,230
It might be empty if there's no pages or otic hence added in yet.

59
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,690
And that's the next step that you want to take.

60
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,120
Once you've created your business mind your account you want to start to add in any of those pages that

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,820
you're going to be working on any of those out I can say you'll be working on and any of the apps that

62
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,640
you might want to be working on as well as show you how to do that.

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:29,550
Now what you want to do is come up to the right hand side here and click on business settings now this

64
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,320
is where we can add rules and permissions and all that stuff.

65
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,520
I'll show you how to do that.

66
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,520
But for now you just want to start by adding in any Facebook pages that you have.

67
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,160
So once in here you can see I've just got one business page in this business find your account right

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,800
now.

69
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,660
I can come up to the right hand side here and add anymore.

70
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,280
So there's really two main options here.

71
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,240
One is clean the page so if your business already owns a page you can just claim this or if you need

72
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,830
to own it.

73
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,990
For example if another company created it for you you can claim the page and it moves into your business

74
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,810
manager can't as well as this.

75
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,000
You can also request access to a page.

76
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,900
So if you wanted to work on behalf of somebody whose Facebook page run ads for them you would request

77
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,630
access to it so you could really run ads on behalf of the client.

78
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,350
The page will still belong to them.

79
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,700
You just get access to it.

80
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,040
So these are the two different scenarios you can see people who own a business use business manager

81
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,580
people who want to work for the business and do freelancing and agency work for them.

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,310
Also used business manager it's the midpoint between those two and really allies and people get access

83
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,660
without handing over full permission.

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,020
So that's the first thing that you would want to do inside business manager claim the page or request

85
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,690
access to a page.

86
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:58,980
You can also create a brand new page in here as well now as well as adding a page in what you also may

87
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,470
want to do is add any apps into business managers so similar to the other options.

88
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:12,060
If you own up and want to start advertising it you can add it in here if you want to start advertising

89
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,080
on behalf of other apps.

90
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,450
You would add them in here.

91
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,950
It's the same process again really add new OPS Clayman up.

92
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,590
Your business will control the source that it moves it into a business manager or request access to

93
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,960
an app and that really allows you to use this asset on behalf of another business.

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,320
Now one thing is if you want to use the apps on moving into biz Niger you need to really have the app

95
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:46,770
I.D. and you get that by the by really registering and configuring an app on Facebook for developers.

96
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,690
So that's a first thing that you need to do if you haven't done that already and then you can move it

97
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,130
into business manager.

98
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:00,210
The key thing about a business manager is even if you have created a Facebook page through your own

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,990
personal profile when you move it to business manager it's almost like creating a business entity like

100
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,700
a company.

101
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,950
It's not directly connected to you.

102
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,200
Like as if you were a sole trader it's putting it up into a separate entity and that allows people to

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,380
access it like employees or external people.

104
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,740
So that's the key benefit of it.

105
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,350
Now the great thing is is that you can always come back to your business manager any time is well inside

106
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,850
of your odds manager.

107
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:36,440
You can just click on the dropdown and you can also come up here and click on business manager here

108
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,840
and you'll be brought to the screen.

109
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,410
I remember that all of the activity is here under business settings and you might even want to bookmark

110
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,580
that page so you can access that easily in the future.

111
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,320
Now you understand what business manager is why you would need to use it.

112
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,650
Go ahead and create an account for yourself if you need to use it.

113
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,570
Following the steps that you've learned in this lecture.
