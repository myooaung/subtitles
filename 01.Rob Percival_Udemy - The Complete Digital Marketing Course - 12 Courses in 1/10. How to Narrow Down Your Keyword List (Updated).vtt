00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.220
In the last lecture you brainstormed for keyword ideas and put together a list.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.620
Q It's here in your keyword research template.

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.920
Now what we want to do in this lecture is look at point nine hundred checklist which is really to narrow

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.150
down your keyword list.

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.780
We want to get one step closer to the end of the process here which is to really have your chosen keywords

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
which will be the centerpieces of your content.

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.040
So how do you start to cut end this list and identify those keywords.

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.780
Well what we can really do is really assess the keywords on two criteria.

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.650
One is the search volume so how many searches per month in Google do the keywords get.

10
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.020
That'll help us identify which of these topics are the most popular and also which of these keywords

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.160
are the most popular.

12
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.570
Because we want to create content where there's interest the thing where we don't want to happen and

13
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.300
spend a lot of time writing something figuring out that actually only 10 people a month search for that

14
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.630
would be much better off invest in the same amount of time and energy into a keyword that maybe gets

15
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.070
a thousand searches per month search volume then is the first thing that we're going to look at.

16
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.700
And we're also going to assess really the commercial intent the the business value of certain keywords

17
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.550
and when we can do that using cost per click data as a guide I'm rating on explain how we're gonna do

18
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.840
that and a real example.

19
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.690
So we can use two different tools to find that it's information in Google Q or a planner here and the

20
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.520
Google everywhere chrome extension.

21
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.790
Let me get started with the keyword every or google keyword planner.

22
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.170
Essentially the process is going to be the exact same we just take our list of keywords pop it in here

23
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.940
and we're going to get our search volume and cost per click data.

24
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.850
Now the google keyword planner tool is actually a tool that is part of Google AdWords Google AdWords

25
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.440
is the platform and the advertising platform of Google.

26
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.640
So people use this tool advertisers really use this tool to identify the search volume on cost per click

27
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.680
data of keywords.

28
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.500
But for us we can use the same information to help inform our as you know decisions.

29
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.070
Now once you arrive into the google keyword planner tool you'll be faced with that this particular screen

30
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.880
here.

31
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.200
Now one thing to note is when you do sign up to Google AdWords you can do it with a gmail account.

32
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.040
It's absolutely free to do.

33
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.500
You may see that you are being asked to set up a campaign you don't need to do that.

34
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.700
You can actually skip through that process.

35
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.540
It's like a button at the top of the button to do that.

36
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.420
Many want to be really coming into tools and keyword planner.

37
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.570
If you've any trouble with that at all.

38
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.160
Don't worry so much because we can do essentially the same thing in this keyword everywhere extension

39
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.030
tool.

40
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.280
That's an alternative.

41
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.660
One thing that I did want to say is you can use the keyword planner tool actually as a brainstorming

42
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.960
tool as well.

43
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.420
So we're going to get the search volume here in this dropped in but we can use it for brainstorming

44
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.070
as well.

45
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.060
Essentially the exact same way.

46
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.320
You can just type in the keyword and click get ideas here and you'll get a whole list of similar suggestions

47
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.930
that we saw before.

48
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.900
The reason that I didn't want to start your key we're brainstorming here is that you can see a lot of

49
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.240
the terms are very closely related.

50
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.730
And so it's more natural to maybe start in something like Wikipedia where you can really get broad see

51
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.420
the broad connected categories because a lot of people everybody's essentially during their brainstorming

52
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.100
here looking at the same keywords.

53
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.900
So you have an advantage if you start outside of this tool.

54
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.530
With that said let us come down to the search volume here.

55
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.550
All we're gonna do is really copy our list of keywords.

56
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.570
We've already got on pace those in.

57
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.400
We can also take our list of topics as well.

58
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.610
I'm just gonna paste these in because I want to get a sense of of the topics that I have which is the

59
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.380
most popular where should I maybe focus my attention.

60
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.350
I'm just going to edit this slightly because this will show you these search volume for the exact terms.

61
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.340
So nobody's gonna be searching for search engine optimization in brackets SEO.

62
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.220
So just on a split that I was and also the same thing with CRM

63
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.980
so once I've got my list of keywords there now I've got a couple of targeting options here.

64
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.950
The main one is probably the location.

65
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.590
If you're a business that only serves a particular country you can set that up.

66
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.790
For example if I only had a product shipped to the United States and I only want to look for the search

67
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.320
volume there I can just add that in and click save.

68
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.680
You can see that that's now going to only show me the search volume data for this particular country.

69
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.540
Now as I have a more of a global business customers can come from everywhere.

70
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.450
I'm just going to leave that off.

71
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.150
So remove that and then click save.

72
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.500
Now I'm going to get the search volume what I can see here now is a list of the keywords the average

73
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.730
monthly searches and also the suggested bid which is essentially that cost per click data.

74
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.710
What I can do is maybe organize this this top to bottom in terms of the average monthly searches and

75
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.110
to do that I can just click on this column here.

76
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.390
No no surprise for me that I can see out of all of the topics the search engine optimization is essentially

77
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.800
the biggest one.

78
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:55.660
And after that we move then to some of these social media market e-mail marketing etc. so that can give

79
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.800
you a very high level view of OK where is the interest between my different topics.

80
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.830
Now as we move down the list I guess where we want to focus most of our attention is identifying those

81
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.640
longer tail keywords that we found and seeing the difference between those and I think the range you

82
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:20.290
want to stick with is maybe between five hundred searches per month and maybe two thousand two thousand

83
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.640
five hundred.

84
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.620
I think they aren't going to be as competitive.

85
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.500
They're going to deliver not enough search volume.

86
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.500
Now I can see that some my list is being hidden here so I might extend this idea to 50 rows and I can

87
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.400
start to see it.

88
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.570
So it's good for me to know something like As check has to sign up 900 searches per month.

89
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.210
I think that's kind of within my range even moving a little bit further than campaign marketing as you

90
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.190
ought to check in is kind of similar 480 searches a month so these are keywords that I'm starting to

91
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.460
like and what I can see as well is that advertisers are paying for these keywords.

92
00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:04.030
So if advertisers are paying five dollars and two cents or euros cents per click then I know this is

93
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.710
a valuable keyword for my business.

94
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:12.210
I can see a sort this list by what advertisers are paying for it.

95
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.430
And I can see that some of the most valuable terms no surprise something like ICAO agency because people

96
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.510
have their wallets out there ready to buy when they're typing in the term like that into google.

97
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.980
Remember the buyer funnel that we looked at.

98
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.060
These guys are right at the bottom they're ready to spend.

99
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:37.330
Whereas if I look at the least valuable terms here something like local search webmasters free course

100
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.940
anybody who types in a free course is not going to want to buy a course.

101
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:47.830
So advertisers are not really spending on that on something like local search.

102
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:54.780
You can even type any keywords into Google if you're not quite sure what they're talking about.

103
00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:01.000
So local search you can see there is one out there for it's somebody spending money on that.

104
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.210
They're spending let's see 78 cents but you can see a lot of it is quite general and broad and maybe

105
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.970
there are those people are not quite far down the buyer funnel essentially you want to assess then the

106
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:19.810
keywords based on average monthly searches and suggested bids and you can do essentially the exact same

107
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.670
thing with the keyword everywhere chrome extension.

108
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.320
Take the same list what you can do is really instead of pasting it into the google keyword planner you

109
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:37.990
just click on the icon here in your browser you can see that there is a place to paste in the keywords

110
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.730
you can take the keywords from your list.

111
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:49.240
Copy those in and paste those in and you can get the search volume and cost per click.

112
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:56.580
Now the one caveat with this tool is that it doesn't do the location targeting as well.

113
00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.150
You can't change your settings.

114
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:06.370
I'll show you how to do that but it only really shows search volume for these different countries for

115
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.860
the moment I think you're adding a lot every single time.

116
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:15.250
But the targeting is much better in the google keyword planner tool you can narrow it down to specific

117
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.290
cities even.

118
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.590
So that's essentially the one caveat that there is between the tools.

119
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.000
So have a look at those two different tools that the keywords that I'm starting to like now are these

120
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.160
ones within the 500 you know the range the couple that I pointed out there.

121
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.030
So what I'm going to do is essentially come to my checklist here.

122
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.710
I can take the information straight from here so I'm actually just going to copy this back in

123
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.770
and essentially I want to add this information in here.

124
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:57.700
So let me take this copy this pace is in there the search volume.

125
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.280
Copy all of these here for you in one rows.

126
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.790
I can just paste this back in here.

127
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:10.770
Now you can see I've got these search volume etc. delete this row don't need.

128
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.470
And I can start to look at the keywords that I particularly like.

129
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:21.330
So looking at some of them I'm just going to highlight some of these here.

130
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.140
I'm actually going to highlight the uh.

131
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.730
There we go.

132
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.430
Easier to see.

133
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.520
Best practices.

134
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.160
That's kind of an interesting one checklist 2016.

135
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.150
Interesting for Web sites.

136
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.830
So there might be some discrepancy between these tools in terms of search volumes.

137
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.360
I think a size 13 and the keyword planner these tools aren't 100 percent accurate.

138
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.160
None of them are you can really use them as a guideline as the audit checklist is another one I like.

139
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:57.510
So now I'm starting to narrow down my list based on these search volume and I suggest you do the same

140
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.710
units really highlighted here in your keyword research template.

141
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.890
Next up we're going to move to the final step in our keyword research process.

142
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.560
Choosing our entire target keywords so I'll see their.
