00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.940
In this video you're going to learn how to set up an app installed on Google onwards.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.110
So once inside your outwards it can't want to come down to the campaign's tab and then click on Add

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.350
an ad or a new campaign.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.220
Then you want to select the campaign type we want to come right across to the right hand side here and

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.520
click on universal app so we can drive up and Stoll's across Google's networks.

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.790
Then we need to select the mobile platform.

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.460
So for example would just select Android and you want to look up your app so we can just type in the

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.500
name of the Ophir or just select one if you have one on your accounts and then go ahead and click continue.

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.190
Now you need to go ahead and put in your campaign name and then once you come down here in this section

10
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.770
you're going to put in the copywriting that's going to appear on your.

11
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.870
And right now we can see a preview of what it's going to look like on the right hand side here.

12
00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:01.290
So as you change the text we'll be updated on the right hand side and we can also see how this is going

13
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.330
to appear on the different places in Google's network.

14
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.360
So on Google search we could see looks like this then the display network on YouTube and then in the

15
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.180
play.

16
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.690
Google Play store as well.

17
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.060
Now coming then we can select the locations where we want this app and so to appear.

18
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.290
We can see like countries different cities that we can select different languages.

19
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.660
Here and campaign optimization then we can focus on either getting install of ops or some Inuk in app

20
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.070
activity and depending on the choices you will make here that will show you whether you're focusing

21
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.110
on new installs or in app activity.

22
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.710
Now moving on now we set our bids and so we can put the bid in and then our daily budget as well and

23
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.290
then we can set our campaign dates and then once we're done we can go ahead and click save and continue.

24
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.730
Now the reason that I would recommend app install ads on Google outwards is that you only pay when somebody

25
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.820
actually goes ahead and installs your app.
