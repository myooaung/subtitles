1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,850
In this video you're going to learn how to select your campaign type.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,180
And this is the first step to set up a campaign outwards.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,260
So what you want to do is go ahead and log into your outwards accounts come command to the campaigns

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,650
tab quickly.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,380
Plus button and click new campaign.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,480
Now as I said this is the first decision I'll make.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,110
And you can see that there are five different campaign types.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,210
So I just want to run quickly through each of these at a high level so you have an understanding of

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,890
them and then we'll select the ones who we can really go through our example campaign.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,770
So firstly we've got our search network and this really allows you to reach customers interested in

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,950
your products or services with text as you're probably already very familiar with seeing this.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,740
These are the ads that appear at the top of the search results.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,830
They're just text ads and pretty simple.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,140
Now next up you've got the display network and this allows you to run different kinds of ads across

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,910
the web.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,720
So this is really a key part of Google's advertising platform that not only can you appear underneath

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,290
to search results but they've also partnered up with a ton of sites so that you can advertise on those

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,640
sites as well.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,690
So here's an example of one of those partners sites that is allowing Google to put ads on their Web

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,560
site.

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:26,440
It's called W3 schools and you can see here is an ad from Google on their Web site.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,690
Now today they put this.

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,370
They allow Google to put this side here because they get a cut of the ad revenue.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,430
And you can see that this format of this ad is a banner ad which is obviously different than to the

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,100
text that's just here.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:48,540
Now if we click this open you can see that you can advertise your business all over the web but add

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,630
words an earn revenue from your web site with ads sense.

28
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,240
So you may have heard of ads sense before and this site would have got set up with ads and so that they

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,250
can earn revenue from Google advertising platform in terms of for you.

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,770
What is the benefit of this.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,230
Well you can really put different types of ad and not only put them on the search results but also in

32
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,260
sites that maybe your customers spend a lot of time on.

33
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,110
Now coming back to our campaign types we've also got shopping ads promote your products with shopping

34
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,900
ads.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,800
So if we look at this you can see the format of these ads are quite different to just plain text.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,310
You have got the pictures here.

37
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,650
And this really goes right down into the private pages.

38
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,940
We've also got video ads.

39
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,720
And primarily this will be ads that you can put on YouTube.

40
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,860
It's all done within the same words platform and campaign set up process.

41
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,070
So for example here's an example of one of those ads on YouTube that just is on top of the video before

42
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,420
it starts.

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,410
So you T-bonds can be set up in here as well.

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,440
And then we've also got up and saw.

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:07,780
So these are these ads will for the most part appear in other people's apps which is they've got a similar

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,950
process where they have a partner apps where they advertise in kind of similarly to how they do it with

47
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,920
their web sites and the display network.

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,140
Now for this example we're just going to pick the search network it's probably the simplest one to get

49
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,060
started on.

50
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,540
And you can see that there's options to drive sales leads and Web site traffic.

51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:36,800
And we're just going to click web site traffic that we want to put in our business web site so I just

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,070
put it on the Web sites and click continue.

53
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,430
Now the cool thing is is that you can go through this process with them just to experiment yourself.

54
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,310
You can go right to the end of the process and you won't need to put your credit card on until you actually

55
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,210
want the ad to go live.

56
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,730
So even if you're not sure if you want to advertise just yet or exactly how it would work I would just

57
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,090
encourage you to come in and set this campaign up so you can really give it a go.

58
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:13,460
Now we can just put this as test campaign what we can do is we can just select it so appears only on

59
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,910
the search network and not also on the display network.

60
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,210
So we want to really keep this as a search only campaign.

61
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,530
And for now we'll just leave it at that.

62
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,260
But that is the first step to really set up your outwards campaign to select your campaign type.
