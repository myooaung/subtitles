00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.330
In this video you're going to learn how to get insights out of your audience reports in Google Analytics.

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.040
So firstly to access them just come into the sidebar here you can click on the audience section and

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.660
let's get started by looking at the demographics overview report and the success of any business really

4
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.400
depends on understanding who your potential customer is.

5
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.730
And a key part of that is really understanding their age and gender.

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.620
So in this report we can really see a breakdown in the ages and the age ranges of our Web site visitors

7
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.460
and also the gender split as well.

8
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.980
So in this case we can see that a significant amount of the Web site visitors.

9
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.470
Thirty six percent and the biggest kind of age bracket is really between the ages of 25 and 34.

10
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.130
And also we can see that the there is a heavy split towards males and even of that age.

11
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.310
So what is this.

12
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.180
What can we do with this information.

13
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.300
Well we can really focus in on that particular age group on that particular gender if we wanted to grow

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.630
our business because obviously they are the most active.

15
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:24.030
And so if we can appeal to them more in our products in our content in our advertisements then we can

16
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.010
really grow the business quite quickly and it's great to come in here if you're thinking of advertising

17
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.960
on Facebook or any other platform to really put in these in this age range and gender because all of

18
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.580
those platforms will require you to do that if you want to get the best results.

19
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.800
So coming into Google Analytics and seeing this here is really invaluable information.

20
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.740
Now just to note that in order for you to get this age and gender information in your web site or in

21
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.370
your own reports you want to just enable this in you or Oddbins section.

22
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.770
So if we come into the admin section and we come into property settings you just need to come in and

23
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.880
make sure that this is enabled your demographic and interest reports and coming back into our audience

24
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.020
reports.

25
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.910
Let's come down now into the interests overview report.

26
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.860
This can be pretty high level stuff sometimes but it can just be interesting to get a look into the

27
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.870
interests of your audience.

28
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.960
What are some of the things that they like and this can give you some ideas about maybe some related

29
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:45.020
products that you could create or maybe businesses in related but non-competing industries that you

30
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.670
could start to partner up with in order to appeal to that same audience so you can see some of it is

31
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.240
pretty high level but even just to get a sense of who are the audience and what are their top interests

32
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.290
that can really help spark some ideas.

33
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.650
Now let's move on then to the geographic reports.

34
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.410
And these are often some of the most interesting reports that you can start to dig into so we can see

35
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.560
that English is the most popular language.

36
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.010
61 percent.

37
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.510
And so if we were creating ads or content where we can continue to do it in that language if we saw

38
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.490
another language where there was a significant amount of users go completions then we could maybe start

39
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.360
to create content to better serve that audience in their native language.

40
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.750
If we come down into the location report then once again we can see the top locations of our Web site

41
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.720
visitors for an online business you might not be too concerned with this if you're selling a digital

42
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.740
product.

43
00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.540
But if you were a local business or you were a national business with retail stores then you'd really

44
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.720
want to see where are the cities that are hitting your Web site the most.

45
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.080
So you could pretty Make sure to serve those customers in that city better.

46
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.400
You could open up more retail locations hold events etc. where if you're an e-commerce store then you

47
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.000
really want to make sure that I was able for example to ship easily to India that the fees in terms

48
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.310
of shipping or not too expensive.

49
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.490
Maybe look at ways to reduce those fees if there were some in order to better serve those customers.

50
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.680
And again this information is just invaluable if you want to build a profile for your ideal buyer that

51
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.030
you can then use in advertising.

52
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.040
Now moving on then let us have a look at the behavior report and the new and returning visitors can

53
00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:01.460
give us an insight once again into our audience people who are visiting for the first time or that are

54
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.010
coming back again and again.

55
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.730
So in this case we can see 81 percent of our visitors are new visitors so maybe there is an opportunity

56
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.730
to really increase the number of returning visitors.

57
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:21.140
Maybe thats by building a bigger email list and if we had a content site we could make sure that we

58
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.770
email them every time we released a new piece of content or maybe even an e-commerce site building that

59
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.950
email list again and emailing them when you have new product releases or sales in order to try and encourage

60
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:42.510
those existing customers or email subscribers to keep going back to the site living on then then we

61
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.580
have the technology reports and again these are extremely useful to look at and really understand what

62
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.620
are the devices and the browsers that are audience are coming to our side on what we want to do and

63
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:05.880
maybe a quick check here is to have a look at the buy in straits and to really look at if there were

64
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:14.400
any browsers where there were is a much higher than average percentage of bounces so we can see here

65
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.620
apparent Minni.

66
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.950
Its only 1 point to 4 percent of our total number of users but there does seem to be a little bit of

67
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.120
a higher bounce rate up here in Safari.

68
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:34.020
There does seem to be this is seventeen point seventy four percent of our users over the last seven

69
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.840
days.

70
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.600
And there does seem to be a much higher balance rate here so maybe thats something we could investigate

71
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:47.220
test web site on that browser to make sure that everything was working okay coming down to the mobile

72
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.150
report.

73
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:56.040
Then we can really see the split in terms of whether people are accessing our website on desktop mobile

74
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.260
or tablets.

75
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:04.380
And we can see here that there is actually quite an even split between desktop and mobile and tablets

76
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.130
out of those up.

77
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:14.180
Some sites are heavily geared towards desktop like online trading site like it used to be.

78
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.740
They have a lot of desktop users.

79
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.760
And so if youre asking people to link off and check this check data.

80
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.610
It's going to be easy for them to do.

81
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.660
If a lot of people were accessing a mobile that's not going to be easy to use.

82
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:33.090
So again just understanding how low your users are accessing your site can influence a lot of decisions

83
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:40.650
you make about the design of the site the content and even how you target them once again in advertising

84
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.590
and looking down at the benchmarks report says can be pretty interesting as well.

85
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:53.910
We can really see how our side is comparing versus the benchmark of people in our industry which we

86
00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:00.690
can select here and which we will have selected when we set up our Google Analytics account so we can

87
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:07.140
have a look at it in terms of our different channels how we might be performing against the average

88
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.660
of people in our industry and that's based on the average of people using Google Analytics and submitting

89
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.090
their analytics to Google.

90
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:22.980
So that can be pretty interesting in terms of seeing how you get traffic to your site versus maybe some

91
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.140
competitors for example.

92
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.220
This is an e-commerce schottische is a shopping site.

93
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.600
You can see that in terms of referral traffic and organic search.

94
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:41.810
We are significantly higher than the competition and were significantly lower than the competition in

95
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:50.070
the normal channels maybe for e-commerce traffic which would be paid search or general advertising.

96
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.990
So that's just interesting to note.

97
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.100
It's it's just interesting to get their perspective on how other sites are laid eyes and maybe some

98
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:06.090
of the marketing tactics that they're using as an industry to see how that compares against how you

99
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:13.050
are you really getting those maybe similar users to arrive at your Web site so that you know how to

100
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:20.460
get some insights of these audience reports come in to your Google Analytics account and have a look

101
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.640
at this information and ask some of those questions that we've been asking in this video.
