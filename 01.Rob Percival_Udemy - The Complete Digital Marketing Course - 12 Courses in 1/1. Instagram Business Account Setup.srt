00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,230
In this video you're going to learn how to create a business account on Instagram.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,990
And this is the first step to using Instagram as a powerful marketing tool to grow your business.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,060
So the first thing you want to do is download the Instagram and to do that you can just open up any

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,880
browser type and download Instagram up.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:26,730
It should pop right up and you can get it absolutely free on iPhone or Android or any other device.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,360
So once you've got the app downloaded you want to go ahead and then open it up and what you actually

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,960
want to do here now is log in with your personal Facebook profile still see this option here continue

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,020
as your name and you want to go ahead and click that.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:48,350
And then once we're inside our personal profile we can add up to five business accounts so and the click

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,770
the option to continue with my facebook account.

11
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,190
Then you want to go ahead and click open click on your icon in the bottom right hand corner to open

12
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,560
up your personal profile and then inside your personal profile you want to click on the settings gear

13
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,910
icon and the top right hand corner.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,230
Scroll down.

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,100
And then you click on Add in that case.

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:19,520
Now what we want to do here is go ahead and click on sign up and the bottom of the screen next you want

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,940
to add in a phone number and an e-mail and it's best to make your business phone number and e-mail because

18
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,250
they would need to be different to your personal account.

19
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,980
Once you've out of those you can just click next.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,730
And now you want to add in here your business name and a secure password.

21
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,340
So for this example just put in

22
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:54,810
a fictional business name here and secure a password and then click Next here we can see that we have

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,180
created our account now.

24
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,330
Now you can see that it's given me a business name I can change this if I want which I think I'd like

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:13,680
to do so I can change this to something more like my business name and I can see if that's available

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,600
which it is that little green tick.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,310
So and then then I can just click next.

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,690
Now there are going to be options here to add Facebook friends etc. you can just skip all of these and

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:33,740
we can just click on the top right hand corner we can click Cancel and now we can really come in and

30
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,090
see our business profile.

31
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,840
To do that we can click on the bottom right hand corner and we can see.

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,950
Here is my business.

33
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,030
I can set up.

34
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,200
There is one further important step that we need to take and to do that we can click on the gear icon

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,150
in the top right hand corner once again and you're going to see this option to switch to a business

36
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,340
profile.

37
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,400
So this will allow us to advertise on Instagram.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,090
It'll allow us to get access to the inside sick cetera.

39
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,800
So this is an important step to do in order to access all a lot stuff.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,540
So you can click continue.

41
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,140
It gives you a little bit of an overview of the benefits of switching to business accounts.

42
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,220
And then this is an important step as well.

43
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,020
We need to choose the page to link it to from Facebook.

44
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:31,540
So Facebook owns Instagram now and a key part of that buying when they bought them.

45
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:38,660
They really are now forcing an integration between Facebook and Instagram see need to create or link

46
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,230
a Facebook page.

47
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,320
So it should show up all of the Facebook pages that I've created.

48
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,400
If you haven't created a page you can go ahead and click Create one at the bottom there.

49
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,560
But I've just set up a Facebook page.

50
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,070
You'll see all of the pages you're not been for here you can just select it and then click next and

51
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,270
then you can import once again.

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,480
Your business

53
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,460
e-mail and phone number and this information will be visible to your Instagram followers.

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,470
So it is important to put this in accurately a phone number and address.

55
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:24,890
And you just need to just put it in one click Don.

56
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,660
And then we can go to the profile and there we go.

57
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,990
Now we have set up our business account on instagram.

58
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,140
I know there was a couple of steps in there so you can go back over the video if you need to to set

59
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,580
it up for yourself.

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,640
But the key reason though we've set it up this way is now I can switch between my personal profile and

61
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,130
any other business accounts that I set up.

62
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,740
And as I said you can add up to five business accounts within the one up here.

63
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,480
So that makes it much easier for your workflow day today to set it up this way.

64
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,750
So now that you know how to set up a business account for Instagram.

65
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,110
Go ahead and set one up for yourself or for a client or a company that you're working for.
