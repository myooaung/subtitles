00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:08,700
It's now time to refine your creative on what people really see when they see you are out in this lecture

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,410
you're going to learn how you can pull images from your web site to use as part of your ad hiking free

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,480
stock images from Facebook to Zura and hey you can even use existing posts as part of your ad and there's

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,670
a key and Vantage in doing that.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,690
Now as a reminder we are still working here inside the ads create tool working at the final stage of

6
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:38,170
the creation process which is the third level and the first thing that you'll see here is the option

7
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,940
at the top of the page to create a brand new ad.

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,560
We're using existing posts now.

9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,190
As I said I'll walk you through both of those scenarios.

10
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,340
But the key thing regardless of which option you choose he has to choose an ad format that is appropriate

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,520
for your objective.

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,920
So you can see here that I have a number of different options to choose from and my example campaign

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,770
here.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,340
My objective is to get clicks to a Web site.

15
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,360
And so I want to choose an on format that is really appropriate for that.

16
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:19,120
The best option for clicks to Web site is probably a carousel where a single image not probably a single

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,600
image and just be as simple as people will see the image they click on the image and they'll go outside.

18
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,160
I wouldn't want to choose a single video for this type of campaign because if I choose a single video

19
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,900
people will just watch the video and not necessarily click through.

20
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:43,900
So be sure that you select the format that is appropriate for the objective that you have set up here

21
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,040
in the campaign level.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,890
Once you've chosen your odd format the next step is to start building at UROD and create something that

23
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,980
looks good.

24
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,720
You can see here now for the odd preview.

25
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,320
Nothing is showing up.

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,960
I really want to select the media for sure and that's the next step.

27
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,970
Probably the easiest thing to do if you have a Clix to Web site campaign like I'm setting up is simply

28
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:17,260
just plain your web site you are all on Facebook can really pull the image from that page and show it

29
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,140
up here as part of your ad.

30
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,990
They also pull some of the text from that page and you can see already I'm starting to get something

31
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,300
that looks pretty good.

32
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,290
So that's how you just simply pull the images from the landing page that you were sending people to.

33
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,770
And that was one of the fastest was just create very very simply.

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,090
Now if you do not have a good image on your landing page we do have the option to add images from your

35
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,390
own computer here and upload them.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,090
If you don't have those you can add in free stock images.

37
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,870
And this is a great resource that's built into the tool and really can save a lot of time digging around

38
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,610
trying to find something good.

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:06,730
So how this works is you just simply type in a keyword like business success as I've chosen here and

40
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,470
I can try and find an image that looks appropriate So this one looks pretty good here.

41
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,130
I'm going to and just click Done.

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:22,660
Now one cool thing at this point is you can add in up to six different images at no extra cost.

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,430
What Facebook will do is then test those six different images and see one which really performs best.

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:37,390
So this is something to do a quick split test that you can do even at this stage very very easily.

45
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,260
And I wouldn't worry about this too much but if you're one or two images that you want access to this

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,530
can be good to do at this point.

47
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,030
So that's really how you add in images from your own computer.

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,410
We're using those free stock images.

49
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,910
Now the final option you have is to use an existing posts and there is a key advantage in doing this.

50
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:04,660
The advantage is really that all of the reactions and comments that you've got on your original post

51
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,990
will be shown in the.

52
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,040
And so for example you can see a preview of it here.

53
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:17,110
This was a live video on Facebook that I did it in show biz live now it's being sponsored by.

54
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,980
You can see all of the cards that I got there that gives huge social proof.

55
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,160
If people see that in their Facebook news feed they go hazed a lot of people are interested in this.

56
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,400
You know maybe I'm going to be interested in it as well.

57
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,300
Now a key thing to do is if you are choosing an existing post remember once again to use an ad format

58
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,780
that is appropriate for your objective.

59
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,430
So in this particular case here this is a video and this wouldn't be appropriate for my ad as I want

60
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,570
to get people to click through to my Web site.

61
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,050
But how you can really choose posts and find one that are good is once you've added in your face Facebook

62
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,650
page here you're going to see a list of page posts below that you can choose from.

63
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,360
Click on the dropdown and you can see in terms of the most recent all of the different posts that you

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,310
have put out and this doesn't give you a lot of information about which one you should choose.

65
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:19,470
And so what I recommend is maybe coming into your Facebook page insights coming down to posts sorting

66
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,810
all those posts by reach just by clicking on this here.

67
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,390
It's going to show from the lowest to highest.

68
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:32,370
Click it again shows it from the top to the bottom and I can pick out an appropriate existing post with

69
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,790
the odd format that I want.

70
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,930
That's really going to work in my case here.

71
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,570
Now I'm going to set one up from scratch because none these posts are really I think appropriate for

72
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:49,290
the ad but that is a great option to do if you have existing post or even to think about going forward.

73
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,960
Can I put out some posts prior to a campaign test them out then use them as part of the campaign.

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,120
So in this lecture you've learned how to really select the media for your release.

75
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:10,710
Uploading an image or video from your landing page or website from your own PC using the stock images

76
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,110
or using an existing.

77
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,470
Go ahead and take a few minutes to dig through your own archives or add them in from your web site or

78
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,390
use those free stock images.

79
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,540
And go ahead and try and find images that are bright higher resolution and that really look attractive

80
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,860
and will make people want to click on them.
