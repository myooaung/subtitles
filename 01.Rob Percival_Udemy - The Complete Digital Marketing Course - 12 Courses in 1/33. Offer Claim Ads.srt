00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,140

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:19,950

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,070
Then we will start to look at some examples and some of the copy that you can use for these type of

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,280
odds in order to get better results.

And then I'll show you how you can set up an offer plain for yourself and give you an example of that.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,410
So let's start by understanding a little bit more about Offer play Ahmad's the benefits and the features

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,240
of them.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,700
Well the key benefit is that you can really grab attention with a deal or a discount if you want to

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,300
boost sales in your online shop or off lines.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,420
Shop a discount or a promotion is a great way to really encourage people to act.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,920
It is a tried and proven marketing strategy.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,930
You'll see it when you go shopping.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,570
SALE ENDS NOW this Christmas sales.

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,310
There is after Christmas sales.

17
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,810
There's a limited time frame on these things and there's often a 20 percent or 50 percent off number

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,840
that's shown in the window to really encourage people to act.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,930
So it's a proven marketing strategy.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,210
And now you are able to use it in your Facebook ads.

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:32,210
So let's have a look at some of the objectives for you if you want to use these claim offer ads.

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,910
Well clearly peer to you can reach more people with these offer a reach new people and it allows you

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,570
to call activate new people it gives them a great incentive to take notice of you.

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,810
Now you can reach these new people through interest and demographic targeting.

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,870
You can do it through location targeting.

26
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:58,620
If you are a physical store but as well as that you can reach existing customers with these offers your

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,550
Facebook fans a custom audience Web site visitors your e-mail list et cetera.

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:13,140
And once again the the outcome is Turi and what you want to achieve is to encourage them to take action

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,000
so you can increase your sales.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,260
Now here's one cool feature of these offer claim ads you can send automatic reminders to people who

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:28,460
have claimed the offer and notify them when the deal is about to expire so that they really use it.

32
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,100
That's a great reminder function that is built in as well.

33
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,550
So the benefits of offer Claremont's are very clear.

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,430
Let's have a look now at the Facebook and skite and get a look at some of the copy that you could use

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,520
in an ad like this for yourself.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,300
So here is an example for both desktop and mobile and you can see the text here.

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,930
Enjoy for us pro-Jew starting with a verb before the season ends.

38
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,660
So that sentence is creating a little bit of urgency.

39
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,590
I can see them below in the headline for the odd 20 percent off.

40
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,890
So that is the offer.

41
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,690
And I can see underneath that again it's an expiry date.

42
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,750
So this is a great way to create that sense of urgency as well.

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,340
Not only in the text here but also in the expiration date.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,060
And you can see the call to action.

45
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,430
But News-Wall says get off for reading encouraging people to click that button and making clear what

46
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,620
the call to action is.

47
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,880
Creating a limited time offer for your business is very simple I'm going to show you how to do that.

48
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,910
Now inside the ads create tool which you will find inside your odds manager.

49
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,980
Now when you come in here the first thing to do as always is to set your marketing objective at the

50
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,840
campaign level.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,900
Now you'll see here that a offer claim God is not one of the objectives that you can pick and that's

52
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,930
because actually the offer climat is just a way that you can reach one of your marketing objectives.

53
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,470
So you'll find this option inside traffic.

54
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,850
So getting people to web site with this offer plain you'll find it inside the conversions marketing

55
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,900
objective.

56
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,200
Now remember in order to use the conversions marketing injected you do have to have the Facebook pixel

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,950
set up and this is most likely going to work much better in an online store we can measure that through

58
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,100
the Facebook pixel.

59
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,950
So let's just take the example of traffic and really select this as our marketing objective setting

60
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,000
up the offer.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,310
In either case is going to be the same process.

62
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:52,080
Now you'll see here that we have an offer on not as an option and we need to do is really enable this

63
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,260
select the page that we want to create the offer for and then click on Create offer.

64
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,590
And here you can see the little interface where we are going to create the offer.

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,460
We have a preview of it on the right hand side here and you can also see a preview of the notification

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,460
that a person will see if they claim the offer but haven't used it so that's the reminder notification

67
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,570
function that we talked about at the start of the visit video.

68
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:28,860
Right now there's no image in this offer but we can add that later on in the third level.

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,760
So what we can do in here is just say 20 percent off.

70
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,180
I'll just show you some of the fields that you will fill in here tell people about the offer learn the

71
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:47,790
buyers before offer expires.

72
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:54,630
You can select the end date and the end time which appears here right under your headline.

73
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,930
You can also select where people can redeem this offer and this is how you choose now if you want people

74
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,960
to redeem this offer online or in-store.

75
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,510
So for example let's start with the online offer your l.

76
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:17,280
Now a lot of e-commerce sites or other online platforms where you buy things enables you to put in the

77
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,220
euro with the coupon already in Attash.

78
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,550
So for example I'll take the example of one of my Uni courses here and you can see the inside of the

79
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:33,150
U R L their coupon code is already there so if they clicked on the offer they would be able to go straight

80
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:40,890
to the landing page where they would see the coupon already applied and that would require them to check

81
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,600
out without having manually to put in the coupon.

82
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,630
Now in-store it's going to be a little bit different.

83
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:58,230
You can choose the type of promo code so you can have no code you can have a code at which you can say

84
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,670
20 off now.

85
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,330
And in order to measure the success of this campaign you would have to have a system in your store where

86
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,710
you could note and how many people claim the offer then linked back to your campaign here inside the

87
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,180
ads manager and match up OK I spent this much.

88
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,220
You got this many customers and then you would be able to decide if the campaign was successful or not.

89
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,500
Now for either scenario you can limit the total offers available and you can also prevent people from

90
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,060
sharing this offer.

91
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,740
With this the deal dropped in now and you might want to do that.

92
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:44,040
And if you only want to get a limited amount of offers and don't want to disappoint people.

93
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,420
The final section here is then for terms and conditions and you can see that this shows up if there's

94
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,760
any other important rules here.

95
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,110
If there are things that you this offer does not apply to and you want to specify that this is the place

96
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,530
to do it.

97
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,030
Now if we look at the in-store example you can actually see it here as well because I've created this.

98
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:14,630
So let's just go ahead and create this offer now that offer is created in terms of selecting the audience

99
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,240
for this offer that's going to depend on your business.

100
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,380
Now you could select it for a location and add two particular locations.

101
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,800
You can do the radius targeting if you type in an address here you can use a custom audience any of

102
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,810
DeCosta more answers that you've learned how to set up you can use to save audience from a previous

103
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,260
campaign.

104
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,650
And in terms of all of the targeting and the placements and the budget we've covered that in previous

105
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,460
lectures so not going to go through that again.

106
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,680
I do want to show you just how to add in the image.

107
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,470
Very simple but just to remind you to do this.

108
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:02,060
So come into the library just add any image here and you can see now a full preview of what your offer

109
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,850
is going to look like.

110
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,460
So I can see my headline here.

111
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,250
Some of the text and the call to action button.

112
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,990
So now you understand what offer claim ads are and how to create a limited time offer for your online

113
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,570
or online store.

114
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,930
Go ahead and set one up for yourself.

115
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,690
Following the steps that you've learned in this.
