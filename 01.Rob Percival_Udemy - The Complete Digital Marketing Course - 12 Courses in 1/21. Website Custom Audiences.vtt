00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.520
Once you are out of the Facebook pixel to your Web site you're going to want to start taking advantage

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.210
of it straight away and you can do that by setting up a custom audience based off of the people who

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.800
have visited your web site.

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.000
And this is often known as retargeting or remarketing and a really good use case is to target people

5
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.050
who have maybe added item to the shopping cart but not reached the checkout page.

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.200
And so you can put an ad in front of them and get them give them an offer again a coupon to really finish

7
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.310
that check.

8
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.830
Now you probably would have never had an e-mail address for them see can do it by e-mail.

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.600
So with Facebook ads and this custom web site audience you can really enable that.

10
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.360
Now there's tons of more use cases.

11
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.960
But let's kick it off and really show you how to get this set up.

12
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.080
So what you want to do to get started is come into Facebook Ads manager come up to the top left hand

13
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.690
side here and click on audiences.

14
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.220
Now once this page loads up what you want to do is really click on the button here to create an audience.

15
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.220
And we're really creating a custom audience now as you can see.

16
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.670
You can create a custom audience from a number of different sources a customer file like an email list

17
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.250
Web site traffic.

18
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.400
Once you've got the Facebook pixel set up up activity once you've got the Facebook SDK installed which

19
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.900
is essentially the app equivalent of the Facebook pixel and you can create a custom audience from people

20
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.480
who have engaged on your Facebook page.

21
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.180
Right now we're going to create a custom audience from web site traffic.

22
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.270
Now here again you can see there are a number of different parameters that you can use to create this

23
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.820
custom audience right at the top here.

24
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.020
You can see that you can create a custom audience from anybody who's visited your web site.

25
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.410
And this is a great audience to have.

26
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.190
And you can promote blog posts this Orlean's get them to opt into something and give them your e-mail

27
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.060
address.

28
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.140
Sell products to them or get them to like your page.

29
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.900
Now as you can imagine targeting an audience of people who are already familiar with your web site and

30
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.270
watch your offering is going to be much better in terms of getting results because they're already aware

31
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.600
of who you are.

32
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.350
They are really at that second stage of the funnel.

33
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.920
So you could set up a custom audience just for anyone who visited your web site.

34
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.210
You can also go deeper though if you want and you can target people who visit specific web pages only.

35
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.220
So maybe people who reach a certain landing page if you've got a blog post on a particular topic and

36
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.120
you want to retarget those people with a new related blog post.

37
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.410
You can do that.

38
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.980
You can also come down again and target people who visited specific web pages but not others.

39
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.930
And this is an interesting use case.

40
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.240
Let's open up this example.

41
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.750
For example if you want to return to that example target people who have really maybe looked at products

42
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.460
in our store.

43
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.580
So while we are really doing here is including people in our audience who have visited any web page

44
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.640
that meets the following rules so the world contains store.

45
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:28.620
So for example this would be my site dot com forward slash store for ads slash product A B C D whatever

46
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.300
it is.

47
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.740
So they could have viewed any of the products in your store and you want to include them in your audience

48
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.300
know who you want to exclude is people who actually looked at the product in the store and then actually

49
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.480
went to the checkout.

50
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.950
So we know that the people who reached the checkout page only could have reached there because they

51
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.980
bought the product.

52
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.210
So we want to exclude those people from our audience if we are doing a campaign for abandonment.

53
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.590
Remarketing you can get more specific if you want and include a world that contains exactly maybe a

54
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.500
particular type of product and you can serve the ad back to them contain that product.

55
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.820
So there are tons of options there.

56
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.590
It really is going to depend on the specific goals that you have.

57
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.810
But you can recreate really targeted custom audiences based off your web traffic now for what.

58
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.070
Right and easiest place to probably get started is just create a custom audience that anybody who's

59
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.550
visited your web site you can see that you can set the parameters in terms of the number of days to

60
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.740
that for a smaller Web site.

61
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.360
Might want to make that bigger.

62
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.270
So I'm just going to move this to maybe 180 days and then you're going to put in the audience.

63
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.210
So all

64
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.150
visitors and then you just have to click Create audience here.

65
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.180
Now I can see that my audience is being created right now saying the audience is too small or what you

66
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.710
have to remember is that because I've just installed my Facebook pixel Facebook has only gathered up

67
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.440
those people who have meaning on my web sites since I've installed it they can go back in the past and

68
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.610
pull information out in the sky.

69
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.350
So it might take time for this audience to build up but once it does it's going to be extremely valuable.

70
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.250
So now that you know to set up a custom web site audience go ahead and set one up for yourself.

71
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.190
Following the same steps that you've learned in this video.
