00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.310
Would you like to gather valuable feedback from potential customers without even needing to send out

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.060
a survey.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.380
I'm going to show you three different ways to do this and this will really solve this market research

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.120
problem for you.

5
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.780
If you feel that you can't send out a survey it just isn't something that your audience would fill.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.250
So if you're thinking that this lecture is for you and you're going to have no more excuses.

7
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.410
So the first way to get feedback is actually just go ahead and talk to somebody.

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.390
Yes.

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.810
As scary as it seems talking to people can just be the most effective way to get feedback.

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.860
Now you can call people up or you can meet people in person.

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.760
But the key thing I want to say is that the questions that you'll be asking them are the same questions

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.270
that we have in our survey here.

13
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.400
So this is a basically a script for you to do your market research.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.980
For example I was talking to somebody recently who said hey what's the biggest single problem you have

15
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.840
with your business.

16
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.400
And he said well I've got 18 employees and managing them is a really difficult thing to do.

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.480
And he said I asked him Well what difference would it make if you had a good solution to managing your

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.490
employees and he said what would be fantastic I could really focus on the higher level things in my

19
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.950
business rather than managing them and being also almost a therapist to them which is the opposite reasons

20
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.720
why are them in the first place to hire them to get rid of side source things.

21
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.410
And then I asked them well how difficult has it been for you to really manage your staff more efficiently

22
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.970
so that it's been very very difficult.

23
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.190
Hired even a staff manager.

24
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.330
But then they hire somebody who's poor and then I have to fire them.

25
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.010
So I'm I'm not getting away from this problem.

26
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.800
So that is a pretty serious problem and if I could develop a solution for him like maybe having a more

27
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.130
defined hiring process characteristics people are looking for a culture within the company that's defined

28
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.900
that would be extremely valuable to him so he could hand that to his hiring manager.

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.250
And there's going to be something consistent.

30
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.820
Similarly I could say What's your single biggest problem in your personal life.

31
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.790
You could say well you know what I've got a five month old baby and she doesn't sleep at night.

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.190
Well what difference would it make.

33
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.540
Well if I could sleep I'd be less stressed at home wouldn't fight with my wife and have more energy

34
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.610
for work and I could get better results.

35
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.690
Well that's a pretty good outcome.

36
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.360
And then how difficult that is being very very difficult.

37
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.480
We've tried different books different online courses sleep training.

38
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.120
It's difficult.

39
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.300
So if I can to develop a solution that would solve the problem for him.

40
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.660
There is some very clear urge and pain points some very positive outcomes.

41
00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.600
So if I can do that well I'm going to do pretty well and sell a lot of my course or product or whatever.

42
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.900
So that's number one talking.

43
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.810
Remember you have the script now.

44
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.600
The second way that you can gather feedback without needing a survey is to come into a Facebook group

45
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.750
that you joined that has your target audience what it has come down into the search bar here and you're

46
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.970
going to search for some specific words that are really going to highlight some pain points of the people

47
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.670
in this group.

48
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:37.400
So for example a complaint is a word that you will see.

49
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.280
I've seen complaints here about early requests for reviews.

50
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.990
Now this is a group for you to be instructors.

51
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.490
Basically it's not important for you to know what the problems are.

52
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.090
But this is surface stuff.

53
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.260
A lot of problems that these people have blurry video screens that's kind of you to these technical

54
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.210
problems.

55
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.390
The early reviews system that's these kind of system instructors aren't happy with it.

56
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:09.060
So if I could design a way or at least inform these instructors of how to beat that early requests for

57
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.980
review system or how to record your videos so that they appear the best.

58
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.530
Well I'm going to solve a lot of people's problems and they're going to pay me or at least get their

59
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.050
attention that I can monetize later on.

60
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.000
So that is something you can do.

61
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.420
Complaint Heyse is another word that people time typing here you know that can surface a lot of pain

62
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.700
points as well.

63
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.870
Bottle neck is another great one as well.

64
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.520
That see what the surface is.

65
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.830
But you know what's the bottleneck for people in their business.

66
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.940
Various bottlenecks.

67
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.490
What part of course creation do you hate the most.

68
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.660
I hate video editing.

69
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.960
So again we've got that hate word there.

70
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.560
You've got 19 Commons people saying what all are pain problems.

71
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.480
Points are.

72
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.280
So that's another good work.

73
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.890
You can put in stress is maybe another word as well.

74
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.960
So you can find out what stress in people lives and that's going to surface a lot of pain points.

75
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.570
Then you can find out you know what difference would it make.

76
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.700
Well if I if I can do video editing faster I could make horses faster I could sell more.

77
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.950
And how difficult is it.

78
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.080
Well you're going to get a sense of that from reading the column So again keep these three questions

79
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.270
in mind.

80
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.960
Now the final way that you can gather feedback from potential customers without needing a survey is

81
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.750
to really look at review sites on marketplaces.

82
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.560
Now for example you did me is an online marketplace with a built in review system.

83
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.800
So if you come to any course let's just say the design game design.

84
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.830
Click on the first course here you can see the reviews here and if you filter down to the three star

85
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.380
reviews this usually is good because five star reviews they're not really complaining about much one

86
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.480
star reviews.

87
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.390
Probably too negative.

88
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.810
And really the three star reviews are kind of quite balanced reviews they say some good points and some

89
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.820
bad points so let's just have a quick look at this.

90
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.320
The sand could also be made more orderable.

91
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.520
So that's something they're introduction.

92
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.440
OK.

93
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.160
Is really low.

94
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.570
That seems to be a consistent problem.

95
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.760
Poor sound quality.

96
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.890
OK.

97
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:46.850
Had a program to skip certain lessons so you can come down into the reviews and have a look at what

98
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:54.890
people not like and then you can create a product that solves all those pain points and really gives

99
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.150
people more what they want.

100
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.180
Now where else do they have reviews.

101
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.220
Well if you're a digital product you could come to me and you want to create a course if you have a

102
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.600
physical product you can come to Amazon built in review system there any product in the world.

103
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.690
If you had a restaurant or I was thinking of setting up a certain type of restaurant you can come in

104
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.170
and search you know whatever it is spas in your area.

105
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.020
What are people giving out about what do they not like what are the pain points you can do that for

106
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:35.930
restaurants hotel Trip Adviser also has a built in review system that you can search for the type of

107
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:44.270
business that you are in and to see what people are getting out of bed and not happy about.

108
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.680
Other thing is for say small business.

109
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.450
Google has a built in review system as well so you can check it you know what are people giving out

110
00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.620
abash in these these dental places you can come into their reviews.

111
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.440
Again filter them down.

112
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:09.500
Let's just look at the lowest rating and see what are the reasons that people have given this low review

113
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.880
and them that'll give you some ideas of the pain points that people are struggling with.

114
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:24.260
So to recap in this video what we have done is look at three different ways for you to collect customer

115
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.010
feedback even without needing to send out a survey.

116
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.000
And that was just talk to people and use these three questions as a script.

117
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:37.560
Number two was to go ahead and go into the Facebook groups and search for those keywords like complain

118
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.530
taste bottleneck.

119
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:48.590
And the third way is to look at these review sites and marketplaces which just have an absolute huge

120
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.870
amount of feedback.

121
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.670
And 99 percent of new entrepreneurs ignored us.

122
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:59.930
But you've got the information now so there's no excuse not to get a brilliant insight into the pain

123
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.410
points and the desires of your potential customers.
