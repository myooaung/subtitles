00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.810
If you want to take your Facebook advertising to the next level the Facebook pixel is really the key

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.120
to make that happen.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.440
Now in this lecture I'm going to explain what the Facebook pics the letters what are the benefits of

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.750
it and how you can get it set up on your Web site.

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.350
We'll look at how to set it up on wordpress.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.760
Hi manager and Shopify.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.600
So let's kick it all off by understanding really what the Facebook pixel is.

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.180
It sounds quite technical but it's actually pretty simple.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.820
All it is is a little piece of code that you put onto your Web site.

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.470
And once that piece of code is there Facebook can do these three things that are laid out here and these

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.340
are the key benefits so they can really start tracking your campaigns and measure real world comes from

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.690
your Facebook ads.

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.920
So for example say you set up a campaign to drive tough traffic to Web site because you want people

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.240
to sign up to an email lefse by downloading a PTF.

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:10.350
Now with out the Facebook pixel you can see how many people from that if you tags ended up converting

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.250
and downloading the PD.

17
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.480
But to be much more accurate and just to make the process easier if you install the Facebook pixel on

18
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.140
your site then Facebook will automatically pick up.

19
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.500
Who are those people who actually then went and download the PDAF from the film the traffic that you

20
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.780
received from her at.

21
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.530
So that's the first key benefit is tracking is more accurate than Google Analytics.

22
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.620
Second benefit here is optimization.

23
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.280
So deliver your ads to the right people to get more conversions.

24
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.750
You want to continuing with this same example.

25
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.460
If you do not have the Facebook pixel installed then Facebook cannot optimize your odds for conversions.

26
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.930
They can optimize your odds to get clicks to your website but if they have no way of understanding who

27
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.350
of those people are actually converting then they can't optimize for that.

28
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.310
So with the Facebook pixel you can set the outcome to be optimized for conversions.

29
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.140
And they're really going to get more people to convert or download your PDA rather than just getting

30
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.370
people to come to your Web site.

31
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.490
So a massive benefit because it's driving a more tangible business results.

32
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.130
And the final benefit is audience targeting and with the Facebook pixel you can build audiences from

33
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.600
people who have converted were similar audiences to reach new people.

34
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.530
So for example say that you send people to a Web site and they did end up converting.

35
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.580
You can build an audience of those people who downloaded UPDF and you could remarket them or sell to

36
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.090
them with a product and using that audience who also downloaded the PDA if you could build a look alike

37
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.840
audience using that source audience and to really build from.

38
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.860
So we'll get into that in more details but hopefully in the end the benefits are really clear of creating

39
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.430
the Facebook pics though it's much more powerful in terms of tracking optimization and audience targeting

40
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.060
than just using the built in interest targeting features alone.

41
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.020
So let's get started.

42
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.360
What we need today now that we understand the benefits is start to create our pixel and then to add

43
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.430
it to our Web site.

44
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.890
So let's kick it all off here and click on Create pixel.

45
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.090
So what we are really doing here is creating a pixel for AD account and we can just go ahead and click

46
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.970
next and once we accepted the terms.

47
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.490
Once you've created your Facebook pixel the next step is for you to install your pixel code onto your

48
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.150
Web site and the exact process of doing this will depend on the type of web site that you have.

49
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.930
And the great news is is that Facebook have integrated with a number of platforms.

50
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.400
You can also do this with Google TYG manager and you can do WordPress very easily I'm going to show

51
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.680
you a plug in to get this done very very simply.

52
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.390
Let's run through some of the options and start by looking at this top option here use an integration

53
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.660
or tag manager so you can see that if you have a Shopify store Magento big commers segment Commerce

54
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.320
the process is going to be exactly the same.

55
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.000
Let's have a look at this Shopify example you can just really go and log into Shopify admin panel and

56
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.860
then you just simply need to enter your Facebook pixel ID which you can see here.

57
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.580
So you just want to copy and paste this ID and then you just need to click save and then you come back

58
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.820
to your Facebook Ads manager select pixels and just make sure that this is active and I'll show you

59
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.110
how to do that.

60
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.640
And at the end of this video what you can also do is email these instructions to anybody if to some

61
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.030
of the Nicole who works on your website or does the back end stuff you can just email the instructions

62
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.770
to them and you can also see that she picks the lady shows up right here very clearly.

63
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.010
So any trouble just come into the Shopify you can see the picture of the lady right here.

64
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.310
Let's go back and have a look at these.

65
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.510
There is there are ways to add it to your site quickly.

66
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.200
Let's have a look at one of the other options which is Google tag manager.

67
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.360
Now there's probably no need to set this up just to install the Facebook pixel.

68
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.920
But it is worth taking a minute or two just to explain what the google time manager is.

69
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.850
Because it is something that comes up again and again.

70
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:47.580
And so it's important just for you to understand what it is the way it works is instead of you putting

71
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:55.260
the Facebook pixel directly onto your Web site what you actually do is put one piece of code for Google

72
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.700
type manager onto your Web site and then with Google TYG manager to which you log into separately you

73
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.680
can create a new tag and you can paste the code for the Facebook pixel.

74
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.900
Here you can also see that you can paste the code for all of these other integrations as well.

75
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.770
We show you here Google Analytics Google odd words double quick.

76
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:27.390
All of these are the ones the purpose of this is that by not adding all loads of separate codes to your

77
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.020
Web site you're not going to slow your website down.

78
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.270
And also a lot of people don't have access to the back end of the company web site.

79
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.990
It's only for technical people.

80
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.460
And so through Google type manager you can add these codes without needing access to the back and the

81
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.990
Web site and that prevents a lot of people breaking code by trying to install these pixels and Google

82
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.520
Analytics stuff themselves that they just need for marketing purposes.

83
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:02.550
So that's a bit of a tangent we just went on there but the purpose of that is really just to explain

84
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.900
walkable time manager is it's a way just to put code on your Web site what actually I putting code onto

85
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.310
your Web site if that makes sense.

86
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.590
Now as I said don't set it up if you haven't got it set up already because there are easier options

87
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.570
and will go back to that here.

88
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.240
So probably the easiest option is just to copy and paste the code in yourself and what you will need

89
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:31.560
to do is come back and actually copy this code here and then you will need to paste the pixel code at

90
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.670
the bottom of the header section of every page that you want.

91
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.630
Now the great news is is that you've got if you've got a WordPress site you don't need to copy and paste

92
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.510
this in all the time.

93
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:48.810
There's a simple plug in that you can use what you first might want to do is come down to click on e-mail

94
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:56.830
instructions here and just copy the pixel ID because this is what you need to put into your website.

95
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:02.160
So in order to add this to your WordPress website the first thing that you want to do is download this

96
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.420
free plug in.

97
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:10.950
It's called pixel Kaffeine by Add espresso an only on thing to do is just click on the download button

98
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:19.950
to download the plug and then you come into the back end of your WordPress website and you come in to

99
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:31.740
plug ins you can come into our new and then all you need to do is come into upload the plug in you can

100
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:39.660
come to choose the file here downloads you can see pics of caffeine you just install out once that's

101
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:48.180
activated it's going to show up in the sidebar of your Wordpress dashboard here so I can see pics of

102
00:08:48.180 --> 00:09:01.610
caffeine and then all I need to do is just to set this up and impose my pixel ID then I just need to

103
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.470
come down here and say click save.

104
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:10.640
And then up the top here I'm just going to enable us to make sure that it's active and I'm going to

105
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.420
say this again.

106
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.090
Once you've added the Facebook pixel to your Web site the next step is just to make sure that it's working.

107
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.340
So to do that come back into your Facebook cad's manager click on the top left hand corner here and

108
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.910
you'll see this option for pixels here.

109
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.400
If not just come comment.

110
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.470
All tools under assets.

111
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.590
You're going to see it linked again here and you can just click on that.

112
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:40.520
Coming up to the top right hand corner I can see it's green so it's active and that a signal was received

113
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.450
60 Minutes ago when I set it up so that is perfect.

114
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.140
It's all in place if you want to be extra sure that is set up correctly.

115
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.880
There is another cool tool that you can use.

116
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.900
It's called The Facebook pic so helper.

117
00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:02.860
It is a chrome extension that you just need to download and it'll appear here in the top of your browser.

118
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.480
Once it's set up now the advantage of this is once you log into your web site you can just click this

119
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:15.710
open here on the Facebook pixel helper icon I can see that one pixel was found on my web site so I know

120
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.550
for sure it's definitely working.

121
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:25.460
And this is a great little to not only for confirming it to Facebook pixel is working on your own site

122
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:32.830
but also having a look behind the scenes at some competitors or big companies in your industry.

123
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:41.210
For example I can come into these Web sites and to sleep dot com I can see here in my fix fix Facebook

124
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:49.910
pixel helper icon that there are two pixels fand and I can also see to start to see some of the custom

125
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.260
parameters that they have built into their pixel.

126
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.990
Now this is getting a little bit more advanced.

127
00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:01.020
Again we're not going to go into that right now but this is a great little 2.

128
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.100
If you get heavy into advertising you want to take a look.

129
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.800
Competitors do they have their Facebook pixel's set up you can even do this and check out some blogs

130
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.810
that you follow.

131
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.700
See if they've got the pace Facebook pixel set up it's an interesting little tool to have.

132
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.460
So I just wanted to share it there.

133
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.030
So never know what the Facebook pixel is.

134
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:26.260
Go ahead and add it to your own web site so you can start getting better tracking optimization.

135
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.130
And audiences for your Facebook campaign.

136
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:36.350
I'll put these couple of links to the Facebook pixel helper and the pixel caffeine WordPress tool in

137
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.410
the resource sources of this lecture.

138
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.390
So you can easily access them as well.
