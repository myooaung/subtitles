00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.140
In this video you're going to learn how to improve the performance of your campaign.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.310
And the key way to do this is to really look at the reports and information inside of your odds manager

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.950
here.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.060
When you log in now what you want to do is start asking some questions and digging into the reports

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.530
and pulling those valuable insights out of them.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.860
So one place that you can really start is try to understand which assets or which is really drove the

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.810
results for your campaign.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.880
So as you can see here I got nine real results or Lane clicks from my campaign which is not yet finished

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.720
but that was the objective of my campaign to get clicks to get clicks to Web site.

10
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.480
I can see that in total I got nine here what I want to understand is which of the onsets audience drove

11
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.770
those links clicks on which of the ads that I created drove those little clicks.

12
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.550
So to do that I can just come down two sets here.

13
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.940
And I was I only created one on set for the side all of them have been driven by this U.S. male 25 34.

14
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.120
But if you had a number of sets and hear different audiences different countries different genders etc.

15
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.150
you would see which set performed the best.

16
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.400
Coming then again I can look at which actually drove those results nine clicks in total all of them

17
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.020
were driven by this one.

18
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.120
And here even though I had tested two.

19
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.050
So the takeaway for me here is that this image performed a lot a lot better.

20
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.870
It delivered all of the results for this campaign.

21
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.840
So going forward if I decided to continue with this campaign I could kill this image or really test

22
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.080
some other images in there as well.

23
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.980
So that is a great place to get started in terms of looking at the results from the top level here and

24
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.200
your campaign start to look at which assets are which ads really drove those results.

25
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.370
Now if you want to dig deeper.

26
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.360
A great thing that you can come across to break down here and essentially you're trying to understand

27
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.510
the same thing get down then look at the reports and pinpoint what was the actual variables that drove

28
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.650
the result.

29
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.550
So for example if I click by delivery here I can see what age and gender really drove the results.

30
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.220
If I had those varied one in my answer I could see in terms of placement whether the Facebook news feed

31
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.880
Instagram News Feed the right hand column really drove those little clicks I can even see the time of

32
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.220
day for the viewers frame timeframe that really drove those results.

33
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.970
I can see those broken down.

34
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.960
So what all of that information what I'm trying to find is what really worked on for a future campaign

35
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.100
really refine it build in more of those factors and targeting options to really get better results next

36
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.490
time around.

37
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.810
You can go through these yourself and really even look at all of the different options here.

38
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.830
And if you want to clear them at any stage you can just click on clear all breakdance.

39
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.990
Now a key thing that you probably want to focus on is the cost per result.

40
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.790
That's what you're trying to reduce when you look at the outset and odds that that really worked.

41
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.500
And also that if it factors in the Breynton here but in terms of the cost per result.

42
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.690
In my case the cost per click.

43
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.790
There are other things that you can do to improve this and some of them are listed right here.

44
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.350
So what affects this metric are things like your auction bid target audience optimization type of creative

45
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.600
messaging and schedule.

46
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.590
So these are all things that you could test going forward in particular in my case what I might do is

47
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.670
instead of using and targeting an audience a cold audience using interest targeting I could start to

48
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.030
target people who've maybe already visited my web site who are on my email list and I'm probably going

49
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.890
to get much better results on a lower cost per result.

50
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.840
So that's a key takeaway for me.

51
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.930
I've tested this with a cold audience.

52
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.770
Maybe I can start to test it with a more warmer audience who are already familiar with my brand and

53
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:25.280
in general those type audience has to perform a lot better and result in a much lower cost per result.

54
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.050
So you know how to analyze your reports to improve the performance your odds go ahead and have a look

55
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.630
at them.

56
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.240
Following the exact same steps we've covered in this video.
