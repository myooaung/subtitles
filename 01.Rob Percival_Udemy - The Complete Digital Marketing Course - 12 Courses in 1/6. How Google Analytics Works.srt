00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,430
In this video you're going to learn how Google Analytics works so you can understand how Google Analytics

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,360
collects data about your Web site visitors and how other Web sites collect data anonymously about you.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,300
So to collect data about your Web site visitors and the interactions they have on your site.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:24,030
What you were going to do is add a small piece of tracking code to your Web site and the tracking code

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,850
looks like this.

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:32,190
And once it's set up Google Analytics will drop a cookie into the user's browser for your Web site and

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,830
it will help track every interaction that the user performs on your site.

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:45,540
Now if you live in Europe you might be familiar with seeing notifications about cookies letting you

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,010
know that the Web site is collecting information on about you.

10
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,230
And the reason that you'll see this in Europe is because there are more privacy restrictions and they

11
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,350
really have to tell you that they're collecting information on you.

12
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:05,430
And as you can see here I visited this site and it's saying we're using cookies for analytics but also

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,470
for advertising.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,770
So retargeting and to improve their Web sites.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,890
So there is letting me know that they're collecting this information.

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:22,590
And so this is the type of cookie that Google Analytics will use to collect that analytics information.

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,530
And the amazing thing is is that just this small piece of code that's put on every page of your Web

18
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:36,390
site plus this browser cookie will actually collect a huge amount of information about you such as the

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,980
pages that you visit.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,480
And with this information Google analytics can calculate the most popular page and also determine if

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,880
for example a user reaches the purchase confirmation page.

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,320
Now Google Analytics will also collect information like the language that the browsers set to the type

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,560
of browsers such as chrome or Safari.

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,710
The device an operating system that I'm using and my location age and gender.

25
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,000
And it can even collect the traffic source which brought me to this Web site in the first place and

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,230
that could be a search engine or an advertisement or an email marketing campaign that I clicked on.

27
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,150
So I think it's interesting to look a little a little bit more detail about what these cookies are because

28
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,700
we hear about them all the time.

29
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,950
We see these notifications for what really are they and what really is the way that Google Analytics

30
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,290
is collecting information on us.

31
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,560
So we know that now these cookies are files created by the Web site that you visit and they collect

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
all that information.

33
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,290
But why do we allow this.

34
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,990
Why do we agree to these notifications.

35
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:49,530
Well they really make your online experience a lot easier by saving your browser information with cookies.

36
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,170
Sites keep you signed in such as say Facebook you don't need to reload again every time because it recognizes

37
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,840
you.

38
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,030
And it will remember your site preferences and give you locally relevant contents.

39
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,200
But Walter these cookies actually look like.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,110
Well what you can do is actually come into your browser and I'm doing this in Chrome but the process

41
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,320
is going to be very similar in any browser that you use.

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:22,500
You can come into your settings have a look for cookies on the settings related to those and you can

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:30,210
actually see the cookies that other sites have created and are collecting information anonymously about

44
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,970
you.

45
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,350
So I can see that there are cookies here.

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:41,370
Forgot Google Analytics also here for say Facebook and lots of other sites that I have visited.

47
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,720
So it's really these small pieces of code and text files that are collecting all of that information

48
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,690
that is then filtering on back to Google Analytics.

49
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,670
One important thing to note is that Google Analytics collects this data anonymously so they won't say

50
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,540
that this visit came from da Walsh in Dublin at this time.

51
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,230
What they'll do is with that prize or cookie create a random I.D. to distinguish between different users

52
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,870
whether they're new or returning on what they also do with that I.D. tie all of the activity like the

53
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:23,040
pages that you visited et cetera up into a single visit known as a session.

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,400
So here you can see in Google on makes that over the last seven days there have been 14 times in sessions

55
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:38,540
by 11000 users meaning that a number of these users have come back for another session on the Web site

56
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,580
and that is really how they're able to create these fantastic reports while respecting the privacy of

57
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,340
the Web site visitors.

58
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,780
So to recap in this video you've learned how Google Analytics collects data about your Web site visitors

59
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,360
and you also got an insight into how Web sites collect anonymous data about you.
