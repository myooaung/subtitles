00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,720
In this video you're going to learn how to set up goals in google analytics on why this is probably

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,290
the most important step for you to complete when you are setting up a Google Analytics account so goals

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:20,120
measure how often users complete specific actions on your Web site or app and a goal represents a completed

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,890
activity called a conversion that contributes to the success of your business.

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,790
So for example making a purchase for an e-commerce site that could be a specific activity that will

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,300
really contribute to the success of that e-commerce business.

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,800
Completing a game level is a specific activity that will contribute to the success of that mobile gaming

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,920
app because it shows that people are engaged and potentially then you can get them to upgrade to the

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,450
paid version or just continue to advertise to the users in the mobile gaming app and submitting a contact

10
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:03,590
information form is a specific activity that contributes to the success of a marketing or lead generation

11
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:11,920
site because you can then contact those people by email or phone and market to them or just send that

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,910
blog post to them and can keep them continued continued in the site and grow your audience.

13
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,940
So hopefully now you understand the importance of setting up goals in Google Analytics and I think it's

14
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,460
important to know that if you don't set up goals all you can measure is how many users are coming to

15
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,610
your site and obviously could be focused on growing not.

16
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,060
But if those users are not completing these specific activities that are growing your business and you're

17
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,700
not going to see any growth so that's what is so important to set them up.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,510
And also as you can see now the goals that you set up are really dependent on the type of business that

19
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,520
you have.

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,460
And that's why goals are not set up by defaults and Google Analytics.

21
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,040
That's why you need to go and set them up and tell Google Analytics specific activities that you want

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,570
to track setting up goals in Google Analytics is very simple.

23
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:10,380
What you want to do is come down into the admin section then come up across two goals and then go ahead

24
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,130
and click on Add a new goal.

25
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:20,010
Now you've two options here when setting and free goals you can select from template here or you can

26
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,980
create a custom goal which basically just leaves everything blank and you set it up from scratch but

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,560
I would recommend that you have a look down through this template list here because they've pre fields

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,250
the name of the goal and also the type of goal which I'll show you in a second.

29
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,910
So this just helps speed up the process so you can see there's lots of different types of goals here

30
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,420
that you can select from as just make a payment register on line schedule visit visit donate create

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,360
an account etc..

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,940
So what I would say about making a payment is that if you have an e-commerce site instead of setting

33
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,060
up this specific goal it's better for you to enable e-commerce tracking and I've got a separate video

34
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,780
on that.

35
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,590
However if say you are a business salesman in one or two products or you sell one to one coaching or

36
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:17,910
maybe of course it will be very easy for you to measure how many people complete that action by setting

37
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,960
up a revenue goal here.

38
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,940
So for this video I'm going to take the example of setting up a newsletter sign up and even though the

39
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,940
name is different actually the process to setting this up is very similar to the other types of goals

40
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,320
listed out here.

41
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,990
So just select your goal and then click continue.

42
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,110
So we can see the name of the goal is pre filled and also the type of goal is preselected as well which

43
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,890
is a destination goal.

44
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,000
And as I said the type of goal is actually going to be very similar whether it's an account creation

45
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,480
or payment completed or a donation made or newsletter sign up because what you are really tracking is

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,620
the destination that people arrive at after completing that goal.

47
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,280
So for example a thankyou page.

48
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,780
So if they sign up to my email list they'll hit a thankyou page and I want to track how many people

49
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,320
reach that page because that will allow me to measure how many people completed that specific activity

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,820
that's important to my business.

51
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,630
Now the next step is to input our destination and this as it says here is the app screen name or web

52
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:32,280
page you were all that people arrive at after completing these specific activity that we want them to

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,260
such as making an online payment donation or signing up period Millis and the vast majority cases this

54
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,120
is just going to be a thankyou page like it suggests here.

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,370
And if you haven't got a thankyou page set up in your site just go into the back and set that up and

56
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,830
then paste that in there.

57
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,740
So by setting up this goal what we will know that is every people whose arrive at that Thankyou page

58
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,500
we know they can only of arrive there if for example they sign up to my email list and then I can really

59
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,490
track how many people are doing that.

60
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,250
And there off some off optional options here to add a value or add a funnel.

61
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,380
I'd say for the moment you can just skip that on what you want to do is just re verify the goal and

62
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,840
verify the goal to make sure that it's working should see a small percentage like this.

63
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,190
If you've had data over the last seven days and then you can just go ahead and click save.

64
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,140
So now I can see that the goal is set up and also that it is active.

65
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,950
And also I can see that I've 18 goals left.

66
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,540
So you have 20 goals per for each.

67
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,210
Google Analytics property that you set up.

68
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,700
So although we've set up a goal to track newsletter sign ups the process is almost going to be identical

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,270
for people who register for an account or make a payments or online donation because you're always looking

70
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,010
at how many people reached a specific Thankyou page or check out page.

71
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,640
So to recap in this video you have learned how to set up goals in Google Analytics and also why it is

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,410
probably the most important step for you to complete when you set up a Google Analytics account.
