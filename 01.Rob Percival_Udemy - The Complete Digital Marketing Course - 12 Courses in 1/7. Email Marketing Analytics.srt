1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,050
In the last place she learned how to create an email campaign.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,870
And in this lecture we're going to complete the very important step to actually analyze the results

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,940
of the campaign because this is the key opportunity for you to analyze the data learn from your successes

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,210
or failures so that you can really get better as you go forward.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,070
So there's two places that we're going to look at the data one here is in MailChimp and you can see

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,850
already we can see the percentage number of opens and clicks.

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,080
There's also been a report here we're going to look at.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:42,040
And then also in Google Analytics if you come down to acquisition campaigns all campaigns you can see

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,850
in the information free email campaign that we sent out.

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,180
And remember that this is coming through because we have added Google Analytics to our MailChimp pecans

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,140
So that was why it was important to do that.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,460
So we can really see the number of people that came to the Web site from that email campaign and also

13
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,550
the number of people who eventually signed up.

14
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,360
But let's go back and start with MailChimp.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,790
So with a high level here in the campaign we can see the percentage opens in clicks but we can click

16
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,450
through to the report to see a lot more detail.

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:26,900
Now if you have a professional or pro MailChimp account you can set up a kind of revenue goals etc.

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,980
and really see revenue driven.

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,350
But I haven't done that so and we'll just be looking really at the information here.

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:42,480
So you can get a sense of how good your open rate is but by using these benchmarks here.

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,770
So it says the industry average for education and training which is the market I'm in is at thirteen

22
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,780
point eight percent open race.

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,150
So I'm well above that's obviously a much smaller list but I think that's not too bad.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,640
So I think the key thing that gets people to open emails is the subject line.

25
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:10,410
So at least now I have a benchmark going forward that I can get a sense of you know are my subject lines

26
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,680
getting better or more open them.

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,310
Or are people starting to trust me more and like me more.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,500
Or is that something I need to work on.

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,830
Now we've got the click rate then so that was actually the call to action five point six percent versus

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,190
1.5 percent for an industry average.

31
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,300
So that's probably a little lower than I would have liked.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,200
And so that's what I can really think about.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,980
Now how can I make it more exciting for them to actually click on that button.

34
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,030
Can I make it something you know like they have to click.

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,920
Now if they want to take advantage of whatever the offer might be but thinking about haggling to get

36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,400
more people to click because that's ultimately what I want people to do.

37
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,990
So it's good to see the numbers have a baseline there.

38
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,480
Now looking across I can see that there was one on subscribe.

39
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,450
So one person when they got the email decided to unsubscribe from the list starts.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,710
Only one person out of 71.

41
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,780
That's not bad at all.

42
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,370
Happy enough with that.

43
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,430
Now if you want further explanation on all of these metrics you can see that there's a little icon here

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,690
that you can click around and it'll help explain those more for you.

45
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,010
You also can see a 24 hour performance.

46
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,140
It's not quite being 24 hours.

47
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,680
It's been about 12 hours since I sent the e-mail so I would expect these numbers to Bombo palatal a

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,200
bit over the next few days because not everybody opens the e-mail.

49
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,040
You know the minute it goes that they come back to it later.

50
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,120
But interesting to see not about an hour after I sent the e-mail.

51
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:59,320
There was a spike so maybe next time I will push my e-mail campaigns to be in one hour later and props

52
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,480
and that is a better time where I would get more options.

53
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:10,050
So there's some great information here in this report alone that can help you improve your next e-mail

54
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,150
campaign.

55
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:18,080
For the subject lines getting people to click that call to action the the time that you send it out

56
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,120
etc..

57
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,140
And so as you do more and more campaigns you want to keep going back to this learning from the data

58
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:31,620
now as well as the analytics here in MailChimp you might want to come into your Google Analytics account

59
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,280
under our acquisition campaigns all campaigns and you will see the results here for the actual email

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,790
campaign so you can see that there was five new users came to the site as a result of the mail campaign

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:52,450
spending an average time of three minutes and 43 seconds on the site which is pretty long.

62
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,290
And then actually two people end up signing up for the e-mail list.

63
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,680
So that was the main thing that wanted people to see you can see that all the way from that number all

64
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,780
the way back to the full list of the email subscribers is a pretty small percentage.

65
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,850
But essentially that is kind of the baseline we're working with right now.

66
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,290
And remember that there are a lot of steps in the process to get people to that point.

67
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:27,650
And if you can tweak all of those steps in the process and then are going to get better results as well

68
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:34,130
as email being the source of traffic we can use email and the figures we've got here now as a baseline

69
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:41,570
to compare our other sources of traffic whether it be social media you know wherever at least we have

70
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,550
a great baseline to compare them with.

71
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,220
And so that is really really useful to have.

72
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,970
So that really wraps up this whole section on email marketing.

73
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,710
This is a very important piece of is understanding and analyzing the metrics and that is how you're

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,220
going to learn if you're not quite happy with the results that you got.

75
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,140
Don't view that as a failure view that really as an opportunity to learn.
