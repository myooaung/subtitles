00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,190
In this video you're going to take the first step to use Google Analytics as a powerful tool to grow

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,300
your business.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,550
You're going to set up a Google Analytics account and install the Google Analytics tracking code on

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,900
your Web site.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,340
So the first thing that you need to do to set up your Google on links account is to go to Google dot

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,570
com forward slash analytics and be brought to a page like this.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,070
Then you want to go ahead and click on Start for free.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,500
Now you want to be prompted to do is if you have an e-mail that you used to to sign into other Google

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,060
products like Gmail or Google calendar you can sign in and create your Google Analytics accounts under

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,930
that email.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,050
If you have never used a Google product before then you will just be prompted to create a new account.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,760
And once you've done that you can just go ahead and sign in.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,340
Now once you set up your Google Analytics account the next step is to set up your property and a property

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,650
represents your Web site or app and it's the collection points in Google Analytics for your data.

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:09,840
And inside each Google Analytics account you can have up to 50 properties so you can be tracking up

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,270
to 50 different Web sites or apps under one single account.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,330
So all you need to do is select whether it's a Web site or app and then input the Web site name.

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,820
So let's just say example dot com and then you what I'm put in the Web site you were else.

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,280
So just type that in again

20
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,610
and what you can do then is select the industry category.

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,750
So that's very straightforward.

22
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,540
Just whatever category that you're in.

23
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,110
And then you want to select the reporting time zones.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,940
So choose your local country so that you can see the reports in Google Analytics in your time zone and

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:55,650
not say in another time zone like the U.S. and then you can go ahead and click on get tracking I.D..

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,200
So we're brought now to a separate section here under tracking info tracking code.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,760
And this is where we begin the second step to install our tracking code back onto our Web site so that

28
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,150
we can send information from our Web site back to Google on links to populate all the reports.

29
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,730
Now there are three ways to install the Google on extracting striking code on your Web site.

30
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,410
And the first way is the simplest.

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:30,510
It's simply taking this tracking I.D. unplugging it into the back end of your Web site or the platform

32
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,040
that you are using.

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,460
So if you are using a Web site builder like wakes or Waverly square space or Shopify they have made

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,720
it extremely easy to install this tracking code you just copy this tracking idea pasted in.

35
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,590
And what I would recommend you do to find the exact place to paste that in is to look at their support

36
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,740
guides and they'll take you through it everything step by step is very very simple just copy and paste

37
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,160
this tracking I.D..

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,130
Now if you are using a wordpress site you can get free plug ins to really do the same thing.

39
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,510
Just input this tracking I.D. so to make sure that it's up to date.

40
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,860
I would just recommend that you search Google for free Google Analytics plug in for WordPress and you're

41
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,930
going to find the best one there that you can just use to install the Google Analytics tracking code

42
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,130
very easily.

43
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:30,300
Now the second way to install the Google Analytics tracking code onto your Web site is to actually copy

44
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,600
and paste this code as the first site him in the hand tag of every page that you want to track.

45
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,820
So what you do is copy and paste this code literally into the code of your Web site on every single

46
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,720
page.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,500
And obviously that can be a bit more manual if you've got a lot of it from pages.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,340
But if you've built a site yourself and this is probably the option for you now there is a third way

49
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,310
to install the Google Analytics tracking code on your Web site.

50
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,670
And it's to use Google Tag Manager.

51
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,560
Now Google Tag Manager is a completely separate tool to Google Analytics.

52
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:13,980
But what it does is specifically allow you to add tags like Google Analytics tracking code to your Web

53
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,140
sites without really messing around in the code on the back end of your site.

54
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,980
Now I would recommend this option if you already have Google Tag Manager setup.

55
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,630
But if you are just getting started I think one of these two methods are the best.

56
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,790
But if you're going to be managing a lot of sites or potentially adding a lot of other tags like the

57
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,760
Facebook tracking code on your site then you can go through and watch these videos to really set that

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,150
up.

59
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,450
Now the final step to install the Google Analytics tracking code on your Web site is just to make sure

60
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,430
that it's actually working.

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,970
So once you install it you should come back into this tracking info page and really just check the status

62
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,260
so you can see right now that no data has been received in the last 48 hours.

63
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,550
But once you set it up.

64
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:11,550
If I switch to a different property here I'll be able to see that at their house.

65
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,680
Traffic has been received in the last 48 hours and that there's four active users on the site right

66
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,460
now.

67
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,810
So that really confirms that the Google Analytics tracking code has been installed correctly.

68
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,780
So that really wraps up how to create your Google on a second and how to install the Google Analytics

69
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,730
tracking code on your Web site.

70
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,090
That is the first step to using Google Analytics as a powerful tool to grow your business.

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,250
So go ahead and complete it for yourself right now.
