00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,840
In this video you're going to learn how to create a customer file custom audience.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:13,030
It's an extremely valuable audience that you can use to target your Facebook ads to keep this whole

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,190
off what you want to do is once again come into your odds manager.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,770
Click on the dropdown in the top left hand corner.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,060
We're in audiences again.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,530
Just click on that and you'll be brought to these audiences page once again up here.

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,820
You want to click once again on create audience and click on a custom audience.

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,160
And this time you're making it from a customer file.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,180
So what we're doing is actually uploading our e-mail list into Facebook and then Facebook is going to

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,930
match our customers with the people on Facebook.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,000
So they'll be able to match them by an e-mail address or a phone number or even sometimes a name or

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,830
a combination of those.

13
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,550
No it doesn't have to just be an e-mail list.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,770
It could be for example if you have an e-commerce store and you have those details from people when

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,130
they've bought a product.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,540
So as you can imagine this is an extremely valuable audience to create because it's not just people

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,070
who visited your web site.

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,360
It's actually that people have taken the next step demo to PD.

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:22,610
You sign up to your main mailing list who bought a product so very valuable audience to use to get started

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,470
then just click on customer file on here in order to create this audience and upload your list of two

21
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,450
options.

22
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,920
You just copy and paste the data and they do have an integration with MailChimp so I'm going to go ahead

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,610
and use this option.

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,130
Otherwise you're just really uploading a CXVII file and importing it into Facebook.

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,920
So they're going to click on import from MailChimp if you select this option.

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:56,760
You don't just need to go in and log in then and start to create a custom audience from any of the email

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,770
lists that you have.

28
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,950
Now at this point it's important to say that I'm going to be importing my full e-mail list for my web

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,350
sites.

30
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,360
About 9000 people on that.

31
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,670
If you do want to import just a segment of that e-mail list maybe people who have signed or opted into

32
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,090
a particular e-mail list or people who bought a particular product then you would have to segmented

33
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,630
before you really imported in some way to create an audience of this here.

34
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:35,150
Now I can name this customer audience if I want and I'm just going to put in an email list.

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:44,710
Custom audience and click Next on their And go ahead and click done now what you can see is that it's

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,120
showing up as not ready yet and it will take up to half an hour for the total e-mail list to be imported

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,560
and matched up to Facebook's users.

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,540
Now one important point of note here is that Facebook custom audiences do not automatically update subscribers

39
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:11,530
are added to your email list so you will need to rebuild your audience each time you want to create

40
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:19,450
a targeted OD for them and not that caveat is not just for MailChimp But as you can see if you're just

41
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,710
uploading a CSP file of your e-mail list then you will need to update that or create a new audience.

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:31,510
In order for those additional people to be added one of the thing that you need to be aware of as well

43
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:37,900
is that not everybody on your list is going to be matched up with profiles on Facebook.

44
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:46,000
For example I bet 9000 people on my email list I expect to maybe get about 4000 5000 by 50 percent.

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,690
Much of that is a good guideline for you as well.

46
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,240
Once youve created your customer file custom audience you want to start taking advantage of it straight

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,790
away.

48
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:02,040
So I wanted to give you four cool ideas or use cases for how you could put it into action.

49
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,140
The first thing that you could do is to create a campaign to increase your page likes and to use this

50
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,220
new audience to really make that happen.

51
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:17,230
So you probably have people on your email list or on your customer file who have not liked your Facebook

52
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,050
page.

53
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,150
You can use this new audience to run a campaign with that objective and you can really exclude people

54
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,460
on that same campaign.

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,030
You have already liked your Facebook page you are on the list Syrie to getting targeted.

56
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:38,130
Just people who haven't like the Facebook page and that's going to give you a huge boost in page lots.

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,910
Another cool use case of this custom audience is to extend the reach of your posts.

58
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:51,310
So you probably have people on your email list who maybe aren't opening your emails or who aren't engaging

59
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:57,700
with you at all on Facebook and by using this custom audience you can really reach them there and extend

60
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,230
the reach of your posts.

61
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,390
The turn way that you can use this custom audience is to sell or sell a product.

62
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,400
These people have already joined your email list or they've already bought a product in the past through

63
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,350
an e-commerce store they are going to be a very warm audience.

64
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,280
They're even warmer than people who just visited your website and so the probability that they are going

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,350
to biproduct for you or buy a product similar to the product that they bought is very very high.

66
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,790
So being able to target those people is very valuable and is a great way that you can put this custom

67
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:40,450
audience to work in the final way that you can use this code to monetise is to create a look alike audience

68
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,890
and really target people in your Facebook ads who are similar to your subscribers.

69
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Now I'll show you how to set up a look alike audience later on.

70
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,670
But it is an advantage of even a small email is using it as a source for a much bigger look alike audience.

71
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,170
So then you know how to make a customer file custom audience.

72
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,180
Go ahead and set one up for yourself.

73
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,030
Following the steps that youve learned in this video.
