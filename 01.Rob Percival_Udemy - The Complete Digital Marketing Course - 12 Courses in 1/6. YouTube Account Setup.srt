00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,110
In this video you are going to learn how to create a YouTube channel for your business or for a client

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,420
that you're working for.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,460
So the first step is to come over to YouTube dot com and log in with your personal google account.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,280
So this would be the candidate you personally use to log into your G-mail or other Google products.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:28,720
Now if you don't have a Google account you can ask searching Google create Google like can't.

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:34,600
And then you can create your Google can't open that up and you just fill in the steps there with your

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,990
personal details.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:42,790
You don't fill this in with your company details because you actually create the channel for your company

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,630
here inside your personal account.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,070
So once you're inside you and you sign in with your personal account you want to come then and then

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:58,910
click on settings and down here you want to click on see all my channels or create a new channel.

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,730
Then you can click create any channel and then you just want to give your channel a name.

13
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,670
So I will just put in you to demo and then you just click Create

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,600
and might take a second to load up here.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,070
But there we go.

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,190
Now we have created a YouTube channel for your business or for another brand.

17
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,470
And it's that simple.

18
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:31,840
