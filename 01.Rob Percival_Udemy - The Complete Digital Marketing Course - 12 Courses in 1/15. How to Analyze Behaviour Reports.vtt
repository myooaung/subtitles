00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.670
The behavior section of our Google Analytics kans can tell us a lot of information about how our Web

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.910
site visitors are interacting with our site.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.160
And in this video we're going to look at three of the key reports the landing page report the all pages

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.560
report and the exit pages report so that we can find some opportunities to optimize that Web site experience.

5
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.910
So let's get started with the landing page report.

6
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.840
Now a landing page is a page through which visitors enter your site and you really want to make sure

7
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.100
that the top landing page here is optimized to get people to come further into your site and that could

8
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.740
be to read a blog post that could be to look at a product and out of the card but really want to make

9
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.860
sure that those landing pages that could be receiving up to 50 percent of how people are coming into

10
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.890
your site that they're actually guiding people to take an action and continue on to your site.

11
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.930
One of the best metrics that you can use to assess the performance of your landing pages is the balance

12
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.830
raise.

13
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.590
And if we look at this site comparison tool here and compare these landing pages on Banse raised we

14
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.790
can really have a look and see any of these non-name pages that have a bounce rate that is much higher

15
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.830
than the site average.

16
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.760
Now this is something of a red flag and something that we would want to improve.

17
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.560
We get a significant amount of sessions to this page and so we would really want to investigate this

18
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.170
and see what might be wrong if we click this open here.

19
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.940
We might be able to actually see the page this may be the case that this page is actually broken.

20
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.230
And so that's something that we might want to fix.

21
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.420
It would require a little bit more investigation.

22
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.990
But that is something that we could easily fix so that the experience of people coming to our side for

23
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.550
the first time is better and that we are really getting them to interact with our side further.

24
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.340
Now let's move on to the old pages report.

25
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.470
Now this shows us not only are landing pages but all of the pages on our Web site and a great way to

26
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.520
assess the performance of these pages is to look once again at the site comparison tool.

27
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.830
But this time to look at the average time on page.

28
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.990
And this would really tell us where our Web site visitors are spending most of their time.

29
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.300
Now we will differ if it's an e-commerce site or a content site like a blog.

30
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.700
But really here we can see that they're spending more time in this Baskett page and it's 72 percent

31
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.350
higher than the average for other pages on the Web site.

32
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.090
So what we might like to do in this case is have a look at that page and see how we could speed up the

33
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.980
process.

34
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.110
So they moved to that order completed page.

35
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.520
If this were a blog post we might say well they're spending a lot more time on this page.

36
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.080
That means they're spending more time reading it and perhaps we could create more content like that

37
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.330
in order to keep them on the site longer or to continue reading.

38
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.870
Now let's move on to our final report which is the exit pages report and this will really show us where

39
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.820
our Web site visitors are leaving our site and we really want to get visitors to stay on the site longer

40
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.720
and maybe complete that order.

41
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.940
So we want to plug these gaps so that the they have a better experience.

42
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.740
And once again we can use the same side comparison too and this time we can look at the percentage of

43
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.430
exits so we can see which pages are responsible for more exits.

44
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.940
And once again we're looking for those pages that are higher than the site average.

45
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.830
So we could look at these sites or these pages and really look to improve these.

46
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.150
Now order completed.

47
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.610
It's probably very natural that they would leave the site after completing an order but maybe for this

48
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.380
page that could be improved.

49
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.500
And the way that we can really optimize these pages is especially look at these pages that are performing

50
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.220
well that have a much lower percentage of the exits and see what's happening on these pages had they're

51
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.630
laid out and use some of the best practices there apply them to these pages that account for the largest

52
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.850
amount of exits.

53
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.770
And then we can reduce people exiting our side and once again guide them towards those girls that we

54
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.990
want them to complete.

55
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.380
So as you can see the behavior reports in Google Analytics can give you a ton of information about how

56
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.520
users are interacting with your site and it gives you plenty of insights into things you can do to optimize

57
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.060
that experience and guide them towards completing the goals that you want them to complete.
