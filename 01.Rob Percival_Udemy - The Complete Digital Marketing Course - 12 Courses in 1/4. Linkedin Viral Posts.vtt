00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.400
Connecting with prospects strategic partners referral partners and other business owners should be a

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.890
key priority for you on Linked In.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.710
And in this video I want to teach you a quick hack to really grow your connections quickly.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.790
Not going to walk you through an example of how I saw this done.

5
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.360
It's an excellent strategy and I really wanted to share it with you.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.510
Break it down for you so that you can replicate it for yourself.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.850
And this guy Noah Kagan did it here in this post.

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.660
And it takes a little bit of explaining I think to really for you to understand the strategies.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.640
That's what I want to do.

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.940
Just walk me through it and give you an understanding of how to do it for yourself.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
So essentially this just looks like a pretty simple post here that's got a huge amount of likes and

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.640
comments but really how did this guy know Kagan achieve this.

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.270
Essentially this is a post that went viral on LinkedIn and also got Noah by twelve hundred new followers

14
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.430
or connections.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.730
So how did he do that.

16
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.900
Well as you can see if we look at this article he starts off by establishing a little bit of authority.

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.570
So when you post on Linked-In you want to really show people how you can help and he can do their job

18
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.430
better or how you can help them run their company better and to do that you can start by really just

19
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.890
setting some authority down.

20
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.580
So I helped build the Facebook platform.

21
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.910
OK.

22
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.820
This guy must know what he's talking about.

23
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.630
I spend over 3 million on Facebook ads in my life.

24
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.100
Again that's just another level of authority.

25
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.450
Not just that you helped build it but you actually spent money on it.

26
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440
And then here's the key part.

27
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.310
What.

28
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.540
OK that's fine but what does that mean for me.

29
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.560
Well it's possible to 10x your investment or more you just need to know the right leavers to pull.

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.910
And today I want to share my ultimate Facebook Ads retargeting Jiechi.

31
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.080
OK so you can see that this has been edited and updated so I wanted to explain how this originally read

32
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.020
of what he said is same start here.

33
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.270
Here is the authority.

34
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.880
And here and you can 10x your investments if you know what you need to do.

35
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.180
And then the next line that he had in here which is now deleted was I will send you a cheat sheet a

36
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:28.290
PBF showing you how to 10x your Facebook Ads investments all you need to do is connect with me on LinkedIn

37
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.700
and also like on comments below.

38
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.810
If you do that then I will send you the PBF in a message on LinkedIn which I can do once we're connected.

39
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.430
So that was the exchange that he was asking for there all sent.

40
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.470
I'll show you how to Tenex your investment just connect with me and like and comment below.

41
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.400
So we looked and here we can see that there is over 1200 likes about eleven hundred comments.

42
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.840
So you can just guess then that the number of connections was roughly the same.

43
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.600
But that is a huge amount of likes and cons to get on a post.

44
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.000
He's now getting himself in front of all of these people and also then people who are connected to these

45
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.250
people will start to see this post because it's going viral and there's a lot of engagements on it.

46
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.260
So it's a fairly simple strategy something that you might often see on Facebook or other platforms but

47
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.660
it's been applied here to Linked-In with great success as well.

48
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.090
Now as you can see he's edited it and he said he couldn't keep up with sending all those private messages

49
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.640
with the PTF.

50
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.550
So he's just linked off and giving it out for FREE now.

51
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.920
And there's the idea that he was kind of really promising that he would give away.

52
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:54.910
So it's a extremely effective strategy to grow your connections and to go viral on Linked-In.

53
00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.620
Just tell a little kind of something amazing that you've done in your life and share a cheat sheet with

54
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.310
people so they can skip the learning curve and learn what you've learned quickly and then just ask for

55
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.600
them to connect to you and to like and call them below and email them the cheat sheet.

56
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.420
So that's all you have to do it's a very simple strategy.

57
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.110
But as you can see here in this example it's very effective and it's something that you could do right

58
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.400
away as well.

59
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.510
And to actually create a posts like this all they do is come in and you can write the post there.

60
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.370
I'll even put a link to this in the description so if you want to take a closer look at the language

61
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.030
that you used here you can copy that and use it for yourself.

62
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.560
So that is a little bit Linked-In connections hack.

63
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.260
Go ahead and use it for yourself right now or put it in your back pocket for later.
