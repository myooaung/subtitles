00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,800
In this video you're going to learn how to capture email addresses without needing a Web site.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,690
I'll show you a perfect example of this.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:15,130
Here is a Twitter page you can see that they say in their bio here that they're working with entrepreneurs

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,320
to solve the world's hardest problems.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:25,240
Follow along through our weekly newsletter and then we can see a link actually here to a standalone

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,600
page where we can sign up to their e-mail newsletter.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,660
Now you can see this is not going to their Web site.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,930
It's just a page recone sign ups their e-mail lists.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:41,800
So this is extremely handly handy way to connect or to collect e-mail addresses even if you don't have

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,950
a Web site.

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:48,070
So in order for you to set this up for yourself first do you want to log into your MailChimp account

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,130
and then click into the list that you've created and you want to come and to sign forms and then you

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,050
want to select general forms.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,090
Notes in here that you can design your own standalone page like this.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,450
You can see here that they have edited the list name.

16
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,960
So if you want to do that you'd need to go back to the list and edit it there.

17
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,990
But then in here what you can also do is add or remove any fields.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:24,010
So let's say I didn't need to collect their phone number I could remove it and then click deletes and

19
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,550
that would be remove.

20
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:33,940
Now what I can do is take this link and paste that in my Twitter profile Facebook profile really anywhere

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,690
in content that I've created to encourage people to sign up to my e-mail list.

22
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:45,430
So it's a very handy feature of MailChimp and makes it incredibly easy to collect e-mail addresses even

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,830
if you haven't got a Web site set up.

24
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,210
So go ahead and check it out for yourself.

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,280
Once again you want to come in to your lists.

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,120
Then you want to come in to sign up forms and to do this you want to look at the general form and you

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,270
can edit it in their.
