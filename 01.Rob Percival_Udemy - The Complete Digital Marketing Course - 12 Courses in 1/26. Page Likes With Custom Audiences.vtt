00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.330
In this video you're going learn how you can very cheaply get likes for your Facebook page using the

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.610
custom audiences that you've created.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.660
Now you want to get links for your Facebook page simply because it's much easier to convert people to

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.870
like your Facebook page into paying customers.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.820
They've already taken that step towards liking your brand and they will continue to get relevant content

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.230
in their news feed which helps to build that trust relationship over time.

7
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.810
The key to getting a cheap Page Likes unreal like the costs that I'm getting here thirty three Europe

8
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.310
or sense euros per page like you can see.

9
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.400
I got 46 here yesterday for this particular campaign.

10
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
And the key to getting these results and not just getting Page Likes from people who are not related

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.170
to your business is actually using a particular type of audience and putting those custom audiences

12
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.930
that you've created to work.

13
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.970
So right now you can see it because we're looking at the ad reports on the campaign level.

14
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.930
But let's go down to the onsets level and this is really where the magic is happening.

15
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.690
So you can see that I'm using three different custom audiences in this campaign.

16
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.820
The first one is the Web site because the audience is people who visited my web site in the last 365

17
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.910
days yesterday this performed the best providing 18 page likes for a total cost of twenty eight cents

18
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.440
euros per page like the second audience is the page engagement custom audience.

19
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.170
People have like or engage in my Facebook page but not necessarily like this 17 page likes 30 cents

20
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.970
a page to make fun of the audience their e-mail is custom audience and Page Likes and forty five cents

21
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.110
per page.

22
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.950
Like so I have constructed this campaign to really test these different audiences against each other.

23
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.090
I really want to understand which one is performing the best are people who visit my website more likely

24
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.760
to convert and give me a page like them people who are on my e-mail list and looking at this data from

25
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.740
yesterday the answer would definitely be yes.

26
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.740
So if I wanted to move forward and have this campaign running continuously put a small budget on it.

27
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.690
Maybe I know now that the best way and the most efficient way that I could spend that money in budget

28
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.570
would be to focus only on one audience.

29
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.560
The Web site custom audiences because they are delivering most of the results based on this data now

30
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.650
as well as testing different audiences.

31
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.930
What I've also done in this campaign is to test different routes.

32
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:57.600
So if I move then once again into the next level I have changed the copy for a couple of these and I

33
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.540
really want to understand which one is going to perform the best.

34
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.930
So let's open up the top one here to have a look at the copy that I've written so I have for this one

35
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.220
put in like this page to get student stories on the latest marketing tips new newsfeeds So I'm putting

36
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.800
at the start of this model like this page being very specific and clear on the call to action and exactly

37
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.440
what I want people to do then showing and giving a reason why they should do that.

38
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.480
Now let's move down to the second best performing ad which I think is going to be the same Like this

39
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.540
page now coming down.

40
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.240
Again I can see the other message that I'm testing which is connect to fellow students share your projects

41
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.370
and get feedback from the community so you can see that this copy here although it's the exact same

42
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.490
image does not have that really specific call to action at the start is more leaving with the benefits

43
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.110
says connect.

44
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.390
It doesn't say like this page so I was interested to see which one performed better based on what I'm

45
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.160
seeing here in my particular case from my audience.

46
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.740
It's much more powerful say like this page at the start and that's delivered more results so quickly

47
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:16.390
analyzing this campaign I can see that the Web site custom audiences and this particular ad is performing

48
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.020
the best.

49
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.710
And that's a really cool insight to have.

50
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.750
Now that you understand how you can use these custom audiences to get cheap page lights I want to show

51
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.600
you how you can set this up.

52
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.240
I'm walking through the steps so there isn't any confusion.

53
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.680
When are you going to do it for yourself.

54
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.110
So what you want to do to get started is come up to the top right of your odds manager and click on

55
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:47.200
Create once this loads up then you just want to come down and click on your marketing objective which

56
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:56.710
is really engagement and specifically page likes next do you want to set the Facebook page that you

57
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.160
want to promote.

58
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.630
So was like whatever the page is there then you want to come down and see like the custom audience that

59
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.630
you want to use.

60
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.020
So just click on the box and you can select custom audience here.

61
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.010
And remember that if you want to set up each customer audience and test it against each other you need

62
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.070
to set up three different sets.

63
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.420
So the way that we do this is we set up one that said once the campaign is light then you can really

64
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:32.170
duplicate it and you'll come back in and just change this one box because the audience let's finish

65
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.920
this and then I'll really explain in a little bit more detail in terms of location then you just want

66
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.930
to remove this location.

67
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.680
So that you're targeting your web site visitors from all over the world not just restricting it to one

68
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.340
location moving down again you can set the age and gender as languages as you learn to do in the past

69
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.930
and is currently that open so it can really target as many people as possible terms of interests.

70
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.250
I'm going to remove all of these because I don't want to limit my audience further I just want to keep

71
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.230
it to those web site visitors.

72
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.430
And here is a very important part of this whole campaign and this will save you a lot of money.

73
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.790
You want to make sure that you put in connections here and exclude people who already like your Facebook

74
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.660
page.

75
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.550
You don't want to be putting this odd for people to like your page in front of people who already like

76
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.370
your page.

77
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.860
You want to be removing them so make sure that you do this in this connections section.

78
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.770
Moving down again you have the options to edit the placements.

79
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.660
But for a Facebook likes campaign there really is only going to be the right call him and the feeds

80
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.310
so you won't have to add it there in terms of your budget and daily schedule.

81
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:57.600
Remember that each set has a separate budget so if you want to test three audiences and you want a total

82
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.470
budget to be 15 make sure that you just put in five per cent or whatever the amount that you want to

83
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.660
put in for your campaign.

84
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.680
Shadow once again maybe not run continuously to get started running for a test of a week just to see

85
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.020
how that goes.

86
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.780
He can set that in there come back and make sure that it's just for seven days or whatever you want

87
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:28.330
it to be and you can confirm that really underneath here moving down again you can change any of these

88
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.520
if you want but it's normally just going to be checking that everything is in place and then you want

89
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:41.350
to name your set and you're best off putting in something like the name of your customer audience so

90
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:49.460
that you will really remember is when you see it in your campaign so put in 365 days.

91
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.990
Then you just need to select continue.

92
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.350
And now we're down into the odd level for that odd set.

93
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:02.830
And this is where you select one your page like image is going to look like now by default they will

94
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.720
pull the cover from your Facebook page so you can see it showing up here for me you can change that

95
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.070
if you want to make it simpler using the stock images as well.

96
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.070
And over here in the ad preview you can see a preview whatever you're putting in.

97
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.070
Now in terms of the text you can change this as appropriate.

98
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:33.440
So like this page perhaps and then some of the benefits and reasons why somebody would do that the headline

99
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.740
for the right columns Well you can edit it as you want and then once you're happy with that you can

100
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.270
see this is really what Iran is going look like and see that big like button which is really the purpose

101
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.960
of the campaign.

102
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.240
Many want to go ahead and place your order.

103
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.760
Now once you have placed your order what you can do is go back to the campaign and start to duplicate

104
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.170
the assets.

105
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.160
So let me show you how to do this.

106
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:06.560
So for example I come back into the campaign once it's set up you can click here and you can come in

107
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.800
to duplicate set and then all you want to do when that server is set up to come back in.

108
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:21.160
We want to come back up to the outset level and you can go ahead and just change this.

109
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:29.320
So remove this Web site custom audience and add in the email list custom audience.

110
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.670
And that's really how it's done.

111
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.940
So that's very very simply how you can set up a page likes campaign using those custom audiences set

112
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.340
up and duplicate the ads that's from the original one.

113
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.680
If you want to test all those other ones against each other.

114
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.170
So now that you know how to set up a page like campaign using the custom audiences you've created.

115
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.400
Go ahead and set it up for yourself following the steps you've learned in this video.
