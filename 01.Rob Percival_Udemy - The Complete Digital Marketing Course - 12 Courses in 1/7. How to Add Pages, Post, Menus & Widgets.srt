1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,970
Now that you set up your Wordpress Web site and you were logged into the backend I want to bring you

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,550
on a tour of the Wordpress dashboard so you can really understand how easy it is to change the look

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,300
and feel of your site.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,870
So the first thing that I want to explain to you is if you come into appearance and PMS is really the

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,710
most radical way that you can change the look and feel of your site and that is to change the team so

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,180
we can see right now that we have the 2017 2017 team installed on our site it's active and this team

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:45,330
comes free with all WordPress sites in 2017 and also you can see the previous versions here as well

8
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,380
which you can activate if you want.

9
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,200
Also you can add themes that you find online.

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,140
And I'm also going to show you how to install a premium corporate team in a little bit as well.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,240
But the key message that I want to say is that if this is not the type of site that you want do you

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,930
not worry about it at all.

13
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,290
You can install a team that transform this into a fully functioning e-commerce site.

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,590
You can change this to a corporate Web site or whatever.

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,940
Wordpress is definitely not just for blogs and just bytes changing the team is really a radical way

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,710
that you can change the look and feel of your site.

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,850
But before we get into that I just want to walk through some of the more basic steps that you can easily

18
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,960
change right away and play around with.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,940
So let's come up to our posts and have a look at all of our posts here.

20
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:44,120
We can see that we have just one post or blog posts or site called Hello world and this will come the

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,060
default swell so we can see it here.

22
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,860
That's the title and this is the content of the post.

23
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:59,220
So if we want to change that we can come in to address what we can do now is to edit the title of this

24
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,870
post.

25
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,940
So let's just change this first post.

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,980
And if you were typing a blog post this is where the title of your blog post would go.

27
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,610
And we can just say this is my first post.

28
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,160
This is my first post.

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,280
Yea what we can also do is change the L of this post as well.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,470
So what we can put in here is first Dasch post.

31
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,690
So let's update this and see how it changes on our site.

32
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,890
So there we go.

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:40,820
Change the title on the post and even if we click into this we should be able to see the URL that is

34
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,280
changed as well.

35
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:48,050
Now what you are seeing in the see where L is the days and it is possible to remove that so it's just

36
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:55,070
our Web site dot com forward slash whatever we've put in there and so to do that I would highly recommend

37
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,600
you do this just even for the search engines.

38
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,420
So combined settings.

39
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:11,090
And then we can set the URL as the post name and then we can go ahead and click save changes and now

40
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,860
let us come back to our posts to make sure that it is changed.

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,590
So we edited again so open that up we can see that that has been changed and if we get a read we'll

42
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,440
have to change the URL here.

43
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,820
And we can see that that's coming up.

44
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,350
And that is showing much more cleaner and easier.

45
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,740
And that's actually much more search engine friendly.

46
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,640
So I would really recommend that you come in to your settings and change those permalink settings to

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,750
the post name so there where you've edited the post.

48
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,320
Now what about if we wanted to post.

49
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,630
Well again we just come to the sidebar.

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:57,140
We can add new and we can just type in second post.

51
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,290
We just wanted to see the content again.

52
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,210
And you can see that now because we changed the permalink settings that it's just showing up as forward

53
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,340
slash our keyword or title.

54
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:18,180
So we're going to go ahead and publish that and if we come into our site preview we can see that showing

55
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,180
up here now in the recent posts.

56
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,320
And even if we just come back to our home page we should be able to see the second post.

57
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,570
And the first post.

58
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,370
So there you go.

59
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,440
That is how you add a post to your site and already that's how we're starting to build up the content.

60
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,830
Now you're going to learn how to add pages to your Wordpress Web site to come back into the dashboard.

61
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,920
Once again you want to come to pages this time and then that's firstly have a look at all the pages

62
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,990
on our site.

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,410
So right now we can see that we just have one sample page and again we can click into edit this and

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,270
if we want to really preview the page we can just open it up as well.

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,250
So here we can see it's just a sample page with the title of the page and looks like kind of an abiders

66
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,320
section.

67
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,680
So what we can do is change this page name again to bite us.

68
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,430
We can also change some of the text here as well.

69
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,830
So I'll just delete some of that just to show you the difference or maybe let's just keep this part

70
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,420
here.

71
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:34,280
And we can write this text as well when we can just make sure as well that this changes to about us

72
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,900
now where we can go ahead and do is update the page and let us preview the changes.

73
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,770
As well so we can really see it there.

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,530
And so they changed to about us.

75
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,650
And we can see the text there that you either imported yourself or that I just just left in there.

76
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:02,270
So if we come back to our just normal page though we can't actually see this about us page it's kind

77
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,500
of hidden away somewhere.

78
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:09,410
So what we want to do is insert a menu appear at the top so we can really see the pages of our site

79
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,570
across the top.

80
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,200
And before we do that we might end up in one more page.

81
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,770
So let's just put in services

82
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:31,460
our services and again what we can do is previous to see how it looks like something there now.

83
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:37,200
But essentially we've created another page and we can just go ahead and publishes.

84
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,120
Now as we said we can see those pages from our home page.

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,940
So how do we get those visible to our visitors.

86
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,580
Well what we can do is come down to appearance and then menus and what we want to do is go out and create

87
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,270
a menu.

88
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:03,380
We can call this main menu and then create it now what we want to do is add our pages to our menu.

89
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,060
And then we can go ahead and click display location top menu and save the menu.

90
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:20,480
And then if we open up our site and refresh the page we can see the menu items appearing up here on

91
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:27,050
if we click through we can come and see our bios page or our services page.

92
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,460
Now if you want to adjust how those appear if you want to put the About Us page first then you simply

93
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,740
just rearrange the order.

94
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,570
Click Save and take refreshed just to see those changes.

95
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,220
Now what we might do actually is want to put in a menu item for our home page or our blog as well.

96
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:58,290
So what we can do is come across to our menu click fuel quick home quick add to menu and then we can

97
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,380
see that that's been added.

98
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,520
Click save and click refresh.

99
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,160
And now we can see the home page which we can get back to quickly from any page on the site.

100
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,820
So what about these links in the sidebar here how could we change the appearance of this or the order

101
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,420
of these or what we want to do is come into our dashboard.

102
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:27,720
Once again this time come down to widgets and in here we can see the blog sidebar and we can add widgets

103
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,070
in just to drag and drop them in if we wanted to see a calendar we could add that in.

104
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,920
We could just give it a title

105
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:45,140
Collender say if we refresh our site we can see the calendar appears up here.

106
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,700
So you can add in different things like a list of categories for your blog post custom hatred email

107
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,750
which you maybe might use to put in as a sign up form for an email.

108
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:02,960
You can put in images caught recent Collin's different things like videos etc..

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,930
Now what if you want to change the order where you simply just rearrange them here.

110
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,520
So if we come back in we can see the search bar is at the top.

111
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,520
And if you want to delete any of these widgets you can just go ahead and Salita very easily and it will

112
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,990
instantly update.

113
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,890
Now there's one more important thing that you might want to change and that is up here and you can see

114
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,310
it's as welcome just another WordPress site.

115
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:33,270
So we do want to change that and to that we can come to appearance once again come to customize and

116
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,160
in here you can come into site identity.

117
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,290
And so what I'll put in here is the name of the site.

118
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,320
WP Septem or dot com.

119
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,370
And then they can say

120
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,820
learn how to set up a word press site.

121
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,570
Then I can just click save and publish.

122
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,320
Now if I come to my site once again refresh the page can see this change.

123
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,080
Now that we've made all those changes.

124
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,300
One things you might want to do and just make sure is that your site is live.

125
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,650
So if you come to blue house right at the top here you may see this here that you can launch your site

126
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,960
your site is currently displaying coming scene page.

127
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:20,870
So I'm going to go ahead and click on the syce and once again we can go and view the site here.

128
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,980
So already you've learned how to change the tag line on your side menus posts pages change the widgets

129
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,680
as you can see it's very simple to work with wordpress even if you're non-technical like me.
