00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.590
In this video you're going to learn a tactics to get the first slice on your Facebook page.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.530
All of them are completely free to do and they'll only take you one or two minutes each.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.780
So this is very light work but it can get a lot of results.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.310
So the first way to get likes on your Facebook page is to invite your Facebook friends to like your

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.820
Facebook page on Facebook have made these incredibly easy in the sidebar here on the right hand side

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.880
you can see the option here is to invite all your friends and you can use go throughout this day and

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.940
invite them one by one.

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.440
And personally I have 646 43 friends on Facebook so that's a huge pool of people that I can really tap

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.440
into to kick start the launch of my page and get some initial engagement on those posts that I've put

10
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.520
down there.

11
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.720
You don't want to invite everybody you can skip anybody that you want and if you've got quite a big

12
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.690
list you don't want to work through the mall.

13
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
Then you also have the option just to search for those friends to advise and invite them in.

14
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.400
So the first way you can get likes on your Facebook page is just simply invite the group of friends

15
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.130
that you already have on Facebook.

16
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.590
And the second way that you can get Facebook likes is to again leverage your personal profile this time

17
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.590
you can come down into your personal profile you'll see or have the option to add pages you manage.

18
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.050
You can just click that.

19
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.090
I'm just going to make this from briberies.

20
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.060
You can select the page that you manage and you can either there.

21
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.090
And now this is getting quite a lot of visibility at the top your profile.

22
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.140
So anytime you engage people on Facebook and they come to your profile they're going to see this page

23
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.850
that you manage and they're probably going to click through and be curious about what's going on here

24
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.320
and then they can go ahead and like it there.

25
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.570
So that's a second way.

26
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.400
Simply adding your page is a page that you manage.

27
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.540
And the third way that you can get likes for your new Facebook page is to ask employees to do the same

28
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.480
thing.

29
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.290
You can add them as an admin and then they can also added as a page that they manage what they can also

30
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.340
do as well.

31
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.880
And you can use as well as come up to the abides section.

32
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.040
You can edit your work and you can add a workplace.

33
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.070
You can find your Facebook page here.

34
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.160
So just concepts in

35
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.480
an area here's the page.

36
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.580
You can say what your position is and what I recommend you do is also include a link to the Facebook

37
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.420
page here and say something a little bit about what the page is about.

38
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.750
And then for this example I'm just going to switch this to only me what you would want to keep that

39
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.160
public so everybody can see it.

40
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.920
And I'm just going to hit save changes.

41
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.250
So now if I come back to my profile

42
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.870
you're going to see exactly what this looks like and this can get quite a lot of visibility here because

43
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.100
not only is it just I've launched a page but it's like I've started a new job and if even a few employees

44
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.430
send that.

45
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.490
That's where a lot of people are going to like that because they've started a new job.

46
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.580
People always congratulate people who start new jobs.

47
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.450
And if you've got a link to the page then they can automatically link through.

48
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.690
Check it out.

49
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.120
And then like the page so you can use other people's social network your employees social network to

50
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.060
help promote your page.

51
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.070
And for every new employee that starts not as a great opportunity to use their social network to promote

52
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.990
your business.

53
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.520
Now the fourth way to get more likes to your Facebook page is also just to share the page.

54
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.540
As I was a normal posts you can say something you can paste the link to the page in there and you can

55
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.760
say something a little bit about it like hey you know take a commentary that I've written before you

56
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.850
can actually just delete delinquency pasted in because I will click through a friends here's my new

57
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.060
page explain a little bit about it.

58
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.920
And for this example I'll just say only me as well.

59
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.400
And if you want to practice this you can switch this to only me as well to see what it looks like it's

60
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.610
going to post this.

61
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.210
And you can see bacon directly like the page here as well in the post and that's the advantage of doing

62
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.860
it this way this way here.

63
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.900
They've to click through and like they're But you can see here as well there's another way to essentially

64
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.640
do a similar thing.

65
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.170
The advantage of this is that they can like it straight from the post without needing to click through.

66
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.340
So it's the fourth way to get likes on your Facebook page is to share it at as it posts.

67
00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.980
And the fifth way that you can get likes on your Facebook page is to od the link to your Facebook page

68
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.600
to your e-mail signature.

69
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:15.520
So I've just come into my Gmail here come into settings and then if I come down here and you see the

70
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.140
option to add in the signature I don't have a signature right now but I could add in a link to my Facebook

71
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.870
page here.

72
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.750
Go through your page first.

73
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.360
So you take the link to your Facebook page.

74
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:46.080
Pop that in your email signature and then you want to add a message like join me on Facebook or like

75
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.560
our Facebook page to stay updated or like our Facebook page for news stories entertainment and freebies

76
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.800
something like that you can put that in your own personal signature here or you can put that in your

77
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.200
company's e-mail signature to really get everybody who sends an e-mail to have a look at this.

78
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:13.080
Now on average people spend send 4.6 4.6 cave 4600 e-mails per year.

79
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.360
So that's prime real estate that you can use to really promote your Facebook page so you can do it on

80
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.170
your personal mail.

81
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.010
Here you can do it on your MailChimp can't your company e-mail accounts and all of your employees accounts

82
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.520
not as a fantastic way to get more likes to your Facebook page and promoted initially.

83
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.190
And you can always change the signature later on if it doesn't already.

84
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.110
Suze.

85
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:43.860
OK so the 6 the way to get likes for your Facebook page is to invite your Gmail contacts to like your

86
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.550
page.

87
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.070
So you could just send in normal mail to everybody.

88
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.960
But if you want to really filter that list then and target people to like your page you can come in

89
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.150
to your settings.

90
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:06.630
Or you can come into your G-mail period and commit to contacts then you can come in here to more exports

91
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.060
to click through to go to old version.

92
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.970
Once again then we want to collect and to more exports.

93
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:22.570
And you can see that I've got 863 G-mail contacts so I could export this list who is CXXVIII.

94
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:30.850
I'd obviously have to filter that down a bit and really invite those e-mail contacts too like my Facebook

95
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.540
page.

96
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.550
Now if I'm sending it from a private e-mail like this I might want to botch it up into e-mails of 50

97
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:44.560
people and just send them and maybe b c c everybody so that people don't see each other's emails.

98
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:53.050
That's a great way that you can just quickly use your Gmail contacts to also get Facebook likes and

99
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.470
promote your Facebook page.

100
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.840
Similar message would be you know hey Sidney Page check it out for X Y Z reasons.

101
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.870
You get updates on x.

102
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.000
I know you get my get freebies or we've got a competition running etc..

103
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.860
So as well as leveraging your facebook contacts you know look for the other contacts that you have that

104
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.500
Gmail contacts are a great one.

105
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:20.380
And as you can see there are over 800 actually even bigger list than my facebook contacts.

106
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:27.610
The seventh way to get likes for your new Facebook page is to leverage your Linked-In contacts and invite

107
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.340
them to like your page.

108
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.720
So I always forget how to do this.

109
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:40.020
So personally what I recommend is type in how to export Linked-In contacts.

110
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.420
It's kind of in a hidden place.

111
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.020
It's good just to get this instruction.

112
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.200
So we want to go to my network

113
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.680
somewhere in my network we want to click on connections in the right hand column your connections manage

114
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.450
sinked.

115
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.570
Then we want to manage sinked imported contacts.

116
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.490
Then we were under advance auctions in the right rail export contacts.

117
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.440
OK.

118
00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.490
So here we go.

119
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.590
Advanced Options export contacts

120
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.260
and then you can really pick the option here.

121
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.920
So we're going to

122
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.850
connections and then that'll be ready in a little bit and we can really get that.

123
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.230
Now again what we're going to get is like a CSP file full of email contacts.

124
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:40.980
I have another 800 CONTACTS on LinkedIn So there's another 800 people that I could invite.

125
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:50.830
So between Facebook Gmail and Linked-In I've got about 2000 over 2000 people that I can buy to like

126
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.950
my Facebook page.

127
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:57.820
You may not have as high numbers but I can guarantee you have something there from your existing network

128
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.300
that you can really use to like your page.

129
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.790
Now the eighth and final way to get likes for your brand new Facebook page is to leverage any email

130
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:12.910
subscribers that you have and simply send them an email and explain that you set up a Facebook page.

131
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:13.830
Love them.

132
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.230
To join you there to light the page and to stay updated.

133
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:24.140
For competitions prizes and posts about whatever it is that your business is about.

134
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:29.110
So those are the eight ways to get likes on your brand new Facebook page.

135
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.810
Go through them all and that is guaranteed to give you abuse and get you started with your Facebook

136
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.670
likes on engagement's on the post that you set up.

137
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.700
So go ahead and do that for yourself.

138
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:46.060
Or keep these strategies in your back pocket for a client or the future page that your phone is so.
