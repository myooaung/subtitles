00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.485
So we've looked at using if else statements.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.250
We've comparison operators such as greater than,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.590
less than or equal to.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.865
In this video, we're going to take a look at logical operators.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:20.270
Logical operators are also often used with if else statements.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.040
Let's take a look at how we can use them.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.990
Let's get started with a folder. This is number 4.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.750
This is called logical-operators.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.780
Then open that folder up in brackets.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.460
Just drop that in there.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:59.700
So again, start in the same way as usual with a new title of logical operators,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.155
and then delete everything between the script tags that we don't need.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:10.910
So to start with, I'm going to create a couple of variables that we can work with.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.500
So just simply we're going to call this number 1 and set that to be 10,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.090
and then a second variable, number 2.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.065
I'm going to set this one to be 20.

00:01:25.065 --> 00:01:29.305
So what we're going to be looking at in this video is

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:33.850
using the and which is the two ampersands.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.160
We will look in at all,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.435
which is the two vertical bars or the pipes,

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:45.140
and looking at the exclamation mark, which means not.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.635
So we're going to get started with and.

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:52.420
I'm going to combine this with a if statement.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.170
So let's create a simple if statement.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:04.300
Lets create document.write just saying condition is true,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.895
and actually we'll put some h2 tags around these,

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.890
so just a little bit bigger.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.905
So let's get started with a condition which is true.

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:29.030
So if number 1 is equal to 10,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.540
then that's right condition is true to the browser.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.860
There we go. So that is true.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.680
If we wanted to check if more than one condition was true,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.755
we can use the and logical operator.

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:49.890
So we can test a second condition.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.730
So this is if number 1 is equals 10,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.210
and also if number 1 is less than 20,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.370
and both conditions are true.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.270
So if we hit refresh,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.790
we look at the condition is true statement.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.790
So that's a good way of checking if more than one value

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.985
needs to be true to trigger an action.

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:19.365
As well as and,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:23.200
if we wanted to just check if one of these statements was true,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.885
we can use the two vertical bars or the two pipes.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:32.830
Now only one of these sides needs to be true for it to trigger this document right.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.355
If number 1 is equal to 10,

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:44.960
or number 2 is equal to 10.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.920
So now just number 1 is true and number 2 is false.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.800
So refresh, and there we go.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.095
So get condition is true.

00:03:55.095 --> 00:04:00.370
But if we'd change this to be two false conditions,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.720
that text disappears now.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.915
The next we're going to look at not.

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:10.195
If you remember from earlier on the course,

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:12.850
we looked at some of the operators you could use,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.445
such as less than and greater than.

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:18.805
These can be combined with the exclamation mark,

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.160
which does the exact opposite.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.920
So rather than the less than symbol,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.730
this would simply mean not less than.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.080
So let's just test this in our if statement and take a look.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.720
So let's just delete a little bit of this.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.480
So we'll start with a true statement.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.475
So if number 1 is less than number 2, which is,

00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:50.335
we should get the text there, but if we wanted to do the exact opposite,

00:04:50.335 --> 00:04:52.465
I'd make this condition false.

00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:55.630
We'll just simply combine that with the not symbol.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.490
So if number 1 is not less than 2.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.320
So now if we refresh,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.840
we should see that the text disappears,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.110
and it doesn't have to be the less than or greater than symbol.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.560
We can also use the equals symbol.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.970
So if number 1 is not equal to 20,

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.830
then print this statement out.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.420
There we go. So that's just wanted two more operators to look up,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.065
which you may find useful,

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:31.405
and I'll see you in the next video where we'll take a look at using switch statements,

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:34.360
and we'll take a look at how we can use them in JavaScript to

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.660
handle multiple outcomes or multiple cases.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.310
So thank you and I'll see you there.
