00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.670
Welcome back. I hope you got a chance to have a little play around with some of

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.345
the JavaScript math that we looked at in the last video.

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:12.150
So now we've got all the boring theory out of the way.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.560
Let's now put that all into practice and create another mini challenge.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.660
It's going to be quite simple,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.705
though you might need to think about one or two things along the way.

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:29.355
All I wanted to do in this challenge is to generate a random number between one and 100.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.030
It's something should be capable of doing.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.845
It's something we've looked at in previous videos,

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:37.470
and it's something which shouldn't cause any problems.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.305
Well, if it does, don't worry,

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.570
just follow along with what I do at the end of

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.930
this video and I'll show you exactly how to do that.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.465
So go into your JavaScript folder and then the math and date, section.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:54.810
Duplicate the last video, and call it what you want,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.030
but I'm going to call a random-number-challenge,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.680
and then get this open in your text editor.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.160
Lastly, change the title and remove the code from the last video,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.080
so Mini challenge: Generate

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:36.030
a random number between 1-100.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.390
We don't need this anymore so we can remove that.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.710
If you don't feel like you need any help,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.560
stop the video now and give that a go.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.590
If you feel like you still need one or two more pointers,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.170
take a look at the last video again and have

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.945
a look at the Math.random section in that video,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.675
and that should give you all the clues that you need to complete the challenge.

00:01:56.675 --> 00:02:00.400
So give that a go, and if you don't feel confident, don't worry.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.565
I'm going to go through how I would do it now.

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:09.210
Let's just get started between the script tags.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:16.295
I'm going to begin by creating a variable to store the random number inside.

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:20.795
I'm going to call this variable rounded number,

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:25.665
and then this is going to be set to Math.random,

00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:28.215
which we looked at in the last video.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:32.610
Don't forget the brackets and then the semicolon.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.635
If you remember that the Math.random generated a random number between zero and one,

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:43.910
but because we want the value to be between one and 100,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.110
we need to multiply the value by 100.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.100
So let's manipulate this variable.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.210
So copy that and paste in.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.615
So rounded number is now equal to rounded number,

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:06.645
multiply by 100, and then let's print this to the screen.

00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm going to use a document.write,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.555
and then pass inside the variable,

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:15.860
which is rounded number.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.485
and let's just see how that is looking for now,

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.450
and refresh that a few times.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.465
You should check that it's working okay.

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:29.415
So we need to also round this number to the nearest whole number.

00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:32.715
I'm going to actually round the number down.

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:41.130
Again, just go into the code and then change the rounded number variable, so Math.floor.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.040
Then inside the brackets this time,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.535
instead of just typing in a number which you just put in ourselves,

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:52.910
we're going to pass in the rounded number variable,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.180
and then take a look at that.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.385
Hopefully, you managed to do that.

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:01.545
But there is one little snag with this.

00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:04.220
If you remember that the random number that we

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.065
generated started at zero but didn't actually include number 1,

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:14.795
so therefore, the largest number that we can possibly go is going to be 99.

00:04:14.795 --> 00:04:19.980
To increase that, we're just going to use plus one.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.610
If you keep refreshing it should finally get the values of one and 100,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.335
but it may take a while.

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:29.525
So now that's all working.

00:04:29.525 --> 00:04:33.350
There's just one more thing I want to show you before we finish this video.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.500
So the code that we've created in this challenge,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.840
it's pretty step-by-step and everything is all on separate lines.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.770
The way we can actually combine this to be a little bit more neater and all on one line,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.630
I'm just going to comment that out.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.540
If you're using brackets like me,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.075
you can highlight all the code and then command on forward slash.

00:04:58.075 --> 00:05:01.915
To put this all onto one line,

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:05.060
we can start with the same variable.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.720
I'm just going to copy that and paste that in.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.740
But this time we're going to start with Math.floor,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.080
so the result is rounded down.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.470
Then inside the brackets,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.860
you can put in the Math.random,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.620
so paste that inside there.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.829
The random number that we generating,

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:33.425
we want that to be multiplied by 100.

00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:38.510
So let's get rid of the sidebar so we can see all on one line there, example,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.360
multiply 100, and make sure that

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.780
all of this section there is between the Math.floor brackets.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.555
Then outside the brackets we can add our plus one,

00:05:50.555 --> 00:05:52.810
just like we do on above there.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.405
Save that and we can still use the same document.writes,

00:05:56.405 --> 00:05:59.780
and then hopefully, if we go to the browser and refresh,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.015
we should still get the same outcome.

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:06.985
But this time, it's just all on one line and it looks just a little bit neater.

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:10.970
There we go. So hope you manage to achieve that by yourself.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.320
If not, don't worry.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.600
Follow along with the example I've just done and

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.305
try to understand exactly what we're doing,

00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:19.080
and I'll see you in the next video.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.440
We'll take a look at JavaScript date and date methods.
