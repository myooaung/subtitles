00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.780
Hi guys, and welcome back.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.770
In this video, we're going to take a look at JavaScript objects.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.925
JavaScript objects are really important parts of JavaScript.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:17.295
So much so that nearly everything in JavaScript is classed as an object.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:21.210
Objects are a collection of name-value pairs.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.240
So let's take a look at how we use them.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
So let's create video number 12.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.300
This is called objects.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.930
Then let's open this up.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.040
So drag, enter brackets.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.750
Let's change this to JavaScript objects,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.930
and start with an empty script tag.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.910
There we go. So when we want to create an object,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.495
we start in a similar kind of way to a variable,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.130
which we looked at earlier on.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.335
So we use the var keyword,

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.760
and then we want to give the object a name.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.660
I'm going to use a phone as a good example for our object.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.120
So let's give it a name of phone.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.785
One way of creating an object is by using the new keyword.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.275
So new object.

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:27.455
When we create a new object,

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:30.385
we need to use the brackets afterwards.

00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:34.040
This layout should look pretty familiar from the array section,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.070
where we created a new array and then we

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.880
added certain values or properties to that array.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.105
So now we've got our phone object.

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:47.615
We can start to add some different properties to it,

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:50.240
such as the phone's manufacturer,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.750
the model, and the color.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.795
So to add properties to our phone object,

00:01:56.795 --> 00:01:59.995
we type in the name of the object.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:03.015
Then to add property to the phone object,

00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:05.495
we can use the square brackets.

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:06.920
Then inside the quotations,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.020
we can add the name of the property.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.625
So manufacturer can be the first property.

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:17.805
Let's set our example to Apple.

00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:20.640
Then a semicolon at the end.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.190
We can carry on in exactly the same way for more properties.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.270
So we can add the model,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.050
and that can be set to the iPhone.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.900
The phone color, so I'm going to set that to silver.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.745
So we set a new phone object.

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:52.715
This is going to have the properties of manufacturer, set to Apple.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.650
The model, set to iPhone,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.520
and the phone's color to be set to silver.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.995
So these are the name-value pairs.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:08.365
So this is a name. This is the value assigned with the equals operator.

00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:12.275
Objects are ideal for anything which has a number of properties,

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.770
such as a person object can have properties,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.675
such as a name,

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:20.870
an age, address, and contact number.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.140
So really useful of keeping all our information contained on the one keyword.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.910
So now we've got our new phone object created,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.130
and we've added three different properties.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.915
We add all our values.

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:35.670
We can now do a console log.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.850
So we can log to the console the phone object.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.670
So let's save that and take a look,

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.220
and head to the developer tools. So there we go.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.330
So we can see our object is being created in the logs.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.620
If you open that up, we can see all the name-value pairs.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.110
We've got the color, the manufacturer and the model.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.205
So that's the contents of the full object.

00:04:05.205 --> 00:04:08.860
If we wanted to access just one of these properties,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.095
this works in a similar kind of way to an array.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.765
Instead of logging the phone object,

00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:18.985
we use a phone object and then the square brackets.

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:20.810
Then inside the quotations,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.135
we just put the name of the property.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:25.295
So now we should get the model,

00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:27.805
which is the iPhone.

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:30.585
Head over and refresh.

00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:33.705
So there we go. So there's the iPhone value.

00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:36.815
In our example that we just looked up,

00:04:36.815 --> 00:04:43.610
we've accessed and added properties to our object using the square brackets and

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.610
usually a more popular and the simpler way to add

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.190
properties to an object is to use the dot notation.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.615
It looks a little bit more simpler.

00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:56.900
So using the example that we've created above,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.650
let's do this again with the phone object.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.349
So let's set this to a new object,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.420
and let's just comment this section out.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.870
Now we want to add properties.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.420
We can start with the phone object.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.385
But this time, instead of the square brackets, we can use the dot.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:24.130
So a dot manufacturer equal to Apple.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:33.070
The phone.model is equal to your iPhone,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.195
and then lastly the phone.color.

00:05:39.195 --> 00:05:42.580
So we'll set that to silver.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.030
So this works exactly the same as the bracket notation that we used above,

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.890
but I think this just looks a little bit

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.085
simpler and it's just a little bit easier to type out.

00:05:54.085 --> 00:05:56.200
So just to check that it's working,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.045
we'll do a console,

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:03.685
console log and that will display in the logs the phone object.

00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:06.585
So save and then refresh.

00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:10.120
So there's our object once more with the manufacturer,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.715
the model, and the color properties.

00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:14.570
So we get exactly the same results,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.480
but I think it just looks a little bit cleaner.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.845
So if you remember from when we created a array,

00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:26.320
we also done the literal version where we didn't need to use the new array keyword.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.600
We can do exactly the same way in creating objects.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.155
So rather than creating the object,

00:06:32.155 --> 00:06:34.780
like we've just done there, which is one way,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.970
we can use object literal.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.595
So it's a little bit simpler to create an object this way.

00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:46.610
So we'll begin with the var keyword and then again give it the name of the object,

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.390
and then this time is to set a new object.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.010
We set the phone object to be equal to all the name-value pairs,

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.645
which we put in between the curly braces.

00:06:56.645 --> 00:07:01.015
So we can set inside the brace the properties.

00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:08.000
So manufacturer and then use a colon. So Apple.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.050
The model, so it is going to be separated with a comma.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.310
The model, again, the iPhone.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:23.300
The color of silver.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.010
So one of the great things about using objects is

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.280
because they are just collections of name-value pairs.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.955
We can also nest an object inside another object.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:39.325
For example, if our phone had many different features,

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:42.095
we could also create a features object.

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:43.930
Instead of adding a value,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.950
we can use the curly braces and then inside the braces,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.710
we can add more name-value pairs.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:58.590
So for example, if our phone had features such as Bluetooth.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:04.650
So we'll set that to a Boolean value of true and Wi-Fi.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.855
So that should be a comma again,

00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:10.200
and then Wi-Fi, which can also be true.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.660
GPS, we'll set that to be false,

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.855
and you can nest as many of these properties inside as you want.

00:08:19.855 --> 00:08:24.670
So now if we wanted to access any of these properties which are nested,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.425
it's pretty simple to do.

00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:28.730
So we do a console log.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.110
So begin with our object name.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.655
The object name is phone and then use the dot to access the properties.

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:44.860
You can see the brackets is already given us a list of the various properties.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.640
So with the color features, manufacturer, and model.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.190
If we wanted to go deeper,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.885
we can select the features and then use the dot again.

00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:58.045
Then you can see inside the features,

00:08:58.045 --> 00:09:03.320
we've got the three properties of Bluetooth, GPS and Wi-Fi.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.555
So let's save that and check that out.

00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:09.860
So we should get the value of Bluetooth, which is true.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.965
So refresh and there's our true value,

00:09:13.965 --> 00:09:20.330
and that changes to GPS and then we should get a value of false.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:27.580
There we go. So now we've got our phone object all setup.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.820
I'm just going to create a example using a function,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.190
which we looked at in this section.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.540
So create a function.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:41.410
We'll just display the features of your phone in a function.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.105
Let's just do an alert to the browser.

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:46.530
Then inside the alert,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.660
we can display the phone manufacturer by grabbing

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.975
the manufacturer property of the object. Let's start with a string.

00:09:54.975 --> 00:09:59.325
So a manufacturer and then a space.

00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:01.925
We can use the plus to add onto the end.

00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:06.785
Let's select our phone object and use the dot notation.

00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:13.070
So phone.manufacturer and then to display this when it's called the yourPhone function.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.655
So paste that in, and then save that,

00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:21.780
and then go to the browser and refresh. So there we go.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.540
There's our string of manufacturer,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.575
and then we've pulled in the object manufacturer, which is Apple.

00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:33.660
So there we go. That's how we create an object in JavaScript,

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.990
and that's the end of this section.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.110
So thank you.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.400
I will see you in the next section.
