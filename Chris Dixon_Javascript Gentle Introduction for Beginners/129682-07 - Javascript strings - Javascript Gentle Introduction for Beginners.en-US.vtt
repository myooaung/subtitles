00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.530
We're doing well now on this section called strings.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:11.120
If we go into the JavaScript folder that we created and then into the JavaScript basics.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.910
Just as before, duplicate the last video and then rename it mine is going to be number

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.860
3 JavaScript strings and then save that and open it up in your text editor.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.410
Then the title just as

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.330
strings and then you can delete the section between the script tags.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.550
In the previous videos we've briefly looked at strings and

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.895
a string is basically a section of text.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:54.575
It can be a character,

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.060
it can be a word,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.225
or it can be a paragraph.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:03.050
Let's start with the first example and we'll create a variable.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.950
The first one is going to be firstName and assign firstName in my case it's Chris,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.980
the semicolon at the end.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.430
Then a second variable of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.975
second name and assign this to be my second name which is Dixon.

00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:34.245
We can use single or double quotes it doesn't matter and we can then join the strings.

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:38.830
I want to display these to the console so console.log.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.390
We could join them by joining the variable names.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.995
So firstName and then the plus

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:54.735
and then the second variable name with the semicolon at the end.

00:01:54.735 --> 00:01:59.340
Then open up in the browser and then go to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.810
the console and you can see the name is just there.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.380
It's printed both the first and the second name,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.435
so it doesn't matter about the single or double quotes.

00:02:11.435 --> 00:02:14.470
Quotations however start to become

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.580
important if we include them actually inside the string.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.835
If we were to have a quote and the quote had texts such as "my name

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:35.330
is Chris," and we wanted the name to be in quotations we couldn't actually do that.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.955
Then you change the variable name to quote and let's see what happens with that.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:51.875
Then go into the console and you can see that we get a syntax error.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.830
We can fix up by going over to

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.620
the string and instead the double quotes we can use a different type of quotes.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.415
Change that to single and then refresh and there we go.

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:09.830
Again, my name is Chris and it's actually printed the single quotes.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.690
You can also do the same if you had single quotes on the outside,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.380
you can set the inner quotes to be double.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.200
Save and refresh and there is a double quotes that all works fine,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.490
so let's just get rid of that.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.790
As well as joining strings we can also join strings

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.435
with variables and things such as numbers.

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:46.120
For example, if we had a name set to Chris,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.100
do we document.write this time.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.210
In this example, I'm going to join a variable with a string and

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.445
then with a number and print out the words Chris is 31.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:08.630
I've already got the variable name so we can add that.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.619
Then we can use the plus to add or concatenate.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:18.180
We've got Chris and then we need to add "is" between quotations,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.695
so that is a string.

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:26.840
Then a number plus to add the number so we can type in the age which is 31.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.470
Save and then hit refresh,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.490
we'll get the word Chrisis31 but there's no spaces in between and that's easy to fix.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.865
If we go into the string we can add a space before and after,

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:50.490
and this will print out the space in the document so there you go.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.180
That's quite a simple way of form and a string but if we

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.205
had a long string such as a paragraph.

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.935
There's lots of different format and options and

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:04.100
escaping that we can do to make that look better.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:14.805
If you go over to Google and search for Lorem Ipsum and we'll just get some sample text.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:22.360
In fact, I'll just copy the first paragraph that looks like enough text their.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.775
Change the variable and call my paragraph.

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:34.130
Then between the quotations paste in the sample text,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:42.115
and then as you go down and we'll print this to the console, console.log.

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:46.640
On the text we want to print is the paragraph,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.520
so head over to the browser and then go to the console.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.695
There's all the dummy text we have put in place.

00:05:57.695 --> 00:06:01.150
It's quite a big, unreadable chunk of text there.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:09.100
We may want to add some formatting to that text such as line breaks, quotations, or tabs.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.375
We can do that with some JavaScript,

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:16.145
if we look for a section that we want to create a new line.

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:18.005
I'm going to start mine there.

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:21.170
If you do a backslash and then an,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.940
so we should get a new line after the word industry.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.990
Refresh and there we go.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.135
That's the first line which breaks after the word industry.

00:06:32.135 --> 00:06:37.040
We can just put one or two of those in just before it.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.335
There's one and save and take a look.

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.200
Good, there's another line break just there.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.120
There is a couple of different things you can also do,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.055
we can also put double or single quotes within text,

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:58.495
and we can also escape them by using the backslash,

00:06:58.495 --> 00:07:02.190
so use a backslash and then the quotes.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:10.350
Then we do just the same afterwards so backslash and a quote and then refresh.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.370
You can see if you look for the word that we just highlighted,

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.995
we've got the quotes before and after.

00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:19.950
You can also do the same way to a single quote.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.930
If you actually wanted to include a backslash you

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.750
just do that twice so include two back slashes.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:36.665
As the backslash appear in there and also the single quotes and we can also add a tab.

00:07:36.665 --> 00:07:40.430
If you wanted to add one at the start it's a backslash and

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:47.820
a t and you've got the indent there.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.000
There's a few useful ways of escaping and formatting text using

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.250
JavaScript and a small examples including the sheet provided at the start of the course.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.530
The last thing I want to show you in this video is how to find

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.090
the length of a string using the length property.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:13.560
Let's get rid of the Lorem ipsum text and we can reuse this variable.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.895
I'm going to use the name example again,

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.325
so name equal to

00:08:18.325 --> 00:08:24.410
Chris and then we'll create a new variable to store the length of the name.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.840
Variable called nameLength and the way we got the length

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.950
for the name is by setting not to the name.length.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.345
Then finally we can log to the console the new variable name.

00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:44.705
Save that and then refresh.

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:48.880
There we go so the length for my name is five characters long.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.250
That's the end of this video and if you join me in the next video,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.070
we will put this into practice in a mini challenge.
