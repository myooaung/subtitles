00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.720
Welcome back. In this mini challenge,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.525
we're going to create a temperature-converter app.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.815
It can be a simple or as creative as you would like,

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:11.810
but this is what I've come up with,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.260
just as an example.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.235
It is simple HTML form which takes the user's inputs,

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:23.235
and then we can convert it to Celsius or to Fahrenheit using JavaScript,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:26.400
so do try it and see what you can come up with, otherwise,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.880
follow along with me and I'll show you how I created this.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.170
Let's get started by creating a folder for the project in the dom section.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.180
This is number 3 and this is the temperature-converter.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.490
Now let's open up in brackets and we can get started.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.020
The title is temperature converter,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.240
and let's lay all the sample code from the previous videos.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.290
I'm going to begin with the HTML section.1 So

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.950
I'm just going to create a Bootstrap HTML form.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.890
Let's start outside the script tags.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.425
Let's create a container,

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:24.960
which is the Bootstrap code,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.305
and then let's create a Bootstrap row,

00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:31.560
and then let's use the Bootstrap grid, so col-sm-6.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.210
If you're using the Emmet plugin like me,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.090
you should be able to get the this grid pretty fast, if not,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.370
you'll need to type this out with the classes and also to send this div,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.495
we'll add the col-sm-offset,

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:53.910
which will offset the grid by three and place it in the center.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.110
The Bootstrap class of text-center

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.300
which will keep everything nicely aligned in the middle and then lastly,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.225
I created a content class,

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:07.535
and this you're going to be used to style it in the CSS.

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:10.965
Let's begin with a level 2 heading,

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:15.190
which is just the title of our app which is Temperature Converter,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.900
and then let's create our form.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.605
Because we're using Bootstrap,

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.850
let's create a div with a class of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.755
form group and this will make sure everything is nicely laid out.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:40.730
Within the form group, let's create a input with the type of number and this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.550
is a section where the user can enter the number that they want

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.955
to convert to Celsius or Fahrenheit.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:51.105
So the ID, I'm going to set to UserInput,

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:54.825
and in fact we'll give this a label,

00:02:54.825 --> 00:03:00.520
so label 4, for the UserInputs ID,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.555
and let's close the sidebar.

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:07.030
Let's save and let's check if that's working okay.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.295
There we go, there's our heading on the input.

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.680
Let's just complete the label now.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.710
Let's put in Enter your number to convert.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.560
Just like that, and then refresh and there we go.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.480
There's the text from the label.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.665
Now I'm going to place two more buttons inside the form,

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:34.235
which is for the Celsius or Fahrenheit.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.985
Let's put them inside now.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:41.300
I'm going to place these inside a new div or

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.310
form-group and then the first input is the type of button,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.050
and then the text inside.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.300
We add that with the value of To Celsius,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.820
and then we want this button to actually do something when the user presses it.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.250
We want to create an onclick event which will trigger

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.210
the function and we'll look at events more in the next video, but for now,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.450
just create a onclick events with the onclick keyword and then inside the quotations,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.580
we add the name of the function that we want to trigger once this button is pressed.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.410
I'm going to create a function called toCelsius,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.145
and then we need the brackets after that.

00:04:28.145 --> 00:04:31.475
So copy and paste or duplicate this.

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.620
This one is To Farhenheit,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.010
and then the function is toFarenheit,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.400
and let's just take a look.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.265
It says there were two buttons on there.

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:52.810
The last thing we need to do is to create a empty div,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.705
which you want to display the text of the temperature conversion.

00:04:57.705 --> 00:05:00.460
Just like the finished version,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.120
we're going to create text field at the bottom where the conversion appears.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:14.140
Outside the form, I'm just going to put this in an empty p tag with the id of results.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.685
Let's open if now in HTML.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:23.170
Let's now just move to the top and we'll add some styling to our form.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.480
Back open the head section.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.670
Let's create our own style tags.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.635
If you remember the down in the div which contains all the content,

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:37.200
we add it a content class.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.785
Let's add that now inside the style tags,

00:05:40.785 --> 00:05:43.785
and then let's add some simple styles.

00:05:43.785 --> 00:05:49.350
Let's add a border, 1px solid.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.750
We'll add some rounded corners with a border-radius.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.660
I'm going to have minus 10px.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.040
Margin top just to keep it away from the top of the screen or

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.290
30px and then a background color or of the gray color,

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.210
which is eee and then let's take a look.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.545
Then I just want to add the background color,

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:20.725
which you can see on the final version there.

00:06:20.725 --> 00:06:26.780
Let's go back into the CSS and let's style the body section.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:33.265
To get the background, I'm just going to add a linear gradient to the background.

00:06:33.265 --> 00:06:41.250
So linear gradient and then inside the brackets,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.665
we can add two, and then let's add the two colors, to blend in.

00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:51.855
First of all, its red and then the second color is blue.

00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:54.935
It will start with red and then as it goes to the right,

00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:56.845
it will change to blue.

00:06:56.845 --> 00:07:01.590
Go into the browser and there's our gradient on the background.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.110
That looks better. Don't forget if this is a live production site.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.230
You may want to add some browser prefixes to

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.630
the linear gradient just for cross-browser compatibility.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.650
Now, that's the HTML CSS all finished for the user interface.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.910
I'm just going to leave this video there and will finish itself in the next video

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:28.140
where we'll add the JavaScript and make our temperature-converter fully functional.
