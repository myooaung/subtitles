00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.240
Welcome back. It's now time to take a little break from learning

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.160
and put into practice what you've learned so far in your first mini-challenge.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.299
What I'd like you to do is to create a simple webpage,

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.775
which displays a user's score.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.600
Create a couple of variables for the player's name,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.475
and also the score,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:27.495
and then display that score on a webpage in a string.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.240
It doesn't need to be anything fancy,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.970
all you need to do is display the user,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.610
and then add a string onto the end of it for score is,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.210
and then add on the variable for the number of points,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.045
and then finally add the string onto the end.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.485
Feel free to make this a little bit different than my example.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:53.125
But to give it a go, it's a good way to put into practice what we've learned so far.

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:57.730
If you don't feel 100 percent confident in doing this yet, it's not a problem.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.070
Just follow along with the rest of this video,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.570
and I'll show you how I will do it.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.555
I hope you managed to do that by yourself,

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.170
if not, don't worry,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.185
I'll show you how to do it now.

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:16.030
If you just go into the JavaScript basics folder and then duplicate the last video.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:24.380
I'm going to call mine number 4 challenge-display-users-score.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.590
Then open your text editor,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.850
then you change the title, Displaying user score.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.395
I'm going to start from scratch in this.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:54.285
Between the script tags,

00:01:54.285 --> 00:02:00.490
I'm going to create a variable called player equals Chris,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.225
and then a variable to hold the score value.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:11.040
So score equals zero, just to begin with.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.240
Then one more variable to hold the display or the string, so displayScore.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.270
Just to make my display a little bit bigger,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.510
I'm going to start with some h3 tags.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.670
I've not actually looked at them in this course yet,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.590
but you can actually add HTML tags by surrounding in the quotations.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:42.300
We start with the h3 and then we'll add the player or the player variable.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.125
Then on the end of the player,

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:51.525
I want to put the apostrophe and then the s. So it's Chris's score is.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:54.585
We can add that as a string.

00:02:54.585 --> 00:03:00.165
So the apostrophe and the s and then a number plus.

00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:02.370
So far, we've got Chris's.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.135
Then we want to put the string of score is,

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:09.100
so open up the quotes.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.225
Remember to put a space before and after so the words aren't touching each other.

00:03:18.225 --> 00:03:20.900
So Chris's score is,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.229
and then we need to add on to the end the score variable.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.490
So Chris's score is zero,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.205
and then the word points,

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:35.760
so space, and then points.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.460
Then at the very end when it's closed,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:46.310
the h3 tag, just like that with a semicolon on the end.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.790
Now we've got our variable sets of display score,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.865
let's just now print that to the page.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:58.860
We document write,and the variable name,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.430
and a semicolon, and let's take a look.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.520
So Chris's score is zero points.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.780
If we wanted to increase the score every time the user gets an extra point,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.950
we could add score++ if you remember that from earlier on.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.650
Then now if we refresh,

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.585
we should get Chris's score is one points.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:28.305
You can do that as many times as you want and the points will go up accordingly.

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:33.090
That's the end of the challenge. I hope you managed to do it and hope you enjoyed it.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.440
Thank you and I will see you in the next video.
