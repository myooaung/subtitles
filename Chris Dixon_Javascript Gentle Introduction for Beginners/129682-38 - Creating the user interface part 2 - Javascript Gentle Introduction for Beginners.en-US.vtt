00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.130
Welcome back. We're going to continue from where we left off in the last video.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.160
We're going to move on from the text colors and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.235
then we're going to add all the rest of the form section,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:16.410
which includes the Text Align and also various names and contact information.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.485
Now, we're going to move on to the Text Align section.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:26.055
Let's go into the text editor and then just underneath the changeText section,

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:32.590
let's just copy this section and paste that in below.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.160
This one's going to work slightly different to the last ones we looked

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.325
at because they're going to be three different inputs.

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.920
Every time one of these inputs is clicked,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.510
we want to grab the ID and then pass that JavaScript

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.580
to determine whether the CSS should be aligned left, right, or center.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.240
We can reuse the label,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.190
and this time we just want to give it a label called Text Align.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.775
Then still within the col-sm-9 section,

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:12.535
we're going to create three different inputs.

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:17.515
The first one is going to be the type of

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:26.940
button and then the class of btn btn-info.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.585
The value we'll pass in is going to be the text inside the button,

00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:33.000
so this is the left button.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.870
Then we're going to pass an id into the text- left.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.630
This is actually a bootstrap class,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.130
but I'll show you exactly what we're going to do in just a second.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.300
We're going to create a onclick event handler and when the button's pressed,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.330
it'll end trigger function called textAlign.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.080
Then inside the brackets,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.985
we're going to pass in a parameter of this.id.

00:02:00.985 --> 00:02:05.130
This part will make more sense when we move on to the JavaScript section.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.140
But basically what we're doing is every time the button is clicked,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.885
we'll then trigger the textAlign function

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.365
and depending on which of the three buttons is pressed,

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.305
it will then grab the id.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.825
In this case, it's text-left.

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:24.080
Then using JavaScript, we'll add this text-left

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.450
id and then we'll add it on as a class name.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.030
The moment it's pressed,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.670
the text inside the business card will then have

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.420
the text-left alignment and the same for text center and text-right.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.195
But it should make more sense when we get to the JavaScript section.

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:45.320
Just duplicate this button two more times and we're going

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.320
to use exactly the same textAlign function.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.720
But we just need to change the id.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.665
The middle one is going to be text-center with the value of Center,

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:06.600
and then the third button has value of Right and then the id of text-right.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.680
All three buttons trigger the same function but we just pass it in a

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.625
different id depending on which button is pressed.

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:18.270
Let's take a look at that and refresh.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.400
Says, I've three buttons.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.810
Now, we can move onto the user's name,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.690
the Job Title, Email,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500
and Telephone Number so it's a pretty straightforward sections.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.635
We can just copy the form groups that we've already created,

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:39.040
and then paste them below the buttons.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.989
The first one is the inputName,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:53.920
the label value of your name, change the id.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.675
I'm going to remove the value because we're not using the color.

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:04.210
Let's remove the color type and change it back to text.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.300
Then we need this be onkeyup.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.360
When the key is pressed will then trigger a function called printName.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.325
Then let's do the same for the Job Title,

00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:23.535
so copy that and then paste.

00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:35.250
InputJob, the id is inputJob too and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.275
then the label is Job Title and then

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:47.505
onkeyup printJob and then the e-mail section.

00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:51.010
Let's create a new form group, once again.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.100
Paste just below so this needs to be

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.375
the inputEmail and then change the id.

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:09.690
The label is simply Email and this time we need to change

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.905
the input type to be email so JavaScript can do some validation on that.

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:19.365
Then onkeyup printEmail function.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:22.895
Then the last one we need to do is for the contact number.

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:32.290
Let's just copy this last form group for the telephone number, which is inputTelephone,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.850
change the id, the title of Telephone Number,

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.425
and then the input type of tel,

00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:56.980
and then onkeyup printTelephone.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.875
Save that and check that out in the browser and that should be

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.310
all of the input types all completed now.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.610
We just need to add the Submit button and then

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.595
also a button to clear the form, so let's add them now.

00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:18.605
We can put these inside their own form group as well.

00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:24.990
Create a new div with the class of form-group.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.345
Then let's add the bootstrap grid so a div,

00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:36.330
let's give this a class of col-sm-3 so it takes up three columns and

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.480
then also a offset-col-sm-offset-3.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.600
Then inside the div, we can put the input.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.270
The first one we need to add is the input type of button.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.185
This is for the Submit button and then onclick.

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:01.840
We'll create the function formSubmit,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.400
and then the button value is equal to Submit.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.235
Then lastly, the button for the form reset or the Clear.

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:23.130
I create this full div from the one above and just remove the offset this time.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.340
Again, we need the input type of button.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:34.360
Onclick will create function fromReset with the value of Clear.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.640
Let's take look at the browser and check if it's all working fine.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.905
So refresh that and there we go.

00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.705
There's our business card and all the forms,

00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:51.340
the Submit button, and also the Clear button at the bottom.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.615
Let's finish off the HTML,

00:07:53.615 --> 00:07:56.420
we just need to create the div on the right-hand side,

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.715
which is for the business card.

00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:04.560
This is going to have all the information that the user inputs into the form.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.180
Let's create a comment just to make it a bit more readable.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.620
This is the output section.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.775
I just want to make sure we've got this in the right section so I'm going to click that.

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:24.260
That's the end of all forms.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.225
Let's just tidy this up a little bit.

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:29.710
Bringing form up to the top.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:36.200
Then this one should be the closing container for the container fluid. There we go.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.245
We can now keep all this within the container fluid,

00:08:39.245 --> 00:08:44.640
so make sure that the closing div is below the output section.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.705
Now, let's create the business card section.

00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:53.790
Let's create a bootstrap grid for this side.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.115
The class needs to be col-sm-12.

00:08:58.115 --> 00:09:00.200
Just like the left-hand section,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.420
it will be the full width of the screen on smaller devices.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.250
Then once you get to a larger device,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:15.205
we can add a col-md-6 and this will take up six parts or half the width of the screen.

00:09:15.205 --> 00:09:20.160
The left-hand section and the right-hand section will sit side-by-side.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:26.075
Then a new div, and this is going to have the id equal to

00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:31.115
card because this is the business card section.

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:36.155
We use this id for the styling and also for the JavaScript intersection.

00:09:36.155 --> 00:09:40.490
Let's put the company name into a level three heading,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.370
so let's put Company Name.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.460
We'll just put that as a placeholder until the user add some information into the form,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.430
and then that will override the text of company name.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.700
We need to give it an id. Because we are now on the output section,

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:05.015
we can add the id of outputCompany.

00:10:05.015 --> 00:10:08.300
Then next we need to do the output message,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:15.360
which is this section here.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.680
Below the level three heading,

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.585
let's put this in p tags and then the id of

00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:29.520
outputMessage and this is going to have a bootstrap class of small,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.785
just so it's a little bit smaller than the rest of the text,

00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:39.510
and then the text of Company Message and then duplicate this section.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:44.195
This is going to be for your name or the user's name,

00:10:44.195 --> 00:10:47.235
so the text is Your Name.

00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:50.385
We can keep the bootstrap class of small,

00:10:50.385 --> 00:11:00.135
but this time change the output to have an id of outputName and duplicate this again.

00:11:00.135 --> 00:11:03.360
This is the outputJob.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.710
Again, the class is small and the name of Job Title.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.930
Let's take a look. It's done, it's come together now.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.615
After the job title,

00:11:17.615 --> 00:11:22.110
we need to also add the e-mail and telephone number.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.765
Let's duplicate this two more times so

00:11:27.765 --> 00:11:36.520
outputEmail and the text can be of Email:.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:48.970
Lastly, outputTelephone and the name of Tel: with a colon at the end.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.840
I should bring that up a little bit closer and save.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.745
That should be it, once you refresh.

00:11:56.745 --> 00:11:58.755
If you go over to the project,

00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:03.900
and there's all our information on the business card on the right-hand side.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.665
That's the user interface section all complete.

00:12:06.665 --> 00:12:12.990
In the next video, we'll move on to adding some CSS and also move on to the JavaScripts.
