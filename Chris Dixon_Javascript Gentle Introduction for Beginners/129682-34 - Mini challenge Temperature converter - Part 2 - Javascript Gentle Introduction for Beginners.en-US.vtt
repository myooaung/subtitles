00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.780
Welcome back. So we've now got the user interface

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.420
completed for our temperature converter app.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.090
So in this video, we're going to finish it all off by

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.820
adding the JavaScript functions to make sure

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.970
that the user inputs is converted to Celsius or to Fahrenheit.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.375
So let's head back over to your text editor and then we'll work inside the script tags.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.610
So we create two functions.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.170
The first one was to Celsius and then one to Fahrenheit,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.830
which is going to take the input entered in

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.170
the input field and then convert it to Celsius or to Fahrenheit.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.005
Then we're going to display the results inside this p tag there.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:48.270
So let's create the to Celsius function to begin with.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.140
So create the function, to Celsius.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.560
So to create this, I'm going to create

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.980
a variable called Celsius and then inside this variable,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.520
I want to store the value of the user input.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.770
So document.getElementByID, and the ID that we

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.305
want to grab is the user input from the form.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:23.060
So place that inside the brackets and then we want to grab the value of this user input.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.610
So now we've got the value of the user's input.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.975
We want to create a calculation to convert this to Celsius.

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:36.590
So it begins with the value minus 32 and then because we're going to multiply this value,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.540
let's put this inside the brackets and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.845
then let's multiply this value by 5 and then we need to divide it by 9.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:52.870
This is the calculation that we need to convert to Celsius.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.215
So now we've got the value of the Celsius stored inside this variable.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:59.930
Let's now round it to the nearest whole number.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.770
So Celsius is now going to be equal to Math.round.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.020
The number that we want round is the Celsius variable.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.150
So put that inside the brackets.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.725
So now let's display the value of Celsius inside the results.

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:22.750
So document.getElementbyID.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:32.365
So let's grab the results.innerHTML and then we want to set that to the Celsius variable.

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:35.640
So let's save that and check that out in the browser.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.870
So let's put a number inside there.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.450
So let's put a value of 40.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.840
So 40 Fahrenheit, and then let's convert it to Celsius.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.340
So conversion is four.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.020
So let's make this label a little bit better by saying that

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.990
40 Fahrenheit is equal to four Celsius.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.355
So inside the inner HTML.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:03:03.490
So first of all, let's take the user input.value.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.145
So this is the value that the user enters in the field.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.870
Then plus then we'll add a string,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.465
say in a Fahrenheit is,

00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:19.565
and then let's add onto the end the Celsius variable.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:22.520
So for example, if the user put the value of five,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.685
this would say five Fahrenheit is,

00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:29.660
and then the correct conversion and then we'll

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.230
want to add a string on the end to say Celsius.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.320
So let's save that and take a look.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.490
So five Fahrenheit and then click to Celsius.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.655
So that will equal to five Fahrenheit is minus 15

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:48.960
Celsius and let's give this a go with another value.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.490
So eight is minus 13, 30.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.870
Okay, so now that side is working,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.420
we can create the Fahrenheit function.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.725
So let's make life easier.

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:07.925
Let's copy this function and then we can make some small changes.

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:11.889
So this one wants to be two Fahrenheit.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.220
So the variable of Fahrenheit.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.650
So want to start by doing the same thing.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.625
So we want to create the document.getElementByID.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:31.270
So we still want to grab the user input and the user inputs value.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.115
But this time the calculation is slightly different,

00:04:35.115 --> 00:04:44.130
so lets multiply it by 9 divided by 5 plus 32.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.200
So let's just change the Celsius variable back to Fahrenheit and also in the Math.round.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.850
We still want to grab the result label and change the inner HTML.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.330
But this time, this needs to be Celsius

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.255
and then this needs to be the Fahrenheit variable

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:08.915
and the string again needs to be Fahrenheit.

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:11.225
Okay, so let's save that and take a look.

00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:14.780
So let's put a value inside there and see if this works.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.175
So that's not working, so let's go back over and check why.

00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:23.160
So we got the Fahrenheit function.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:33.220
No it all looks okay so let's check the inputs, we got a spelling mistake.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.590
There needs to be H inside the,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.665
so save that and let's try again.

00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:45.120
So 30 Celsius should be equal to 86 Fahrenheit and let's just try one more.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.010
So 10 Celsius is 50 Fahrenheit.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.565
Okay great, so that's all working now and that's the end of this video.

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:58.650
So I do hope you managed to achieve that by yourself and get it all working correctly,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.710
and I hope you enjoyed this challenge.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.179
I'll see you in the next video where we'll take a look at JavaScript events.
