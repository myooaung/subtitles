00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.545
Welcome back. In this video we're going to take a look

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:07.780
at another mini-challenge called the Name-animator.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.070
If you've understood how onclick Events work,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.985
particularly the way that we change an element once a button is clicked,

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.510
you shouldn't have any problems completing this challenge.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.930
All I want you to do is to add your name to the top of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.090
the page and then create some buttons which then manipulates these elements.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.320
So in my case I've created one which makes the text big.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.355
We can change the color, we can say

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:37.350
all the characters to be

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.415
capital letters and then we can hide the name and then show it again.

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:45.830
So it's just a good chance to put some things into practice,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.870
and get them into memory.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.720
You should be able to give that a go, and if not,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.175
just follow along with me as I create this.

00:00:54.175 --> 00:00:56.700
Back in the Dom section,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.315
let's create a new folder which is number five,

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:03.070
and this is name animator.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.910
Open that up and change the title,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.930
and then let's begin with a blank page.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.105
In this video, I want to handle the clicks in a slightly different way.

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.535
You can trigger a function if you want,

00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:37.660
but I'm going to show you a slightly different way to do that.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.985
Inside the body let's just create our name.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:44.445
I'm just going to put that in p tags,

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:47.805
so the Id equal to name,

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:50.235
and then put your name inside of that,

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:56.100
and then let's create the five buttons which are all input types of button.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.930
You can create more buttons or less buttons if you prefer.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.130
So the type is button and then just to make it look a little nicer,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.770
let's add some Bootstrap classes, so,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.500
btn btn-info, the value

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.000
which is just a text which appears inside the button of big,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.395
and then an onclick event.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:25.520
Onclick is equal to, and then this time,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.830
instead of triggering a function,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.460
I'm going to actually put the JavaScript inside the quotations.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:41.255
So document.getElementById, and then inside the brackets,

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:43.220
we need to put the Id,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.730
which in our case is name.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.730
Place that inside of there and then hopefully you can remember how

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.050
to add CSS styles from the manipulator in elements video,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.890
That was dot style and then dot

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:06.120
font size equal to 100 pixels,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.400
and this in fact wants to be in single quotes,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.110
because we have the double quotes on the very outside there.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.160
This is just a slightly different way of laying this out,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.210
and it should work exactly the same,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.995
so, as you're saving, check inside the browser.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.365
So there's our name and then you've clicked big,

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:30.770
we should get the text change to 100 pixels.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.910
Just before we move on, I'm going to add a couple of styles in the head section.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.535
Just to get this in the center, the body,

00:03:41.535 --> 00:03:51.760
let's set the width to be 100 percent and then text align in the center,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.235
and then just a couple of styles to our name.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.865
So add an Id of name,

00:03:58.865 --> 00:04:06.160
let's create the font size of 60 pixels,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.810
and then the color, I want mine to be blue.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.510
[inaudible] has pushed it all into the center,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.020
and just added some color to our name,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.010
and you can change that to whatever you want,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.500
so be as creative as you want to be.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.225
That's our first button,

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:28.010
all working correctly, so,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.415
now it's just the case of creating more buttons with various CSS styles.

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:35.670
We can either type this all out,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.060
or you can just copy and paste, or duplicate.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.610
So I'm just going to copy that,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.770
and then paste that below.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.990
I want my second button to change the color of the text,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.630
so, let's give this a value of change color,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.995
[inaudible] at the style dot color to be equal to red,

00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:01.080
or any color which you like,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.970
so mine is going to be red.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.155
If we refresh and click change color,

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:08.610
there's the red styling.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.800
Now let's create a button to transform the text to be all uppercase.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.260
So the button value is capitals,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.770
and then this time the style dot text transform,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.330
and then this is going to be equal to uppercase,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.030
and then two more buttons.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.290
This one is to hide the button,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:47.500
and to hide the button we do the style dot visibility.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.540
So visibility is equal to hidden.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:00.390
The last one is to make the elements appear again, this is show,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.480
and then style dot visibility once again,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.640
then this is equal to visible.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.250
There's our five buttons, so save that.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.425
Okay. Let's try all the buttons and see they're all working, big's working,

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:24.420
change color is, all changing to capitals,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.760
hide, and then show.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.365
There we go. I hope you manage to do that by yourself.

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:32.870
It's quite a simple challenge but it does give you

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.605
the chance to put into practice what you've been learning,

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:38.775
so it's really useful to give that go yourself.

00:06:38.775 --> 00:06:42.140
Thank you, and we'll now move on to the final project.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.085
We will create a business card application.

00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:48.210
Thank you and I'll see you in the next section.
