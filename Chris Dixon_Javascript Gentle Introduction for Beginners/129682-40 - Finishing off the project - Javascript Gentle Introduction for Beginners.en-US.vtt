00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.750
Welcome back. This is the last video of the Business Card Designer project.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.080
We're going to continue from where we left in the last video.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.590
We're going to start by setting the "Text Align" property.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.715
If you remember, inside the index page,

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.460
if we look for the "Text Align" section,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.350
which is just there, we pasted in some values and

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.255
onclick we created a function or we're going to create a function called "textAlign."

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.770
This is going to take in a parameter and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.305
the parameter which we are going to use is the id of this button.

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:44.210
We set the id to be the same as

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.105
the Bootstrap class of "text-left", "text-center", and "text-right".

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:51.560
Every time the button is clicked,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.550
the id will be changed to one of these three values,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.850
and then we can grab this id and then change it to be a

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.445
"class" and then that will apply the Bootstrap styles and align the text accordingly.

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.455
I'll show you how to do that now inside the JavaScript file.

00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:11.380
Let's create a function.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.180
This function was called textAlign.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.990
I'm going to give the parameter a name of selected_id.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.790
Then inside the function,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.970
we'll do a document.getElementById.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.460
Then we want to select the card once again,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.120
but then we want to add a class name equal to the selected_id.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.095
I hope that makes sense.

00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:55.965
Selected_id will pull in the id from the bond and then once it's got the id,

00:01:55.965 --> 00:02:02.320
such as text-right, you will then use the id and set it as a class name.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.145
Effectively, it will look like this.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.485
className equals text-right.

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:08.960
That is a Bootstrap class,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.915
which will make all the text appear on the right-hand side,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:15.750
and the same for text-left and text-center.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.980
Let's save that and check it's working okay.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.995
Text Align center, right, and left.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.850
Now we need to move on to your name,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.165
and your name had a function called printName.

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:36.270
Then let's create that now in the custom.js.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.430
A new function, printName.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.260
We could do this in the same way as earlier with document.getElementById.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.310
The Id that we want to grab is in the output section.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.690
We need to grab output name and then set

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.975
the inner HTML to be the same as the input section.

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:08.385
InputName. Then when you scrub the value and save that.

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.680
Now in the print name section,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.570
let's just add something into that.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.520
You can see as we're typing it's being printed to the business card side.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.785
printJob is pretty much exactly the same too.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.975
Let's copy the function.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.630
This time printJob.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:35.715
The output name is outputJob and input name change to inputJob.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:39.520
Then email and telephone section.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.060
printEmail, grab

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.935
the outputEmail and then inputEmail.value.

00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:55.650
But instead of just printing the email,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.345
we want the string of e-mail to appear just before it.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:03.745
Just add that in with a colon and a space,

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:08.920
and then add on the input that the user has entered inside the form.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.040
Then the same for the telephone number.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.810
Copy that function.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.820
This function is printTelephone.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.500
The element we want to grab is outputTelephone.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.750
The innerHTML is inputTelephone.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.660
Then change email in the string to be Tel and then save that.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.935
Then let's refresh the browser and then we can

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:46.210
add some values into the rest of the form and check it's all working.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.280
Company 1.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.560
I'll just add some text into these and check it's all

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.145
working. Change the background color.

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:03.910
That's working and the tax is also changing.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.640
The Text Align, that's all working correctly.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.420
Your name, the job title,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.630
the email is working correctly.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.835
There is a string that we'll put in front of of email and we

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:30.040
should get the same for the telephone number. I'm going to add that in there.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.950
We got the string of tell in front of the number.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.495
Great. That's all working.

00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:40.380
There's just one more thing to do and that is the buttons at the bottom.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.005
I'm going to start with the Submit Form.

00:05:43.005 --> 00:05:45.885
All I want to do with the formSubmit.

00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:49.170
All I want to do with the Submit button is to create

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.610
an alert to alert the user if certain values have been left blank or in other words,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.360
we can put in the required fields and then create a function

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.290
for the Clear button to reset all the sections of the form.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.270
Let's start with the Submit button.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.890
Let's create a function called formSubmit.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.130
This is the function name that we used inside the index page.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:27.960
If we scroll down to the bottom and then look for the Submit button, which is just here,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.525
and there's the formSubmit button,

00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:32.070
which I've spelled incorrectly,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.335
so formSubmit and then let's create that now,

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:39.000
so it'll do an if statement.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.840
So "if" and an exclamation mark,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.960
which means not, so inputName.value.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.725
This is checking if there is not a value inside the input name.

00:06:56.725 --> 00:07:00.800
Then we need to create an alert to the user.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.500
"Please complete all required sections."

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:17.320
Save that. Now we've put in the inputName and we've check if there's no value.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.160
Now if we don't put a name inside the input fields and we click,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.590
Submit, we'll get the alert box,

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.905
which is, "Please complete all required sections."

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:32.280
But if we were to have a name inside there and then click,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.445
Submit, we don't get the alert popping up.

00:07:35.445 --> 00:07:39.655
I've only used the name section as a required field.

00:07:39.655 --> 00:07:41.800
You can put as many as you want inside

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.675
the "if" statement to test if there's any value or if it's being left blank.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.550
Well, I'm just going to leave it now as

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.570
the name and then move on to create the formReset.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:59.060
A new function at the bottom and we'll call this formReset.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.465
The way I'm going to refresh the page is by selecting the

00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:14.300
window.location.reload and this will

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.640
clear all the information inside

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.440
the business card and also the form by doing a page refresh.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.000
We save that. Just to add some information into

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.050
the business card and then click on the Clear button and that should reload page.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.584
Let's just check for any spelling mistakes,

00:08:36.584 --> 00:08:42.375
so formReset, then index page.

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:44.760
That just needs to be formReset.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.215
So save that and that should fix our problem and refresh.

00:08:49.215 --> 00:08:53.175
Add some more information into there.

00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:55.290
Then now hopefully when we click,

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.530
Clear, that clears the form.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.314
That's it. That's the end of this project.

00:09:02.314 --> 00:09:04.700
I really do hope you manage to get to the end

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.670
by yourself or at least complete a section of it.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.820
Feel free to customize this as much as you want.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.755
But for now, thanks very much,

00:09:12.755 --> 00:09:15.420
and I hope you've enjoyed the project.
