00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.144
So far in this course, we've looked at string basics,

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:08.550
such as storing a string into a variable and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.290
also joining strings but there is so much more we can do with strings.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.035
Now we're going to take a look at some very useful string methods.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:21.575
If you go into your JavaScript folder and then into the JavaScript basics.

00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:26.115
I want to duplicate the last folder we created.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:30.550
I'm going to name this number 5 string methods,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.930
then open up in your text editor.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.440
I'll just make it a little bit bigger,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:57.765
and then change the title to string methods, and then go down.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:01.540
I'm just going to delete the code that we wrote in the last video.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.900
String methods allows us to do a lot more with strings.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.645
The first example I'm going to show you is converting a string to uppercase.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:17.690
Let's start by creating a variable called string and I'm just going to set that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.710
to learning JavaScript add a semicolon,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.410
and then I'm going to create a second variable.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.750
I'm going to call that new string.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.405
We're going to set the value of new string equal to the original string.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:42.280
That's the variable name, and then dot,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.440
and then two uppercase then the curly brackets and semicolon.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.135
Don't forget the couple of layers on every word after the first one.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:57.425
Now we've converted the string to be uppercase.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:00.445
Let's now alert the new string.

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:02.895
We can check that's working okay.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.790
Alert, what do we need to alert?

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.925
That's the value of the new string.

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:10.680
Place that in the brackets,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.540
and then open up in your browser.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.115
There we go, great. There's our original string

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:22.150
and it's all being changed to capital letters.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.240
We can do a similar thing,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.715
but we can convert to lowercase.

00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:28.635
You can probably guess how to do that,

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:34.609
we just need to change string dot to lowercase,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.015
and then open that up and check it's working.

00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:43.660
There we go, so all the capitals have been changed to lowercase now.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.940
The next method I'm going to show you is what's called string replace.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.625
That is when we look for a certain section or a certain word in the string.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.395
We can replace that word.

00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:01.405
Let's just make a slightly longer string.

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:10.650
I want to learn JavaScript to build websites.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.790
Again, we're taking the value of the original string,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.645
and the method we're going to use is string.replace,

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:22.680
and then inside the brackets,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.535
we're going to put in two parameters.

00:03:24.535 --> 00:03:28.360
The first one is going to be the word that we want to replace.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.110
I'm going to change websites and then separate it by a comma.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.755
We put in the word that we want to put in its place,

00:03:37.755 --> 00:03:40.440
so I'm going to change that to games.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.010
Now when we take a look at the alert,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.865
we should see websites has been changed to games.

00:03:45.865 --> 00:03:48.775
So go to the browser and refresh,

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.650
and that's exactly what we want.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.600
I want to learn JavaScript to build games.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.645
As well as replacing individual words,

00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:04.205
we can actually split the string up either into individual characters,

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:06.650
or we can split up all the individual words.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.995
The way to do that is by using the split method.

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:15.950
I'm just going to go back to the original string of learning

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.460
JavaScript and then delete the contents inside the brackets.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.370
This time we're going to use string.split,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.010
and then what we'll put inside the brackets,

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.940
determines exactly where the split is in the string.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.145
If you just put a empty string or quotations with nothing in it,

00:04:37.145 --> 00:04:40.865
the string will be split up into individual characters.

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.980
Just refresh the page,

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.540
and you can see with the comma,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.060
that the string has been split up,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.200
and it's all now individual characters.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.675
If we wanted to split it up into individual words rather than characters,

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:55.415
we can put a space.

00:04:55.415 --> 00:04:59.885
The space in the string will be the marker for where to split that string.

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:02.465
Now we should get two separate words.

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:06.260
Refresh. Now we've got the word, learning and the word,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.895
JavaScript separated by a comma,

00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:11.040
so now they're individual strings.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.020
Now we've got two separate words there.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.980
We can access the individual words by the index number inside the square brackets.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.930
If we want to access the first word,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.735
that would be position 0.

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:29.115
Save and then refresh.

00:05:29.115 --> 00:05:30.690
Now, we've got the word learning,

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.000
and if we want the word JavaScript,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.680
change that to the second word,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.855
which is position 1.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.705
Now we get the word JavaScript.

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:45.260
So now we've split the string into two separate words.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.985
We can join these back together by using the concat method.

00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:51.920
Now we've got two separate words.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.115
We're going to create a new variable.

00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:56.340
I'll just add this above the alert,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.650
so I'll call this joined string,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.230
and then to add the two strings together,

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.215
we're going to select the first word.

00:06:07.215 --> 00:06:10.020
That was in the new string variable,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.260
and then just as we did with the alert,

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.960
we're going to set that to position 0,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.085
which is the word learning and then dot and then concat,

00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:22.550
and then inside the brackets,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.150
we're going to add the second string that we want to join on.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.965
Hopefully you've worked out what that is.

00:06:27.965 --> 00:06:31.490
That is new string and then the square brackets,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:38.880
and position 1, and then now we need to alert the joined string.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.620
Let's just get rid of that and paste joined string in and then refresh. There we go.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.040
You can see the string has been joined into

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.590
one string and there's no comma in-between them. That's good.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.860
The last method I'm going to show you is the string slice.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.275
Let's just get rid of the joined string variable.

00:07:02.275 --> 00:07:05.615
Again, we're going to manipulate the original string,

00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:09.190
but this time we want to use dot slice.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.175
Put the curly brackets again,

00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:13.125
and the slice method,

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:16.035
it has a start and an end position.

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:19.900
You can slice out a certain section of the string.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.175
The first value is required,

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.990
and that is the start position.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.370
I'm going to start with number 2 and then separated by a comma,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.950
and the second value is optional,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.955
which is the end position.

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:40.215
I'm going to use number 6 and then alert the new string. Let's take a look at that.

00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:42.630
We got the word arni there,

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.125
which is this part of the string.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:48.420
That's position 2, so 0, 1,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.525
2, and then all the way through to six.

00:07:51.525 --> 00:07:53.700
That's the end of this video.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.630
I hope you've now got a better idea of how you can

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.585
manipulate strings using string methods.

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:01.880
Do take a look at the cheat sheet,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.280
which was provided at the start of the course.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.075
There's one or two more string methods on there which you may find useful.

00:08:08.075 --> 00:08:10.045
Have a little play around with them.

00:08:10.045 --> 00:08:13.800
For now, thank you, and we'll see you in the next video.
