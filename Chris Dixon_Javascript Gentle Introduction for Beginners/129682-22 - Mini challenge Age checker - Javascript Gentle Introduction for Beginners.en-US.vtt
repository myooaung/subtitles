00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.790
Welcome back. Now, it's your chance to give if

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.955
else statements to go with a mini challenge.

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:11.665
It's quite a simple challenge,

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:13.960
if you understood the last few videos.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.130
However, it gives you the chance to type away on your own without watching me,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.370
and that way it should stick in your memory a bit better.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.479
Just duplicate the last video on else-if statements,

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:28.205
and then this is number 3,

00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:33.890
and the mini challenge is going to be called age-checker.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.450
Then open the app in your text editor, drag in the folder,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.100
and then open up the index page,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.920
change the title to Age checker and delete this code of that, so we don't cheat.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.005
Okay, so this is fairly straightforward.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.775
All I want you to do is to create a few variables,

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:14.360
one for a minimum age and one for your current age.Then create an if-else statement,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.950
just like we used in the last video.Then do a couple of checks.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.310
First of all, check if your age is below the minimum age,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.360
and then create a message to the browser.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.915
When we search us, please come back when you're 18.

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:33.340
Then a couple more conditions such as if you're old

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.195
enough or if your a certain age to check your identification.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:41.680
Give the Ago which just uses things that we've learned in the last video.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.920
There's nothing extra that you need to try to research or Google.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.880
Try that and see how it get on.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.360
If you do get stuck or if you don't feel confident enough to try this here,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.385
just follow along with me.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:02:00.460
I'm going to create a variable of minimum age.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.930
I want to set that to 18.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:12.220
Then a variable, which is your age and it's going to be 15, for example.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.320
Then create your if statement below.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.620
If you prefer to lay this all out empty

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.070
first just to make sure you've got everything in the right place.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.160
Just like this, it can be useful just to make sure we don't miss any braces or brackets.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.880
Okay. So first of all, we want to check if you're under age.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.790
We check the variable, yourAge.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.350
If yourAge is less than the minAge,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.120
we'll create a message to the user with the document.write.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.555
Inside the brackets, "Sorry,

00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:04.715
please come back when you are 18".

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:08.825
Then I'm going to create a else-if statement.

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:13.415
I'm going to check if your age is 25 or under,

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:17.635
and then create a message to supply some identification.

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:25.000
If your current age is greater than or equal to 18,

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.870
then the two ampersand symbols to also check the second condition.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.475
Then yourAge is less than or equal to 25.

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:43.270
We want it to be a greater than symbol.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.780
So if you're over 18, but under 25,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.590
we'll create a new message to supply some identification.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.920
This time the message is "Please supply identification".

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.000
We've got all conditions matter,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.150
[inaudible] use is equal to 25.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.740
The else statement at the end provides the fallback if the user is over 25.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.570
In that case we'll just create a document.write just allowing the user to enter.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:26.550
Please enter and then save that.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.570
Let's test this in the browser and see this all works.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.845
Currently the user is underage.

00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:37.950
We should get the sorry message from the If statement,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.250
which we do, "Sorry, please come back when you are 18."

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.745
If the user now is between 18 and 25,

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:52.480
we should get the please reply identification message.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.169
Then lastly, if the user is over 25,

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.630
it should be allowed to enter the website.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.070
So refresh, and there we go.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.935
We get the final message of please enter.

00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:09.410
So well done if you manage to do that on your own,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.345
if it was something you did struggle with,

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:13.775
don't worry.Now you followed along with me,

00:05:13.775 --> 00:05:16.200
may be do a skip a day or two and try that again

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.280
yourself and see if you can work out next time.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.990
Both now, thank you. I'll see you in the next video.
