00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.195
Okay, so now the user interface section is all finished for our business card project.

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:11.175
Let's now move on to the styling and also add a bit of JavaScript to get this working.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.815
So head back over to Brackets,

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.470
and then we need to start in the style.css.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.435
The first thing I want to do is move the Level 1 Heading

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:25.560
into the center and just make it a little bit more spaced out.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:35.340
So h1 and then add some text alignments to the center and also some padding.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.805
So 20 pixels on the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:45.425
Then let's add some styling to the business card.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:46.865
In the index page,

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:50.840
we'll give the business card a ID of card,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.600
so we can use that in styles of the CSS.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.685
So let's give it some width of 400 pixels,

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:07.194
a height of 250 pixels,

00:01:07.194 --> 00:01:15.020
and then a border to go around the business card of 1 pixel and a solid line,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.205
and then just little bit of padding of 10 pixels,

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:23.970
and this will keep all the text within the outside edge.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.780
Now, it just looks a little bit more like a business card.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.535
In fact, we'll just put a horizontal rule just above your name.

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:34.510
So back into the index page.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.640
Let's just put hr after the Company Message.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.745
So there's your [inaudible] faint horizontal rule,

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:47.380
just to separate the company name with the person's information.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.350
Now let's add some styles to the background section of the form.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.955
So we'll give this form section a custom class of background.

00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:02.110
So let's use that in the style.css.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:11.249
So let's give it a background color of a light-gray color, which is eee,

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:16.185
and a little bit of padding of 30 pixels,

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:19.670
and then some margin on the bottom and this,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.615
you're going to be set to 30 pixels.

00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:23.735
This is just for the mobile view.

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:26.840
So when the form is stacked on top of the business card,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.595
it will just keep a little bit of distance between the two. Then save that.

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:34.460
So now we've got a slight background color to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.690
separate the form section from the business card.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.510
That's looking a little bit better now.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.425
We've got the user interface all completed,

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:45.545
and we've added some styling to make it look a little bit nicer.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.515
So now let's move on to adding some JavaScript,

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:50.510
to actually getting this to work.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.060
So we want the user's inputs from the left to then appear on the right-hand side,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.820
and then populate the business card so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.910
the user can see exactly what their card will look like.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.025
So let's go into the custom.js.

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:09.725
We can create the functions that we created inside the index page.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:14.020
So the first one we need to do is printCompany.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.045
This is the first function to create.

00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:26.110
So just copy that and then go over to the custom.js, function printCompany.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.465
Okay, so what exactly do we want this function to do?

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:33.905
Well, if we take a look at our index page,

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:40.925
what we want the function to do is to grab the HTML elements on the right-hand side.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:44.725
So we need to do it with document.getElementByID.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.340
So this is outputCompany,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.910
and then we need to change the innerHTML to be

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.785
the contents of the inputCompany on the left-hand side.

00:03:55.785 --> 00:04:01.785
So let's do that now. So document.getElementById.

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:06.040
So we need to grab the outputCompany,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:16.450
and then we need to set the innerHTML to then be equal to the inputCompany.value.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.955
So let's save that and see if that's working okay.

00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:28.270
Refresh, so now we should be able to type a company name

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.210
inside there and because we used on keyup as the event handler,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.525
we can now see the contents displayed on the right-hand side,

00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:40.835
and this triggers a function every time a key is pressed.

00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:44.350
So let's move on now to the Company Message.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.310
Just copy this function,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.660
and then we can paste it below.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.460
The function was called printMessage,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.690
and then the element that we wanted to grab was outputMessage.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.560
So we're setting the innerHTML of outputMessage to be inputMessage.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.970
Then next, instead of the innerHTML,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.920
we need to change the CSS to change the background color and also the text color.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:25.600
So function, and the function name was changeBg.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.070
Of course, if you use any different function names in the index page,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.225
just change them accordingly inside the JavaScript file.

00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:35.720
Okay, so to begin with,

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.650
we need to grab the value or the user's input value,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.910
and I'm going to store that inside a variable called bgColor.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:51.840
So the bgColor is equal to document.getElementById and the ID

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.995
we want to grab is the inputBg and then.value.

00:05:59.995 --> 00:06:06.155
So now we've got the user's input value stored inside a variable called bgColor.

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:08.840
Now we can set the business-card side.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.660
So document.getElementById, and the ID we want to grab.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.300
So the background color we want to change is the full business card section,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.565
and this had the ID of card.

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:30.519
So add card into there and then.style.color,

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:34.939
and then we're going to set this equal to the user's input,

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:37.115
which is stored inside this variable.

00:06:37.115 --> 00:06:41.075
So paste that in there with a semicolon.

00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:43.890
Let's check that's working okay.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.390
Go to the Background Color and select the background that you want.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.980
That's actually changing the color of the text,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:59.240
so we just need to change our style.background. So save that.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.510
Then now when we change the color,

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.480
it should change the background color rather than the text, so there we go.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.470
That little mistake there should have gave you

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.295
a clue on how we're going to do the text color next.

00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:19.875
So copy this function and then paste up.

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:23.350
The function is changeText.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.550
Just like before, this can be a variable called textColor.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.510
Then input we want to grab is inputText.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.960
So this is grabbing the value that the user has selected.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.520
Again, document.getElementById, and we'll select the full business card,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.210
and then the style needs to have the color property.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:08:00.910
This is going to be equal to the variable of textColor. Let's just check that.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.800
The Background Color is working fine,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.300
and then the Text color,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.020
okay, good, that's all changing.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.265
So let's just refresh that.

00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:20.455
Okay, so now these colors are all working.

00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:24.530
We'll leave this video there before it gets too long and come back in

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:29.940
the next video where we'll finish off all the rest of the JavaScript for the project.
