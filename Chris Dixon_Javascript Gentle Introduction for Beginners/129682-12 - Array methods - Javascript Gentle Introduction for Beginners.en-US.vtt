00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.865
So as with strings we looked at a few videos ago,

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:09.660
arrays also have various array methods and we can use,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.355
which can be really useful.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:13.935
So let's start with a new folder.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.810
And this is number eight,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.675
and this is array methods.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:27.159
So rename the folder array methods and open the open in brackets.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.475
Then let's rename this.

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:41.075
So array methods, and then we can actually reuse this array that we created before.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:45.425
So, if you wanted to add an extra value into this array,

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.455
we can use the push method.

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:51.635
The way to do that, is we use the array's name,

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:56.545
which is users dot push,

00:00:56.545 --> 00:01:00.135
with the brackets afterwards, and a semicolon.

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:04.295
Then inside the brackets we put the value that we want to add.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.545
So, I'm going to create a new user called,

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:11.490
Tom, and then just remove the length property there.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.715
So, let's save and open that up in the browser.

00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:17.260
So now you can see we've got four values now,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.170
and Tom has been placed onto the end of the array.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.140
But if we wanted to add Tom to the start of the array,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.870
we can use a method called unshift,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.840
and then save that, and refresh.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.065
Now Tom is added to the start of the array,

00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:41.885
and we can also remove values from the array in a similar kind of way.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.625
So instead of unshift,

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:48.655
we can use the Shift method and this will remove the first element of an array.

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:53.430
Just leave the brackets empty, and then refresh.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.805
Now you can see that the value of Chris,

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:58.705
which is the first value, has been removed.

00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:01.655
We can also remove the last value of an array,

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.635
with the pop method.

00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:06.380
So, users dot pop,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.760
and this should remove Paul,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.335
off the end of the array,

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:13.230
and refresh, and now we're just left with Chris, and Mike.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.180
Okay, and we can also reverse the order of the values in the array,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.280
by using the reverse method.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.880
Now we should get Paul, Mike,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.405
and Chris appearing in that order.

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:31.745
Okay, so before we looked at adding values,

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:34.010
and removing values from the beginning,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.495
and the end of the array.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:37.520
We can also use the slice method,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.810
which will remove a value out of an array between a certain point.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.290
So we'll do that, will actually create a new variable.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.160
We'll call this Slice,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.800
and that's going to be equal to, users dot slice.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.165
Then inside the brackets we put in two values.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.620
So the first value that we want to enter is the start position.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.400
So if we wanted to remove Mike,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.445
that is our position one.

00:03:08.445 --> 00:03:11.435
If you remember, the first index is zero,

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:12.890
and then separated by a comma,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.570
we put in the second value,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.685
which is the end position.

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:19.355
So we want this to end just before a Paul,

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:21.730
which is value two.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.700
Then document right, the slice variable, and save that.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.250
Now when we check that out in the browser,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.370
we should see that the value of Mike will display,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.950
so save, and refresh, and there we go.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.900
So we've got the value of Mike appearing on the screen.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.570
We can use the start,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.370
and end positions to pull out any value that we want inside the array.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.830
If you check out the cheat sheet provided,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.810
they're some more additional array methods that you can have a play around with.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.509
I'll see you in the next video, where we'll take a look at JavaScript functions.
