00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.845
Welcome to another mini challenge.

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:10.110
This is the exciting part of the course where you get

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.445
to put into practice what you've been learning so far.

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:15.255
In this mini challenge,

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:18.390
we're going to format a user's name.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.045
We've all done it, we've all put the capital on

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.075
accidentally or in the wrong place when typing.

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:28.395
Sometimes got a couple of letters where they shouldn't be in our names.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:32.790
I'm just going to get started and then you can do that by yourself.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.000
Number 6 challenge-name-formatter,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.120
then open up this folder.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.230
I'm going to change the title to Name Formatter,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.590
and then delete this section.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.415
I'm just going to get you started.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:09.285
I'm going to create a variable called name,

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:13.280
then you need to put your name inside the quotations.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.605
But with some misplaced capital letters, just like that.

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:22.940
What I'd like you to do is use some of the string methods

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.460
that we looked at in the last video and format your name.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.910
The first letter is a capital of

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.930
your first second name and then all the rest to be lowercase.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.420
So pause the video and give it a go,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.780
trying it yourself is really the best way to learn.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.019
If you get stuck or have any problems,

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.510
I'll go through exactly how I would have done it.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.555
This is what I would've done.

00:01:51.555 --> 00:01:53.870
As with many things in programming,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.750
there's various different ways you can approach this.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.190
But I'm going to break it down into some variables to start with.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.855
I'm going to start with a variable called split.

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:10.505
I'm going to split the name into two separate words so it can work individually.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.200
To split the first and the second name,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.830
we want to use the split method that we looked at in the last video, so name.split.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.705
Hopefully, you remember how to do that.

00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:28.780
Just create a space and I'll recognize where the split is.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.200
Now we've got the two individual words stored in a variable called split.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.680
It's not going to create a variable for each one of these words.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:48.135
So variable name1 is equal to split on the position zero.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.650
So that's the first word.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.665
Name2 is equal to split,

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:57.920
and then number one,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.840
which is the second position.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.950
Now we've got the first name into a variable.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.680
I'm now going to format that name,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.910
so I'm going to call this variable formattedName1,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.650
so that's equal to name1.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.750
Then we need to make the first character a capital.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.680
I'm going to slice the first letter.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.235
The two parameters we need to put in is position zero to start at the beginning,

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.600
and then to end a position one.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.250
It's only going to slice the first character.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.365
Then to make this a capital,

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:48.680
we're going to set it to uppercase,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.770
and don't forget the brackets.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.400
As it stands, this variable is only containing a capital C,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.544
so we need to add onto the end of it the rest of the characters in lowercase.

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:14.510
After that name1.slice, we're going to slice the remaining section,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.650
but we're just going to put one parameter in there.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.190
It's going to start at position one and then be all the way

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.080
to the end of the string,.toLowerCase.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.390
Let's just create alert,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.685
just to see if that's working okay.

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:39.220
Once you alert formattedName1;

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.890
great, that's all working.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.510
We can do the same with the second name.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:55.255
I'm just going to copy this section and then change it to formattedName2.

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:57.835
This method will work exactly the same,

00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:06.080
but we just need to change name1 to name2 and check that's working again.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.030
Great. We've got the two individual names which are correctly formatted.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.995
We just need to join them together.

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:19.310
I'm going to create a variable called newName.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:28.005
That's going to be equal to the formattedName1 plus formattedName2,

00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:33.220
and that's alert the new name.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.290
We needed that. We've got the formatted name appearing,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.590
we just need to put a space in-between.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.165
We can do that between formattedName1 and 2.

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:53.910
Just add a space in there and another plus symbol.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.870
Hopefully, that should be it now. There we go.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.970
So that's a correctly formatted name.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.510
I hope you did give that a go and worked all by yourself.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.010
If not, don't worry.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.005
Hopefully, now you know how to do it.

00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:10.390
More mini challenges as we go on throughout the course.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.490
Thank you for watching,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.080
and we'll see you in the next video.
