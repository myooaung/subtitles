00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.350
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.640
we're going to take a look at JavaScript numbers on basic arithmetic.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.630
If you go into the JavaScript basics folder and

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.130
duplicate the variables folder from the last video,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.830
I want to to call mine number 2,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.720
numbers and arithmetic, then open up this in Brackets.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.010
There we go. In JavaScript so far,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.689
we've already looked at how we can assign a number to a variable,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.820
but JavaScript can do so much more with numbers.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.385
When we create a variable,

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:55.220
we'll just delete the last section there and also the heading,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.300
we don't need that anymore.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.825
So far we've looked at assigning a number to a variable, such as this,

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:10.130
but as well as assigning number 10 to the value of x,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.335
we can also put a sum in there,

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:14.480
so 10 plus 5,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:22.575
and then we can alert the variable of x and open on the browser,

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:25.870
so we get the sum of 15.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.630
As well as addition,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.045
we can also take away,

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:35.110
we should get the value of 5.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.015
We can also use division, multiplication,

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:44.330
so we change the subtract to a forward slash for divide,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.850
and we should now get the value of 2.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.200
In JavaScript, when we do a multiplication,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.515
the value we need for that is the star,

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:59.275
10 multiply by 5 should be the value of 50.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:05.300
Another interesting one to look up is the percentage symbol.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.045
This actually provides the remainder,

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:11.285
so 10 divided by 5 would be 2,

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:13.405
and there would actually be no remainder,

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:16.125
so that value will be 0.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:20.795
However, if we change the value to be 9 divided by 5,

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:26.110
5 would only go into 9 once and would leave a remainder of 4,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.840
so we get the value of 4 alert it there.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.330
As well as doing the calculations inside the variable,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.550
we can set a separate variable,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.940
and we can do the calculations inside the alert.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.275
The alert can be x multiplied by y,

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:50.845
and we should still get the same outcome.

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:54.260
Refresh, and we get 45.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.540
One thing that's really worth remembering when dealing with numbers and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.765
calculations is the order of the calculation is really important.

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:07.290
Take a look at this as an example.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.470
Variable x we'll set to 10 plus 5,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.685
which is 15, multiply by 2.

00:03:17.685 --> 00:03:19.870
We will read this from left to right,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.345
thinking 10 plus 5 is 15,

00:03:22.345 --> 00:03:25.175
multiplied by 2 equals 30,

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:26.610
but that's not actually the case,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.715
so let's just alert x and see what happens.

00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:37.360
We'll get 20. The reason we get 20 rather than 30 is because multiplication and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.249
division have a higher precedence or higher priority than addition and subtraction,

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:49.065
so the multiplication gets performed first.

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:52.035
2 times five is 10,

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:55.020
plus 10 is equal to 20,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.705
so that's why we are getting the value of 20 appearing in the alert.

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:03.080
But if we wanted to have the value of 30,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.135
one way we can solve this is by adding the brackets around the first section.

00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:12.405
This will add 10 plus 5 to start with,

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:15.855
so 15 and then multiply by 2,

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:18.300
save that and then refresh,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.430
and now, we'll get the value of 30.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.720
The last thing I want to show you in this video is how

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.735
to increment and decrement numbers.

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:35.810
Let's take a look by assigning the variable x to 10.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.140
Currently, if we let the value of x, we'll get 10,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.010
but if wanted to increment x,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.760
we could use x plus plus,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.840
and this increments the value by one every time.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.530
Now, if we refresh our browser,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.300
we should get the value of 11.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.300
If we were to do it again and duplicate that line,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.150
x would now be 12.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.770
This is really useful for things such as

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.990
increasing a player's score every time they get a point,

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.095
we'd have a variable called score,

00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:15.045
and then every time they get a point,

00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:17.550
it would be score plus plus.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.265
As well as plus plus, we can also decrement the score by one, just like that.

00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:29.365
Now, we're taking one away from 10 and we should get 9.

00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:32.790
That'll be useful for situations such as a player losing

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.765
their life in a game or reducing the player's score by one each time.

00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:42.929
Thanks for watching, and that's the end of this video on numbers and arithmetic.
