00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.110
Congratulations on getting this far.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.995
This is a new section called Control Flow and Loops.

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:11.970
In this section, we'll be taking a look at some new methods such

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.290
as if else statements and we'll be taking a look at operators,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.070
switch statements, and various types of loops.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.540
As usual, we'll throw in one or two many challenges into there,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.380
so we can put into practice what you've been

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.590
learning and see how it works in real-life examples.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.690
The first video we're going to get started with is called if statements and comparison.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.130
In JavaScript, and many of our programming languages,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.230
we can often deal with a lot of data,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.525
such as numbers and values.

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:48.800
We often need a way to compare more than one value to another and decide upon an outcome.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.965
JavaScript provides us with a way of comparing called comparison operators.

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:57.530
Then if statement test to see if a condition is true.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.300
If that condition is true,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.800
then it runs some code.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.680
Let's take a look at some examples.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.915
Because we're in a new section,

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.310
we want to create a new folder.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.915
I'll call this folder control flow and loops.

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:22.715
Then we want to go into one of the previous videos and just copy any of those,

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:26.380
and then paste in just so we got a starting point.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:35.620
Then rename this if statements and comparison.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.860
Then open up this in brackets, or your text editor.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.140
Just drag it into there and then change the title in the index page.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:02:00.130
My case is, if statements and comparison,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.395
and then remove the code between the script tags.

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:09.870
There we go. We don't need that either.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.345
To get started, we're going to take a look at

00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:18.605
a simple comparison just to compare two variables.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:27.820
Variable a equal to 10 and also variable b equal to 20.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.925
We're going to start with a simple if statement just to

00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:35.930
check if the value of a and b is the same.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.875
To get started, we use the if keyword,

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:41.299
and then a set of brackets,

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.415
and then after that, a pair of curly braces.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:49.205
With an if statement between the brackets here,

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.965
we put a condition to test.

00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:56.075
In our case we want to test if a is equal to b,

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.615
so let's just put that in there, so a,

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:03.285
and then three equals and then b.

00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:06.050
If you remember, the three equals check if

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.150
the values are equal value and also equal type.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.425
Let's check if a is equal to b, and then if it is,

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:20.560
we want to do a document write

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.050
and then it prints them out to the browser just to let us

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.050
know that the condition is true.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.765
I'm just going to write condition is true and just make it a little bit bigger.

00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:36.480
Let's put some level 2 heading tags in there.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.800
So h2 before and after,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.150
and then let's open the app in the browser and see what happens.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.935
Again, nothing is showing in the browser because the condition is not true,

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:53.840
because a is not equal to b.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.200
If we just change both the values to be the same and then refresh,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.600
we should now get the message condition is true.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.085
The if statement is all working correctly.

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:08.720
As well as the three equals,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.065
there's many different other comparisons we can use.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:15.530
We mentioned earlier on that using two equal symbols will

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.040
check if a and b is equal value but not equal type.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.505
For example, one could be a string and one could be a number.

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:25.520
If we want to check if the values are not equal,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.465
we use a exclamation mark and then an equal symbol.

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:33.140
Let's just change that to be not equal and we should still get

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.210
the condition is true, which we do there.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.480
This checks for the value.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.485
If you wanted to check for the value and type,

00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:46.345
we could use two equals and the exclamation mark.

00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:50.145
This means not equal value or type.

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:54.365
We can also use less than or greater than.

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:56.360
If a is greater than b,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.010
which it is, the condition is still true.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.460
If a was less than b,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.100
it should now be blank because the condition is false.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.395
Combining the less than and greater than with

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:17.540
a equals symbol means if a is less than or equal to b,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.180
then run this code between the braces,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.185
and exactly the same with the greater than.

00:05:23.185 --> 00:05:26.660
If a is greater than or equal to b,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.860
the condition is true. Let's refresh that.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.175
This is true because a is greater than b.

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:36.905
If b was also 20,

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:38.585
so they were equal,

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:41.835
we should also still get condition is true.

00:05:41.835 --> 00:05:44.370
Good. So I hope that makes sense.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.360
I'm just going to show you a quick example

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.055
use of how this can be used in a real life program.

00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:57.895
I'm going to just check if a user is logged in and also check the user's name.

00:05:57.895 --> 00:06:01.670
An if statement could check if a user is logged in and

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.305
then print to the browser a welcome message to that logged in user.

00:06:06.305 --> 00:06:11.210
With a variable such as logged in,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.500
I want to set this to a boolean value of true.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.015
This can be either true or false.

00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:25.910
Then a variable which stores the user's name.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.160
I want to set mine to Chris.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.250
Then just as before,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.900
we'll create a if statement.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.310
If you just want to check if a user is logged in,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.670
we can just check if logged in.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.900
We don't need to use any comparison operators such as equals,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.800
because this is already set to true. Open the variable.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.305
If the user is logged in,

00:06:55.305 --> 00:07:00.880
let's create a message for that user with a document write.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.530
This can be as simple,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.770
or as complicated as you want.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.230
I'm just going to create a welcome message to that user and then add

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:17.735
onto the end of that welcome message the variable name of the user.

00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:20.120
This should say, welcome Chris.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:26.490
Then lets open the browser. There we go.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.635
We get the welcome message because the user is set to logged in.

00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:38.435
If you change this to be false and then refresh the browser again,

00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:43.685
we should lose the message because this condition is no longer met.

00:07:43.685 --> 00:07:46.860
I hope that all makes sense to you now.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.985
If it doesn't, just take a look at some of the examples that we just used

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:53.570
and try and get your head around it before we move on to the next video,

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.760
where we'll build on the if statements by taking a look at if else statements.
