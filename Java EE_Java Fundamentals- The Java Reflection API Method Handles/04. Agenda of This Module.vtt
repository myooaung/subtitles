00:00:02.015 --> 00:00:05.615
So let us now see the agenda for this module.

2
00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:10.891
This module is about introducing the Reflection API and first of all,

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:11.916
of course,

4
00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:15.462
define the technical terms we are going to use all

5
00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:16.972
through the rest of the course.

6
00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:22.576
So we are going to see what a class is, what a field is,

7
00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:27.668
what a method is in the context of the Reflection API,

8
00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:41.000
and we are going to see how to get information on a class at runtime and all the patterns that you need to understand to be able to do that.
