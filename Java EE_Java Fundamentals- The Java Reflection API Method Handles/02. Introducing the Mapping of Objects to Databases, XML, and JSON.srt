00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,002
Mapping objects to files on databases is, of course, a very classical problem.

2
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:13,775
Everybody does that, and you have many, many standard tools to do that.

3
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:17,607
Suppose you have person objects in your application.

4
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:20,738
If you need to map those objects to a database,

5
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:26,487
you can do that with JPA, the Java Persistence API,

6
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:32,042
implemented by Hibernate on the EclipseLink just to name a few.

7
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:36,082
If you want to map those same objects to XML files or streams,

8
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:41,510
well, you can use JAX-B to do that and to save for JSON.

9
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:52,000
If you need to map them to JSON file, a very classical problem nowadays, you can use JSON-B to do that.
