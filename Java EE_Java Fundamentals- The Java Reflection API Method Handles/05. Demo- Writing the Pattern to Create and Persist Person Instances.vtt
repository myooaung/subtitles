00:00:01.962 --> 00:00:04.037
Now that we have set our DB server,

2
00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:07.613
let us begin by writing the code we want to run.

3
00:00:07.613 --> 00:00:13.450
From the examples in the slides, we want to create an EntityManager of Person.

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.597
The Person class is our example class.

5
00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:19.054
Let us call this EntityManager entityManager,

6
00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:25.045
and we want to create this EntityManager with a factory method

7
00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:29.794
EntityManager.of and pass the Person class as a parameter.

8
00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:36.673
Let us suppose we have a Person called linda = new Person.

9
00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:41.521
This one linda is called, well, Linda; age,

10
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:48.704
31; and we want a Person, james, new Person James,

11
00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:50.520
age, 24.

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.907
Let us create another Person, susan, new Person, = new Person, Susan, age 34.

13
00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:02.185
And then let us to take you to the last one,

14
00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:08.436
Person john = new Person, John, age 33.

15
00:01:08.436 --> 00:01:12.108
And the code I want to write to be able to write a Person

16
00:01:12.108 --> 00:01:17.075
object inside my database is the following,

17
00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:21.494
entityManager.Persist and pass linda as a parameter,

18
00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:25.376
and the same for james, and the same for susan,

19
00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:27.024
and the same for john.

20
00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:40.000
This is the pattern of code I want to create so that my client code is as simple as possible and all the complexity hidden in the API.
