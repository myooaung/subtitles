Let us make a quick wrap up on the three patterns we have covered here to

2
00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:11.201
get the reference on the class from our application.

3
00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:15.292
The first one is just called the getClass method from

4
00:00:15.292 --> 00:00:18.778
the object Class on any instance.

5
00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:26.914
The second one is called the .class keyword on a known type, here, String.class.

6
00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:31.292
And the third one, which leads to the Java Reflection API,

7
00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:35.931
called the forName factory method of the class Class,

8
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:45.000
passing the full name of that class along with the packages as a string of character.
