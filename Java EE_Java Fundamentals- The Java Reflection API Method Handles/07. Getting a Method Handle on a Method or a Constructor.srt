1
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:06,722
Now that we have the proper method type for the method we are looking for,

2
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:12,715
the second step consists in finding the Write method of this lookup object.

3
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:15,827
We have three available methods to find the

4
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:18,898
reference on the method or constructor.

5
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:23,218
The first one is the findVirtual method for any kind of method,

6
00:00:23,218 --> 00:00:28,369
the second one is the findConstructor method for constructors,

7
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:33,714
and the third one is the findStatic method for static methods.

8
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:38,626
So let us see the pattern of code to get a method handle on this

9
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:41,823
getName getter method from the Person class.

10
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:45,369
We have our lookup object, we have the right MethodType.

11
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:51,338
All we need to do is to call the findVirtual method on our lookup object;

12
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:56,960
pass the Person class as a parameter since what we are looking for is a

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,744
method from that Person class; pass the name,

14
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:07,305
of course, getName here; and then pass the methodType as a third parameter.

15
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:11,834
We can do the same kind of thing for the setName method.

16
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:15,685
The findVirtual called is exactly the same.

17
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:17,634
The only thing that changes, of course,

18
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:22,088
is the name of the method and the methodType object.

19
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:25,143
Let us see the pattern for the constructor.

20
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:30,530
We have our lookup object, the constructorType that we just saw,

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,909
and then what we need to do is to call the

22
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,421
findConstructor method on this lookup object,

23
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:41,192
passing the class on which we want to get the constructor,

24
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:42,679
and the constructorType.

25
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:43,619
Of course, here,

26
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,500
we do not pass a name since we know that a name of a constructor

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
has to be the same as the name of the class.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,000
The pattern for the empty constructor is, of course, the same.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The only difference being the methodType object that is used.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,500
So here are the four main patterns to get a reference on a method

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:20,000
or a constructor using the MethodHandle API, and all those objects that we get are instances of MethodHandle.
