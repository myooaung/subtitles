00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:06.726
First, let us see how we can create a metamodel.

2
00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:11.611
That is something that we are going to add to our Java classes to

3
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:15.694
add some semantic to the fields of our class.

4
00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:19.074
The information we need is, in fact, quite simple.

5
00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:26.139
It is what to save from the objects we are dealing with and how to save it.

6
00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:29.139
Suppose you want to save an object to a database,

7
00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:35.076
the information you need is in what table you are going to save it and

8
00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:39.016
in which column you are going to put which field.

9
00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:42.718
This is what this metamodel will have to tell us.

10
00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:45.346
So from a technical point of view,

11
00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:49.717
what we need is to add metadata to the Person class,

12
00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:54.878
and we are going to do that using annotations in Java.

13
00:00:54.878 --> 00:01:00.094
So here is our Person class, a very classical JavaBean,

14
00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:03.101
with three fields, private fields.

15
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:06.088
The first one is the id, and the two others,

16
00:01:06.088 --> 00:01:13.292
the age of that person in an integer and its name in a string of characters.

17
00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:16.469
We are going to state that this id field is,

18
00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:22.015
in fact, the primary key simply by adding this annotation,

19
00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.313
@PrimaryKey, directly on the field.

20
00:01:25.313 --> 00:01:28.569
If you are not familiar with annotations, do not worry.

21
00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.872
We are going to see in a minute how to create our own annotations.

22
00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:38.464
And then we are going to do the same on this age field and this

23
00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:44.155
name field just to tell our system that those two fields should be

24
00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:47.589
saved in a certain way in our database.

25
00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:51.309
How can we create annotations in Java?

26
00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:53.567
Well, it is extremely simple.

27
00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.227
What you just need is to create an interface,

28
00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:59.834
and instead of calling it an interface,

29
00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:05.696
you call it an @interface with this at symbol just in

30
00:02:05.696 --> 00:02:16.000
front of this interface keyword. And we are going to see that as an example in the demo part of this module.
