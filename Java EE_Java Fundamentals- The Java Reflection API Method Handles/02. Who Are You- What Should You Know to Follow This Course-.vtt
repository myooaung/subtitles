00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.423
Who are you, and what do you need to know to follow this course?

2
00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.266
Well, this is a Java course,

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:12.306
so you need to have at least a fair knowledge of the Java

4
00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:16.494
language and its main API from the JDK.

5
00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:21.363
You need to be able to write classes, to create a main class,

6
00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:22.894
this kind of thing.

7
00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:28.948
We are going to use annotations in the example codes we are going to write.

8
00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:33.209
So if you have a small knowledge of annotation, it's okay.

9
00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.934
It's fine.

10
00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.747
But if you do not,

11
00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:41.525
then we will cover just the basic things you need to know to understand that.

12
00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:44.380
And since this is a fundamental course,

13
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:56.000
we will really go from the very beginning of the Reflection API all the way to the top up to the method handles and VarHandles.
