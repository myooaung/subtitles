1
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:06,070
Now there is one thing we need to fix with those annotations due

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,840
to the way annotations are working in Java.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,827
An annotation is first handled by the compiler,

4
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:17,715
and the compiler needs to decide at what time of the lifecycle of

5
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:21,267
a class an annotation will be made available.

6
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:25,689
And there are three stages when an annotation can be available.

7
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:29,289
The first stage is the compile stage itself,

8
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,179
so only the compiler will be able to see that annotation if we choose to

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,575
do so; the second stage is the class loading stage,

10
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:42,218
so the annotation will only be seen by the class loader; and

11
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:44,696
the third stage is the runtime itself.

12
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:48,590
If we need to analyze an annotation to take an

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,948
annotation into account at runtime, we need to tell the compiler to do so.

14
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,402
And to do that, we need to add an annotation on this declaration,

15
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:00,407
which is the Retention annotation.

16
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:06,097
The Retention annotation takes an attribute of type RetentionPolicy.

17
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:11,064
And this RetentionPolicy is an enumeration, which may take three values.

18
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:12,491
The first one is SOURCE,

19
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:16,371
meaning that this annotation will be only available at

20
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:19,045
compile time; the second one is CLASS,

21
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:23,203
meaning that this annotation is available only when the class is

22
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:25,796
loaded and not after that; and the third one,

23
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:29,277
the one that we need, is the RUNTIME value,

24
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:33,813
meaning that the annotation will be made available at runtime.

25
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:43,000
So let us select this value, and let us do the same on the Column annotation here.
