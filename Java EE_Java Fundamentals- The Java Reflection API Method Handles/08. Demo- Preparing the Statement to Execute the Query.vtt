00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:06.390
So now I will built-in search request method has been created.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.148
what we need to do is to create this prepareStatementWith the SQL string we just

3
00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:16.909
created and the andParameters method on the return object.

4
00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.038
Let me create this one.

5
00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:23.844
This is going to prepare the statement, and you know that to prepare a statement,

6
00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:25.650
in fact, you have two steps.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.579
The first one is to create the statement itself using the SQL query,

8
00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.399
and this is very easy because we already have the SQL query,

9
00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.866
and in the second step,

10
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:39.785
you need to set the parameters to this PreparedStatement so that the

11
00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:45.695
final SQL query can be created by the JDBC API itself.

12
00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:48.396
So what is going to be returned here is,

13
00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:52.308
in fact, a PreparedStatement, but an extension of that.

14
00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:55.838
And we know that extending stuff is not recommended by

15
00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:58.882
the patterns from the Gang of Four.

16
00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:04.212
Instead of extending objects, the Gang of Four tells us to compose objects.

17
00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:08.015
So we are going to create, in fact, a PreparedStatementWrapper,

18
00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:14.822
and we are going to make it a private in a class,

19
00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:17.455
PreparedStatementWrapper.

20
00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:20.841
And this PreparedStatementWrapper will compose a

21
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:23.745
prepared statement and add behavior to it.

22
00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:25.662
What do we need to do here?

23
00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:30.633
Well, there is something that is going to be particular to the H2 database.

24
00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:35.823
It's that to prepare a statement, we first need a connection to the database.

25
00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:38.407
So let me write this connection code.

26
00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:42.616
It's a connection from JDBC, Connection.

27
00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:43.439
And here,

28
00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.496
we need to read the documentation on the H2 database because we

29
00:01:48.496 --> 00:01:51.825
need to pass this special connection string,

30
00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:53.902
which is the following.

31
00:01:53.902 --> 00:01:55.477
I'm just going to paste it,

32
00:01:55.477 --> 00:02:00.427
and this is basically the complete path to the db-Pluralsight

33
00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:06.524
file that we just created with the prefix,

34
00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:09.267
which is jdbc:h2:.

35
00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:13.157
And after that, we need to pass the username,

36
00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:20.003
which is the default sa username, which stands for system administrator,

37
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:21.927
and an empty password.

38
00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:25.143
This is going to throw some exceptions.

39
00:02:25.143 --> 00:02:26.770
We are not real interested in those exceptions,

40
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.272
so we are just going to throw them back.

41
00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:32.210
From that connection object,

42
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.497
we can prepare a statement by passing the sql string that we just got.

43
00:02:38.497 --> 00:02:41.361
This is our PreparedStatement.

44
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.628
And before we can call executeUpdate on that statement,

45
00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:50.271
we need to set the parameters that have been specified in the SQL string.

46
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:56.814
In our example, those parameters are the three parameters, id, name, and age.

47
00:02:56.814 --> 00:03:03.167
So for that, we are going to wrap the result in this PreparedStatementWrapper,

48
00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:05.935
a single statement as a parameter.

49
00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.695
Let me create this constructor.

50
00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:10.352
And here, once again,

51
00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:16.475
we are going to assign this parameter to a field just like that.

52
00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:19.743
So now we have created a PreparedStatement,

53
00:03:19.743 --> 00:03:31.000
at least the first step of it, and now we need to conduct the second step, which is adding the parameters to this statement.
