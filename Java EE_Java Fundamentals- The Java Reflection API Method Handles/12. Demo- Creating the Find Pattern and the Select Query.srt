1
00:00:01,717 --> 00:00:07,414
Let us now write the find method on our EntityManager.

2
00:00:07,414 --> 00:00:12,407
I've just created a simple code able to read back the object we

3
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:16,559
created in the database in our application.

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,929
So for that, we need the find method.

5
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,391
Let me create this method.

6
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,323
It's going to return an object of type t.

7
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:26,646
It is a class T.

8
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:32,617
Let me call it like this, and this is going to be the PrimaryKey.

9
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,977
Since we should be able to deal with any kind of PrimaryKey,

10
00:00:35,977 --> 00:00:40,643
we are going to say that the PrimaryKey itself is an object.

11
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:41,403
So, of course,

12
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:45,914
the implementation of the EntityManager we created does not

13
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:51,330
compile anymore because it is missing this method,

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,243
which has been created here.

15
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:59,608
This method is constructed in the same way as the persist method.

16
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:02,085
So first of all, we need the metamodel, of course,

17
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:05,695
because this is where we put the information on the class,

18
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:09,317
so let us get the metamodel from the class.

19
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,653
We need the SQL string.

20
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,930
Just like in the previous example,

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,520
we are going to create this method buildSelectRequest,

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,690
and just as previously,

23
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,645
we are going to prepare the statement by calling this

24
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:31,904
PreparedStatement with the SQL request we have and the PrimaryKey,

25
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,741
which is this PrimaryKey here.

26
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:39,321
Executing this statement, let us execute this query,

27
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:42,587
will return this time a ResultSet.

28
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:45,170
And by analyzing this ResultSet,

29
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,885
we are going to be able to create an instance of this class,

30
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:54,990
and we are going to create another method,

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,777
buildInstanceFrom this class and the ResultSet.

32
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:03,565
This is the pattern we want to create in our find method.

33
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:08,133
So first of all, we need to create this method,

34
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:08,494
buildSelectRequest,

35
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:14,976
and I am going to put it just near the buildInsertRequest

36
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:18,602
because it really looks like this one.

37
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:24,398
We want to type in select id, name, age from Person.

38
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:30,906
And you can see that we already have some of the elements we need.

39
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:31,520
Basically,

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:39,290
we need this piece of code because those columnElement is precisely the id,

41
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,690
name, age string of character.

42
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:55,250
And we want to return select + columnElement + from this.clss .getSimpleName.

43
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,518
And here, we need to specify the value of the PrimaryKey,

44
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:04,339
and for that, we have getPrimaryKey .getName,

45
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:09,794
which is the name of the column, plus, and add the question mark.

46
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:19,108
Here, we are missing, of course, where id =?. So this is the select request,

47
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:28,000
which is fairly simple. Same kind of the thing as the insert request we already saw.
