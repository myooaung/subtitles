00:00.260 --> 00:00.800
OK.

00:00.840 --> 00:06.000
So the final stage of this is obviously to see the effect on the site.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.350
One more thing if you could just create the art component parts USS under the app folder it's completely

00:13.350 --> 00:13.970
empty.

00:13.980 --> 00:21.570
But nevertheless we still need it because it's basically listed here so it won't work without it.

00:21.570 --> 00:23.050
You'll get errors.

00:23.310 --> 00:28.730
Anyway let's go to the site and ocal host Colan 3000 will lead us here.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.180
So where it says personal finance.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.890
This is actually a part of the app component Daut HGA Mellon's says personal finance.

00:37.890 --> 00:43.000
But when we request the slash account you URL or account you are l.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.360
The content will be loaded here.

00:45.390 --> 00:47.080
Between these two.

00:47.400 --> 00:51.890
So when I click here look personal finance remains here.

00:51.930 --> 00:56.480
It's still loaded there but you get additional content here.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.770
Inspector

01:06.460 --> 01:06.800
OK.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.750
So let's let's just go back

01:12.830 --> 01:14.830
and it's loading.

01:14.870 --> 01:15.220
OK.

01:15.230 --> 01:17.110
Personal Finance.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.270
Excellent.

01:18.380 --> 01:25.080
Could see head up apply a lot of these things.

01:25.490 --> 01:28.810
Style body.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.730
Let me just go ahead and find it

01:35.280 --> 01:36.030
OK.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.660
So there you go it says welcome to personal finance.

01:40.670 --> 01:42.770
This is the home component.

01:42.950 --> 01:45.510
And if you load this it says ok.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.510
Atra if you can see that the account is listed here.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.990
That is the link to which we are going.

01:52.550 --> 01:54.890
But there is nothing else.

01:54.890 --> 02:03.250
However if I go ahead and click on this link it takes me here and I am on the site.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.290
Personal finance still remains the same.

02:05.290 --> 02:09.130
It is still loaded exactly there.

02:09.160 --> 02:14.230
But let me go ahead and find the tags between which descanted has been placed

02:16.930 --> 02:20.860
and I may just go ahead and do that.

02:20.930 --> 02:22.620
Expand this and there we go.

02:22.620 --> 02:32.120
So we have a ton load of this content which has been placed here where basically between these two tags.

02:32.140 --> 02:33.030
So to say.

02:33.150 --> 02:36.160
So this is where the content has been placed.

02:37.380 --> 02:44.090
Basically you have static content which remains persistent across the sites which is personal finance

02:44.450 --> 02:52.310
and then you have the content which is basically dynamically loaded here depending on which link you

02:52.310 --> 03:00.350
basically click and can go back so we can have a fairly large amount of links without any problems.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.440
So take a look around.

03:03.470 --> 03:04.830
Have fun with the code.

03:05.060 --> 03:09.820
See if you can modify things by modifying things and breaking things and then fixing things.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.630
You really learn the most.

03:11.630 --> 03:14.820
That's what I would definitely suggest that you do.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.050
If you have any questions we are available as always.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.400
So bid you farewell.
