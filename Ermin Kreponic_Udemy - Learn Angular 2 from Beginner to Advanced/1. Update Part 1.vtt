WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:01.820
Work come back all.

00:01.860 --> 00:08.030
So today we're going to go ahead and perform an update of angular and a node.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.590
Why are we doing this.

00:09.600 --> 00:14.460
Well during the development of the Course new versions were released.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.430
Now I want to update it.

00:17.310 --> 00:24.540
But by the time you get to see it you'll probably see even newer versions as angular is being developed

00:24.720 --> 00:25.670
rapidly.

00:25.920 --> 00:31.770
Nevertheless I want to show you how you can update angular and how you can update it.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.290
What are the procedures for updating them.

00:34.290 --> 00:42.350
So let me go ahead and show you the first thing that we're going to go ahead and do is update Engler.

00:42.450 --> 00:48.150
So update it regular It doesn't doesn't have a specific command we just type in something and it updates

00:48.150 --> 00:48.980
or something like that.

00:48.990 --> 00:53.260
Maybe it does but I didn't find it anyway.

00:53.540 --> 01:02.020
You go into the package Jason and I just find it typings karma package.

01:02.030 --> 01:03.640
Jason Yup there we go.

01:04.060 --> 01:10.000
So if we scroll down you will see it's as angular common angular core.

01:10.060 --> 01:21.220
It's the version is 2 0 0 r c so Release Candidate 1 and we are going to modify this adjacent file and

01:21.220 --> 01:26.200
a few other files and then we're going to perform the installation.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.840
So where are we going to get the modifications for the files.

01:28.870 --> 01:30.660
Well we just open up Firefox

01:33.160 --> 01:44.890
and you basically type in Angella quick starch press center and open up the very first one from the

01:44.890 --> 01:45.200
get go

01:48.020 --> 01:48.480
OK.

01:48.530 --> 01:53.250
So now we need to copy a few files here.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.610
Where is it again.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.840
I'm looking for Jason.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.950
Yep there we go.

02:00.140 --> 02:00.600
OK.

02:00.630 --> 02:03.630
So let's scroll down.

02:03.630 --> 02:10.180
Copy it all control See and here control a control V.

02:10.650 --> 02:11.450
Excellent.

02:11.730 --> 02:14.270
So now we have copied over.

02:14.270 --> 02:16.540
Let's go ahead and see our modifications.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.640
Oh wow.

02:17.910 --> 02:24.510
Release Candidate for so our release candidate was one hand by the time I reached this point in time

02:24.510 --> 02:30.470
with of course the hair there came to be release candidate for basing.

02:30.840 --> 02:35.630
Anyway press control s to save and start moving onwards.

02:35.970 --> 02:44.650
So the next file that we need to change is system geus that conflict Arjay us.

02:44.950 --> 02:45.940
So same place.

02:45.970 --> 02:56.600
Just go back to get up that beautiful place for code resides and put another and go ahead and select

02:56.600 --> 02:57.140
it all

03:02.030 --> 03:03.370
and go back here.

03:03.830 --> 03:13.910
Control a control V and now we need to make a small modifications here to adapt things to our application.

03:14.240 --> 03:19.830
So just in t m p slash that set.

03:20.070 --> 03:28.940
And there's just one more file which we need to change that is t y p typings da Chaisson.

03:29.430 --> 03:30.070
So there we go.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.180
This is the this is the one the fairly short one.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.140
OK so let's just find it here.

03:37.140 --> 03:37.930
There we go.

03:39.900 --> 03:47.190
And they've increased it in terms of size and much thanks to all the contributors that you see here

03:47.250 --> 03:50.820
on get help for providing this code.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.730
This is very nice on their part.

03:55.580 --> 03:56.030
OK.

03:56.090 --> 04:00.640
So this is done now press control s to save.

04:00.950 --> 04:05.450
And I didn't save just one so press control s to save this one.

04:05.810 --> 04:06.100
OK.

04:06.100 --> 04:12.760
Now open up the CMT and navigate over to the folder where you have QuickStart.

04:12.890 --> 04:17.930
So it's just for me this is my path service

04:21.380 --> 04:25.180
is it let me just type it in.

04:25.810 --> 04:28.470
Right right right right right.

04:28.570 --> 04:33.910
I'm just used to working with a unix shell so I just keep on typing and slashes instead of backslashes

04:35.080 --> 04:37.650
which is frustrating.

04:37.720 --> 04:50.020
But well QuickStart master and now I'm going to go ahead and type in and P M and Stolpe and wait for

04:50.020 --> 04:52.510
it while we wait for it.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.200
Go ahead and begin updating node.

04:57.230 --> 05:10.960
So in order to big node just leave this running as it is so open up Firefox and type in node K so node.

05:10.990 --> 05:14.660
JS.

05:14.820 --> 05:19.410
And this is recommended for most users for point four point seven LTE.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.440
This is the long term support version.

05:22.440 --> 05:32.990
But as it is the newer updates to Angella actually required the versions 6 3 0 required this version

05:33.000 --> 05:36.220
here with the latest features.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.920
So let's go ahead.

05:37.920 --> 05:43.170
Actually they don't require a 6 3 0 but they require 5 version 5.

05:43.190 --> 05:47.550
But I mean I can see Version 5 anywhere around here but it doesn't really matter you can just download

05:47.550 --> 05:48.690
6 3 0.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.900
It should be fine.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.030
So just run it

05:57.680 --> 05:58.730
and wait.

05:58.940 --> 06:04.090
Basically depending on your computer speed this might be a longer wait but apparently not.

06:04.340 --> 06:08.940
So just go ahead and the node actually finished up as well.

06:08.940 --> 06:12.630
The angular finished up as well node is going to happen soon.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.310
But before I actually continue.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.730
Let me just go ahead and show you something here.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.860
If I type in node.

06:19.170 --> 06:23.420
The it's version four point four.

06:23.870 --> 06:26.390
And now let's go ahead and proceed with installation

06:29.130 --> 06:30.050
case.

06:30.110 --> 06:36.260
Next install and wait for days to finish.

06:36.390 --> 06:37.650
Shouldn't take too long.

06:41.590 --> 06:42.380
Today.

06:42.430 --> 06:46.620
Now I need that music when you wait on the phone for somebody to answer.

06:46.630 --> 06:48.630
I should i should get.

06:48.800 --> 06:53.830
Seriously you just for such occasions when something is installing

06:57.350 --> 06:58.820
removing backup files.

06:58.870 --> 07:00.960
Never could ID but ok.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.510
Why not.

07:02.510 --> 07:07.640
Maybe it's just removing the old backup files and accreting will create new ones probably at a certain

07:07.640 --> 07:08.810
point in time.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.230
OK.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.480
No JS has been successfully installed.

07:12.490 --> 07:18.200
Let's just go ahead and click on Finnish and let's type in node.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.400
The there you go.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.200
It's six point three point zero.

07:22.490 --> 07:22.790
OK.

07:22.790 --> 07:28.550
So these are all the things that we need to do in terms of updates in order to actually update update

07:28.580 --> 07:30.740
node and update and Giller.

07:30.770 --> 07:38.300
If you want you can type in and start as well and just to start at once after the procedure is done

07:38.300 --> 07:44.540
this is always a good idea to verify that it's working but ours is actually not working.

07:44.750 --> 07:49.390
So I'm going to need to come back and troubleshoot this problem.

07:49.430 --> 07:56.570
So to see what what went wrong because this is a common thing to occur after an update.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.970
Things tend to break.

07:57.980 --> 08:06.350
That's why I said it is a good idea to actually type in NPM start immediately after the update to verify

08:06.350 --> 08:10.800
that you don't have any errors but you are very likely to actually have errors.

08:10.940 --> 08:16.910
And we're going to attempt to fix them in the follow up tutorial and then it should all work out and

08:16.910 --> 08:19.070
we can go ahead and proceed with the course then.
