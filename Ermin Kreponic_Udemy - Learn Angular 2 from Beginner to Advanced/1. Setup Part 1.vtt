00:00.270 --> 00:07.440
Welcome all that we're going to go ahead and create ourselves an environment for development.

00:07.470 --> 00:10.530
There are a few things which we need to do and install from the net.

00:10.530 --> 00:14.700
As you can see I am using a Windows virtual machine here.

00:14.700 --> 00:20.850
I'm not actually a Windows user myself but I figure that most of you will be using Windows so I'll show

00:20.850 --> 00:26.190
you how to do it in Windows first and there will be a section down below that will show you how to do

00:26.190 --> 00:27.200
it in Linux.

00:27.270 --> 00:33.870
Once you set the environment up in Windows and Linux and on Mac or most likely do a demo on how to how

00:33.870 --> 00:36.060
to do it on a Mac as well.

00:36.060 --> 00:41.130
The development will be pretty much the same there will be no differences once you open up the development

00:41.130 --> 00:42.120
environment.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.790
It's the same on all three systems.

00:44.790 --> 00:48.990
They pretty much are new differences aside from the cosmetic ones.

00:49.350 --> 00:55.950
So I'm going to go ahead and put my virtual machine into full screen mode so it won't see anything in

00:55.950 --> 00:56.770
the background.

00:58.060 --> 00:58.850
On There we go.

00:58.870 --> 01:01.720
And we're going to go ahead and proceed with our installation.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.390
Now I'm using a fresh install of Windows.

01:04.390 --> 01:07.320
There is nothing else installed on the system.

01:07.330 --> 01:12.680
I have installed Windows maybe like 10 minutes ago and now I have set it up.

01:12.710 --> 01:18.010
I've created this virtual machine of Windows like 10 minutes ago and now I'm going to go ahead and show

01:18.010 --> 01:23.260
you how to actually install how to actually set up the development environment.

01:23.290 --> 01:31.150
The idea which we will be using is called Adam and it is cross-platform so you can install it on Mac

01:31.420 --> 01:34.540
Linux and Windows as well without any problems.

01:34.570 --> 01:42.070
Aside from that we will need a development server so we will go ahead and download that as well.

01:42.100 --> 01:48.370
The very first thing that I'm going to do here is actually download Firefox.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.490
Some of you might wonder why didn't I do it like before.

01:54.180 --> 02:05.160
But I really wanted to go from scratch quite literally on a fresh installed and a fresh installed Windows

02:05.160 --> 02:09.020
machine where there is literally nothing else.

02:11.450 --> 02:13.650
So there is nothing.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.130
Yes go ahead.

02:15.920 --> 02:21.600
Install got all of the windows permissions system where you just click yes and that's it.

02:21.820 --> 02:24.560
It's downloading Firefox This shouldn't take too long.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.300
I can't I don't know my way around Explorer.

02:27.310 --> 02:30.900
I'm going to give you a heads up so I don't want to look too confusing.

02:31.090 --> 02:36.070
I'm just going to download it quickly and then we'll actually proceed into Download now.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.110
Well this is going on.

02:37.120 --> 02:43.390
Keep in mind that you can use your browser you want see I would advise you to use Firefox or crow.

02:43.540 --> 02:49.750
So one of the two I wouldn't really advise using Internet Explorer in the past it has been known to

02:49.750 --> 02:54.470
be incompatible with some of the newer technologies.

02:54.490 --> 02:59.740
So to say I hear that the newer versions of Explorer are working just fine with pretty much everything

02:59.750 --> 03:02.690
but back I don't know a couple of.

03:02.710 --> 03:05.590
I haven't used that in a very long time so I don't know.

03:05.590 --> 03:10.810
But back in the day I know that it was incompatible with a lot of things in that it was lagging behind

03:10.810 --> 03:16.790
in terms of technology is applied to it quite a good deal behind Firefox and Chrome.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.780
So definitely use either Firefox or chrome.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.920
Go ahead and you can go ahead and download either one of those two.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.680
Both of them are completely free browsers from the net.

03:26.680 --> 03:32.980
Firefox is completely open source as well and Druckmann that use Firefox but I cannot really say that

03:32.980 --> 03:36.400
there are any technical reasons why I'm recommending Firefox or chrome.

03:36.400 --> 03:41.800
It's mostly my sentimental reasons because I'm using it on Linux as well.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.680
Also on Mac you can use the Mac browser.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.120
It shouldn't be a problem either.

03:48.190 --> 03:50.540
So you can use Safari there without any problems.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.660
Don't import anything.

03:53.660 --> 03:54.160
Next

03:57.110 --> 04:05.100
yes I would like to use it as a default browser and God Windows is going to make me do some settings

04:05.160 --> 04:06.110
here isn't it.

04:10.140 --> 04:13.670
Firefox excellence.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.520
I've changed out.

04:15.710 --> 04:20.660
Another reason why I'm sure why I'm actually installing the browser in front of you all is due to the

04:20.660 --> 04:28.310
fact that as I said you shouldn't be using Internet Explorer for this although you probably can but

04:28.400 --> 04:34.220
no guarantees there really the very first thing that we're going to do is open up whatever page comes

04:34.220 --> 04:40.130
along and use our favorite search engine you can use whichever one you want and type in Adam.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.480
OK that didn't really help us out a lot.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.490
Right.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.950
We did it actually.

04:49.300 --> 04:49.540
OK.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.050
So it did open up the site.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.420
It's HTP as Collins slash.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.740
Adam dart I O.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.120
So go ahead and click on it.

04:58.660 --> 05:06.400
And regardless of whether you are in a Mac or whether you are on Windows that this site should recognize

05:06.400 --> 05:13.210
your user agent by default from where it will pool your operating system information and it will serve

05:13.210 --> 05:15.280
you right download straight away.

05:15.280 --> 05:21.160
So if you're on a Mac it's going to say download for Mac or something like that anyway just go ahead

05:21.160 --> 05:23.980
and click on download Windows Installer.

05:24.500 --> 05:24.880
OK.

05:24.920 --> 05:30.070
So save file again if you really need me to do a set up Tauriel for Mac.

05:30.100 --> 05:30.880
Do let me know.

05:30.890 --> 05:33.580
But I think I'm going to go ahead and do one anyway.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.460
So no worries there.

05:35.470 --> 05:39.300
The installation is pretty straight forward.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.220
Although on Linux it's somewhat different.

05:43.630 --> 05:51.670
I would say simpler but that's mostly it's not really that I can claim for any technical reasons.

05:51.670 --> 05:57.850
Again it's mostly because I am a Linux user and I'm just more more acquainted with it than I am with

05:57.850 --> 05:58.200
Windows.

05:58.210 --> 06:03.850
But as I said once you actually set the development environment up it will be the same across all three

06:03.850 --> 06:07.110
platforms with only minor cosmetic differences.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.100
So you won't have any problems there.

06:09.250 --> 06:13.730
Depending on your internet connection this might take some time.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.760
Hopefully not too long.

06:15.910 --> 06:21.050
While this is going on we can go ahead and safely open up another tab without any worries of cancelling

06:21.050 --> 06:21.980
your download.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.570
And we're going to go ahead and start looking for node.

06:25.660 --> 06:37.790
J.S. Jess so just go ahead and jump over to their website and there is the version 6 1 6 1 0.

06:37.790 --> 06:40.720
This is the current version with the latest features.

06:40.940 --> 06:48.230
But I am going to go ahead and download the four point four point four Eltis LDS stands for long term

06:48.230 --> 06:49.150
support.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.250
Those are the stable versions.

06:51.380 --> 06:57.650
And during our learning stages it is always best to download the long term support ones already stable

06:57.650 --> 07:04.040
versions because as a beginner you really and I cannot emphasize this enough you really don't want to

07:04.040 --> 07:11.930
be messing around with all the undocumented bugs and encountering new problems to which which haven't

07:11.930 --> 07:15.100
been solved and to go about solving them yourself.

07:15.110 --> 07:17.770
You will lose incredible amount of time.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.630
So just go ahead and select the LTL version.

07:20.660 --> 07:26.850
Believe me when I tell you it makes quite literally no difference to you as a beginner.

07:26.930 --> 07:32.540
There are differences of course between these two versions but you as a beginner on this level.

07:32.540 --> 07:34.890
It is not of any importance.

07:34.940 --> 07:40.070
I assure you that it is far better to go with the long term support when you can of course go with the

07:40.460 --> 07:41.110
latest one.

07:41.110 --> 07:47.540
The unstable one as it is usually referred to this is a common terminology have DLT Yes and you have

07:47.600 --> 07:49.020
unstable testing.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.540
This is also used for operating systems for example for Linux.

07:52.580 --> 07:58.490
You will generally have the unstable version and the long term support one.

07:58.650 --> 08:02.390
If you're a beginner you will always go for the long term support.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.930
Or if you are if you want the operating system for a server you will of course go for the long term

08:06.930 --> 08:07.330
support.

08:07.330 --> 08:12.570
Wonder you're not insane to go for the unstable one with the server.

08:12.570 --> 08:16.200
Now what do I mean by unstable and long term support.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.990
This is a general term that that is applicable across pretty much all the applications out there.

08:21.990 --> 08:26.970
Unstable doesn't mean that it's faulty that it's bad etc. it just means that there are a lot of new

08:26.970 --> 08:33.630
features there that are yet to be tested out that it's still in the development stages and you are bound

08:33.630 --> 08:37.360
to encounter problems which you will need to solve.

08:37.420 --> 08:39.220
Now I could.

08:39.460 --> 08:44.190
It wouldn't be that much of a bother for me or for somebody or some people that I know that are pretty

08:44.190 --> 08:44.970
good with it.

08:45.030 --> 08:48.930
They will be able to solve the problems in a relatively short amount of time and would probably enjoy

08:48.930 --> 08:49.710
doing so.

08:49.710 --> 08:55.050
But for you while you are learning I strongly advise that we go with the stable version so that we don't

08:55.050 --> 09:06.260
spend too much time fixing bugs going about solving problems which are really not up to you to solve.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.880
As a beginner.

09:08.040 --> 09:17.610
So the next thing that we're going to need to do is go jump over to get help and this will be our development

09:17.610 --> 09:18.960
server.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.520
So to say No way.

09:20.550 --> 09:22.730
Don't take that with a grain of salt.

09:22.740 --> 09:27.930
We're going to go ahead and type in angular slash.

09:28.050 --> 09:30.240
Quick Start.

09:30.360 --> 09:36.810
We're going to go ahead and press enter there and the very first it should be the very first one so

09:36.810 --> 09:40.320
it's spelled angular slash QuickStart.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.920
Go ahead and click on it.

09:41.940 --> 09:48.510
Now there are a lot of things here like quite literally that we will not actually require but there

09:48.510 --> 09:51.150
is really no need to filter this file out.

09:51.150 --> 09:57.330
I mean we probably will at a certain point of time to an extent but the additional fileshare which we

09:57.330 --> 09:59.560
won't use will not do you harm.

09:59.640 --> 10:07.360
So to say so don't worry about it too much just go ahead and click on download zip and we're gonna go

10:07.360 --> 10:09.760
ahead and say save file.

10:09.760 --> 10:15.310
I don't believe that I have anything that can open this file up but that is yet to be seen.

10:16.330 --> 10:24.780
OK QuickStart extract extract all downloads.

10:24.810 --> 10:26.840
No I don't want you to extract it there.

10:26.850 --> 10:28.750
I shall extract it to desktop.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.600
OK so that will be the selection of the folder.

10:31.710 --> 10:35.070
So just click on browse find your desktop.

10:35.070 --> 10:42.570
Click on it and then click on select folder and then click on extract.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.420
Yep there we go the extraction process should be fairly fast.

10:46.430 --> 10:47.900
I do not require any additional tools.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.830
As I said this is a fresh install of Windows.

10:50.840 --> 10:56.330
I have not installed any additional tools including the browser I've installed it 10 minutes prior to

10:56.330 --> 11:03.390
the beginning of this tutorial and just double click on it so you can see everything is in here.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.800
All the all the necessary all the necessary files are there.

11:07.820 --> 11:12.840
Now if you just go ahead and check if my downloads are done my downloads are done.

11:12.960 --> 11:18.320
OK so now if we have everything that we need to begin installation and setup procedure if we've pulled

11:18.320 --> 11:23.390
everything from net we're going to go ahead and proceed into actually installing these things and setting

11:23.390 --> 11:25.210
them up one by one.

11:25.220 --> 11:26.990
We shall do that in part to.
