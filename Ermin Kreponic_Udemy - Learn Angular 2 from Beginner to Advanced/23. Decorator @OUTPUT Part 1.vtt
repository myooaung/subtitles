WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:02.060
Welcome back all.

00:02.220 --> 00:10.400
So today we're going to go ahead and take a look at the decorator at output.

00:10.450 --> 00:16.000
It's a bit of a there isn't that much code that we actually need to write but there was a lot that we

00:16.090 --> 00:22.000
need to explain which is a little bit kind of counter intuitive I guess.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.380
Anyway go into the account list that component dot TS and I am going to write this out.

00:29.650 --> 00:33.710
But before we do that let's just go ahead and copy this.

00:33.730 --> 00:41.620
So just select this and press control X to cut it out completely and then go into the app component.

00:41.740 --> 00:46.770
TS and we're going to paste it here.

00:49.390 --> 00:50.730
It just label it there.

00:50.970 --> 00:51.960
Why did we do this.

00:51.960 --> 01:00.090
Well as we stated in a previous tutorials we do not want the account list that component has to be a

01:00.090 --> 01:05.890
worry to be able to do any sort of part of fixations to our accounts.

01:05.910 --> 01:10.890
We only wanted to be able to display things we don't wanted to perform any sort of pontifications.

01:10.890 --> 01:18.330
We want a different component to be in charge of modifications and deleting something falls into the

01:18.330 --> 01:21.850
line of it falls under the modifications.

01:21.870 --> 01:27.990
This is perhaps not so important now but later on when we actually conduct these sort of operations

01:27.990 --> 01:35.070
on the server and in the database it will be important because aside from I mean here I just go back

01:35.070 --> 01:36.110
to the app component.

01:36.120 --> 01:42.740
Yes you see disparate in real world you wouldn't be able to use just this method because if you want

01:42.740 --> 01:49.690
to delete something from a server from a database which doesn't necessarily need to be on the same machine

01:49.730 --> 01:57.440
and usually is not on the same machine where your web server is you need to perform a certain logic

01:57.440 --> 01:58.840
here like you.

01:58.890 --> 02:05.210
Most likely you will have something like a try catch block so it will attempt to connect to the server

02:05.390 --> 02:06.130
or the database.

02:06.140 --> 02:12.890
It will attempt to access what it needs to delete and it will try to find it and then it will try to

02:12.890 --> 02:14.840
delete it.

02:14.960 --> 02:15.840
It might succeed.

02:15.860 --> 02:18.820
It might not succeed if you ask me why it might not succeed.

02:18.930 --> 02:23.660
There like a good amount of reasons why it wouldn't be.

02:23.660 --> 02:27.130
Why why why the deletion can fail.

02:27.200 --> 02:33.770
Therefore we will be implementing a logic later on down the down the road for deletion.

02:33.770 --> 02:41.180
So you will need to attempt to delete it and you will need some sort of method of informing yourself

02:41.190 --> 02:47.420
or the client if the deletion process has failed to happen for whatever reason.

02:47.490 --> 02:50.990
So that's why we're removing it from the account start component.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.410
Yes.

02:51.420 --> 02:55.530
That is only used for displaying information onto the screen.

02:55.530 --> 02:58.520
We don't want we don't have we don't really have any.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.540
What defecation logic here.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.770
So to say anyway enough about that.

03:03.810 --> 03:10.070
We only needed to move data here and press control as to save it.

03:10.110 --> 03:12.240
Now we're going to go back to the account.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.350
Why is that.

03:13.350 --> 03:14.080
Or what.

03:14.270 --> 03:14.800
OK.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.250
For some strange reason it's orange.

03:19.350 --> 03:23.120
It's pretty early in the morning it's something stupid I can't think how it was.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.420
I can't think why.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.380
But doesn't it.

03:26.460 --> 03:33.110
It's not important to anyway in the account list here.

03:33.260 --> 03:37.270
We're not in the demo accounts list.

03:37.310 --> 03:38.080
Yes.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.200
Where I am now but I'm looking at my notes.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.180
We're going to need to include a few more things here.

03:43.210 --> 03:49.880
The very first thing that we're going to include in addition to input will be output.

03:50.150 --> 03:58.600
And in addition to the output we will also include event emitter so event emitter.

03:58.810 --> 04:04.220
If you don't know what event emitter is that's fine but try to figure it out just by reading the name

04:04.250 --> 04:07.830
it it emits an event.

04:07.850 --> 04:11.600
Hence it is called an event emitter.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.550
Anyway I will explain that in more detail down the road.

04:17.400 --> 04:25.880
So all I'm going to go ahead and type this out as I don't really have a lot of it to do.

04:26.310 --> 04:30.810
I just need to it's a very sure as I said not a lot of code but a lot of talking in this one

04:33.430 --> 04:34.320
output.

04:34.560 --> 04:46.030
And then we're going to do as before but this one shall be named the elite and do it well let me just

04:46.030 --> 04:54.700
write it out and then I'll explain it and emitter.

04:56.130 --> 04:59.560
Number Wow.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.930
So was this reaching a new level of low with typing.

05:04.940 --> 05:13.060
OK so the first thing you notice is the DS to look hilariously alike like one another.

05:13.330 --> 05:16.800
Well this this first part does.

05:16.810 --> 05:21.130
Anyway the second part is something completely different.

05:21.220 --> 05:31.210
If I just do give you a heads up if this does not exist if this is not here if I did not specify that

05:31.210 --> 05:36.550
it is delete it will still work it will still be delete.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.200
It will take this as the default name.

05:41.090 --> 05:41.570
OK.

05:41.850 --> 05:46.890
So let's take it from left to right output at output.

05:46.890 --> 05:55.350
First of all is the decorator just like an input is and same thing as with input it.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.500
It also adds additional characteristics to the variable.

05:59.640 --> 06:05.400
So you have a variable which is delete the name of the variable is delete and you have the decorator

06:05.460 --> 06:12.640
output which adds additional characteristics to the variable delete.

06:12.690 --> 06:21.220
It basically states that the delete variable the one that I'm selecting now is an output variable.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.670
What does this mean.

06:24.350 --> 06:32.520
Well it means that the parent components or in our case the parent component is apt or component Datti

06:32.520 --> 06:41.390
as the painfully orange one mysteriously where one should I say can subscribe to this variable so the

06:41.390 --> 06:45.890
parent component can subscribe to this variable.

06:45.980 --> 06:51.630
So just like with mouseover mouse click events etc..

06:51.650 --> 06:54.290
It functions in pretty much the same way.

06:54.290 --> 07:00.590
We're simply specifying what will occur if that event occurs.

07:00.590 --> 07:04.440
So what does it mean to subscribe or to perform such things.

07:04.460 --> 07:14.190
Well if an app component TS is subscribed to the it's basically here to this to this event.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.190
What will happen to this variable sorry.

07:18.230 --> 07:24.050
What will happen is that when a certain event occurs and we will see how the logic unfolds a little

07:24.050 --> 07:31.520
bit later on when a certain event occurs all those who are subscribed to this variable will be informed

07:31.610 --> 07:33.590
that that event has happened.

07:33.590 --> 07:38.430
And in addition to that we will be able to pass certain values as well.

07:38.780 --> 07:47.480
And here we have it says new event emitter and then number so new is a keyword that we use to create

07:47.540 --> 07:56.090
a new instance of a class event emitter is basically a class that makes this logic work.

07:56.090 --> 08:05.090
Now the logic behind this the logic that we're trying to create here is the logic of subscription and

08:05.180 --> 08:07.670
event event passing.

08:07.730 --> 08:09.930
Basically it functions like this.

08:09.950 --> 08:16.490
Just imagine that our app comput and up to us is let's say an individual A and that we perhaps have

08:17.390 --> 08:19.220
more individuals like those.

08:19.220 --> 08:21.910
A group of them or just one it doesn't matter.

08:21.950 --> 08:30.860
So basically with this logic we are enabling a group or an individual component or other or other things

08:30.860 --> 08:40.830
that we can plug in here like services and that's why I suggest individual a basically to subscribe

08:40.980 --> 08:49.710
to the event emitter class and then the event emitter class can inform them that a certain event has

08:49.800 --> 08:50.580
occurred.

08:52.760 --> 08:58.030
Now you have in addition to this right here it says a number.

08:58.100 --> 09:05.530
Now this means that the information emitted or delegated by this event will be of type number

09:08.190 --> 09:13.890
basically since we're deleting something we need to say what we are deleting and we are defining that

09:13.930 --> 09:15.130
with the number.

09:15.140 --> 09:23.990
Basically a final thing before I actually come back to output I can go into the other files where I

09:23.990 --> 09:29.690
show you how we inter-linked this logic together we will need to create a method.

09:29.910 --> 09:35.940
So private underly move

09:38.620 --> 09:39.390
index.

09:39.550 --> 09:46.300
And we're going to be so kind as to create this this thought

09:49.670 --> 09:52.420
delete and read

09:55.270 --> 09:56.410
index.

09:56.530 --> 10:01.140
And there we go case for some strange reason.

10:01.180 --> 10:03.760
It's in its index.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.560
Let me just see where that makes your.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.510
I think I need to please a number or something.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.830
Yep there we go.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.420
It is a number.

10:13.180 --> 10:22.920
So just this small error here anyway when you press delete button from here from the web site when you

10:22.920 --> 10:27.830
press a delete button this method will be called.

10:27.870 --> 10:33.590
So when this method is called It will perform this logic here.

10:33.600 --> 10:42.720
It will say OK current instance delete delete is referring to this and then it says Emmett Emmett.

10:42.850 --> 10:49.780
And then in addition to that it gives an index as well which basically is the index number of the account

10:51.160 --> 11:01.000
so it will admit this and to everything that is subscribed to this variable in our particular case since

11:01.000 --> 11:07.390
the app can put it out has will be subscribed to this variable it will receive the index and it will

11:07.390 --> 11:16.040
receive info that this event has occurred and then it will act based upon that notification.

11:16.090 --> 11:19.640
That's the same thing same logic would be.

11:19.660 --> 11:23.500
I know it's a little bit difficult to understand but you can look at and can look at it this way the

11:23.500 --> 11:26.320
same logic could be applied to a YouTube subscription.

11:26.320 --> 11:32.440
If you go on to YouTube if you subscribe you can have one subscriber we can have 10000 subscribers on

11:32.490 --> 11:33.400
an a channel.

11:33.520 --> 11:40.780
And then when somebody uploads a new video on that channel they all get informed and then they perform

11:40.810 --> 11:43.780
a certain action based upon the information that they've received.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.140
OK somebody there.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.560
Did you get a notification.

11:46.570 --> 11:52.030
Hey this guy that you're subscribed to has upload the new video so you decide OK do I want to watch

11:52.030 --> 11:57.920
it or do I want to unsubscribe or do I want to.

11:58.090 --> 11:58.960
I don't know whatever.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.020
Basically it doesn't matter.

12:01.030 --> 12:07.000
But you get the logic you are the component will subscribe to and then the component will be informed

12:07.030 --> 12:10.210
when the event occurs and it will receive some additional information.

12:10.330 --> 12:14.020
And then we will see the logic that we will implement.

12:14.020 --> 12:17.010
How will this be actually handled.

12:17.140 --> 12:21.790
I will get back to you in the follow to Tauriel as I am running a little bit short in terms of time

12:21.830 --> 12:24.450
and we will move on right from where we left off.
