00:00.600 --> 00:06.730
Welcome back all the there we're going to go ahead and introduce bootstrap.

00:06.780 --> 00:08.540
So what is bootstrap.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.800
Why do we use it.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.930
And what's the answer.

00:10.950 --> 00:12.170
We need it for.

00:12.210 --> 00:20.430
So first of all bootstrap is a CSSA and Javascript framework for styling it is very useful because it

00:20.430 --> 00:24.050
saves you a lot of work so you don't need to create your own styles.

00:24.060 --> 00:30.210
You can use bootstrap styles and you can effectively make your sites look a lot better in a very short

00:30.210 --> 00:33.510
amount of time and without a lot of work.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.910
Here let me just open it up.

00:34.950 --> 00:38.040
So this is how the site will look like.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.590
This is the code that I've typed here.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.740
And that you can have a look at now.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.970
So as you can see this part looks completely different.

00:46.980 --> 00:52.170
This has been moved and the colors are way different as well.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.190
So how do we achieve this.

00:55.260 --> 00:57.970
Well as I said we use bootstrap.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.210
And if you just.

00:59.250 --> 01:04.740
Well I've already opened it up but if you just use your favorite search engine and type in boot strap

01:04.740 --> 01:11.390
impersonator the first the very first site will be where you want to go.

01:11.390 --> 01:13.710
And then you click on getting started.

01:14.770 --> 01:18.080
And you have these three links here.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.670
So the very first one is for CSX.

01:20.710 --> 01:25.060
This is for an optional team and this is for javascript.

01:25.060 --> 01:33.670
Now not all javascript part will not really work well with Engler two as angular too is very new and

01:33.670 --> 01:36.890
not all things have been developed and made to work properly.

01:36.910 --> 01:42.490
So I'm not saying that not that it won't work at all but you will definitely encounter problems at this

01:42.490 --> 01:50.410
point in time until it until all has been until the code has been written out optimized and made to

01:50.410 --> 01:52.600
fit angular too.

01:52.630 --> 01:56.310
Anyway we will be utilizing this one here.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.670
So just go ahead and copy it.

01:58.720 --> 02:04.780
It says here to folks over at Maxey the end generously provide a CD and support for bootstrap C Ss and

02:04.810 --> 02:05.920
Javascript.

02:05.950 --> 02:12.790
Just use these bootstrap CDN links so a lot of thanks to the back CD.

02:13.100 --> 02:19.250
And if you don't know what a CDN is chant the fact that you're watching this to the fact that you were

02:19.310 --> 02:23.630
watching this course I would guess that you've heard about CD but that you are not really familiar with

02:23.630 --> 02:25.370
what that is or how that works.

02:25.430 --> 02:36.780
Well CD On-Star stands for content delivery network and it basically what he does basically is service

02:36.780 --> 02:41.960
content from the servers that are closest to the client's request.

02:42.060 --> 02:49.380
So if you have a client for example who is in Canada and your site is being hosted in an effort somewhere

02:49.380 --> 02:57.900
in Africa it say the content to that client portion of your site's content will be served from us for

02:57.900 --> 03:02.190
example which is closer to the source location of the Clydes request.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.620
And why would that.

03:04.620 --> 03:06.150
Why would we need to do this.

03:06.210 --> 03:12.370
Well in order to make our sites load faster you might think that.

03:12.690 --> 03:19.800
I mean this is basically getting a millisecond per an image somewhere or per style some or something

03:19.800 --> 03:24.900
like that but a secondary a millisecond here it adds up to a lot.

03:25.200 --> 03:31.650
And you might not think that its important but believe me you want your site to work as fast as possible.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.050
You don't want it to be slow at all.

03:35.070 --> 03:42.240
That is a huge deal breaker for a lot of people who visit Web sites the site loads in a slow fashion

03:42.240 --> 03:43.350
if it takes a while.

03:43.380 --> 03:49.170
And if it takes a while for I mean if you have a website with a content loads first and then you have

03:49.170 --> 03:52.210
a huge lag behind.

03:52.380 --> 03:57.900
For example a paragraph loads but then you have a lag for that in for the styling for the paragraph

03:57.900 --> 04:00.730
to load so that's a huge deal breaker.

04:00.780 --> 04:06.900
What you want is for it to be practically instantaneous and you achieved by serving the content from

04:06.900 --> 04:12.670
the locations closest to the clients requests anyway.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.710
That is why were using the Cdn to make our site work faster you could of course it's technically possible

04:18.710 --> 04:20.720
to download the source code of bootstrap.

04:20.720 --> 04:30.490
In fact you have it up here download source and you can download bootstrap Actually this.

04:30.560 --> 04:36.100
This includes some documentation as well and you can create your own content delivery network.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.740
Is also technically doable but not really an easy thing to do.

04:39.740 --> 04:40.820
Believe me.

04:40.880 --> 04:49.470
So you go ahead and capitis and you go into the index that HDMI will find it indexed Ayodeji your model

04:49.880 --> 04:55.850
and you basically just paste it here so can for or just imagine like it wasn't there I just deleted

04:55.850 --> 05:01.900
it and you press control V to paste it in there you press control as you say.

05:02.150 --> 05:06.580
And that's all you really need to do in order to plug in Bootstrap.

05:06.590 --> 05:07.820
It's that easy.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.970
No complications needed.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.690
It's super easy to do that.

05:11.870 --> 05:19.740
Now the next thing that you need to do is go into the index file to the HDMI file mythologies.

05:19.750 --> 05:27.860
So app app component dot HD M-L And now here we're going to start playing around and utilizing things

05:27.890 --> 05:29.460
from Bootstrap.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.710
All right.

05:30.950 --> 05:36.200
There was one more thing that I forgot the diner got to mention and that is that angularity has some

05:36.200 --> 05:37.760
of some styles of its own.

05:37.790 --> 05:41.980
So go into the style see SS and you will see a lot of things here.

05:42.990 --> 05:47.000
All the work you will see a lot of styles here.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.790
Well not a lot but you will see a lot of content here.

05:50.090 --> 05:55.640
And what I want you to do is just press control a and delete everything like I've deleted it.

05:55.640 --> 06:00.500
I want your styles start see it as file to be empty void.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.980
There should be nothing in it to be completely empty.

06:05.540 --> 06:10.980
And then you can and then you can go to the app component got a DML file.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.580
Now here in this particular file you will first off add div class container.

06:18.650 --> 06:20.230
Why do we need this container.

06:20.270 --> 06:26.990
Well we will use a container to mark the contents of our component for bootstrap.

06:27.020 --> 06:34.910
We have two types of containers container fluid and Container container fluid with is 100 percent of

06:34.910 --> 06:38.660
the screen size no matter the size of the screen.

06:38.840 --> 06:45.470
So you can have for example a 24 inch screen or a 32 inch screen or you can have a mobile device which

06:45.470 --> 06:51.050
is me maybe even Max six inches or something like that for phones.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.920
You can have a tablet which is maybe 9 inches.

06:55.610 --> 06:59.780
It will be 100 percent of that screen size no matter which screen it is.

07:00.020 --> 07:06.380
And a container has a weight with space to the right and left but both are responsive.

07:06.380 --> 07:08.960
Like pretty much everything is in Bootstrap.

07:08.960 --> 07:16.250
So what I mean by this is that weird container alone you will have this space to the left and this empty

07:16.250 --> 07:19.150
space to the right and that is what I've decided to use.

07:19.220 --> 07:31.230
If you just type in container dash fluid saved as can go back to Mazola wait for it to load.

07:31.250 --> 07:37.340
So now you can see that the entirety of the screw in a way that has been occupied you can use both.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.280
Really there are no obstacles.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.230
I've just decided to opt for that container.

07:44.660 --> 07:50.370
I'm just going to go ahead and delete this and save So load.

07:50.410 --> 07:51.120
Yep there we go.

07:51.220 --> 08:01.530
So now we have spaces on the right and left side so that we can go down below and immediately we're

08:01.530 --> 08:07.150
plugging in another class from Bootstrap which is row.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.580
Now this part of the page you do not see immediately.

08:11.070 --> 08:16.410
But if we just do this delete delete.

08:16.440 --> 08:16.860
There you go.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.240
Now you can see it it says no accounts yet.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.780
Please add it within that.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.950
This is a class road.

08:24.940 --> 08:26.640
Basically you have a row.

08:26.780 --> 08:30.010
I will explain this in more detail down below.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.920
But for the time being I would like to explain this class here it says alert.

08:33.950 --> 08:39.560
You have one alert and then you have another one which is alert which says alert info.

08:40.000 --> 08:50.460
If I basically just go ahead and press control X to and it UPS UPS that's something I want to do if

08:50.480 --> 08:54.170
I just can press control X to save it again and open up Firefox

08:56.890 --> 08:58.640
pressed delete delete.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.570
It will see that the alert box is no longer there.

09:02.580 --> 09:07.500
The alert box is no longer president so we would like that the alert box there very much

09:11.590 --> 09:12.260
yes.

09:12.380 --> 09:21.130
You so now when the alert box is present you can immediately C.D affect and they're going to have the

09:21.130 --> 09:23.270
alert box in our case it's blue.

09:23.320 --> 09:29.440
We didn't define the color that is the predefined color of the current theme colors between theme's

09:29.530 --> 09:34.220
me defer.

09:34.230 --> 09:40.300
So anyway let's go down let's go let's go further down below.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.860
So you have a class a row again.

09:44.190 --> 09:47.630
And within this row we're going to have Colon's.

09:47.640 --> 09:54.140
Now before we get into the code here let's go over to the bootstrap website.

09:54.250 --> 10:00.350
Scroll back up and click on see SS load.

10:00.470 --> 10:01.590
Thank you very much.

10:01.610 --> 10:06.590
And then click on grid system and scroll down it's right here.

10:06.590 --> 10:07.690
Second one from the top.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.920
It's grid system.

10:08.960 --> 10:16.360
I would strongly advise you to read through this says bootstrap includes a responsive mobile first fluid

10:16.370 --> 10:22.170
grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns.

10:22.700 --> 10:27.020
That's something that you need to keep in mind it's always going to be 12.

10:27.290 --> 10:28.580
And there we go this is an example.

10:28.580 --> 10:36.630
So you have a class row and then you have a colon empty one and then you have these empty four except

10:36.640 --> 10:41.880
for can't really find the proper example that I wanted to use.

10:42.060 --> 10:45.200
But we can use this one here look.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.160
So you have a class row.

10:47.670 --> 10:50.550
And this creates a row.

10:50.760 --> 10:51.870
So Per.

10:52.040 --> 10:56.360
So this is X X X X and we don't need that.

10:56.460 --> 10:59.540
We need empty OK.

10:59.770 --> 11:01.210
You know what let's just use this one.

11:01.210 --> 11:06.130
The first one that seems this seems like the simplest one to use.

11:06.280 --> 11:14.530
So you have a class row and you see here it says class call and d 1.

11:14.550 --> 11:21.280
So for empty one you're going to have in one row you're going to have 12 Colon's

11:24.120 --> 11:29.430
for MT 8 and M.D 4.

11:29.430 --> 11:31.510
If you place them up like this.

11:31.550 --> 11:36.890
So if you place empty one you can have up to 12 of them in one row.

11:37.260 --> 11:44.990
As a 12 it is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.

11:45.010 --> 11:45.460
Yup.

11:45.680 --> 11:53.010
So you can have 12 of them and all 12 of them will be displayed in a single row like this.

11:53.510 --> 12:01.260
But if you state like it's 8 and 4 like they have stated down below it says row and then call on the

12:01.260 --> 12:04.530
8 and call an empty four.

12:04.650 --> 12:09.270
It's going to be like this so calling him V8 and calling him before and they you can see that they differ

12:09.360 --> 12:10.260
in width.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.620
So what's going on here.

12:12.030 --> 12:15.570
Well 12 divided by 1 is 12.

12:15.570 --> 12:23.220
Therefore in terms of where you can have all 12 of them displayed in a single row but 12 divided by

12:23.370 --> 12:26.450
eight is basically eight.

12:26.460 --> 12:31.680
So you will have this and the remainder is four so you can have another call NMDA so you can squeeze

12:31.740 --> 12:35.550
another call an empty four.

12:35.700 --> 12:40.240
So as long as the total number is 12 you can squeeze them in here.

12:41.970 --> 12:48.970
And 12 divide by four is three so it can def. if you want if you want to have three columns in a single

12:48.970 --> 12:54.710
row they need to be empty four so that they can fit into a single row so you have calling them before

12:54.720 --> 13:00.190
call and before in court before you have four you have three of them and you can see that they are written

13:00.190 --> 13:03.140
out here one below the other.

13:03.250 --> 13:07.250
They can have three of them there if you six six to 12 divided by six as do.

13:07.390 --> 13:12.120
So in terms of width you can only have two in a single row.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.110
OK.

13:13.180 --> 13:14.610
So now that sort it out.

13:14.710 --> 13:22.630
We have six we have stated that our call and will be empty 12 12 divided by 12 is one hence we can only

13:22.630 --> 13:30.130
squeeze in one colon per row and within that call and we're going to have all of our info for a single

13:30.440 --> 13:31.220
account.

13:31.270 --> 13:39.780
If you go back to the site and use our own site website let's just reload it.

13:39.790 --> 13:40.190
There you go.

13:40.190 --> 13:43.410
So this is row and column.

13:43.880 --> 13:47.340
So here you have one single caller.

13:47.430 --> 13:48.480
It is M.D 12.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.770
So you can only have one you cannot have two.

13:50.970 --> 13:58.410
And then again we go into the 12 and other one is displayed right below it.

13:58.420 --> 14:08.650
So this is you have a row here and this law effectively belongs to a row so this class called an empty

14:08.650 --> 14:11.630
12 belongs to this class row.

14:11.630 --> 14:12.760
So to say.

14:12.940 --> 14:19.150
And since it's 12 you can only have one colon for an account that will be displayed on the screen in

14:19.150 --> 14:20.390
one row.

14:21.860 --> 14:22.470
OK.

14:22.560 --> 14:28.980
In addition to the bootstrap class call and the dash 12 we also have our own which is A.S.C. and we

14:28.980 --> 14:34.800
have up component Dotsie assess where we have actually plugged in some of our own styling.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.520
We have added it.

14:35.520 --> 14:42.120
So in addition to actually using the bootstrap styles you can use some customization options such as

14:42.220 --> 14:44.210
a DS without any problems.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.990
So can go back to the HD.

14:49.810 --> 14:53.670
Anyway if we scroll down a little bit I just want to explain.

14:53.700 --> 14:57.160
And I just want to explain basically these two things.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.900
And then we are going to cut a story because I am running a little bit short on time.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.630
You have here strong.

15:03.850 --> 15:12.330
And then we've taken a class a lead this is balance and so if you go back to the site it's referring

15:12.330 --> 15:15.110
to this part of your balance school and then five six seven.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.760
Now this is just enlarging the.

15:17.790 --> 15:21.030
The number here in regard to balance.

15:21.540 --> 15:27.390
So I think just go ahead and press control X here and save this

15:30.670 --> 15:33.670
you can see that five six seven is now a lot smaller.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.210
It's still bold but it's a lot smaller.

15:36.210 --> 15:46.250
So we would like to enlarge that risk save and save it 5 6 7 has been enlarged here.

15:47.130 --> 15:51.100
No problems OK going down below.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.890
We again have another row and this is four buttons.

15:55.530 --> 16:02.580
So if data is going to be called an M.D. 3 so we can squeeze three colons there but we don't really

16:02.580 --> 16:03.930
actually have three cones.

16:03.930 --> 16:11.820
We've just created we just which is going to have basically two buttons one next to another.

16:12.030 --> 16:18.260
And as you can see here we have the lead and select ify.

16:18.550 --> 16:24.460
I can basically delete this control save

16:27.220 --> 16:34.260
epic and see that the delete here is completely different now from the select from the style for the

16:34.260 --> 16:36.250
select button.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.320
So we're going to leave that as it is.

16:40.730 --> 16:46.400
We've just had it styling from the between class and between dash danger now between dash danger and

16:46.400 --> 16:47.000
Beechen dash.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.790
Primary will signify the colors of the buttons.

16:52.280 --> 17:01.870
Just reload it to save it control us just wait for it to restart.

17:01.890 --> 17:09.310
OK so the BT in-dash danger basically that just means that the button will be red and primary will be

17:09.310 --> 17:15.360
blue within this theme with some other team who might have different colors.

17:15.400 --> 17:19.270
But here in this particular team it's going to be red and blue.

17:19.460 --> 17:24.410
We're just specifying the colors and nothing else pretty much with this beauty and danger and beauty

17:24.400 --> 17:28.410
and dash primary we haven't changed the logic of the site at all.

17:28.420 --> 17:33.480
The only thing that we have changed is the styling that is being applied.

17:33.500 --> 17:39.200
So now we're going to go ahead and move on to the lower part of this demo code but that we're going

17:39.200 --> 17:44.310
to do the follow up to Tauriel as I am in the 17th minute at the 17 minute mark.

17:44.330 --> 17:48.530
The videos need to be shorted in 20 and I don't think that you enjoyed the longer ones anyway.
