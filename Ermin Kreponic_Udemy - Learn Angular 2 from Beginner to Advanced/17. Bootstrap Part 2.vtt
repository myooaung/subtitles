00:00.900 --> 00:02.960
So let's go ahead and continue.

00:03.050 --> 00:07.050
We're past these buttons and we're going to go down below.

00:07.050 --> 00:16.110
Once again we have a row and then call them the six while I'm using calling them D6 here for the add

00:16.200 --> 00:19.860
new account and place where you can basically see a new account.

00:19.860 --> 00:21.790
Why is it called and D6.

00:21.930 --> 00:27.300
Half of the screen half screen size that space will not have screen size because we're using this container

00:27.330 --> 00:29.270
but just half size.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.320
Let's go ahead and describe it as such.

00:31.320 --> 00:39.600
Because as you can see it literally takes half of the width of the container size if we use container

00:39.600 --> 00:44.330
fluid it would actually be half the screen size that.

00:44.710 --> 00:50.950
So this entire form the simple form is half of the container with OK.

00:51.670 --> 00:54.060
So it's an empty six.

00:54.140 --> 00:55.050
And your count.

00:55.090 --> 00:58.910
And now we have something new here it's as glass equals four group.

00:59.170 --> 01:06.370
So we would like this to be in one group which will be detached from the group down below intron term

01:06.430 --> 01:09.820
will be detached from this group down below.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.800
What am I doing here.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.770
Well see title.

01:12.940 --> 01:18.280
So the input field for the title it's in one group and then you go to another forum group where you

01:18.280 --> 01:25.170
have a description and then you go into another group which is where you have balance and as you can

01:25.170 --> 01:31.410
see tidal and you put a title here and then you have a different group which is a description where

01:31.410 --> 01:37.370
you can type in a description and that is basically what bootstrap does is separate these two.

01:37.410 --> 01:40.340
A little bit and style of them as well.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.870
So no big deal there.

01:42.870 --> 01:52.080
If we go all further down below you will see that we also need to state for and control in order to

01:52.080 --> 01:54.580
state that this input should be styled.

01:54.720 --> 01:59.240
We see it with the bootstrap as well.

01:59.310 --> 02:02.520
So you get some nice things.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.480
I see it.

02:03.690 --> 02:08.300
It just looks better in general but we have plugged in some of our own styles.

02:08.310 --> 02:14.460
So just just to before I leave this file go from here.

02:14.470 --> 02:20.960
So this one this one and this one.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.010
They are the same just for different inputs.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.640
That's all that there is to it.

02:26.090 --> 02:32.350
But we have created some of our own styles and if we go into see a SS apt out component Dotsie SS for

02:32.390 --> 02:41.070
Dot A.S.C. you have Bouyeri bottom and it's one pixel and it's solid which means it's not interrupted

02:41.080 --> 02:48.270
it's one story one line around the padding you already know the background color you already know.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.200
But why are we stating border bottom here and look down bloats is not A.S.C..

02:52.210 --> 03:03.680
Colin first child border top Well OK let me just go ahead and zoom in.

03:03.710 --> 03:07.450
We don't want each one of these to have a top border.

03:07.490 --> 03:10.620
We want only the first one to have the top border you can see it.

03:10.820 --> 03:16.700
If I move the mouse away you can see that there is a very thin black line across the top.

03:16.700 --> 03:17.450
In fact

03:20.020 --> 03:22.700
border top we can.

03:22.890 --> 03:25.080
I don't know we can do something crazy like this.

03:28.960 --> 03:36.070
As you can see the border is a lot thicker and we only won the first child to have the top border because

03:36.130 --> 03:41.740
all the other ones we want them to have the bottom border so that in between them we wouldn't have double

03:41.830 --> 03:44.410
borders which would look kind of stupid.

03:44.860 --> 03:50.200
So only the first one will have the top border and the other ones will have the bottom one.

03:50.230 --> 03:54.040
So I mean just go ahead and state that this is basically one.

03:54.490 --> 03:55.550
So it's his first child.

03:55.570 --> 03:59.240
The first one that's that's going to be displayed there will have the top order.

03:59.470 --> 04:10.510
Everybody else including that first child will have the bottom border so that's that's very useful for

04:10.510 --> 04:15.030
us in terms of styling and A.S.C. colon hover.

04:15.040 --> 04:21.070
It means that basically we have a background color every time we move our mouse over it.

04:21.070 --> 04:25.790
So here it's greed painfully green.

04:25.990 --> 04:31.390
And then you have the form down below which is the last on our input form.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.970
So just giving it some just giving in a margin.

04:35.020 --> 04:38.110
And then the border that's that you know.

04:38.140 --> 04:40.190
But border radius What does this mean.

04:40.190 --> 04:41.740
So it says for pixels.

04:41.950 --> 04:46.040
That's the curve's to zoom in furter.

04:46.130 --> 04:52.800
And as you can see the left and right border the left and right the borders to the top left to the.

04:52.820 --> 04:53.230
Sorry.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.400
These ones from they would form the borders of the entire form.

04:57.410 --> 04:58.240
They have a curve.

04:58.280 --> 05:05.860
They have a slight curve around the edges which is really what we want so far.

05:05.910 --> 05:10.000
If border radius was zero we obviously wouldn't have any.

05:10.460 --> 05:18.500
Well if we could then just delete it basically Anyway anyway we go back to the apt component and here

05:18.500 --> 05:22.760
we have the very last thing that we're going to do here just as another form group we're creating another

05:22.760 --> 05:32.240
form group for our button B.T. and success BATNA between success so BATNA success is basically to create

05:32.240 --> 05:34.810
that's green in this style.

05:34.850 --> 05:42.590
In this in this team it's going to be green and some other team might have a different color but that's

05:42.590 --> 05:43.280
all they're doing here.

05:43.280 --> 05:48.690
But just using the button class and in restating which color we wanted to be.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.210
OK so that's it.

05:51.230 --> 05:55.550
We're going to go ahead and move onwards in the follow up tutorial.
