00:00.720 --> 00:05.950
So let's go ahead and do a little bit of up account data component.

00:06.030 --> 00:06.510
Yes.

00:06.570 --> 00:09.950
We're going to remove a good amount of things.

00:10.170 --> 00:20.920
So first of all this goodbye we don't really need it these to bid farewell don't need them.

00:23.200 --> 00:30.550
Account Services bÃ©l-princess going to need a count for goodbye.

00:31.030 --> 00:34.950
And we are not going to need account lists.

00:34.990 --> 00:37.440
So goodbye.

00:38.140 --> 00:46.680
However what we will need is to add another line so import will need them though.

00:46.700 --> 00:50.380
Another one of those Routier directives router

00:53.340 --> 00:54.710
directives.

00:57.630 --> 00:58.500
From

01:02.900 --> 01:07.260
angular Bauder.

01:07.640 --> 01:20.380
OK so this component discompose this component so we'll have some outs and we will want to we will we

01:20.380 --> 01:22.320
will need to utilize them so it is needed.

01:22.330 --> 01:31.240
So it is needed to actually plug in the router outlet which we are going to use here so there will be

01:31.240 --> 01:34.100
a router outlet here.

01:34.510 --> 01:36.050
Actually you know what.

01:36.060 --> 01:40.850
Let's just go ahead and create it now so you can actually see what I'm doing.

01:40.930 --> 01:42.720
We have actually done this before.

01:42.730 --> 01:45.990
I do believe that it will be familiar to you

01:48.890 --> 01:52.040
this is where the content will be able to go

01:56.470 --> 01:59.000
and for this to be possible here.

01:59.460 --> 02:07.240
Basically they need to create a we need to plug in a router directives so we doubted this would not

02:07.240 --> 02:08.250
be possible.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.010
So that there is to it.

02:10.180 --> 02:11.490
And then you go down below.

02:11.530 --> 02:21.070
You go to where it says account component this curly bracket and then you basically scroll all the way

02:21.070 --> 02:21.770
down.

02:21.880 --> 02:26.210
Just don't select the last curly bracket and delete everything.

02:26.840 --> 02:27.690
OK.

02:28.320 --> 02:37.060
Under directives we don't really need any of these we just need rodder directives.

02:39.620 --> 02:42.090
Rodder directors and that's it.

02:42.410 --> 02:45.350
So all done fine and dandy.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.570
Can you even recognize the class.

02:48.800 --> 02:54.410
Oh and by the way between these two we will have depending on where we click.

02:54.410 --> 03:01.730
We will have the accounts list or the box for the actual creation of the accounts.

03:03.620 --> 03:08.240
And if you're wondering well I mean why did you leave the palace.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.550
I mean there is nothing in it.

03:10.850 --> 03:17.570
Well you kind of have to have it due to the ruling due to the way that angular functions.

03:17.570 --> 03:23.270
So this component is actually kind of like a class or you need or you need a class even though it does

03:23.390 --> 03:24.000
nothing.

03:24.020 --> 03:28.310
You still need there if you don't have it there you're going to encounter problems.

03:28.310 --> 03:31.010
This is not going to work.

03:31.500 --> 03:31.750
OK.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.520
So that's basically it.

03:34.790 --> 03:40.910
We're going to go ahead and continue to follow tutorial will we will create a bunch of other things.
