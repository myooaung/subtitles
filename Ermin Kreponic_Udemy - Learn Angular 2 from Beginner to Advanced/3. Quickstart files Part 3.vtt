WEBVTT

00:00.440 --> 00:06.620
OK so the next think we're going to take a look at is the index dot DML.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.470
So it's right here.

00:08.820 --> 00:15.340
Anyway you have this well not a very large file but here our application will begin.

00:15.360 --> 00:23.370
And here we will include all that needs to be included in order for our project to actually come alive

00:23.970 --> 00:25.530
anyway.

00:26.400 --> 00:33.210
These are standard HD M-L tags so you open them and you close them and then we have the head tags for

00:33.240 --> 00:38.850
the header and then we have a title here the title will be angular to QuickStart.

00:38.850 --> 00:45.550
It's of course something that will in all likelihood in all probability be altered to suit our needs

00:45.560 --> 00:51.960
as we're not going to name our application angular to QuickStart we're going to name it something else.

00:51.960 --> 00:56.450
Anyway this is the title that you will see in the browser tab.

00:58.190 --> 01:05.900
Double-O we have a char set UTF 8 meaning that you will be able to use characters from pretty much any

01:05.900 --> 01:11.870
keyboard and take out the grain of salt because I'm not sure about the Chinese characters but pretty

01:11.870 --> 01:21.240
much anything from the Western world you will be able to use with UTF 8 down below the viewport content

01:21.510 --> 01:22.340
extra.

01:22.550 --> 01:29.050
Pretty sure if you can actually conclude what this stands for what this is says with equals device with

01:30.140 --> 01:36.590
this is this particular line is here so that your site would scale in accordance with the device that

01:36.590 --> 01:38.570
is basically accessing it.

01:38.570 --> 01:42.620
By this I mean if you are accessing it from your phone and if you're accessing it from a computer with

01:42.620 --> 01:46.120
a 24 inch screen there are two completely different things.

01:46.130 --> 01:47.570
Obviously one is 24 inch.

01:47.570 --> 01:51.100
The other one is maybe six set max.

01:51.380 --> 01:59.060
So the site needs to scale in accordance with the width of the device screen devices screen which is

01:59.060 --> 02:05.000
very nice meaning that you don't need to make actually two separate sites for mobile and for desktop

02:05.000 --> 02:11.110
versions but rather instead the same site will simply scale to the size of the screen in a proper manner.

02:11.480 --> 02:12.740
Ok done below.

02:12.890 --> 02:20.410
We have a link basically to for the style that will be used on our site.

02:20.420 --> 02:27.170
We will in all likelihood probability use bootstrap as well.

02:27.170 --> 02:31.270
Pretty much everybody uses it and it's very simple and it's very good.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.830
So why not.

02:34.070 --> 02:41.850
OK so Double-O we have these things are generic so they just need to be there you don't need to study

02:41.850 --> 02:48.760
them in great detail but let me just go ahead and go over them in the simplest possible manner.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.990
So the first line the first script that will be plugged in here.

02:54.180 --> 03:00.220
It provides something like a compatibility layer so that our site would work on older browsers.

03:00.420 --> 03:04.440
Although why anybody would use older browsers is actually beyond me.

03:04.440 --> 03:11.480
I really do not understand since I know of no browser that you actually need to pay for to get updates.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.670
As you can freely update pretty much all of them.

03:15.120 --> 03:24.030
So why is that so I have no idea why why people use older browsers I have no idea about this makes perfect

03:24.030 --> 03:28.830
sense because people do use older browsers and we would like our application to work with pretty much

03:28.830 --> 03:30.180
every single browser out there.

03:30.180 --> 03:37.920
Therefore in Therefore we are going to go ahead and utilize this script here.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.060
That's its purpose.

03:39.060 --> 03:42.130
The next one down below.

03:42.560 --> 03:49.070
Now this is just basically needed by angular so that it would function properly without it it will not

03:49.070 --> 03:56.170
function properly and angular relies on it so that it would perform well for the time being.

03:56.210 --> 04:01.270
I'm going to go ahead and leave zones as they are.

04:01.400 --> 04:07.460
I'm not going to go ahead and dive deep into what zones are or how they function etc. as this is a rather

04:07.460 --> 04:09.610
advanced subject in angular.

04:09.620 --> 04:13.820
And it's really not fit for beginning stages.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.020
Just how much.

04:15.890 --> 04:17.210
Just leave it at what it does.

04:17.270 --> 04:25.520
And later on we will eventually stumble across we will move into more advanced things once we are once

04:25.520 --> 04:28.570
we are once we have actually mastered the simplest of things.

04:28.970 --> 04:30.860
And then these things will be explained.

04:30.860 --> 04:36.680
For now to explain it would actually make no sense whatsoever to definitions that I would give you would

04:36.680 --> 04:39.050
be basically hieroglyphs.

04:40.230 --> 04:46.710
Anyway if you really are that interested at this point in time to know exactly what zone G does or what

04:46.710 --> 04:51.770
zones are in general here go on the net and there are plenty of definitions out there.

04:51.780 --> 04:55.640
But I assure you you will find them very confusing at this point in time.

04:57.210 --> 05:01.110
Next up you have reflect Yes.

05:01.140 --> 05:08.760
So this script basically allows for the usage of decorators whose usage will be demonstrated later on

05:08.880 --> 05:13.890
along their merry way because to explain the decorators.

05:13.950 --> 05:16.170
Now again could be something.

05:16.200 --> 05:21.530
It would be it would have a similar effect as me describing what zones are.

05:22.050 --> 05:23.500
Let me put it like this.

05:23.520 --> 05:30.810
I don't mean to insult anyone especially not myself in this case but imagine that you just started learning

05:30.810 --> 05:37.440
math and you're obviously not going to begin with trigonometric functions are going to begin with something

05:37.440 --> 05:43.500
like plus minus equals etc. and then move on to the Trigon the metric functions.

05:43.500 --> 05:50.610
Same case here except here we actually plug these things in an age anerobic Arafat fashion so that the

05:50.610 --> 05:52.670
application would actually work at all.

05:52.770 --> 05:59.910
But we don't need to know immediately what each one of these scripts does how it functions as we will

05:59.940 --> 06:02.640
learn that along the merry way.

06:03.030 --> 06:08.060
So next up we have system s r c r g s.

06:08.070 --> 06:18.300
Now this script with this line we're basically including system J us modular and after this line we

06:18.300 --> 06:21.640
can use it in our project as from this point onwards.

06:21.660 --> 06:24.730
It actually exists so this is a key concept to understand.

06:24.930 --> 06:31.290
So if we plug this in this exists from this point on it does not exist above.

06:31.290 --> 06:34.810
So you cannot use anything from here above.

06:34.830 --> 06:36.210
You can only use it.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.880
You can use things from here down below.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.950
That's how it is.

06:42.990 --> 06:46.750
Anyway that's just up a way of explaining it a way of putting it.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.330
So say

06:50.740 --> 06:51.570
the system.

06:51.580 --> 06:57.790
We've basically explained in the previous tutorial I can remind you a little bit.

06:57.790 --> 07:01.490
Basically system G-S is a dynamic module loader.

07:01.660 --> 07:11.160
The QuickStart uses the system just basically to load libraries as and our modules as well.

07:11.650 --> 07:18.880
So I've just read a line from my notes but if you didn't figure what system just that is to the fullest

07:19.000 --> 07:19.430
extent.

07:19.450 --> 07:25.160
Please feel free to go back a story or two and check it out.

07:25.510 --> 07:29.230
Anyway it's not terribly important at this point in time.

07:29.260 --> 07:36.640
Once again now down below we move into these into the

07:39.850 --> 07:42.990
system just start config dot J us.

07:43.060 --> 07:50.970
So we need this script in order for the system just to be configured in the first place.

07:51.460 --> 07:58.930
So keep that in mind and down below this a final this final thing that we're going to import this is

07:58.930 --> 08:05.680
actually probably the most interesting one and this is something that you do need to know what it actually

08:05.680 --> 08:06.370
is.

08:06.370 --> 08:15.490
So here our application begins so as this line that I have highlighted this is where our application

08:15.550 --> 08:16.340
will begin.

08:16.570 --> 08:26.880
And here for the first time we are actually loading something that is a part of our application system

08:26.890 --> 08:29.970
J.S. we'll import d apt module.

08:30.190 --> 08:33.130
We've talked about that before you have the app here.

08:33.390 --> 08:41.620
Let me just expand it and main database files so this one right here.

08:42.130 --> 08:47.860
And basically if it fails it is it.

08:47.950 --> 08:48.880
There we go.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.740
So basically if it fails it's just going to catch the error.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.330
In our case it really shouldn't fail there is no reason for it.

08:55.330 --> 09:00.360
It's basically default configuration aside from some minor changes.

09:00.370 --> 09:04.720
But this is probably the most important and the most interesting line here.

09:05.230 --> 09:08.140
Down below we have these strange tags.

09:08.140 --> 09:16.510
I mean you've probably seen body tags head tags script tags before but my app tags you probably haven't

09:16.510 --> 09:19.980
seen before and this is going to be explained later on as well.

09:19.990 --> 09:26.470
But for the time being no dead this part here where it says loading and three dots before our application

09:26.470 --> 09:33.430
is imported and functional loading three dots will be displayed on the screen and we will get into the

09:33.430 --> 09:40.280
my app tags a little bit later on for the time being I'm going to go ahead and bedew fair.

09:40.330 --> 09:40.980
Well.
