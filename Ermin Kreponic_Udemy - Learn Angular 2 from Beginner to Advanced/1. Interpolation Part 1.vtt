00:00.360 --> 00:02.040
Welcome back.

00:02.040 --> 00:08.890
So today today we're actually going to start coding and I just dropped by Mausers I said that but oh

00:08.920 --> 00:16.900
well I do believe that from this point onwards we will do nothing but actual code.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.670
There's no one could be there.

00:18.710 --> 00:23.440
I don't believe that there was any more need for talk about individual things that you see around you

00:24.040 --> 00:29.320
here but rather instead we can focus primarily on the code itself.

00:29.680 --> 00:38.980
So let's go ahead and begin the very first thing that we're going to do is replace this with a template

00:39.010 --> 00:40.020
you are l.

00:40.210 --> 00:43.350
Now you might wonder why on earth would we do that.

00:43.360 --> 00:53.860
Well we want to actually have an HD M-L file somewhere else which we are going to upload from which

00:53.860 --> 00:56.480
we are going to access from here.

00:56.970 --> 01:01.800
Well maybe not access from here but we're going to give a path to it here.

01:01.920 --> 01:07.020
We want to have a separate HDMI file where we can do the entirety of our HD m-L.

01:07.210 --> 01:13.690
We do not want to be doing our HD M-L here although it is kind of possible I guess but it would be very

01:13.690 --> 01:19.900
messy very inconvenient and quite frankly it would look very it would look terrific.

01:19.900 --> 01:26.370
Imagine if he had like 50 lines each DML code here that would be like amazing.

01:26.830 --> 01:32.770
So just go ahead select this line and press delete.

01:32.770 --> 01:34.120
Gone forever.

01:34.330 --> 01:37.200
Well not really compress control set to bring it back.

01:37.710 --> 01:38.850
Yep there we go.

01:38.980 --> 01:42.690
So its not gone forever but soon it will be anyway.

01:42.880 --> 01:53.960
You type in template you are l and you of course need to actually provide the L to the given template.

01:54.280 --> 02:06.750
Basically type in a Peepy slash APCP DOT COM component dot h DML and that should be our path.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.420
Now you might want your source where.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.470
Wait whoa.

02:09.510 --> 02:12.270
I mean where on earth is this file.

02:12.490 --> 02:17.800
Well you see this app folder on top you know the one where we actually remove things from.

02:17.860 --> 02:20.200
Well now we're going to put things into it.

02:20.380 --> 02:26.530
So just go ahead and right click on it and click on new file.

02:26.530 --> 02:29.940
Now what will the name of this glorious new file be.

02:30.090 --> 02:32.310
Well it's going to be KPP.

02:32.470 --> 02:37.420
Here it's a backslash and then KPP again dot

02:39.850 --> 02:47.860
component dot h d l and then press enter and there you go.

02:48.050 --> 02:49.560
It's right there.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.590
It's actually been spawned into existence.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.710
Anyway we can go back to D.

02:57.740 --> 03:01.170
Basically a BP component dot TS.

03:01.370 --> 03:06.560
And here you can see that the path is actually matching except except for the backslash.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.500
But don't worry about that.

03:07.500 --> 03:10.520
That's just the that's just a Windows thing.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.870
Everybody uses a slash.

03:11.870 --> 03:16.470
For some strange reason God knows why they like to use a backslash.

03:17.470 --> 03:21.810
But hey what can you really do about it.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.830
We're going to go back to the HD.

03:23.860 --> 03:27.730
And here we're going to go ahead and begin playing around.

03:28.060 --> 03:36.850
Now almost all the MLS index is valid in an angular template except for these things.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.780
So there are some exceptions which are not valid.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.020
So script.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.650
So this is not a valid tag.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.370
You might say oh but wait we have it.

03:48.370 --> 03:54.220
We look at how many script tags we have here how can you say it's not valid.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.990
Well this is an index thought.

03:57.100 --> 04:00.400
And this is something that we're going to you and repr component.

04:00.460 --> 04:03.230
HMO is something that we're going to use as a template.

04:03.280 --> 04:09.860
So these things are not valid syntax in a template but you can certainly use them in index that DML

04:11.190 --> 04:15.690
otherwise it would pretty much be impossible to run this application.

04:16.290 --> 04:20.340
So delete that and reason for this.

04:20.340 --> 04:23.520
Why why are these not considered to be valid syntax.

04:23.520 --> 04:31.350
Well it's for protection from script injection attacks usually script tags are just ignored.

04:31.680 --> 04:32.530
Also tags.

04:32.550 --> 04:40.290
As for example DML or body.

04:41.730 --> 04:44.010
They don't really play.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.190
They don't really have a useful role here.

04:46.230 --> 04:48.650
I mean quite literally at all.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.390
So we're going to go ahead and delete that.

04:51.390 --> 04:53.740
However these tags do rule.

04:53.820 --> 05:01.560
So if I type in age 1 and you see Adam is kind enough to render its aid to me and to give me suggestions

05:02.220 --> 05:15.080
so I can type in my file my first and Giller to up there we go.

05:15.080 --> 05:22.600
So the same thing which we have which we have had written before we have written now.

05:22.950 --> 05:27.930
So this is definitely going to print out no big deal.

05:29.090 --> 05:35.590
And we can even do this oh this is actually running well let's stop it from running.

05:41.370 --> 05:46.970
Hey well keyboard seems to be not responsive at the moment.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.150
Let's see how this is working out.

05:51.130 --> 05:54.420
Loading.

05:54.540 --> 05:55.950
It is a Wii.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.200
But OK.

05:57.210 --> 05:59.120
Look it says the same thing.

05:59.130 --> 06:03.440
But what we have not done is actually saved anything.

06:03.510 --> 06:07.320
So just control us on this one and.

06:07.830 --> 06:10.270
Yes of course you need to press control.

06:10.560 --> 06:14.230
And that should save it if it doesn't I'll just do it manually.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.350
But I mean controllers should really work

06:19.390 --> 06:24.280
and it says my first and killer app case so it still works.

06:24.430 --> 06:28.540
Let's go ahead and change this old Just so you know that it's changed.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.980
I would like to know this change as well.

06:32.200 --> 06:44.880
Let's give it a paragraph and let's just say this is just an well this is this is definitely something

06:45.720 --> 06:46.730
that will light up.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.570
So just a standard paragraph.

06:48.570 --> 06:54.640
This is what we would like to be printed out on the screen and control us again to save.

06:54.690 --> 06:55.340
And there you go.

06:55.410 --> 06:57.920
So this is something it does indeed.

06:58.110 --> 07:06.970
It does indeed change so control it does work because sometimes on the VM and in Windows in general

07:06.970 --> 07:12.660
things don't tend to work out the way I expect them to like to be certain of these things.

07:12.880 --> 07:18.160
So anyway it says Heather one my first to my first angular to app as before.

07:18.160 --> 07:23.530
And then you have a paragraph down below it says this is something

07:26.690 --> 07:30.800
OK let's go ahead and see something else.

07:31.040 --> 07:39.950
So interpellation for interpellation we use a double curly braces everything inside braces is evaluated

07:39.950 --> 07:43.880
by angular and then converted to a string.

07:44.540 --> 07:52.760
It can see this it can just do this and then I added salt

07:55.980 --> 08:02.450
of one plus one is three.

08:03.190 --> 08:05.310
I don't know it could be in some universe.

08:05.580 --> 08:09.040
It's quite possible actually in my opinion anyway.

08:13.550 --> 08:15.790
There you go control as they say.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.910
Now we're going to go ahead and wait for it to see.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.170
We just zoomed in.

08:21.200 --> 08:21.600
There we go.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.030
It says this is something and the result of one plus one is two.

08:26.030 --> 08:31.260
Basically this is actually evaluated here and something is being done with this.

08:31.340 --> 08:35.470
So it actually adds the two numbers and then it says to.

08:35.500 --> 08:41.170
OK so the result is two which performs a metaphorical operation and then it prints out number two on

08:41.190 --> 08:42.110
to the screen.

08:42.110 --> 08:49.000
Samples that case something just broke in the apartment above me.

08:49.020 --> 08:55.700
Not true if you actually heard that I have no idea what it could be but I don't really care.

08:55.770 --> 09:00.080
Let's go ahead and move on.

09:00.480 --> 09:11.500
Also interpellation the data binding happens precise to be more precise interpellation is just just

09:11.700 --> 09:17.040
syntax and it is converted to property binding.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.120
We will talk more about this a bit later on.

09:20.120 --> 09:26.010
Actually we'll talk about this fairly soon but difficult to understand when you don't have at least

09:26.010 --> 09:26.940
some prior knowledge.

09:26.960 --> 09:32.380
But it's ok I will get to it fairly soon I just don't want to get into it straight away.

09:32.550 --> 09:35.060
So I'm going to call historial in a moment.

09:35.070 --> 09:38.970
But before I do I just wanted to just want to recap.

09:39.030 --> 09:46.050
We have set the template you are raÃºl to a separate file which we have created and then we have created

09:46.470 --> 09:54.000
HVM and then we have written out HD M-L code which in it as opposed to actually writing the HD M-L code

09:54.410 --> 09:55.220
here.

09:55.290 --> 10:00.480
This is purely for our convenience and not only our convenience but keep in mind that there will be

10:00.480 --> 10:05.040
a lot of other people who will be reading your code and you will be working with a lot of other people

10:05.040 --> 10:06.490
usually that's how it is.

10:06.690 --> 10:14.490
You work with people on projects and it's good to segment things anyway farewell and we'll see each

10:14.490 --> 10:15.330
other in the follow up.
