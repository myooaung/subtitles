WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:00.760
OK.

00:00.960 --> 00:02.050
So welcome back.

00:02.430 --> 00:05.200
Let's go ahead and continue onwards.

00:05.730 --> 00:12.030
We've finished the first day of not the first year but we finished these two divs and now we're going

00:12.030 --> 00:16.380
to go ahead and move on to the one right underneath it.

00:16.380 --> 00:20.190
Now here we're going to play around with click events.

00:20.190 --> 00:22.200
So on click.

00:22.520 --> 00:27.330
Something's going to happen not click events but something similar to it I guess.

00:27.780 --> 00:31.180
So we have it says Heather 3 change email.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.140
OK.

00:32.340 --> 00:38.030
So we scroll down just a little bit more.

00:38.580 --> 00:43.220
So the first oh my God it says here change e-mail.

00:43.290 --> 00:45.160
And then there is the input field.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.140
OK.

00:46.650 --> 00:51.080
So change email and then there is an input field here.

00:51.090 --> 00:58.200
So input type and we type in the text and the name is name and then we have a reference to this input

00:58.200 --> 01:02.360
feel to this input element which is basically new mail.

01:02.370 --> 01:07.390
So that's going to be a reference to it down below it immediately.

01:07.410 --> 01:08.880
We have a button.

01:09.350 --> 01:13.770
It's not placed here right down below it it's place next to it here we could place it down below.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.470
But anyway it says change e-mail.

01:15.480 --> 01:21.960
And then there is a button that you can click on that will perform that will cause certain logic to

01:22.050 --> 01:22.760
occur.

01:25.450 --> 01:31.700
The wonderful phone noise but oh well some can't be loaded anyway.

01:32.330 --> 01:33.390
Yes.

01:33.880 --> 01:40.610
So there was a button and then it says click and then on click we've done some binding here.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.490
It says change mail.

01:42.540 --> 01:50.060
We're calling a method and we're passing some sort of a parameter to that method.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.490
And the name of the button is actually change.

01:53.490 --> 01:56.840
So that's the that's this right here.

01:57.150 --> 02:03.540
But here we've actually got we're actually calling a method change mail and then we're passing a value

02:03.540 --> 02:04.710
to it change.

02:04.740 --> 02:09.580
Mail is a method from the components.

02:09.630 --> 02:16.380
You just move the components down below and change mail change mail.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.410
Yep there we go.

02:17.660 --> 02:18.140
So there we go.

02:18.140 --> 02:19.840
There is a method change.

02:19.880 --> 02:20.860
Mail here.

02:21.660 --> 02:22.080
There you go.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.910
It says there change mail.

02:24.150 --> 02:32.240
It accepts a single parameter of type string and then performs and then it changes the current user

02:32.250 --> 02:39.210
dot e-mail and it initializes it to whatever we actually have passed to it whatever string we have actually

02:39.210 --> 02:40.910
passed to it.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.710
So it says your new mail.

02:43.710 --> 02:50.290
So that is a reference to this input element and we've typed in new mail dot value.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.510
Now what are we doing here.

02:51.510 --> 02:57.860
We are pooling whatever we have to whatever text we have actually typed into the input field and we're

02:57.900 --> 03:02.950
passing that text to the change mail method from app component.

03:03.010 --> 03:09.770
Yes that is exactly what's going to happen here so you have changed mail.

03:09.800 --> 03:14.570
You typed something in here throw at

03:19.460 --> 03:29.940
something thing dot com while sometimes managed to amaze myself and if I click and I can click change

03:30.210 --> 03:30.970
but ok.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.280
Nothing's going to happen.

03:33.300 --> 03:41.570
You see I need to call I need to call some sort of I need to like just toggle click and then your email

03:41.630 --> 03:44.100
is throw lot at something dotcom.

03:44.130 --> 03:45.570
I want to look up here.

03:45.610 --> 03:48.520
Well they need to go back to tutorials for that.

03:48.620 --> 03:55.100
That is basically something that basically a button that actually either shows your e-mail or hides

03:55.100 --> 03:56.150
your email.

03:56.150 --> 03:59.460
The logic for it is up here somewhere.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.880
So it's in the top.

04:01.070 --> 04:02.850
There we go soapie hidden.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.160
So you have the logic for it.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.360
Here it says to go click.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.490
So if I click on it to hide it I can click on it to show it.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.170
But it does display.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.260
If I go ahead and change this to blah

04:17.870 --> 04:24.590
blah dot com if I click on change it's going to say blah blah com.

04:24.630 --> 04:28.360
In fact here let me just zoom this out so you can see it better.

04:28.430 --> 04:37.720
We are our dot com change and there we go the changes enacted immediately.

04:37.720 --> 04:42.010
The reason why you didn't see it immediately is because we've implemented a function to actually hide

04:42.010 --> 04:49.000
the displaying of the e-mail we've implemented logic to actually hide the spelling of the e-mail.

04:49.140 --> 04:55.060
Anyway going back to this I mean just scroll down.

04:55.240 --> 05:00.020
So that would be this part here where you can actually type in an e-mail address and then change it

05:00.040 --> 05:03.630
doesn't need to be an e-mail address you can change pretty much whatever you want in this fashion.

05:04.980 --> 05:12.070
Morales again we have some sort of change e-mail logic but this one is a little bit different.

05:12.140 --> 05:17.790
So this one is actually tied to the event on the keyboard.

05:17.830 --> 05:23.920
When we actually press and release a key so key up so you press it and then you release it.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.310
And that's key.

05:25.930 --> 05:27.530
That is the key.

05:27.830 --> 05:31.090
That is the actual method that I explained a moment ago.

05:31.090 --> 05:35.870
So key press there you go this is referring so.

05:35.940 --> 05:42.930
And this we are going to use in conjunction with this method here in order to enact exactly the same

05:42.930 --> 05:44.400
changes as before.

05:44.420 --> 05:49.610
But within with by pressing Enter on the keyboard.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.170
So everything is the same again.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.800
Heather change email input type text.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.010
We're creating another reference to it.

05:56.010 --> 06:03.810
See this reference is in your mail and then number two and then we're giving this key up and says key

06:03.900 --> 06:08.050
press parentheses dollar sign event.

06:08.050 --> 06:11.760
So this is something that is very unique to angular too.

06:11.790 --> 06:14.790
It is its way of processing these sort of events.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.130
This is not like email.

06:16.140 --> 06:21.070
This is this is something that's angular too specific.

06:21.090 --> 06:27.720
Then of course we have a a button that click we can use a button as before but we don't actually use

06:27.720 --> 06:28.250
a button.

06:28.290 --> 06:32.010
We can just use the Enter And that's going to happen.

06:32.190 --> 06:35.860
So we have the method keypress.

06:36.170 --> 06:36.620
OK.

06:36.660 --> 06:41.270
So key press here and then we're passing an event to it.

06:42.710 --> 06:48.230
It accepts a keyboard event it checks if the event key code is 13.

06:48.380 --> 06:55.250
It stores that into a variable but before it stores it it needs to convert it to the input element and

06:55.340 --> 06:58.800
then it calls the function change mail.

06:59.060 --> 07:03.850
And of course it takes the input element value it passes the entertainment value to the change mail

07:03.860 --> 07:09.080
function and then the chain mail function well we all know what it does it basically changes the value

07:09.140 --> 07:11.180
of that email field.

07:11.300 --> 07:20.310
If I go ahead and arduous and go to the second one right here if I type in oh oh oh.

07:20.770 --> 07:22.190
Oh no.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.530
T.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.130
B.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.680
Nuts and type and think out of the norm.

07:27.680 --> 07:32.570
And if I press enter you can see that this is actually changed.

07:32.570 --> 07:34.970
So I haven't I did not click change.

07:34.980 --> 07:42.230
Look look I'm not looking change I'm just pressing enter on my keyboard now but it changes up above.

07:42.230 --> 07:48.440
So monitor what happens here when I change something down here I can type in 3 3 3 3 and I press enter

07:48.440 --> 07:50.150
and watched the watch.

07:50.150 --> 07:50.940
Watch this part.

07:50.940 --> 07:55.110
Now here I need to be actually slow.

07:55.440 --> 07:55.730
OK.

07:55.740 --> 07:56.380
There you go.

07:56.580 --> 07:57.810
So it's 3 3 3.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.410
So it's not just a random clock you can't.

07:59.430 --> 08:04.590
You can press enter in a random fashion and be anywhere on the site you actually need to click onto

08:04.590 --> 08:07.420
this field and have the cursor pointing there.

08:07.440 --> 08:14.170
This blinking one and then press enter and then it's going to change a very very simple nothing too

08:14.180 --> 08:15.130
complex there.

08:15.210 --> 08:20.540
You just have a method which accepts a keyboard event and based upon that keyboard event it performs

08:20.540 --> 08:24.620
a certain logic on the HDR element.

08:24.640 --> 08:32.240
How does it know how does it how does this method know to actually work with this part.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.570
Is it because we have cast that input type.

08:34.610 --> 08:37.550
No that's just something that we have to do.

08:37.550 --> 08:43.550
The reason that this function actually knows that we would like it to perform certain logic for this

08:43.550 --> 08:46.150
element input here is because it's been called there.

08:46.190 --> 08:52.880
So you see keypresses actually called there so therefore it knows OK to perform logic here for this

08:52.880 --> 08:57.420
one and not for anything else anywhere else.

08:57.850 --> 09:04.160
And down below the final day of that we're going to do again it's going to refer to the same method

09:04.160 --> 09:04.560
here.

09:04.580 --> 09:05.480
Nothing new there.

09:05.660 --> 09:17.920
But instead of actually going through a lengthy process there is instead of actually one lengthy process

09:17.970 --> 09:23.290
but instead of actually passing an event in this fashion we can just do this.

09:23.350 --> 09:26.180
So input type and then it's a text.

09:26.190 --> 09:26.920
OK.

09:27.090 --> 09:33.800
We have our preference here that's referring to the input element and then it says key up that enter.

09:33.870 --> 09:36.300
So we no longer need this method down below.

09:36.300 --> 09:41.260
Immediately we have eliminated the need for this method by just typing this.

09:41.280 --> 09:48.870
This basically this one line here this one line of code actually two words in parentheses and two parentheses.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.530
So key Daut key up dot enter.

09:52.860 --> 09:59.490
When this happens go ahead and state go ahead and call change male function and pass the inputted text

09:59.820 --> 10:03.620
to this function in order to change the value of the e-mail.

10:03.630 --> 10:10.040
So all that this year is is a shortened version of this though.

10:10.160 --> 10:15.870
Might be counter-intuitive because like a weight butterman like this line is shorter than this one.

10:15.870 --> 10:16.490
Yes.

10:16.530 --> 10:20.520
But this line does not call this entire method.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.750
It has no need for it.

10:21.750 --> 10:28.140
While this line actually calls this method so see where the short applies it saves you the trouble of

10:28.140 --> 10:33.770
writing an entire method for a certain task when you can just type in key a dot enter.

10:33.770 --> 10:34.650
So it's going to work.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.090
It's going to work exactly the same.

10:36.090 --> 10:40.540
So if I just take one one one not clicking on change just pressing enter.

10:40.650 --> 10:42.520
You can see that this happens.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.800
Anyway that's it good to bid you farewell.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.530
And I will see you in the follow up Tauriel.
