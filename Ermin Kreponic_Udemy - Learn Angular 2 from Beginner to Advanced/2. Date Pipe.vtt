00:00.240 --> 00:00.500
OK.

00:00.510 --> 00:04.460
So let's have a look at the date.

00:05.670 --> 00:12.960
We used the date pope in order to play to date in a specified format so the pipe as a parameter will

00:12.960 --> 00:18.480
receive a string as usual which basically present which in this case will basically represent a format

00:18.510 --> 00:21.400
in which the date will be displayed.

00:21.450 --> 00:29.520
We could have either our own custom pipes custom formats not because some pipes will talk about custom

00:29.520 --> 00:30.680
pipes or but later.

00:30.690 --> 00:37.170
So we can have our own custom formats of date by using some sort of symbols but we also have predefined

00:37.170 --> 00:39.630
formats and usually these predefined formats are used.

00:39.630 --> 00:44.550
But let me just go ahead and show you both the custom and predefined formats.

00:44.790 --> 00:48.930
So we will only be a thing to slime and to be more precise.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.710
We'll just be altering this part here.

00:52.050 --> 01:00.220
So if we take a look at the site now you'll see it says a Sepehr 11 DC 19 Sep etc..

01:00.230 --> 01:09.030
So eight of September 11th of December 19th of September and now we're going to go ahead and enact some

01:09.090 --> 01:09.690
changes.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.710
Let's go ahead and use some of the predefined pipes.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.360
Let's go ahead and type in medium

01:19.060 --> 01:19.620
medium.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.910
OK.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.800
Controllers.

01:23.290 --> 01:24.480
Wait for it to reload.

01:24.490 --> 01:25.430
And there you go.

01:25.430 --> 01:26.530
The date format has changed.

01:26.530 --> 01:31.190
So this is a medium is a predefined format for a time and date.

01:31.330 --> 01:39.490
So it tells you like September 8 through 16 and then the time here in terms of a M at the moment in

01:39.490 --> 01:44.340
terms of AM and PM the channel so use some of that.

01:44.380 --> 01:51.580
There aren't a lot of them going to go ahead and show you all that I have all that I know we're all

01:51.580 --> 01:54.970
that I have listed here so you have short

01:58.010 --> 01:59.420
which is like this.

01:59.420 --> 02:03.660
So you see nine slash slash 2016 etc..

02:04.070 --> 02:08.100
Much better looking than the other one in terms of time anyway.

02:09.620 --> 02:10.020
OK.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.420
So medium and short will display both time and date.

02:13.440 --> 02:20.130
And then you have the ones that are predefined only for date and only for time.

02:20.490 --> 02:24.150
So Fool date

02:27.440 --> 02:29.450
if we just reload it.

02:29.560 --> 02:29.980
There you go.

02:29.990 --> 02:41.480
So it says Thursday September 8th 2016 the day the month and which day of the month is it and the year

02:42.700 --> 02:50.290
goes or have a short version or if you have a sure you have a full long medium and short.

02:50.300 --> 02:56.110
So go for an Ethiopian long I'm just demoing the differences between the formats.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.380
And there you go so September 8th 2016.

03:02.450 --> 03:06.590
This plan doesn't display the name of the day.

03:07.070 --> 03:07.640
So

03:10.430 --> 03:10.940
medium

03:14.470 --> 03:18.390
medium.

03:18.950 --> 03:19.670
Here we go.

03:19.670 --> 03:29.000
So it's Sep 8th 2016 but no time came from medium.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.720
We got short

03:34.100 --> 03:42.590
and again just a short version of the date numbers although no time for time we have medium time and

03:42.590 --> 03:43.370
short time.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.880
So we can just

03:47.560 --> 03:51.590
short time.

03:51.890 --> 03:55.450
I think there might be some other predefined piked but I've just taken these.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.980
Feel free to check out the.

03:57.010 --> 03:59.570
Feel free to consult the official documentation.

03:59.620 --> 04:04.350
So 7 0 6 1 145 son Dean etc..

04:04.360 --> 04:12.330
So this just shows the short version of time and you also have way medium.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.190
Oh why do I keep telling this.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.790
This is like the 100 time I've done this today.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.280
The misspelling.

04:20.450 --> 04:21.720
I don't know what's wrong with me.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.230
So this is the medium time.

04:23.310 --> 04:27.470
I've not much appreciative of this format at all.

04:27.470 --> 04:28.730
Kind of confusing.

04:28.940 --> 04:32.010
But anyway those would be the predefined values.

04:32.180 --> 04:35.320
Now we can customize our own values.

04:35.450 --> 04:38.830
Just go ahead and just write some pseudo code here.

04:39.200 --> 04:39.980
So you have.

04:40.010 --> 04:43.430
Why for example Y represents a year.

04:43.430 --> 04:46.670
So you can have like two wise for a two digit year.

04:46.670 --> 04:57.800
For example if it's 2016 it's just going to show 16 and you have Y Y Y Y which will present a 4 digit

04:57.800 --> 05:03.340
year meaning that it will be like two thousand and 16 or 4 digits will be displayed.

05:04.500 --> 05:13.690
And then you have m which represents a month you can have like M M which is the two digit months so

05:13.690 --> 05:22.570
it will be like 0 0 9 instead of just 9 and won't be the ninth month it will be 0 9 for the month.

05:23.080 --> 05:29.660
And you can also have like the deal represents a day.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.200
So you can have Dee-Dee.

05:31.270 --> 05:36.190
This will be a two digit day in a sense that it won't actually display the name of the day it will just

05:36.190 --> 05:42.020
displayed the number of the day within the month.

05:42.120 --> 05:52.180
You have h which represents a 24 hour format and H H is for a digit of the two digit of the hour that

05:52.180 --> 05:54.800
were present two digits for each hour.

05:55.030 --> 05:59.530
You have a lowercase h which represents a 12 hour for that

06:02.290 --> 06:06.600
M for minutes M M would display two digit per minute.

06:06.590 --> 06:12.910
So if it's for example one minute it's going to be 0 1 again so you can see that the logic pretty much

06:12.910 --> 06:16.090
follows the same way as four seconds.

06:16.090 --> 06:20.690
SS For two digit seconds you have.

06:20.730 --> 06:29.400
You can also add a Eira presents am or pm depending on what time it actually is.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.980
And you can also insert E which stands for the day of the week sic.

06:34.000 --> 06:41.950
For example do three for three letter three letter a three letter shortcut for the name of the day or

06:41.980 --> 06:49.510
E for four which is the full name of the other day.

06:49.570 --> 06:54.810
So let's just go ahead and do a demo with this one.

06:54.820 --> 06:57.830
Pretty sure you get the logic of this it's fairly simple.

06:58.420 --> 07:13.340
Let's go ahead and type in like Y Y Y Y that we're going to type in dash dash d d colon colon.

07:13.430 --> 07:15.290
SS OK.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.980
My apologies it's not

07:24.790 --> 07:26.580
it's h here.

07:30.030 --> 07:31.350
Let me just.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.180
There we go.

07:32.330 --> 07:37.310
So just don't have a just don't have dash there.

07:38.330 --> 07:47.910
On the could have it excellent So you see it now you've got the full date and then you have the full

07:48.450 --> 07:49.320
time.

07:49.800 --> 07:54.870
So just go ahead and create another demo in disregard just three how you can customize your format.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.680
For example you can do it.

08:00.360 --> 08:07.150
He can do koma and then you can for example do

08:11.540 --> 08:19.100
and that it's going to be like the coma y y.

08:19.520 --> 08:29.420
I don't know h it's going to be m s and at the end we will add a forward form.

08:29.450 --> 08:32.540
OK so let's go ahead and just that other one here for three

08:35.780 --> 08:45.770
control s because he can't have a day of the week which is represented by two by two letters.

08:45.780 --> 08:49.500
OK so there he goes it says Tuesday.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.570
Sunday Monday September 3.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.080
And that is giving you the time.

08:54.090 --> 08:59.790
And it's also stating It's 8:00 a.m. or p.m. at the end.

08:59.790 --> 09:04.080
Anyway that's it as far as I'm concerned.

09:04.350 --> 09:09.960
I'm pretty sure it is you all managed to figure this out to the fullest extent it's fairly simplistic.

09:10.010 --> 09:12.220
Any questions feel free to post them.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.340
I bid you farewell until the next Tauriel.
