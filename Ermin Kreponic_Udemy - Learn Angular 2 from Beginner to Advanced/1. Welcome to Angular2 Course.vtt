00:00.580 --> 00:06.180
Them all welcome to the singular to course and as is the case with pretty much any other boards that

00:06.180 --> 00:12.900
I made I look a little bit of an intro tell you a little bit about the course in general to introduce

00:12.900 --> 00:18.180
you to some of the additional features that you have that you get along with the boys and so on and

00:18.180 --> 00:19.120
so forth.

00:19.140 --> 00:22.080
So let's go ahead and begin with the basic information.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.610
So the prerequisites what you will need for the course.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.780
So this requirement is a computer the computer can.

00:30.840 --> 00:37.350
The Demos are done in the windows but the computer the computer can have the computer can be a macro

00:37.350 --> 00:43.920
it can have access to all the queries to be done with either of those operating systems.

00:44.070 --> 00:48.370
However I have demonstrated how to do the set up in Windows.

00:49.110 --> 00:55.020
I mean you can just send me a PM or something like that and ask me to put some additional videos how

00:55.020 --> 00:58.110
to do it for example on a map or how to do it on a.

00:58.150 --> 01:04.430
But it's no big deal I can post them if you need to but set of procedures are pretty much the same.

01:04.430 --> 01:07.080
Go onto the web and you just download and run.

01:07.080 --> 01:15.690
That's about it anyway so you can also acquire some basic computer skills.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.830
By that I mean just come and don't have a computer on and log in.

01:21.090 --> 01:24.600
And from that point on you can just follow the story more or less.

01:24.590 --> 01:30.540
Another very important characteristic which you should possess and which I do believe that you do possess

01:30.560 --> 01:35.120
those you have decided to take this course is curiosity.

01:35.130 --> 01:37.190
So there will be problems along the way.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.180
There will be difficulties along the way.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.830
Not everything is going to be perfect.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.570
Not everything is going to work out the way you want it to work out.

01:43.800 --> 01:49.350
When you code it is a perfectly natural thing that you have errors BOD's problems etc..

01:49.380 --> 01:54.120
So just have to wait for the curiosity to persevere through your work.

01:54.150 --> 02:02.130
We offer it tech support and we support our students with all of the courses and we strive to get.

02:02.130 --> 02:06.300
We strive to help them out in any way we can anyway.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.970
So that brings us to our next point the support.

02:10.050 --> 02:15.890
So if you need help or assistance with something that is sports related please feel free to post in

02:15.890 --> 02:18.590
the discussions in the discussion section.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.260
There will be somebody there to report.

02:20.280 --> 02:25.320
Maybe it will be me but we'll be a member of my staff who will come.

02:25.320 --> 02:31.350
We'll take a look at your recovery and we will strive to help you out in any way that they can do to

02:31.350 --> 02:40.300
help you resolve your issue and to get you going on your way because of your private message as well.

02:40.320 --> 02:47.670
If you wish but I'm slow with the response with responses to private messages the discussion section

02:47.670 --> 02:49.030
is really really fast.

02:49.030 --> 02:49.720
You are going to get it now.

02:49.770 --> 02:56.810
You should get an answer really fast within a day or so and that's probably fast.

02:56.830 --> 03:01.860
But you know it's not it's not exactly a wide infraction in a discussion section you post and then there

03:01.870 --> 03:06.420
is somebody who is continuously checking it throughout the day and if they see it they are going to

03:06.420 --> 03:07.490
reply immediately.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.560
Not probably just the next day.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.050
Last resort you can send me an email.

03:13.260 --> 03:19.080
This is their last possible resort so use the discussion section if that really doesn't help in any

03:19.080 --> 03:19.920
way.

03:19.920 --> 03:25.660
Send me a private message and if you can't reach me by private message or send me an email.

03:25.830 --> 03:34.290
I do tend to answer with student inquiries wherever and however I can I by some chance did not reply

03:34.290 --> 03:37.050
to you and you have sent me a message.

03:37.110 --> 03:40.880
Please don't be angry with me just send me another one.

03:40.910 --> 03:45.790
I get like a hundred and thirty nine messages I think it was per day.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.060
So if I lose one or if I miss one.

03:48.070 --> 03:54.120
I am so sorry but there are a lot of them and those are just a student thing for is not including everything

03:54.120 --> 03:55.100
else in my life.

03:55.470 --> 04:01.380
So if I did not reply to you straight away or if I didn't reply to you at all just go ahead and copy

04:01.380 --> 04:03.880
paste that message and send it again.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.480
So it gets pushed into the into the queue again.

04:06.510 --> 04:11.060
I wish to apologize in advance if I by some chance you don't reply.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.790
One of your inference.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.470
As I said just said it again.

04:14.490 --> 04:17.160
I do and I do try to answer them all.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.060
And that is my point.

04:18.060 --> 04:28.290
That is my girl but if I missed one by chance I do apologise for that anyway so that's done Strachans

04:28.440 --> 04:31.440
so you can send me suggestions if you feel like it.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.400
Not all the subjects were covered and of course that you would like some additional subjects to be covered

04:35.400 --> 04:36.310
in the course.

04:36.570 --> 04:42.470
So feel free to send a brief description of what it is that you would like to be included in the boards

04:42.840 --> 04:48.230
and I will see what I can do about it can actually squeeze it in time wise.

04:48.690 --> 04:52.260
Or perhaps I can upload it to my YouTube channel or something like that.

04:52.290 --> 04:58.050
Either way if you wish something too if you wish some of which or if you wish certain subjects to be

04:58.050 --> 05:07.120
processed please feel free to send me a message you can also message me about your courses if you have

05:07.120 --> 05:12.720
any ideas or if you would like to see a course on a particular subject feel free to send it to me as

05:12.730 --> 05:13.870
a request.

05:13.870 --> 05:18.730
And if you have any other questions that are not related to courses or anything like that feel free

05:18.730 --> 05:25.150
to contact me as well if I can I will strive to help you or in any way that I can.

05:25.220 --> 05:28.200
Feedback feedback is very important.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.700
So it's really a five star review.

05:31.870 --> 05:32.480
Excellent.

05:32.620 --> 05:33.400
That's great.

05:33.580 --> 05:41.350
But if you for some reason leave for three to one star reviews something like that please.

05:41.410 --> 05:42.030
I am.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.460
Just write down below.

05:44.950 --> 05:45.720
Why.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.680
Well what did you look like.

05:47.740 --> 05:55.720
What was bad and what caused you to give a lesser review so that I know what was going on so that I

05:55.720 --> 05:59.580
can try to actually improve or fix certain things.

05:59.740 --> 06:07.120
So please if you do leave about and you just tell me what sort of Tiner I do and you take my students

06:07.120 --> 06:12.090
feedback very seriously and I strive to act on it as much as I can.

06:13.620 --> 06:19.750
So additional resources can find the code or get help or most of it.

06:20.060 --> 06:24.090
And you can find some additional videos material on YouTube.

06:24.310 --> 06:31.220
Neither one of these two sites requires any registration to actually access to resources that are related

06:31.220 --> 06:32.550
to guess course.

06:32.610 --> 06:40.280
So you can just follow the links and have a look at the material that you might require for the course.

06:40.310 --> 06:46.610
All the code is explained in the course and I am going over pretty much every line of the code through

06:46.610 --> 06:52.400
the course of those same chunks of code that play some get.

06:52.460 --> 06:58.610
I don't know if you can't be bothered to type something or for whatever reason you just think that it

06:58.640 --> 06:59.720
would then have a look at it.

06:59.780 --> 07:08.540
I've written it I'm sure most of it should be there and get upset will be able to just download it should

07:08.540 --> 07:11.000
help you troubleshoot and stuff like that.

07:11.030 --> 07:15.650
But I do encourage you to take your old home not to you even though it's available don't mean to be

07:15.650 --> 07:16.490
able to do it.

07:16.490 --> 07:18.430
Anybody can download it.

07:18.710 --> 07:26.720
I just posted it the other GPL license up more or less but I do encourage you to actually type it in

07:26.900 --> 07:28.380
and type it out yourself.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.580
Type it out yourselves.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.100
You will learn a great deal if you had paid for that course.

07:34.160 --> 07:40.520
And if you have decided more importantly you dedicate the time to actually go through the lectures and

07:40.520 --> 07:45.980
go through the course do yourself a favor and take the code out.

07:45.980 --> 07:52.670
Trust me you will learn a lot more that time investment that you make and to actually watch and of course

07:53.780 --> 07:59.120
will be more valuable because you will amass a greater amount of knowledge in the same amount of time

07:59.510 --> 08:06.980
as opposed to just copying the code and running it you won't learn much if anything from such actions.

08:08.920 --> 08:09.820
Keynote.

08:10.310 --> 08:18.070
So make sure you use the same angular version as I want the things to work the same way that they work

08:18.070 --> 08:25.120
for me and I place the TO opened at the time of the making of this course.

08:25.120 --> 08:33.520
There are no stable releases of angular there is still development stage and new release candidates

08:33.510 --> 08:36.780
of regular two are being released very fast.

08:36.820 --> 08:40.730
So expect expect things to change really fast.

08:40.870 --> 08:46.520
But the general concept still remains the same can use the newer versions of anger too.

08:46.610 --> 08:50.430
The problem is that you have to adjust the code accordingly.

08:50.710 --> 08:58.200
So once again angular Q is in a development stage there are no stable versions of angular Q as making

08:58.340 --> 08:59.000
scores.

08:59.170 --> 09:04.030
I have made the scores in accordance with the material available for regular Q During the development

09:04.030 --> 09:05.440
stage.

09:05.440 --> 09:12.460
It is likely if not certain that things will change rapidly and they are changing rapidly.

09:12.460 --> 09:18.020
I had to modify the course several times while I was actually making it.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.260
Just keep that in mind.

09:20.500 --> 09:28.840
So those changes those changes in mind and don't expect things to work if you use a different version

09:28.840 --> 09:30.090
or something like that.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.960
Just have a look at the version that I was using and use the same version.

09:33.970 --> 09:41.840
Then things should to work out but as I said you are free to use your versions and try the same code

09:41.840 --> 09:43.040
with your versions.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.260
And that would actually provide for a very good learning experience.

09:46.310 --> 09:52.000
Actually see what changes need to be conducted in order to make it compatible with your versions of

09:52.220 --> 09:55.570
angular anyway.

09:57.250 --> 10:01.930
Doesn't matter if angular progresses doesn't matter how hard you are changes.

10:01.930 --> 10:03.540
In all likelihood.

10:03.760 --> 10:10.990
The primary programming concepts the basic price the basic programming concepts will remain the same.

10:11.170 --> 10:16.500
You will still have more or less the same structure you should warless still have the same structure.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.220
The same basic idea.

10:19.630 --> 10:26.860
Some change might change certain certain functionalities might be moved from one place to the other.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.650
Some other functionalities might be added and so on and so forth.

10:29.800 --> 10:35.140
But the basic bottom line concept remains will in all likelihood remain the same so we don't have any

10:35.140 --> 10:37.630
worries in that regard anyway.

10:37.810 --> 10:43.340
I wish to be a bit too far off here and I'm sure a bit of luck with this force.
