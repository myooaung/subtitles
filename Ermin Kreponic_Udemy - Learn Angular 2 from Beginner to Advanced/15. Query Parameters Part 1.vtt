00:00.180 --> 00:07.950
Welcome back all today we're going to go ahead and start talking about the Querrey parameters.

00:07.950 --> 00:12.710
Now they go into the address bar as well.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.260
You've seen them before that I assure you.

00:15.270 --> 00:20.400
Maybe you have not noticed them but if you have used any of the search engines out there you will have

00:20.400 --> 00:25.230
noticed that there you will have seen that there are clearly parameters and you might have not noticed

00:25.230 --> 00:26.120
them.

00:26.220 --> 00:37.360
So if I open up the browser and if I just go ahead and type something in it in the browser it's in the

00:37.360 --> 00:45.310
search engine just I don't know what ever you will see.

00:45.310 --> 00:55.100
Up here it says search and then a question mark after the search and then the then the parameters begin.

00:55.210 --> 00:57.350
First of all you have the query whatever.

00:57.360 --> 01:01.420
And I had to have the encoding and honestly.

01:01.470 --> 01:01.730
OK.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.440
Client is Firefox.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.430
That's my browser and I have no idea what these other are.

01:08.470 --> 01:13.520
Well the person who created it knows what the he'll are part of me anyway.

01:13.530 --> 01:20.130
Those are the query parameters and based upon those query parameters you can determine how many how

01:20.130 --> 01:25.010
many For example how many listings would you like to have per a page.

01:25.020 --> 01:28.740
So I don't have a lot of listings here maybe 10 or something like that.

01:28.980 --> 01:36.620
But if you alter the parameters you can have maybe 50 or 100 or something like that.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.090
Same goes with pretty much any Web site out there.

01:39.090 --> 01:41.130
It functions in pretty much the same way.

01:41.130 --> 01:48.710
So they don't they do not alter or affect the routes but they do affect the data with it.

01:48.780 --> 01:52.050
They can affect the data within the within the components.

01:53.370 --> 01:55.200
And how the components are displayed.

01:55.200 --> 02:02.400
So if you want to as I said if you want to have ten results per page or 50 results or something like

02:02.400 --> 02:11.220
that once you change your settings your query route parameters with your query parameters will actually

02:11.730 --> 02:13.440
change as well.

02:14.520 --> 02:19.360
You can put a lot of things in the query parameters say what's what names will be displayed.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.410
How will it depending on your settings.

02:22.410 --> 02:27.230
How will it how will how will the settings reflect the site etc..

02:27.660 --> 02:32.400
So let us go ahead and begin the first thing.

02:32.550 --> 02:36.670
The first thing that you need to do is create a transaction folder.

02:36.970 --> 02:41.740
So like this you have it from the previous tutorial.

02:41.740 --> 02:48.580
So just in the in the transaction folder just realize that in the transaction folder you need to go

02:48.580 --> 02:52.940
ahead and create all these files.

02:52.950 --> 02:55.890
I couldn't go ahead and create one by one with me.

02:56.050 --> 03:01.150
Or you can as I explain them we can just go ahead and create all of the ones that are actually green

03:01.150 --> 03:07.870
here and then we can implement then we can populated them with code together.

03:08.170 --> 03:11.320
So either way but you will need all of these.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.300
The first one that we will do here is transaction route start.

03:16.310 --> 03:17.950
Yes.

03:17.950 --> 03:24.700
So that's the that's the one that I have opened here so it is very similar to accounts that route start

03:24.870 --> 03:33.070
ups here we will simply define the route for transactions for transaction and it's sub routes.

03:33.070 --> 03:34.430
That's really it.

03:34.430 --> 03:39.730
There's very little there's very little new material here.

03:39.730 --> 03:46.820
So this is just for this is just another basically just another set of routes for each other component.

03:47.350 --> 03:50.180
So the first one router config.

03:50.200 --> 03:55.030
Basically this is needed for the creation of the transaction and

03:57.680 --> 04:09.090
you will there is the critical data transaction at Tartaros Tertius fake

04:11.710 --> 04:12.540
expert.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.120
It's rather comfy.

04:14.410 --> 04:14.930
OK.

04:14.950 --> 04:21.790
So anyway I just looked at my notes and something was really confusing anyway.

04:22.130 --> 04:31.930
Discreate component here it should not be confused with the Create component and it's actually create

04:31.940 --> 04:35.790
that component that should not be confused with the one in the accounts.

04:35.780 --> 04:37.890
So here we have create our component data.

04:37.890 --> 04:39.940
Yes it has nothing to do with that one.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.020
It has the same name.

04:41.020 --> 04:43.130
True but it has nothing to do with that one.

04:43.390 --> 04:47.680
Actually we will create the create our component here.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.760
So right here it will actually be created

04:54.130 --> 04:54.850
and

04:57.770 --> 05:03.050
we need to basically just moved is well know.

05:06.110 --> 05:06.780
Right.

05:07.170 --> 05:15.410
Anyway there's no need to do anything with it except if you for example have a wrong path here.

05:15.440 --> 05:21.680
You need to have this path so it cannot lead and it cannot go from anywhere else so the doc states that

05:21.680 --> 05:24.890
it begins from the from the current directory.

05:24.920 --> 05:31.430
So from transactions and it is going straight to the Create art component so it is going to be looking

05:31.430 --> 05:36.650
for the Create art component within the transactions within the transaction folder.

05:36.650 --> 05:39.240
So it is necessary for it to be there.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.610
Otherwise if you go from Ruge this is going to be problematic anyway.

05:43.790 --> 05:50.990
The first one router config but this is just needed for the configuration of routes and the transaction

05:51.020 --> 05:51.650
component.

05:51.650 --> 05:59.060
This is basically our parent component inside of which inside of which instead of which we will have

05:59.060 --> 06:06.470
the computer we will have these SoBo routes of our of our components basically all the components listed

06:06.470 --> 06:07.260
down below.

06:07.580 --> 06:11.990
So we'll have the some routes and some routes are basically the child routes.

06:11.990 --> 06:17.230
They have children here and then you create some routes anyway.

06:17.790 --> 06:24.450
We will go ahead and create the variable so routes and going go ahead and export it so we can utilize

06:24.450 --> 06:25.100
it elsewhere.

06:25.140 --> 06:32.430
And we will make it a contest in order to state that no further change will be done or no further changes

06:32.430 --> 06:33.600
will be possible.

06:34.820 --> 06:41.600
Now below you have a bath which is basically just transactions that is the main route and the component

06:41.600 --> 06:51.380
it is shown with that main route is transaction component down below it's we have the children routes

06:51.420 --> 06:59.300
the the routes where you wish to refer to them all routes and here you have a path which is basically

06:59.300 --> 07:05.720
create and then you have a component which is to be shown and it is create component which we have imported

07:05.840 --> 07:07.560
from here.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.490
And do you go to this child route.

07:10.490 --> 07:15.800
It will be where you are rail will look something like this those last transactions slash create.

07:15.980 --> 07:21.530
If you just go to transactions Well you just eliminate the Create and you get transactions that's pretty

07:21.530 --> 07:22.620
much it.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.260
In that regard nothing much new stuff here in general.

07:27.260 --> 07:32.470
Next up we need to go into the app routes.

07:32.750 --> 07:42.800
So right here at Prout's dot D.S. and there isn't there isn't much new here either.

07:42.800 --> 07:54.080
So this we're just going to basically import raw import routes and they will be imported as transaction

07:54.140 --> 07:54.530
routes.

07:54.530 --> 07:57.310
That is how they will be referred to here.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.300
And that is how they are referred to down below.

07:59.300 --> 08:07.810
So we have added this line here and here we will use the spread operator once again the triple dot.

08:07.910 --> 08:17.530
All it does is takes this array takes all of its elements and puts all of its elements into this array.

08:17.530 --> 08:21.040
Basically simple as that.

08:21.050 --> 08:27.610
So these are just transaction routes so just you see this second line here of the array.

08:27.860 --> 08:33.980
And once you import things from huge is going to get another one like that and another one like that

08:33.980 --> 08:36.090
and another one like that etc..

08:36.110 --> 08:40.050
So we're just importing the routes and nothing else really.

08:41.350 --> 08:45.690
Next up is the transaction dot computer and Altius.

08:45.740 --> 08:52.650
So you just find that transaction component that D.S. here.

08:52.700 --> 09:00.420
It's yes this is a new this is a new file but we haven't done anything new here.

09:00.420 --> 09:06.180
So we've imported the router directors because we're going to need them for the router outlets which

09:06.180 --> 09:12.910
we're going to use in our HD Malko just specify the template you Arel which is the transaction that

09:12.960 --> 09:17.970
component at HD M-L that is another file which you actually need to make.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.270
And you also need a class down here you can just leave it empty.

09:21.600 --> 09:31.770
If you go to the component that HD M-L this will be this year will be shown regardless of the sub routes

09:31.780 --> 09:38.880
or just head to transactions and you have the router outlet where the where the component where the

09:38.880 --> 09:45.180
content of the components will be placed and then displayed in regard to.

09:45.180 --> 09:49.770
With respect to the sub routes that are requested.

09:50.030 --> 09:51.570
So keep that in mind.

09:51.920 --> 09:56.130
Anyway good to bid you farewell here and we shall see each other in the follow tutorial.
