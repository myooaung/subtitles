WEBVTT

00:00.290 --> 00:00.830
OK.

00:00.930 --> 00:08.340
So let's go ahead and take a look at the DML file so details that component out HD Ammal you will of

00:08.340 --> 00:11.580
course need to make it anyway.

00:11.650 --> 00:13.580
They are the first three lines.

00:13.610 --> 00:18.140
That's old news and the rest of it has been written.

00:18.530 --> 00:20.390
So let me just go over over it.

00:20.390 --> 00:25.760
I mean I don't have to go over every single element here I'm sure that a lot of it is familiar but I

00:25.760 --> 00:27.820
will go over a good amount of it.

00:28.850 --> 00:40.370
So the very first one and this will basically be shown if there is if there is an account so NGF basically

00:40.370 --> 00:41.700
checks if there is an account.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.290
OK.

00:42.320 --> 00:49.560
There is go ahead and begin to display if there isn't well don't display it.

00:50.210 --> 00:56.980
And below you have an account description so if account text description exists go ahead and display.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.300
Simple as that.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.330
Not nothing new and nothing strange there.

01:03.200 --> 01:12.040
And now down below we have by the way the call M.D to and call M.D.

01:12.060 --> 01:18.350
And these are things from from Bootstrap which we have went over before.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.820
And you see these classes here a detailed label and detailed data.

01:23.850 --> 01:32.190
These are basically the classes which we will need in order to reference the specific specific segments

01:32.280 --> 01:37.910
in CSF so that we can adjust the styling accordingly.

01:37.920 --> 01:46.130
Now OK so here it says class the label for balance.

01:46.180 --> 01:49.910
We can take a look at this on the site.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.250
It says balance here.

01:51.250 --> 01:55.550
Five hundred and sixty seven for this account.

01:55.900 --> 01:59.170
And where it was that way it was that Web site.

01:59.250 --> 01:59.520
OK.

01:59.530 --> 02:05.710
So it says here balance and then Engy class and then you have a bit of a strange text here which is

02:05.770 --> 02:07.440
something new I would say.

02:07.720 --> 02:14.700
So it basically states if the account balance is greater than zero then text success which means that

02:14.700 --> 02:19.340
a text will be green if it says text.

02:19.780 --> 02:27.910
Otherwise basically just say that text danger meaning that it's zero or below zero which is a problem

02:27.910 --> 02:33.610
because you don't want to run out of money on your account and therefore the sum will be displayed in

02:33.830 --> 02:35.560
red letters.

02:35.740 --> 02:40.020
And then you see the variable account balance which will be displayed.

02:40.360 --> 02:46.350
So you see here it says 567 that's green we're good.

02:46.390 --> 02:52.380
But if it was like zero or mine or minus five million then it would be red.

02:52.420 --> 03:02.820
That would be a big problem going down the low going down below Well OK maybe it was actually I'm not

03:02.810 --> 03:05.330
sure about this if it was actually equal to zero.

03:05.340 --> 03:08.390
It wouldn't actually be a threat.

03:08.580 --> 03:11.840
So probably my mistake there but doesn't really matter.

03:11.940 --> 03:12.840
Let's go down below.

03:14.410 --> 03:19.740
Class detail trends again we're just creating another clause so that we can create references for it

03:20.370 --> 03:23.260
in the sea assets which has yet to be created

03:27.410 --> 03:34.920
so here what we're doing is checking if there are any transactions so the transaction length is zero.

03:35.340 --> 03:40.380
Then obviously there are no transactions so there is no dear

03:43.020 --> 03:46.920
there are no transactions.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.240
Create a new one.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.760
Create a new one is the feature that is yet to be implemented so we cannot actually create any transactions

03:54.240 --> 03:57.910
just yet this is not going to.

03:57.910 --> 04:04.490
This is not going to be the case for us now because all the accounts they have transactions as we created

04:04.490 --> 04:05.320
them.

04:05.870 --> 04:12.560
OK so in case that the transaction lent length is greater than zero came from under-class restyling

04:12.560 --> 04:21.390
This is the bootstrap class and then go ahead and create the SO description value date tags.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.480
And you can even see the dash here.

04:24.500 --> 04:32.700
So the dash and description ups value date tags.

04:32.720 --> 04:38.300
That's what we created here with these Aline's right.

04:38.440 --> 04:38.670
OK.

04:38.670 --> 04:47.480
So going down below D.R. basically represents table row and for every transaction and G-4 will basically

04:47.510 --> 04:53.360
create a row we have done this before so we're just creating a loop here and you will have the Deedat

04:53.360 --> 05:02.110
ID the dot description and then right below that you will have a again as as before.

05:02.150 --> 05:08.050
Above what I've explained it says if the value is greater than zero then you will have green tax.

05:08.540 --> 05:15.320
If the value is lesser than zero then you will have read the text and then the value will be printed

05:15.320 --> 05:17.360
out down below and that you have the date.

05:17.360 --> 05:27.220
So what I'm talking about now are these things so Id description value date tag and so on and so on

05:27.230 --> 05:27.590
that's it

05:32.560 --> 05:33.190
here.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.010
We're using something a little bit different.

05:35.020 --> 05:41.370
These are called pipes and so something that you will see in general news almost everywhere.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.170
We have the dot date.

05:43.180 --> 05:49.590
And then you have a pie which pipes it to date and that the format of the date is specified.

05:49.600 --> 05:57.880
So the date format is OK display the day and tell me the month with three letters so m m m

06:00.750 --> 06:06.400
so display the and display the number displayed the day and then give me the month in three letters

06:06.410 --> 06:09.300
so July.

06:09.340 --> 06:16.060
J u l you can explore different formats are can experiment with it.

06:16.600 --> 06:24.520
Put something like h h h h h h something like this.

06:25.450 --> 06:29.200
So I don't think it's actually triple h h it's yeah it's minutes.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.470
And then this should work.

06:33.490 --> 06:34.180
Yep there you go.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.650
So 18 fifty eight

06:40.490 --> 06:40.940
OK.

06:40.970 --> 06:46.430
So I mean just go ahead and voted back and that's basically it.

06:46.430 --> 06:50.700
There isn't that much to say.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.990
You also have the energy for four attacks.

06:54.350 --> 07:02.450
So there will be a loop that will create the tags in one line so label primary and that will mean that

07:02.450 --> 07:04.950
you will get a certain color like here.

07:05.010 --> 07:10.820
See so they will all be in one line one after another as you can see down below it says bills and then

07:10.880 --> 07:11.850
electricity.

07:11.870 --> 07:14.960
It's in one single line.

07:15.210 --> 07:15.720
OK.

07:15.770 --> 07:19.790
So let's go over to the CSSA and wrap this up.
