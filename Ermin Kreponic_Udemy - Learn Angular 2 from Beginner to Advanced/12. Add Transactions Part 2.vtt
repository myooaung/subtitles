00:00.810 --> 00:02.540
So let's go ahead and continue.

00:02.640 --> 00:09.600
So you will need these two additional lines to additional imports here transaction and transaction service

00:09.630 --> 00:10.290
transact.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.340
We've just created these things down below.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.500
There is the style or else.

00:15.510 --> 00:18.000
So this file has yet to be created.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.220
We will do this in the fall of the Tauriel but just go ahead and include it now to save a little bit

00:23.220 --> 00:24.050
of time.

00:25.900 --> 00:26.810
We go down below.

00:26.830 --> 00:29.580
We will have a private variable underscore Trents.

00:29.590 --> 00:36.730
So this is the private variable that holds and operate an array of transactions which need to be shown.

00:37.090 --> 00:39.420
And here it says transaction service.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.250
So we are injecting our service.

00:41.260 --> 00:47.110
But first we need to provide it somewhere basically and we will do that in the account component.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.120
Yes.

00:49.210 --> 00:56.520
So just go over here and here we have a few imports as well.

00:57.280 --> 01:05.680
So we have transaction service providers we're basically we're just basically imported the new providers

01:05.740 --> 01:09.770
and down below under the providers we listed.

01:09.940 --> 01:15.220
We listed them here since this is the parent component of the detailed art component.

01:15.280 --> 01:22.300
They will be provided there as well so as soon as we list them here and include this here they will

01:22.300 --> 01:24.620
be provided in the details component.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.920
Yes.

01:29.510 --> 01:33.930
Let me just fix my notes a little bit.

01:36.860 --> 01:37.470
Okay.

01:37.760 --> 01:43.530
So if you keep on scrolling down and we'll get to this.

01:43.730 --> 01:47.240
You need to create this method here.

01:47.630 --> 01:55.310
So this is something that you will require here we will just get the transactions off the account by

01:55.310 --> 02:01.000
using this service we are calling the get by account.

02:01.020 --> 02:04.610
So get by a count method and we are passing to it.

02:04.630 --> 02:05.820
I d.

02:06.020 --> 02:13.120
Parameter which is the ID of the account as well immediately.

02:13.290 --> 02:22.470
Down below and see dot then at an index and this arrow arrow shaped function arrow syntax function trends

02:22.560 --> 02:24.590
are basically here.

02:24.690 --> 02:31.680
Trends are basically the result transactions and we will place them into our variable underscore trends.

02:31.770 --> 02:38.750
You see we're just assigning values a trend the this like this start underline trance equals trance

02:39.220 --> 02:45.190
this start underlying trance is just the current instance of the trance variable basically.

02:46.020 --> 02:48.610
And we will store all the.

02:48.990 --> 02:54.880
We will store all the variables that need to be displayed all the values that need to be displayed into

02:54.900 --> 02:59.110
this variable here anyway.

02:59.870 --> 03:06.090
Get a bid you farewell here and we shall see each other in the follow up or we will create the C Ss

03:06.150 --> 03:08.960
and d h d m l and then we'll be done with this.
