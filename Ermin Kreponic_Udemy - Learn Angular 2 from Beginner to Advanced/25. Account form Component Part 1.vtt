00:00.430 --> 00:01.550
Welcome back or.

00:02.040 --> 00:09.750
So today we're going to go ahead and perform another separation of functionalities as we did before

00:09.790 --> 00:11.690
with account blessed.

00:12.120 --> 00:17.430
So this component that we're about to create we would like it to be used for the serving of content

00:17.520 --> 00:21.200
for the serving of forms for the creation of new accounts.

00:21.210 --> 00:23.990
It's not going to handle the storing of new accounts.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.750
It's not going to care about the logic that is used to basically store something into a database or

00:30.750 --> 00:32.260
something like that.

00:32.490 --> 00:37.950
We don't have a database yet but at a certain point in time we will have it at the moment.

00:37.980 --> 00:44.160
I would just like to separate these functionalities so the parent component will take care of the storage

00:44.160 --> 00:50.940
logic and the other component which we're about to create which will be a child component will be in

00:50.940 --> 01:00.430
charge of actually creating the actually serving the forms to the user for the creation of new accounts.

01:00.690 --> 01:08.200
So as before we need to create new folders we need to create three new folders so account for them to

01:08.250 --> 01:12.670
come form h DML in a conference C Ss.

01:13.250 --> 01:17.310
I'm just going to go ahead and copy them from here but I'm pretty sure you can see this and rewrite

01:17.310 --> 01:18.540
it easily.

01:18.660 --> 01:28.550
Right click on the account and new file go ahead and create it then you're going to need to team L-1

01:31.610 --> 01:35.530
again just right click and file

01:39.130 --> 01:41.970
and the CSSA of course you're going to need that as well.

01:48.190 --> 01:48.570
OK.

01:48.590 --> 01:50.860
So we have these three new files.

01:50.860 --> 01:57.200
Now we need to populate in the very first one we're going to populate the CSSA that is the easiest one

01:57.200 --> 02:01.830
we'll just go into the up component out SS and take what remains there.

02:02.670 --> 02:09.830
And place it into this file here and save it and also saved up comput endorsee ss.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.500
So now we know that it's empty.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.150
Next up we're going to go into the up component of DML and we're going to take code from here in order

02:18.150 --> 02:21.070
to populate the account for him.

02:21.340 --> 02:24.530
More begin an end tag tag comments here.

02:25.370 --> 02:30.630
That tell me from where should I begin and where should I end the copying process a bit close attention

02:30.630 --> 02:38.100
to what you need to extract from the Sagem Alcoa's go right below the accounts list and go into the

02:38.100 --> 02:39.710
first here.

02:39.960 --> 02:48.630
Scroll all the way to the bottom and then next to last day of will be the one that you want to take.

02:48.650 --> 02:49.520
So do you see it.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.490
This is the last year.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.120
This is the next to last year.

02:52.300 --> 03:02.240
It's just control X take that and go into the DML file base that save at saved this that you save this

03:02.240 --> 03:02.960
file as well.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.990
From where you've taken the information that's it.

03:05.990 --> 03:12.810
Now the account for TS I would like you to give it a shot prior to next prior to the beginning of the

03:12.810 --> 03:17.800
next tutorial to actually write at least a portion of the code here on your show.

03:18.030 --> 03:23.490
You can use this as a reference and this as a reference as well.

03:23.490 --> 03:28.440
So this is this is the part that I would like you to write out for yourselves.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.310
You don't need to actually deal with the imports it will shoot you.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.160
But first I would like you to break this part out for yourselves.

03:36.160 --> 03:42.530
You will definitely be able to figure out what the template you are l and styles or else are just pay

03:42.530 --> 03:46.270
close attention to the sub folders here.

03:46.420 --> 03:51.910
So give it a shot for beginning the next tutorial doesn't matter if you succeed or fail as long as you

03:51.910 --> 03:54.340
have actually tried you.

03:54.870 --> 04:00.020
Well in general you actually learn more from failed attempts than you learned from the successful but

04:00.020 --> 04:03.730
then it's in my general logical things.

04:03.930 --> 04:08.950
Ok so I'm going to bid you farewell here and we're going to meet up in the follow up to Tauriel.
