00:00.300 --> 00:07.070
OK so the last the last chapter of this saga the CSSA file.

00:07.230 --> 00:09.260
So we need to go over it.

00:10.180 --> 00:17.800
I have created details that component at CSX and then we're going to go over our customized styling

00:17.830 --> 00:22.440
for the outlook for the way that the site actually looks like.

00:23.420 --> 00:29.940
We disclose this for the way that this site actually looks like OK.

00:30.460 --> 00:41.380
So they first have the dot details and it says margin top 30 to be X meaning 32 pixels can be written

00:41.380 --> 00:47.340
in percentages but percentages are always relative to their parents anyway.

00:47.420 --> 00:51.860
So margin top for details.

00:51.860 --> 00:59.960
And you have the details here and the top margin will be 27 was at 32.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.650
Sorry.

01:00.950 --> 01:09.430
So we want to bounce this from the create account in all accounts for 30s by 37 pixels that's a basically

01:09.430 --> 01:12.880
we're just we're just separating the space between them.

01:12.880 --> 01:17.890
You can i would I would actually before it can go any further I would actually go ahead encourage you

01:18.520 --> 01:24.400
to change a lot of these settings change them drastically and take a look at the site see how it actually

01:24.400 --> 01:29.530
reflects the behavior of the site the the layout of the site.

01:29.860 --> 01:30.130
Okay.

01:30.130 --> 01:37.920
So next up we have a detail label and if we go back we are still here.

01:37.970 --> 01:46.550
So account and balance first of all we have text align to the right so we are aligning to the right

01:47.530 --> 01:51.030
account balance should be somewhere here where my mouse is now.

01:51.040 --> 01:58.630
But we're aligning it to the right so it is here and then we have teks transformed to upper case.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.250
Yes.

01:59.280 --> 02:06.490
They're both upper case account and balance regardless of how it is written in HD a male font weight

02:06.490 --> 02:12.370
is probably the only unknown here that is that it signifies the thickness of the letters so the thickness

02:12.370 --> 02:17.730
of that letters 700 deaths basically bold font size 14.

02:17.830 --> 02:19.510
No explanation needed there.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.210
Just set the font size and margin right.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.280
Minus eight.

02:23.290 --> 02:29.850
So we wish to decrease our alignment to the right.

02:30.180 --> 02:34.240
We wish to actually bring this a little bit closer.

02:34.290 --> 02:39.600
I don't believe that this many see is strictly necessary but oh well you can live with it change it

02:39.660 --> 02:43.380
just change the mind say that is literally the best way to see what's going to happen.

02:43.380 --> 02:47.380
Change it to something else change it to plus there and see what happens.

02:47.700 --> 02:55.360
And then you have margin top which is nine pixels basically just the top margin for 9 pixels.

02:58.980 --> 03:09.090
And you have the color which is some eight hundred and eighty eight which is basically the weird and

03:09.090 --> 03:15.560
the strange color of these letters it's somewhere in something like gray zoomed in.

03:15.570 --> 03:19.660
It's yeah it's something like three or it's gray.

03:19.950 --> 03:25.680
If you're if you're a little bit colorblind like me sometimes it's something great let's just leave

03:25.680 --> 03:27.180
it at that.

03:27.180 --> 03:34.980
Next up you have media and now media is utilized in order to make our site responsive.

03:34.980 --> 03:35.760
So let's see.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.820
We didn't actually have this line.

03:37.890 --> 03:39.510
Let me just show you what's going to happen.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.780
So control X control us.

03:42.860 --> 03:43.220
OK.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.010
It looks fine right no changes.

03:45.240 --> 03:49.320
But if I reduce the size of the screen look at what happens to the account balance.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.150
They run off to the right because they are aligned to the right.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.830
So let's go ahead and bring this line back.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.330
Now explain it.

03:58.800 --> 04:03.730
If I reload the site look at what happens now account and balance are aligned to the left.

04:03.720 --> 04:13.560
So if the max with the for the screen for this screen with perform a certain action if it's lower than

04:13.560 --> 04:20.060
this please perform this action and align it to the left on the smaller screens.

04:21.550 --> 04:22.030
OK.

04:22.050 --> 04:25.630
Now we move on forward to the DTL date data.

04:25.650 --> 04:34.260
Basically just the alignment of the text should be to the left and the font size should be 24 so global

04:34.290 --> 04:39.660
bank main bank account.

04:39.880 --> 04:45.520
Now we're going to go ahead and go into the details that tranced these are all the classes which we

04:45.520 --> 04:52.540
have been specifying in the HD in our file if you go back you will be able to find them all.

04:52.570 --> 04:55.890
So details trance.

04:55.930 --> 05:01.410
This is basically giving us what I say with 100 percent.

05:01.570 --> 05:09.600
It's 100 percent not of the screen size but rather instead it is 100 percent of the parent of the parent.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.080
Basically what the parent is that you need to see DHT about but doesn't matter.

05:14.080 --> 05:21.630
When you say 100 percent it is referring to the parents that appearance size.

05:21.740 --> 05:22.790
Let me just see if I can

05:27.250 --> 05:30.010
get so position.

05:30.710 --> 05:40.420
You see the width of this this whole thing this whole rectangle is 100 percent in response in in respect

05:40.420 --> 05:42.010
with respect to its parent.

05:42.010 --> 05:48.010
And you have position relative to all the other elements there and then it says the thickness of the

05:48.010 --> 05:51.490
border shall be one pixel and this will be the color.

05:51.490 --> 05:53.830
So this is just the hexadecimal representation.

05:53.860 --> 05:56.250
This is just a representation for the color

05:59.530 --> 06:07.610
that representation for the color and C Ss let me just get the hexadecimal just the representation of

06:07.610 --> 06:09.250
the color and.

06:10.070 --> 06:17.120
And where was the border color so the border color is again something gray which goes round and round

06:17.120 --> 06:18.190
in circles.

06:18.200 --> 06:24.160
Now the border radius actually states that we don't want the edges on our borders as you can see there.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.430
We have curves.

06:25.460 --> 06:32.390
So there are no edges it just curves margin top 24 pixels so we're separating it from the top by 24

06:32.390 --> 06:34.790
pixels.

06:36.240 --> 06:51.500
But the padding is 72 by 12 by 0 by 12 which are basically the distances between the which I what is

06:51.500 --> 06:52.130
done with the padding.

06:52.130 --> 06:56.790
Here is the spacing within this rectangle.

06:56.840 --> 07:07.550
So you have 70 72 like from the from the top from the top and you have which number was a 12 from the

07:07.550 --> 07:08.110
left

07:10.930 --> 07:17.440
and you have zero pixels from from the bottom basically.

07:17.850 --> 07:18.550
So it goes.

07:18.550 --> 07:23.560
It goes in that order in a circle is circular sort of fashion the way that these paddings have been

07:23.560 --> 07:23.890
put.

07:24.010 --> 07:29.490
But again please go ahead and change these values and see what happens.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.490
That's really the best way to learn it.

07:31.510 --> 07:32.670
I can tell you this.

07:32.690 --> 07:33.850
This is like a top.

07:33.850 --> 07:35.840
This is was it the left.

07:35.980 --> 07:38.080
And this is the bottom.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.010
And this one is.

07:41.860 --> 07:44.110
This one is the left side.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.210
And this one is that.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.620
Sorry this one is actually the right side and this one is actually the left side.

07:48.820 --> 07:50.600
But it doesn't matter.

07:50.680 --> 07:57.160
Change them and see what they actually do and how they behave without you actually changing them.

07:57.160 --> 08:03.160
My talk is actually pointless because chances of you actually remembering this are pretty slim without

08:03.160 --> 08:04.380
you actually doing it.

08:04.660 --> 08:12.360
So anyway moving down to the details trends before this is a very weird thing.

08:12.370 --> 08:17.060
This actually creates something before the actual element.

08:17.740 --> 08:25.540
And it says here content transactions so this is the content of the transactions.

08:25.660 --> 08:28.610
You can see it here and then it says.

08:28.730 --> 08:29.670
Position.

08:29.690 --> 08:33.100
Absolute top 24 for left.

08:33.100 --> 08:37.650
Twenty four.

08:37.750 --> 08:41.810
So we are again doing the yard.

08:41.830 --> 08:43.940
Wait wait wait wait.

08:44.130 --> 08:51.750
Kind of want to put the screens left and right so that you can actually see what's going on might be

08:51.750 --> 08:52.480
like this.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.450
So I can scroll it down and

08:57.670 --> 09:02.860
or just give me a moment to it OK.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.530
So this is this is better.

09:09.330 --> 09:20.910
Anyway so we have lights and stupid things here that we had from before like the font weight like the

09:20.910 --> 09:23.880
font weight which is basically the thickness of the font.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.920
And you have the font size which is 14 and you have some silly color.

09:27.930 --> 09:34.470
And again we have the transformation to uppercase which is basically which basically stands for trans

09:34.560 --> 09:35.540
actions.

09:35.670 --> 09:39.360
So we're transforming dad into upper case.

09:39.450 --> 09:43.230
And then for transactions we have the top margin.

09:43.290 --> 09:52.420
And we have the left margin so we're moving it from the top and moving it from the left by 24 pixels.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.710
That's approximate absolute.

09:56.710 --> 09:59.650
It just means in respect to its parent.

09:59.650 --> 10:05.320
So it's not a margin it's basically a position in respect to the parent.

10:05.940 --> 10:14.710
OK so that would be it would be have the last one which is the dot label which is the label for the

10:14.710 --> 10:20.380
tags which is stedding the margin there to be two pixels.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.870
So we can separate them apart anyway.

10:25.010 --> 10:27.240
That would be it for the C Ss.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.880
I'm going to go ahead and bid you farewell here.

10:30.290 --> 10:34.580
Before I do I'm going to go ahead and ask you one more time just to keep on changing these things.

10:34.580 --> 10:40.450
I'm not the best person for success but some change you do require a certain amount of knowledge for

10:40.490 --> 10:46.640
the SS and the best way to do it is just to have the code and then just keypunch write the code and

10:46.640 --> 10:50.540
then just keep on changing things and see how they reflect on the side because that's basically how

10:50.630 --> 10:51.960
I learned it as well.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.570
So for a while and hope to see you soon.
