00:00.360 --> 00:04.670
OK so let's go ahead and continue anyway.

00:04.920 --> 00:11.580
So we have this input field that says disabled and says disabled input so what is the value of disabled

00:11.580 --> 00:17.750
input at the moment it's full so the input is not disabled.

00:17.810 --> 00:26.970
Henceforth we can basically enter our test text so all of our enter it doesn't nothing will happen of

00:26.970 --> 00:29.710
course because we didn't configure any logic for that.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.160
But if we go into the app component and if we basically says disabled input falls and if we change this

00:38.160 --> 00:44.520
to true and save it wait for the page to reload.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.210
And this is what I want you to be doing.

00:46.210 --> 00:51.070
Basically go ahead and change things change as many things as you want in as many things as you can

00:51.490 --> 00:52.930
and see what happens.

00:52.930 --> 01:00.460
So as you can see other as you can see we can type something in here we can well we can tap into the

01:00.460 --> 01:01.990
other ones but we can type in something here.

01:01.990 --> 01:06.830
But look here where it says enter your text and the first one we can't do anything in the blue.

01:06.850 --> 01:09.770
And sure this one no and this one.

01:09.790 --> 01:17.200
So the first row has been stable completely but at this one we can type in whatever we want because

01:17.200 --> 01:21.070
these have not been disabled but the input and top ones has been disabled.

01:21.070 --> 01:22.040
Now why did we.

01:22.210 --> 01:25.260
Why is the important symbol for for all three of these.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.950
I just want to disable it for one.

01:26.950 --> 01:28.280
What happened.

01:28.660 --> 01:31.200
This is something that's a little bit unpredictable.

01:31.390 --> 01:32.730
Well not really.

01:32.800 --> 01:39.340
Look all three of these are dependent on exactly the same variable.

01:39.340 --> 01:45.310
So regardless of whether or not it's a method here or whether or not it's a bull is just a boolean value

01:45.310 --> 01:45.840
here.

01:46.000 --> 01:46.680
It doesn't matter.

01:46.690 --> 01:50.660
This method returns this boolean value so in turn it's the same.

01:50.680 --> 01:57.190
So these three inputs which correspond to the first three inputs from left to right in the first row

01:58.540 --> 02:02.520
their input has been disabled completely and that does not work anymore.

02:02.620 --> 02:11.960
So if we change this to false and save it just go ahead and wait for this to recompile.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.620
OK so now we can once again enter our tech test.

02:17.740 --> 02:22.200
Our text sorry not just.

02:22.420 --> 02:29.050
And if we come down to this line if you remember I stated that I would explain what this is.

02:29.050 --> 02:33.360
So I can just reload the site and quickly here.

02:33.500 --> 02:40.460
So this one by default is test why the value is equal to current user data username.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.760
So this is still we're still doing.

02:42.780 --> 02:46.860
We're still doing pretty much the same thing property bindings so you can do that also for the value

02:47.760 --> 02:55.380
and if the value of this field is current user that user name that means that the value will be just

02:55.400 --> 02:57.220
because it will return the user name.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.620
But then we have the placeholder equals to enter your text.

03:00.630 --> 03:05.520
And if we delete this you will see enter your text appear.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.210
So that's that's that's what's going on here.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.980
These last these last two snippets of code.

03:11.160 --> 03:15.380
I just want to show you that logic and why is that there and what happens there.

03:15.390 --> 03:21.520
And lastly we have these last two lines here where we explained some sort of coloration.

03:21.840 --> 03:30.030
So as I said we have blue dash B.G. which has been whose bullion that we are binding to it has been

03:30.030 --> 03:31.790
defined here.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.380
Let me just see where it is so is blue Biji.

03:34.410 --> 03:36.500
Boolean equals true.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.810
So will it be blue.

03:37.830 --> 03:38.940
Yes it will be blue.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.480
So enter a text how do we know that it's blue.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.810
Well have a look around.

03:43.860 --> 03:46.620
We've stated that that was the very first line that we have changed.

03:46.620 --> 03:49.220
It says blue dash B.G. background color.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.910
It's blue.

03:51.390 --> 03:55.910
So please go ahead and change these things and try to change the colors.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.110
It should be fairly simple.

03:57.110 --> 04:01.170
I mean type in something else here and see what happens.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.640
In fact let's go ahead and just

04:05.190 --> 04:05.700
screen

04:08.560 --> 04:15.270
K which was kind of faster I did four course and eight weeks of RAM but it's still kind of slow.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.810
Anyway it says enter your text but now it's green.

04:18.810 --> 04:23.610
So these are the these are the sort of changes that I want you to play around with and don't just wait

04:23.610 --> 04:26.610
for me to tell you what to change go and change things on your own.

04:26.610 --> 04:27.950
I mean what is the worst that can happen.

04:27.950 --> 04:31.360
You can just break the site but who cares you're just testing it anyway.

04:31.980 --> 04:38.130
So Baloo you can do pretty much whatever you want there play around with it and see what happens what

04:38.130 --> 04:40.410
sort of results do you get.

04:40.410 --> 04:49.620
OK so going back here it says Down below styled or background color and this actually we're actually

04:49.620 --> 04:51.360
passing the name of the color that we.

04:51.360 --> 04:56.650
So you see there's background color and you can relate this to this.

04:56.650 --> 04:59.340
It's as background color.

04:59.350 --> 05:05.110
So in this particular case they don't have much to do with each other but here he said styled art background

05:05.110 --> 05:08.710
color and then you assigned the name of the color that you would like.

05:08.710 --> 05:12.940
So it's basically the string is equal to red.

05:12.940 --> 05:19.030
So B.G. color is our string that we are binding here and says B.G. color so it's red.

05:19.030 --> 05:26.750
Therefore this input field will be red item if I change it to gray.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.460
Let's see Will this work.

05:32.470 --> 05:33.850
Yup it works.

05:33.850 --> 05:37.570
So as you can see the field the field color has changed.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.910
Now it is gray.

05:40.630 --> 05:42.470
So that should be it.

05:42.490 --> 05:44.340
Yep that is the last line.

05:44.350 --> 05:52.240
Anyway once again please please change as many things as you can and then observe the effect of your

05:52.240 --> 05:54.380
change on the site itself.

05:54.590 --> 05:57.830
I'm literally begging you to do that anyway.

05:58.090 --> 06:02.760
I'm going to go ahead and bid you farewell here and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
