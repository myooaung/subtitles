00:00.300 --> 00:09.120
OK so our next objective will be to make our component account list which we have created in the previous

00:09.120 --> 00:10.230
tutorial.

00:10.230 --> 00:21.240
Even more reusable we wanted to be only and only in charge of displaying accounts and nothing else.

00:21.240 --> 00:27.390
We do not want to care which accounts are are given to it to display.

00:27.570 --> 00:35.100
We do not we don't have wanted to care how the accounts are retrieved or where are they retrieved from.

00:35.100 --> 00:47.340
So we want our account accounts that we want our account list component to be only in charge of this

00:47.340 --> 00:49.520
billing account and nothing else.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.550
We don't want to care about anything else quite literally.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.200
Why are we doing this.

00:55.230 --> 01:01.350
Well at the moment our accounts are basically stored in an array.

01:01.350 --> 01:03.380
They are not stored in a database.

01:03.390 --> 01:06.050
Hopefully soon we shall moved them to a database.

01:06.330 --> 01:11.670
But if we had a database assume for a moment that we do.

01:11.880 --> 01:20.550
And imagine if this one component was in charge of database retrieval and display displaying the same

01:20.550 --> 01:21.470
information on the screen.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.170
That's bad that's bad coding practice.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.070
That's not good.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.030
Really it's not.

01:26.190 --> 01:33.150
So what we want is information retrieval account retrieval will be the logic for it will be elsewhere

01:33.750 --> 01:41.820
and our counseling component will only be in charge of actually displaying the content the current the

01:41.820 --> 01:47.940
content the accounts that is the list of accounts will be served this component and this component will

01:47.940 --> 01:50.410
take it and then it will display it on.

01:50.460 --> 01:55.540
And then it will be in charge of the display logic on the screen.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.490
So how do we achieve this.

01:57.710 --> 02:05.750
Well in order for us to be able to do this we will need to implement a logic for it to implement a logic

02:05.750 --> 02:09.340
for the parent component which is the opt out component.

02:11.370 --> 02:18.600
To basically pass the accounts to the child component which is the account account list component which

02:18.600 --> 02:19.930
is above.

02:20.610 --> 02:28.490
So one component will be passing accounts to another component so this is enter component communication

02:28.500 --> 02:37.200
here the process is very similar to property binding from the previous tutorials and we will also be

02:37.200 --> 02:39.250
dealing with input and output.

02:39.270 --> 02:45.630
What they are how they are used I will show you soon enough in the follow up tutorials but for now let's

02:45.630 --> 02:51.150
go ahead and let's go ahead and build foundations for Inter component communication.

02:51.150 --> 02:53.900
In our particular case.

02:54.140 --> 03:03.840
So the very first thing that we need to do is take away basically I've given the tags here.

03:04.230 --> 03:13.280
So take away from this array private accounts IRA and we're just going to go ahead and copy that should

03:13.280 --> 03:14.420
be here.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.110
Yes.

03:16.330 --> 03:22.330
So just go ahead and just select this what I've selected and press control X beginning from private

03:22.330 --> 03:27.580
accounts and I'm ending it down at the semicolon before the method remove account.

03:27.910 --> 03:33.530
So just press control X delete it completely and then move on to the app component.

03:33.550 --> 03:42.480
TS and right below the export class subcomponent and you can go ahead and paste it.

03:43.210 --> 03:45.090
Excellent so we shall leave it there.

03:45.350 --> 03:51.310
I know that we are playing basically a back and forth game here but I need to I need a word and you

03:51.310 --> 03:52.970
get a way of demonstrating this to you.

03:52.970 --> 03:56.440
So I've chosen to take this path anyway.

03:56.450 --> 03:59.130
All I need to do is copy it here.

03:59.150 --> 04:06.870
So now the app component will be initializing these these elements of the array.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.060
The first two anyway.

04:08.330 --> 04:12.040
But this is just the beginning of what we actually need to do.

04:12.350 --> 04:20.540
So once again the optimum account list that the US will not be in charge of account retrieval don't

04:20.540 --> 04:22.870
fill it don't worry about there we'll fix it soon enough.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.540
In the follow up to True Will we actually edit the code further.

04:28.760 --> 04:33.010
But for the time being I just wanted to understand the general logic of what we were actually doing.

04:33.020 --> 04:38.840
So this component the accomplished component will no longer be in charge of account retrieval.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.270
It will not care about account retrieval.

04:41.270 --> 04:43.620
It will not care where the accounts are coming from.

04:43.640 --> 04:49.640
It will not care what what sort of accounts they are where they're coming from how they are being pulled

04:49.700 --> 04:54.110
etc. It will only take them and it will display them onto the screen.

04:54.260 --> 05:00.560
A good security a good secure practice to perform so that logic will be moved to the app component up

05:00.560 --> 05:07.430
to us which is the parent component of the child component account list and disparate component will

05:07.430 --> 05:14.400
be in charge of retreat of information retrieval and serving the same information to the account list

05:14.420 --> 05:15.400
component.

05:15.830 --> 05:19.910
So from parent to child that will be our flow.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.820
See you in the follow up tutorial.
