00:00.280 --> 00:04.910
OK so let's go ahead and continue.

00:05.190 --> 00:17.640
Now what we need to do is have a way of providing a longer service to me just when we need a way of

00:17.640 --> 00:23.760
providing the logger's service here so that this would so that this variable logger would actually be

00:23.760 --> 00:28.610
initialized and so that the logging process would actually occur.

00:28.620 --> 00:31.130
There are three main ways of doing it.

00:31.140 --> 00:34.210
The third one I guess that's the recommended one.

00:34.320 --> 00:44.700
The first way is basically to go into the main tiers main Dotty's and imported here globally with bootstrap

00:44.700 --> 00:48.480
method that basically starts the angular application.

00:48.540 --> 00:56.400
This will mean that there shall be only one instance and one instance alone of the logger's service

00:57.270 --> 01:02.430
across the entire application and it will be the same.

01:02.460 --> 01:13.110
So this is not good for other services that are component specific like account account services.

01:13.110 --> 01:19.080
So it's not good there because account services is not used globally it is only good for basically some

01:19.080 --> 01:23.550
of the services which are used globally such as the logger's service because each one of our components

01:23.640 --> 01:32.970
will need the ability to actually generate Laux and this will work rather well with the at optional

01:33.000 --> 01:37.920
decorator as we only need to basically write it here as I have.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.710
So I either have it here or not have it here.

01:40.710 --> 01:42.410
Either way the application will work.

01:42.450 --> 01:47.340
Not having it here means that there will be no logs and having it here means that there will be locks

01:47.340 --> 01:51.380
and you only need to change it here and here alone and nowhere else.

01:51.420 --> 02:00.300
Not a bad way but not something that we need that we want because you would also need to list all the

02:00.300 --> 02:04.150
dependencies and all the other things we don't really have any now.

02:04.170 --> 02:08.860
But not the best of not the best of ways.

02:11.650 --> 02:14.060
Yeah the cover anyway.

02:14.130 --> 02:21.510
The second way is to include in the component basically app component ts that uses the account service.

02:21.510 --> 02:29.730
This means that this service will exist within this component and all the children will basically be

02:29.790 --> 02:31.710
using it.

02:31.710 --> 02:32.970
So this will be the third method.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.100
Explain it in a moment.

02:34.330 --> 02:36.440
But again it's included like this.

02:36.750 --> 02:43.170
And if app component has it included in the list of providers that means that all the children will

02:43.170 --> 02:47.220
be will actually be able to use it as well.

02:47.220 --> 02:50.170
You don't need to include it here.

02:50.640 --> 02:55.980
Now this again is very similar to the first method except it's not included globally but you still would

02:55.980 --> 03:00.660
have to list dependencies here which is rather bad for us.

03:00.690 --> 03:03.810
What are these depends what on earth is that I'm talking about.

03:04.170 --> 03:11.310
Well just imagine that instead of just private lager here we would have like two three four more you

03:11.310 --> 03:18.090
would need to literally list them all out here one by one and every time you would change something

03:18.090 --> 03:22.710
in in here you would need to go to the other file and change it here as well.

03:22.710 --> 03:32.250
But is it you're bound to create faulty code if you go about doing it in such a way that is why we're

03:32.250 --> 03:34.830
going to go ahead and use the angular way.

03:34.890 --> 03:40.650
I'm just going to go ahead and comment this is just going to go ahead and comment this out and utilize

03:40.740 --> 03:42.120
this.

03:42.120 --> 03:51.820
So I have included the account service providers here and it's used from account dot services.

03:52.070 --> 04:00.230
And if we go to the account services and if we scroll down all the way to the bottom there's a new export

04:00.230 --> 04:08.060
going on here so it says export left and then account underline service providers and this is an array

04:08.330 --> 04:11.360
that can be filled up with pretty much anything.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.270
I'll take that with a grain of salt.

04:14.720 --> 04:20.280
And then we have accounts service and logger's service.

04:20.420 --> 04:23.260
So they are both included in this array.

04:23.600 --> 04:29.120
And we can then pass this array elsewhere we can include it wherever we want.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.240
And once when we make changes here.

04:32.540 --> 04:39.290
So when changes are made here it doesn't matter because all that we need to do is change the array and

04:39.830 --> 04:44.090
the changes will reflect to everything that is using it.

04:44.630 --> 04:50.840
So we just need to change it to conduct changes within this file and changes will be reflected to everything

04:50.840 --> 04:52.500
that's tied to it.

04:53.030 --> 04:55.340
And as you can see here it says providers.

04:55.340 --> 05:02.210
And then you just give account service providers you pass this array and then you of course need to

05:02.210 --> 05:04.220
include this here as well.

05:04.280 --> 05:11.300
But as soon as you pass this array that means that all the dependencies all the services and their dependencies

05:11.660 --> 05:16.300
are actually loaded from the array and passed and passed as providers here.

05:16.330 --> 05:22.460
And therefore they can be used now they can be you they are used by this component by Apter component

05:22.470 --> 05:26.210
at ts and they can be used by all of its children.

05:26.480 --> 05:32.750
So it's not the same as the global providing which I am actually going to remove

05:36.800 --> 05:41.620
just like this that was about that was a bad idea.

05:46.300 --> 05:46.560
Anna

05:50.120 --> 05:51.020
it's already removed.

05:51.020 --> 05:51.900
Sorry it's gone.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.370
I did remove that and realized that sorry.

05:54.380 --> 05:55.710
So I'm just going to go ahead.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.590
Just go ahead and leave this as app component.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.560
I didn't realize that I actually removed it already.

06:02.570 --> 06:06.200
Silly me anyway so we're going to use this way.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.500
And we'll be passing an array of services and their dependencies.

06:10.830 --> 06:16.380
And then that will be including the providers and that will become available to the app component that

06:16.440 --> 06:18.560
TS and to all of its children.

06:18.560 --> 06:26.750
So to parents and to all the children and in such a way were creating a resilience a system which is

06:26.900 --> 06:30.280
easily changed from a single file.

06:30.290 --> 06:34.870
You don't need to jump between files to actually conduct changes you might say well what's the difference

06:34.880 --> 06:42.320
I needed to make a change here and here that still to change is the same as changing the array and changing

06:42.320 --> 06:43.190
it here.

06:43.190 --> 06:47.870
Well no not really because you are just conducting changes within one file.

06:48.020 --> 06:48.440
Yes.

06:48.470 --> 06:51.650
And two places in one file but in one file nevertheless.

06:51.860 --> 06:58.310
And those changes are reflected anywhere where this is used when you need to jump between when you make

06:58.310 --> 07:02.090
a change and want to file for a certain set of variables or something like that.

07:02.090 --> 07:05.440
I mean it's dumped next file or next file next file.

07:05.450 --> 07:12.000
Trust me this leads to errors on end and headaches pretty bad headaches.

07:12.170 --> 07:18.800
So just include it like this as an array and you will have all the things that are listed in the array

07:18.860 --> 07:21.700
of fit made available.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.650
So that would be it.

07:23.660 --> 07:28.130
Here we're going to go ahead and move on to the next chapter.

07:28.460 --> 07:33.320
If you have any questions feel free to ask we'll be more than happy to help you out in any way we can.
