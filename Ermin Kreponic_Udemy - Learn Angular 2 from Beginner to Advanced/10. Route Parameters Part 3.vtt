WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:06.500
OK so let's go ahead and continue and wrap this up.

00:06.510 --> 00:13.660
Anyway the first file which we need to edit is the account underscore list of component diet tips.

00:13.920 --> 00:19.540
So go over there and we're going to be doing some editing there.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.530
We don't need to actually do much.

00:22.560 --> 00:26.460
These are the only two new lines here which we have at.

00:26.460 --> 00:31.350
So instead of us performing it a vacation from this particular component in which we are at the moment

00:31.770 --> 00:39.840
we will provide an event to which the parent component can actually subscribe to which will mar that

00:39.840 --> 00:48.000
we want to show the details of some account and that account will basically just be admitted so we're

00:48.000 --> 00:55.380
using the decorator output to a variable details and then we are creating an event emitter which will

00:55.380 --> 00:56.430
basically

00:58.850 --> 01:02.650
will basically emit that account as an event.

01:03.060 --> 01:09.420
And down below we have a private method show details so this method will be called on clicks on when

01:09.420 --> 01:12.270
we click on the site on the account.

01:12.270 --> 01:20.070
This will get the account which we would like to display and down below in the body of the metal Bubel

01:20.070 --> 01:27.240
simply a media event containing the account to specify that we want basically just containing the account

01:27.540 --> 01:29.690
that we want to show.

01:30.150 --> 01:38.040
So we are Amedee consumers see here details that admit details and then demit account that is there.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.480
That is the thing that we are emitting.

01:39.480 --> 01:47.580
Next up we need to go into the account list component that HD M-L And here we need to make a very small

01:47.850 --> 01:48.720
change.

01:51.610 --> 01:58.720
This line here so we need to create an on click thing up there actually which is going to edit this

01:58.720 --> 02:00.920
line and create a click.

02:00.940 --> 02:04.590
So here we are finding the show detail function.

02:04.600 --> 02:11.280
So you have the show detail phunk details function to the click event that we are passing.

02:11.350 --> 02:17.980
And we and we are passing to it the account on which it has actually occurred.

02:17.980 --> 02:22.620
So as you can see we're passing it A.S.C. anyway.

02:23.050 --> 02:29.560
Now we can move on to the count list component Dotsie SS and here we just need to add one short line

02:29.820 --> 02:32.710
its cursor colon pointer.

02:32.880 --> 02:39.280
So when we pass with the mouse over the given account it will have the shape of a hand so that it is

02:39.280 --> 02:48.400
more intuitive of the click and now we're going to go into the list component at HD M-L and what we

02:48.400 --> 02:56.230
did here is basically this line as well that this entire line.

02:56.230 --> 03:01.140
But like just this part that we are inserting here.

03:02.050 --> 03:08.560
So we are now in the period component and now we would like to bind to the details event which we just

03:08.620 --> 03:17.060
made and we are binding it to the show account details here function and we are passing to it defend

03:18.040 --> 03:23.940
right here which in essence is the account that was actually admit it.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.990
Now if we go into the list component Dotti Yes actually don't need this last part here.

03:32.990 --> 03:35.220
There we go.

03:35.510 --> 03:41.500
Just scroll down and private.

03:41.890 --> 03:42.730
There we go.

03:42.730 --> 03:45.630
So these two are the new lines.

03:45.670 --> 03:52.690
So like this the first one the private router here is what we're doing here is that we are injecting

03:52.690 --> 03:59.770
the service router which we will use for navigation so that we can go from so that we can go to one

03:59.770 --> 04:03.010
of the given routes and down below.

04:03.220 --> 04:06.000
We have private route.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.080
This was a private underscore router.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.340
This is private underscore route.

04:11.380 --> 04:17.260
We mentioned the service before which is needed in order to retrieve the route which we will need in

04:17.260 --> 04:25.810
order to retrieve the route for the relative navigation and we import and we did import the dependencies

04:25.900 --> 04:27.200
above.

04:27.220 --> 04:34.830
So just this this line here a router and activated route.

04:34.970 --> 04:38.200
OK so moving on from there.

04:38.300 --> 04:46.270
There is a private show account details and private a private method if you will.

04:46.310 --> 04:53.270
So it takes the parameter d account whose details we wish to show and that is the method which we have

04:53.900 --> 04:54.780
previously.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.050
Bind it.

04:56.210 --> 05:00.620
So it takes as a parameter of the account whose details are going to be shown.

05:01.070 --> 05:05.070
And we have the two lines down below.

05:05.080 --> 05:09.860
Now these two lines of code do pretty much the same thing just in a different way.

05:10.250 --> 05:14.220
In order to talk let's go ahead and discuss the first one.

05:15.610 --> 05:24.310
So in order to reach a certain route we are using the method navigate are right here we're using We're

05:24.310 --> 05:32.920
using that method from the router service which is which takes the first parameter the length array.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.650
So you have the length array here.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.590
And which is.

05:39.900 --> 05:45.990
Which are the same as for the router link directive as well.

05:45.990 --> 05:48.780
That's really important at the moment.

05:48.780 --> 05:52.550
So the first element of the array is slash.

05:52.690 --> 05:54.010
So this is important.

05:54.120 --> 06:00.690
And the second parameter and the second element of the array is the route parameter that is the current

06:00.780 --> 06:01.660
ID.

06:01.740 --> 06:04.120
So count dot ID.

06:04.620 --> 06:12.900
But since the direct routing is not reusable we will go ahead and take a look at the relative routing

06:12.960 --> 06:20.610
as well which is that line down below for relative routing we require an additional parameter for this

06:20.610 --> 06:23.460
navigate function and that is an object.

06:23.460 --> 06:33.300
So here theres an object which relative to property which to which we pass the route as well the current

06:33.300 --> 06:37.790
instance of the route and the current and basically that is the current route.

06:37.820 --> 06:40.630
It is the current instance of it.

06:40.710 --> 06:47.540
So to say the dot dot here dto it.

06:47.580 --> 06:48.560
Well let me show you.

06:49.050 --> 06:56.480
Let me go ahead and open up another D and if you type here see the dot dot ups see the dot dot.

06:56.670 --> 07:05.210
You are going back exactly one directory so the same logic applies here you see C users test and a fight

07:05.220 --> 07:06.660
to do this.

07:06.660 --> 07:13.920
And if I am against the users test but if I do see the dot dot I am going back one folder and again

07:13.990 --> 07:17.330
I'm going back one step so to say.

07:17.340 --> 07:26.750
So we are first routing with this apparent route with this first and going back to the parent route.

07:26.910 --> 07:35.060
And then we are routing to the route with the parameter we need this because the current route is.

07:35.490 --> 07:43.170
Let me just go ahead and type that this is this is the the current route would be this and we need to

07:43.170 --> 07:52.830
go out of this route and we need to go from here and then go elsewhere because that's how that's how

07:52.830 --> 07:53.750
it works.

07:53.760 --> 07:59.420
So that's why we have the double dot which takes us back one step.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.570
Anyway that's it.

08:00.570 --> 08:04.950
Save the file save all of them and go ahead and pop your browser.

08:04.950 --> 08:09.250
Go ahead and click on look at your accounts and then you can click on one of these do.

08:09.330 --> 08:11.040
Let's go ahead and click on the first one.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.440
And there you go you have the account details.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.820
If I go back one step just take a look at the shape of my mouse.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.790
Just take a look at it.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.320
It doesn't change doesn't change.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.500
I go over it it changes to a hand.

08:24.580 --> 08:27.590
So it's kind of more intuitive when you click on it.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.760
Anyway good to bid you farewell here and hope to see you soon.
