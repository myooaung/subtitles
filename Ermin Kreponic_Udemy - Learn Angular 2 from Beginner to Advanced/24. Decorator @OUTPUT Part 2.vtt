WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:05.160
OK so we are back.

00:05.790 --> 00:16.920
Let's go ahead and take a look at the first art component that each DML and we're going to need to rename

00:17.250 --> 00:18.340
this one.

00:18.450 --> 00:28.860
Going to need to delete that and basically just put the underline here and save it OK.

00:28.880 --> 00:35.540
So because we have actually added a different function and in we have actually moved the method remove

00:35.540 --> 00:37.390
account elsewhere.

00:37.790 --> 00:40.320
So we just need to basically rename this.

00:40.550 --> 00:44.120
And here's what's going to happen thus far.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.730
We're going to do some other things as well.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.570
So we have a button and it's click here.

00:50.930 --> 00:52.400
So it's delete.

00:52.400 --> 01:01.430
So when you when when you click on the delete you will call it move you will call this method.

01:01.680 --> 01:11.520
So this method will be called and if you go into the account accounts that component.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.640
This method is here.

01:13.760 --> 01:20.000
And then this method is or is used in order to permit an event but we haven't subscribed anybody to

01:20.000 --> 01:20.870
do it.

01:21.140 --> 01:26.470
It is variable here therefore nobody is going to actually get the problems.

01:26.950 --> 01:31.560
OK so let's go ahead and click that Subscribe button on you.

01:31.610 --> 01:32.600
No just kidding.

01:32.690 --> 01:35.970
Let's go ahead and subscribe the component.

01:36.040 --> 01:45.680
Yes in order for us to do that we will need to go into the HMO file and you see here where it says accounts

01:45.740 --> 01:47.950
a dash list.

01:48.080 --> 01:52.240
So we will just need to add an additional line here.

01:52.750 --> 02:01.860
We will need to extend the current line delete and we're going to say equal and this should be equal

02:01.860 --> 02:04.700
to remove account.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.720
So remove A.S.C..

02:09.240 --> 02:12.780
And this one will receive an event.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.120
There you go.

02:15.460 --> 02:22.340
So now this app component of TS is subscribed.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.620
How is it subscribed.

02:23.620 --> 02:32.830
Well we've used the delete here and this and this here is basically ours subscription.

02:33.070 --> 02:44.350
This is quite different from this because here it goes from child to from here it goes from parent to

02:44.800 --> 02:52.950
from parent to child while here it's going to go from from a from child to parent.

02:52.990 --> 03:00.480
So it's a reverse logic child parent parent child.

03:00.520 --> 03:06.820
So just two different two different projects because the child will meet an event parent will receive

03:06.820 --> 03:12.760
it and then parent will act upon that logic OK.

03:12.770 --> 03:19.160
I do believe that that is all that we need to do here and this H.A. file if I have missed something

03:19.550 --> 03:21.280
please don't hang me.

03:21.710 --> 03:23.290
But anyway that's it.

03:23.300 --> 03:29.330
That's all that we need to do now app component is subscribed and it will act.

03:29.350 --> 03:29.700
OK.

03:29.780 --> 03:35.540
Before we are done there is just one more thing that I would like to do and let's go over this.

03:35.590 --> 03:42.830
Let's create an overview and follow the traits of the logic see what happens and which is which exact

03:42.830 --> 03:44.300
steps are taken.

03:44.330 --> 03:57.810
So you open up the browser you can click on the delete button here if you like and it's well fight hard

03:58.840 --> 04:00.450
to control this.

04:00.460 --> 04:02.910
Just let me save these files.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.060
It saved them too.

04:04.060 --> 04:07.140
I failed to save some of them.

04:07.170 --> 04:08.310
It doesn't really matter.

04:08.350 --> 04:09.660
Just wait for it to reload.

04:09.790 --> 04:14.750
So we'll retrace the steps of the logic so you can see the exact path that this logic will take.

04:14.830 --> 04:20.330
So you can click on the delete button here and one account will be deleted.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.920
Now let's see where did this go and what it happened.

04:23.920 --> 04:32.340
Well the first thing we do is check out the HD M-L file with the button.

04:32.410 --> 04:35.720
So accounts underline this dark component at HD.

04:35.780 --> 04:36.020
OK.

04:36.070 --> 04:36.830
So we are here.

04:37.330 --> 04:45.010
You have a button here that we have created and it says on click call this method here.

04:45.300 --> 04:50.830
OK let's go ahead and let's go ahead and check this method out.

04:50.890 --> 04:55.870
So this method here what it does it relates to here.

04:55.900 --> 05:02.050
This one here it says there's a dot delete dot emit and it emits an event.

05:02.080 --> 05:09.190
It emits a notification of an event or an event and it passes along the index number of that account

05:09.250 --> 05:11.350
to be deleted.

05:11.350 --> 05:17.020
Now we go into the app component outage Decimo and right here where we've placed accounts liest.

05:17.230 --> 05:23.180
There is a subscription where it says delete and then it will remove A.S.C. remove account.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.990
So this one will actually.

05:26.030 --> 05:30.520
This will be this app component will be notified of this event.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.710
It will be passed the index number.

05:32.950 --> 05:36.050
And here the event will actually be the index number here.

05:36.050 --> 05:40.040
So remove A.S.C. method will be called.

05:40.180 --> 05:44.400
Now remove A.S.C. method is in the app component.

05:44.410 --> 05:47.030
So let's pick up component.

05:47.130 --> 05:49.570
Yes and there we go.

05:49.570 --> 05:56.830
So remove A.S.C. will be called It will be given an index number of the account and then it will be

05:56.910 --> 06:05.400
then that account will be deleted with a previously defined logic and it will be gone eliminated permanently

06:05.620 --> 06:09.540
without the possibility of recovery anyway.

06:09.810 --> 06:12.450
So that is the logic that we have followed here.

06:12.450 --> 06:15.960
I know it'd be a little bit complex to understand.

06:15.960 --> 06:22.020
I would strongly advise you to re to go out onto the net and just read the documentation or whatever

06:22.020 --> 06:28.460
you can in regard to the events and the imaging of events possible.

06:28.470 --> 06:35.850
It will possibly help you out a little bit more when talking when I advise you to go out onto the net

06:35.880 --> 06:37.420
and take a look at the documentation.

06:37.430 --> 06:42.630
I'm not telling you go out and read whatever somebody has written and take it for granted.

06:42.660 --> 06:48.730
Now go onto the official documentation on the angular to side see if you can find something there see

06:48.750 --> 06:53.930
if you can find something on reputable forums such as stack overflow or someplace like that.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.310
Don't just go and accept everything from unverified sources.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.860
Anyway that'll be it for to it all.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.320
They hope to see you in the follow up.
