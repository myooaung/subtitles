WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:09.680
OK so our account list component RTX is still completely empty and we need to populate it.

00:09.750 --> 00:22.320
So this portion of the code we will need to simply write its import component from this.

00:22.550 --> 00:28.520
The standard thing that we need to write in Giller core

00:33.720 --> 00:34.760
angular core.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.150
OK.

00:36.390 --> 00:46.510
Next up we're going to need to import count so import count so this we're basically just doing this

00:46.570 --> 00:47.090
again.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.960
From dot dot represents the current folder and then slash to where we are going with that current folders

00:56.960 --> 01:04.120
so account dot model.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.770
So do you know where we are importing this from.

01:09.020 --> 01:10.620
Your account model that.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.020
Yes.

01:11.030 --> 01:11.480
OK.

01:11.590 --> 01:12.390
Dot model.

01:12.410 --> 01:15.820
That is what we're looking for so a our model does exist.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.700
If you go in it there is a class count.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.920
It's right here.

01:22.010 --> 01:29.400
So if we go back to the TS as import and then restate account so we just account is right here

01:31.940 --> 01:39.560
and then count off model which is right here in that ABC account that model Okay.

01:39.570 --> 01:42.780
So that basic import is done.

01:42.780 --> 01:46.390
Next up we need to actually construct our component.

01:46.950 --> 01:48.520
So let's go ahead and do that

01:51.420 --> 01:52.480
component here.

01:53.500 --> 02:00.170
And here we go let's begin writing the first thing that we're going to need to do is create a selector

02:02.130 --> 02:03.480
selector Colin

02:06.190 --> 02:12.980
counts the list and then just then just we need a comma.

02:13.090 --> 02:21.300
So selector is a name of an H DML pair of an HD tag that marks this component.

02:21.760 --> 02:28.450
So this account Dasch list will inter relate to this.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.360
So it says here accounts dush list.

02:31.660 --> 02:39.140
And here we're creating a selector for the selector with the same name so accounts dash list.

02:39.220 --> 02:44.920
This is how angular geus will know what is tied to what and where to insert what sort of code.

02:45.070 --> 02:53.620
I'll come back to this in a moment when we actually do a demo in the part 3 I guess you we'll see how

02:53.650 --> 02:58.680
that each DML code and logic is inserted into a certain place on the main page.

02:59.140 --> 03:08.810
So to say and we're of course going to need a template for this so template you are ELF and are going

03:08.810 --> 03:20.920
to need a p p o KPP slash count slash counts underline list.

03:20.930 --> 03:32.350
So when you specify path component art HVM out and this is the path for the the HD M-L file within the

03:32.350 --> 03:33.800
account folder.

03:34.450 --> 03:44.140
OK so next up we're going to need to give it the style you are L4 the styles so as style if you or else

03:45.890 --> 03:47.980
and we're going to go ahead and do that as well.

03:48.080 --> 04:01.480
So you just put the quote marks and then type in an app slash account slash accounts underline list

04:01.550 --> 04:17.210
we're just plugging in the C Ss component the C Ss and of course we need a it just me red dots which

04:17.210 --> 04:19.630
is always a very bad thing.

04:20.270 --> 04:22.490
So that should solve.

04:22.490 --> 04:27.910
They sure don't know why those that either do or do seriously require a calling here.

04:28.090 --> 04:30.630
Coba here.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.390
It's going to go a rule.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.290
We'll fix that along the merry way.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.480
But there you go it's gone.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.320
So we just need to actually continue writing code.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.880
And now we need to go ahead and use this one.

04:45.010 --> 04:51.630
So export class accounts list this boom sound that you just heard that is the Linux in the background

04:51.630 --> 04:59.100
telling me that I should really perform the 70 some updates that have been pending for a while but I

04:59.100 --> 05:00.890
am not going to do that.

05:00.930 --> 05:02.130
Not now anyway.

05:02.300 --> 05:07.670
So we're going to type in export in order and then create a class account's list.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.970
We are exporting it so that we may use it elsewhere.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.350
That is the that's very important that re-exported I've explained it before so that we so that it's

05:16.350 --> 05:17.310
reusable.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.230
And it says accounts lists.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.090
Let's go ahead and open up our tags.

05:23.370 --> 05:25.270
And the red dot is gone.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.470
No more anyway.

05:27.570 --> 05:33.030
Now within this within this class we will have to pull something out of the app component.

05:33.040 --> 05:38.340
Yes because we no longer want it to be located here we would like to pool this portion of the code and

05:38.340 --> 05:39.870
place it there.

05:40.110 --> 05:42.860
So I have again marked it for myself here to begin.

05:42.860 --> 05:43.920
The copy process.

05:43.920 --> 05:49.200
So just copy all of this and go to here.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.860
So take taken Take a good long look what we do to copy.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.390
So where where where my beginning to copy and where am i ending it.

05:56.440 --> 06:04.520
Then press control X take it out and plug it back into the other TS file here.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.700
Just control V and paste it.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.550
So there you go.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.220
It's all here now.

06:09.300 --> 06:13.970
There's nothing the code is not different to code is the same except we are separating it.

06:14.370 --> 06:22.580
Go back into the component parts component at the file and we're going to need to copy something else

06:22.580 --> 06:24.050
as well.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.920
So this part down below so these two methods down below.

06:27.920 --> 06:36.610
We would also like to grab them and put them into the account lists D.S. file.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.650
Ok so now that they are here.

06:38.700 --> 06:42.370
Press Control as save and that's it.

06:42.390 --> 06:49.410
So you see now we have successfully constructed our accounts underly list start component as file we

06:49.410 --> 06:55.230
have everything that we need from there and we have fooled everything that we have needed from the other

06:55.230 --> 06:56.420
files as well.

06:56.460 --> 07:01.310
So information is no longer stored there it is stored here.

07:01.410 --> 07:04.370
Now it is completely separated.

07:04.860 --> 07:12.160
The other work that we're going to that we will need to perform is actually in relation to the D.S.

07:12.170 --> 07:12.600
file.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.000
So we're going to need to modify it a little bit.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.730
So app component TS need to go here and I no longer need these are cations.

07:21.960 --> 07:27.380
So remove this.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.830
Never mind the commented code down below.

07:29.830 --> 07:36.230
That is just I will get to that all of it will be explained.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.890
There are some things which we haven't which I haven't implemented yet.

07:38.900 --> 07:42.290
So you don't have to really worry about that at all.

07:42.650 --> 07:48.800
So the very first thing you are doing that we will need to change is this part here.

07:49.910 --> 07:55.250
But I think I'm going to go ahead and explain that in part 3 and give you a demo as well because I have

07:55.640 --> 07:58.140
directives here that needs to be plugged in.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.650
And we will need to make an A.

08:00.710 --> 08:01.520
We will need to.

08:01.580 --> 08:07.340
We will need to do additional imports with modified pads in order to take into consideration the new

08:07.430 --> 08:09.250
account folder that we made.

08:09.470 --> 08:16.430
So thus far our imports as you can see just been stating Daut current folder and then grab something

08:16.430 --> 08:17.660
from the current folder.

08:17.660 --> 08:19.970
This is no longer valid.

08:19.970 --> 08:28.610
We need to add a path an absolute path to this to the second model so we need to take current folder

08:29.340 --> 08:35.390
and then go into the account folder and then find a account that model the farewell and I'll see you

08:35.390 --> 08:36.160
in the follow up.
