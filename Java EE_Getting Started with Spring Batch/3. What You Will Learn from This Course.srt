1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,603
As this is a course to get you started with Spring Batch,

2
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,673
the primary focus is on the basics of the framework.

3
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:09,974
As a result of watching the course,

4
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:12,603
you should understand how to do the following.

5
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:15,359
You will know how to configure a Spring Batch job.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,013
This includes configuration of both the framework and outside dependencies.

7
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:23,043
It also includes configuration of the job repository,

8
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:25,531
job steps, readers, writers, and processors.

9
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:29,170
You will understand how to implement a Spring Batch job.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,347
You will learn how to construct the various aspects of

11
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:34,572
the batch job from the framework.

12
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:36,390
You will know how to implement the reading,

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,499
processing, and writing of data for a batch job.

14
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:41,428
This will be done in the context of a requirement to

15
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:44,889
load patient data from a file, transferring the data,

16
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:48,146
and then output the results into a database.

17
00:00:48,146 --> 00:00:48,438
Finally,

18
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:51,647
you will learn how to implement unit tests that cover the

19
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:54,571
various aspects of the job including the reading,

20
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,432
processing, and writing of the data.

21
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:56,731
Again,

22
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:00,917
the primary focus will be to get you up and running with a

23
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,789
working batch job using the Spring Batch framework.

24
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,853
Given this, let's look at what is outside the scope of this course.

25
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:11,158
As the goal of this course is to get you started in a short time,

26
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:14,233
there are several things that I'm not going to cover.

27
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:18,874
First, Spring and Java knowledge are a requirement for the course.

28
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:21,538
I won't be going into explanation of how the Java language works

29
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:24,666
or how aspects of the Spring Framework behave.

30
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,714
If you need to learn more about these topics,

31
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:30,986
please visit one of the many Pluralsight courses already covered.

32
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:33,821
I also won't be diving into more advanced Spring Batch

33
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:36,579
concepts like asynchronous processing, restarts,

34
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,770
and performance considerations.

35
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:46,000
If you need to know more about these, please visit the documentation on the Spring Batch website.
