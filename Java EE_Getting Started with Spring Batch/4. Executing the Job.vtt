00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:04.284
To complete the discussion on the item processor,

2
00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:08.183
I'm going to demonstrate running the full batch job using the

3
00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:10.395
fully implemented ItemReader and ItemProcessor.

4
00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:15.328
The ItemWriter will continue to output the PatientEntity to the System.

5
00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:16.180
err log.

6
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.522
Note that I'm following Demo 18 found in the DEMOS.

7
00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:23.561
md file of the root project directory.

8
00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.774
With the full item reader and processor in place and the writer stubbed,

9
00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:28.778
let's try to execute the job.

10
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.688
Make sure in the toolbar that you've selected the

11
00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:35.864
PatientBatchLoaderApp and run the server.

12
00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:38.099
I see here that the server started successfully,

13
00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:40.335
so I can open up the REST Client.

14
00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:44.670
Once again in the REST Client, I'm using the HTTP method of GET,

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.508
the URL of localhost:8080, and the path of /job/test-unit-testing.

16
00:00:52.508 --> 00:00:53.379
csv.

17
00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.824
Let's run that now.

18
00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:58.799
If it was successful, you should get a Success message returned.

19
00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.370
Now let's look at the runtime log.

20
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.744
Verify that you see a line noting the start of the job,

21
00:01:05.744 --> 00:01:08.268
a line that outputs the PatientEntity data,

22
00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.611
and a line that denotes success for the job.

23
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:14.088
That completes the execution of the job using the ItemReader,

24
00:01:14.088 --> 00:01:18.000
ItemProcessor, and stub. writer.
