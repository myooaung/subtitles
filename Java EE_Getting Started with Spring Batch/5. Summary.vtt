In this section,

2
00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:06.920
I completed the last part of our chunk-oriented processing for patient data.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.659
I added a new database changelog for Liquibase to manage.

4
00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:15.991
The changelog included the full table and columns for our patient record.

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.033
Next, I implemented a JPA ItemWriter.

6
00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:24.026
The ItemWriter leveraged my EntityManager database configuration for writing

7
00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:27.641
PatientEntity records to the new patient database table.

8
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:27.911
Finally,

9
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:31.339
I created a unit test for the ItemWriter and then demonstrated full

10
00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.959
execution of the batch job using a larger test file.

11
00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:37.301
This completes the course.

12
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:40.896
I'd like to sincerely thank you for taking the time watch this course,

13
00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:47.000
and I hope that you'll continue to explore the features that Spring Batch has to offer.
