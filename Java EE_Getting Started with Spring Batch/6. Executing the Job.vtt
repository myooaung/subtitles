00:00:02.454 --> 00:00:04.487
To complete the discussion on the ItemReader,

2
00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:07.604
I'm going to demonstrate executing the full batch job.

3
00:00:07.604 --> 00:00:12.169
Note that I'll be following Demo 14 found in the DEMOS.

4
00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.367
md file in the root project directory.

5
00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:19.336
With the full item reader in place and the processor and writer stubbed,

6
00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.627
let's try to execute the job.

7
00:00:21.627 --> 00:00:22.773
In the IDE,

8
00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:28.324
make sure that you've selected the PatientBatchLoaderApp in your toolbar,

9
00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:30.966
and then select to run the server.

10
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.719
With the server started, let's go to the REST Client.

11
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.492
I again have my REST Client request that has an HTTP method of GET,

12
00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:48.140
a host and port of localhost:8080, and a path of /job/test-unit-testing.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.113
csv.

14
00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:53.007
Let's run it now.

15
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:57.320
If the job was successful, you should see a Success message.

16
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.403
Let's go over to the console.

17
00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.459
Here's the runtime log.

18
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.575
Verify that you see a line noting the start of the job,

19
00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:07.859
a line that outputs the PatientRecord data,

20
00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.245
and a line that denotes success for the job.

21
00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:19.000
This completes the execution of the job using the ItemReader and stubbed out processor and writer.
