00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,145
In this last section of the course,

2
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:06,777
I'll be completing the implementation of the batch job.

3
00:00:06,777 --> 00:00:10,697
I'm going to focus on writing items that were passed

4
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:13,398
from the ItemProcessor into a database.

5
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:17,752
To do this, I'll first need to add a database table to write to.

6
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:21,051
As I'm using Liquibase to manage the database changes for the project,

7
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:23,633
I just need to add a new changelog.

8
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:27,082
This changelog will define the table and columns that

9
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:29,376
map to our PatientEntity class.

10
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:33,582
I'll also need to add this file name to the master changelog.

11
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:35,056
Let's do that now.

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:38,798
I'm going to demonstrate adding the patient database changelog

13
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:41,702
to the project's Liquibase configuration.

14
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:44,873
Note that I'll be following Demo 19 found in the DEMOS.

15
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:49,222
md file of the root project directory.

16
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:51,314
To support writing items to the database,

17
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:54,408
I'm going to demonstrate adding the patient database schema

18
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:57,065
to be managed as a Liquibase changelog.

19
00:00:57,065 --> 00:01:03,967
Make sure that you've opened up to the folder

20
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:04,734
resources/config/liquibase/changelog.

21
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,242
We're going to add a new file here.

22
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:10,376
I'm going to drop in the name of the file.

23
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:14,566
Note here that the prefix of the file name has a timestamp.

24
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:17,435
Let's paste in the database changelog.

25
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:21,543
This changelog defines the table and columns for patient data.

26
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:25,999
Note that these columns directly map to the PatientEntity JPA entity class

27
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:29,692
that we created in the previous section in the course.

28
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:34,393
Next, I need to add this file path to the master changelog.

29
00:01:34,393 --> 00:01:36,779
Let's open up the master.

30
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:38,210
xml file now.

31
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,387
I'm going to drop in the path to the file that we just created.

32
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:48,136
Finally, let's run the application to assure that Liquibase started correctly.

33
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:51,209
We see here that the server started.

34
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,843
Now let's open up a browser.

35
00:01:53,843 --> 00:02:01,127
I've once again navigated to the H2 Console at the URL localhost:8080/console.

36
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:01,417
Again,

37
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,031
use the settings that were used previously when we

38
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,582
looked at the console and click Connect,

39
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:13,024
and here we see on the left side of this form that we have our PATIENT table.

40
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:17,539
Let's expand it, and we see all of our patient columns.

41
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:25,000
This verifies that Liquibase loaded up our schema correctly and completes the demo.
