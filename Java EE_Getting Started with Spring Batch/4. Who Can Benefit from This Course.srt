1
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:05,449
There are two main profiles that this course targets.

2
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:05,797
First,

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,927
this course is mainly geared at developers looking to

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,763
leverage the Spring Batch framework.

5
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:11,135
Again,

6
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:14,942
you'll need to have working knowledge of the Java language and working knowledge

7
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:19,122
of the Spring Framework to get the most out of this course.

8
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:19,427
Second,

9
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:23,025
this course can be used by architects who are investigating how to

10
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:30,000
prototype Spring Batch for an implementation or who are just looking to learn more about the framework.
