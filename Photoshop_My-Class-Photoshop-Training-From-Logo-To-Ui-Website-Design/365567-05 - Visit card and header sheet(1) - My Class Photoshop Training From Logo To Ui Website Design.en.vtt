00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
hello to your guys.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.850
Hope you all be OK.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.950
I'm payment Sadeq Thes video.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.190
He's the third part of our education will be all enjoyed and use the last parts in this

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.990
video.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.580
We're going to create a reason core and a header sheet for our imaginary company.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.750
As you see,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.140
I designed a to face visit corn and a header sheet for our imaginary company.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.920
Okay,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.020
I've done it before.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.560
Actually,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.420
I said my own name on it.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.180
P s,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.650
I mean payment sadhu.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.450
And that little PS is the contraction all photo shop.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.740
Okay.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:49.130
Should use both illustrator and for the shop software to design them.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.250
And like as we did before,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.220
uh,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.430
we should sort our work in illustrator software to design it in there.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.650
Onda completed in for the shops after their own affairs.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.770
Designed it in illustrator,

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.100
then complete.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.050
Eat in for the shop software.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.950
Okay,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.580
let me tell you some points.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.490
As you see,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.050
the reason card has a crease style crystal low mood is increased.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.650
Olmert,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.080
uh,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.320
you can create it manually and finish off software,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870
and it's a little defeat.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.250
Cool.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.580
So it's a complicated,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.860
but no matter you can did.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.580
I'm sure that you can do Onda actually indeed see me automatically and somehow quickly

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.900
Illustrator software.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.530
And we choose to work on these part in illustrator software.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.730
We're going to work on eating less serious often.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.950
And actually we got the same shape here as c Ah,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.270
see?

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.540
Yes.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.250
And we'll designing the other patters on guy comes in for the shelf software.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.870
So let's just start our work in a lawsuit.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.680
Illustration.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.750
Software Sorry.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.410
Uh,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.350
now you're going to design those crystals in illustrator software.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.940
We need to have some patterns to Denise.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.870
You can create them now or after you created the crease souls.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.940
There is no difference.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.180
It's just work on the crease stalls for now.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.890
And then we'll work on the colored patterns.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.750
As you see we have a political shape here.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.550
Yes,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.490
it's like Hegseth again.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.210
Yes,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.450
a hexagon shape,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.290
but it is bored.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.880
Kassid.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.750
I select pen tool in illustrator software to design the intended shape.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.040
See,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.200
it's desirable.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.750
Design it in the way you like.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.790
Actually,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.170
it's not regular.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.770
I said it here.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.340
Okay,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.350
this desirable?

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.780
Actually,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.330
as I said,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.740
uh,

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.950
okay,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.330
I said it year.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.150
Now we should set the color off the shape.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.630
And then I mean,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.280
we should call it,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.080
and then we should set a stroke for it.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.870
I mean,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.550
a set a border around it,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.740
but it we can color it from here in Australia just after we can do sling the in ear color.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.880
By these option,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.960
I mean feel aches.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.660
And by clicking on this,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.260
I can,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.640
uh we can manage coloring process on Stroup with these options.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.130
I mean,

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.990
suit X.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.410
We can double click on this to set a caller for it,

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.980
or we can color it by selecting collar.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.090
Uh,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.610
my selecting color polity s polit from here.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.900
And I said it here before,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.230
so I can black it from here.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.850
Yes,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.560
just like these.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.170
We created a black stroke around our shape.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.850
Well,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:21.250
we should use a line tool to create the crease souls and triangles.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.070
Actually,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.450
we should match the corners to each partner in so four.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.450
We feel that we're doing well.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.020
Yes,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.540
Until you feel that you're doing well,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.110
you have to match the corners with each order.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.110
I messed this corner with these.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.310
Phone these phone with this one.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.080
Well,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.260
now okay,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:11.450
the small Okay,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.750
Now we have a combination of lines and our basic shape here.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.240
Yes,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.410
and we must merge.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:31.350
Actually was merged them with each order and turned them into board Cassidy triangles.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.850
Okay,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.620
You select all of these.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.440
Object,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.610
and then we'll step on the sport.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.580
As you know,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.220
I'm using a 2018 version of the software.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.150
The last Russian was like the spa,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.650
but the new one is better.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.750
Actually,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:57.870
we had to choose a Pathfinder in window mania to select are desirable,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.600
Aiken.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.330
Actually,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.300
uh,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.850
we had to choose divide Aiken from here.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.640
If you use,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.420
uh,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.680
the last version,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.370
you have to do these.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.070
Okay?

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.650
Actually,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.080
this way is used for the last region.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.400
But if you use a newer version,

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.630
you can use the panel easily.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.360
From here,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360
we can click on these.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.020
Three points were here.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.410
Then we'll select divide Aiken.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.950
Now we have emerged and sliced object,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.550
and we can press shift control g to get it out of the good mood.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.410
Yes.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.440
Use shift control G to get it out of the group mud.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.750
And now you can separate its shape from each other,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.270
separate the shapes from charter.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.600
Actually,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:02.570
those lines which we created turned to spatial political shapes by these ship on.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.060
Actually,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.010
we can color them,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.210
sir.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.350
Prayed Lisa.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.780
Uh,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.690
now I need to call her the object.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.130
Like as I d eating for the shelf software.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.950
Now it's time to create our color patterns.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.680
We should select a rectangle tool to design a score.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.750
Lively's gay,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.650
or you can create any other shape.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.590
But see,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.330
remember that we need a color pattern.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:40.140
I take a copy of these by pressing old t Keep pressing on old key to take a copy,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.640
not to take to cope.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.650
Ease of it.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.650
Okay,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.020
well,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.290
now I have three Oscars to create my color patrons.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.160
Yes,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.850
I can create my color patterns on them.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.060
At the first,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.450
I activate the feel I can to select it for coloring on the squares.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.600
You can select the stroke.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.100
Aiken.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.650
Set your desirable color on this troops.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.390
I mean,

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.240
on the borders,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.890
if you want.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.860
Now,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.450
I should activate Grandjean mania.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.150
Yes.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.950
Ah,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.920
As you see,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.300
the sees this set off my menu.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.000
Actually,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.950
you can change the layout.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.170
Uh,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.920
desirable.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.710
You can activate it from here from the window menu.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.050
Okay,

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:39.400
so set a linear style.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:39.990
Fareed.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.920
Mm.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.050
said Linear style.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.480
I just need one of them.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.280
Uh,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.050
okay.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:57.580
You can change the color of object by setting color on each of these two palettes day.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:04.040
Yes.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.600
As I said,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.350
you can change the color of object by setting color on each of these two palettes.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.230
And you can change the color mood,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.730
uh,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.270
off the colder by these menu.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.060
But,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.050
uh,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.280
what should you do if you use the last version?

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.000
See other first?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.600
As you know,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.120
uh,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.990
we got Grady in many here I said it as linear and by double click,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.290
see,

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.550
And by a double click on each pallet,

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.590
we can change the color mint.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.620
Actually,

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.540
the color mint is grayscale.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.050
It means it is monochrome somehow.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.950
Yes.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.300
Ah,

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.230
Wish it set.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.910
Uh,

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:59.450
should select RG b or C M y que as color mitt.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.630
Okay.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.870
Actually,

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.230
we must sit up.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.390
C n y que Because we want to paint,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.050
Actually.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.370
Sorry.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.430
We want Prange.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:16.280
Our project and the printer machines followed a C and like a rule,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.560
I mean order,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.050
uh or somehow color system.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:25.740
It's better to say printing machines followed a scene.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.250
Why can call her system,

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.880
But if you don't want to print it.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.100
You can set it as RGB.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.080
You can set RGB as the government.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.890
I said it has seen Y K.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:45.850
You can use the prepared collars on the's or sit number for each handle to call her the

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.300
shape.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.950
I set up a sign handle as 100.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.290
Let me show you completely.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.330
See,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:02.050
it's white because old handles or zero or set as zero.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.220
You said the mole as 100.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.050
The shape will be absolute dork.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.460
Yes,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.440
I convert them.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:24.770
C C Is the contraction off saying If you set it up as 100 it will somehow give us a sky

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:25.700
blue collar.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.150
And it will be like this when you increase the handle of magenta.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.530
When you increase the yellow handle,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.130
you'll reach a nice yellow color.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.850
And by increasing this one,

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.440
you'll reach an absolute door color.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.760
I mean,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.450
really small.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.790
At the first,

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:51.210
we should set up a C handle as 100.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.270
And if you want to do our Kate,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.250
just increase the handle of magenta,

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.470
see whatever you increase this whatever you increased the handle,

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.980
the shape will be door occur.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.940
And I mean,

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.220
whatever you increase the handle of magenta,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.140
magenta,

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.300
The shape will be darker.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.490
And I set it up as 70.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:11.950
Okay,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.990
on.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.370
And we should do the same work for the white part two.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.450
Ah,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:23.700
change it into C and y que set it up as 100.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.590
And actually,

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.630
these desirable.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.850
I set up the magenta as 20%.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.450
I set up 20% Faried.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.170
Well,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.070
uh,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.160
as you see,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:53.800
I set the color pattern from here and here we can delete them and take two copies off the

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.470
swan.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.720
And then we can change the color mood to RGB.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.490
And actually,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.620
we change the colors to,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:02.730
for example,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.090
we can change it to 40 and we can set it up as zero.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.030
Mm,

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.620
a C.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.050
It's lighter now.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.250
Yeah,

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.960
and even we can dark the next phone.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.700
100 and 70.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.380
Okay,

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.720
set up call,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.580
handle as 20.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.450
Let's just sit up.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:30.870
Why?

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.400
Handless?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.360
40 And no need to change car handle in these pallets.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:35.840
Okay?

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.440
And we designed 1/3 color pattern.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.230
As you see all of them have the stroke.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:50.160
I click on this truck in the sport and then I'll select none icon to delayed it.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.060
Well,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.510
let me check it.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.440
Okay.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.670
You can select each part by move tool,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.840
impress I to activate your color selection tool.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.860
Okay,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.420
let me show you.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:14.450
Select them by moved to impress I to activate your color selection tool.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:19.170
And it's enough to,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:19.850
uh,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.740
click on one off the patterns.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.760
Click on one of the patterns I choose the 1st 1 just become one of them.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.120
Then press three to activate,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.430
move,

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.790
tool,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.650
and select the next port.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.550
It resuming to concentrate Maurin my work.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.350
I select these and then press I.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:48.450
Then I choose the 2nd 1 for eat.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.950
I use the third pattern of the sport.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.470
Yeah,

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:00.660
and I used the first bone on least court.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.930
Yeah,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:15.660
you can drag your mouse from outside of shape to select these two parts and keep pressing

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.610
on shift key.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:26.090
Then click on the dark one to reach these and then cholera eat by one of the patrons.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.350
This one is okay.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.200
So,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:38.140
like this one by you re key and use I t to color it.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.750
Okay.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:16:06.500
Okay.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.610
We colored all the parts.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.510
As you see,

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.200
each one has a special color.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.600
I mean,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.880
the object has different parts,

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.950
but some parts are not suitable.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.530
I mean,

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.270
they're not somehow desirable.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:20.770
Actually,

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.100
the gradient is not good enough.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:32.070
Somehow Likas these parts we should click on a poli ah Hedren shape to change the angle of

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:37.000
grey aliens now selected Grandjean tool from here.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.970
See,

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:39.690
from here,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.780
it appears a line here.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:52.070
But as you see these signs shoes that we can't do anything and it's because all that,

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.180
uh,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.750
we chose is true.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.290
I come before,

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:56.960
remember,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.660
So we kill icon feel Aiken.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.190
And as you see,

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:09.600
we can increase or decrease the line to change shape with our mouse.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.480
Okay,

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:20.750
Kill you can feel in order to activate it and to see we can increase or decrease the line

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.090
or to change shape either mouse.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:29.870
See?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:36.270
Okay.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:46.430
I asked you rate v tool again to select another Poli Hedren.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.520
Uh,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.360
then I press g key to activate Graddy in two.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.660
And then we should use the best,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.020
uh,

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.350
form Which keys is a beautiful shape.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.830
Okay,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.350
well,

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:08.540
I used Gene to work of these two.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:22.690
Okay?

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.160
I have fixed him.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.240
No need to do anything.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:35.430
If you want a state them together or if you want to say prayed them from charter by borders

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.430
.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.280
Actually,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:44.430
you can separate or change the size off each port manually.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.490
Or you can select a love them,

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:54.900
select the mole and click on his truth to create the white border between all the parts by

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.850
these Aiken.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.400
Or actually,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:07.710
you can double click on color palette to set a light on the borders,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.890
not to show them off a lot.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.350
Do not to show them off a lot.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.540
Uh,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:22.060
like these even weaken dark it more and see even you can increase or decrease the stroke.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.660
As you see,

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.880
uh,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.450
supports the borders.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:34.470
Has Arrowhead other first we should a teeny ate the borders,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.590
dear.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:40.750
So think you can many district on the's panel,

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.570
for example,

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:50.440
sited up as 0.5 from here sited up as 0.5,

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.450
I think it is OK right now,

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.610
Yeah,

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:58.050
click on the souk and if you sell it Ah,

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.880
the first icon.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.550
This suit goes to the middle of shape.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:12.220
The second shifts it to the inside and the third mourn moves it to the outside and we don't

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.020
need this one.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:19.180
So we select the 2nd 1 to set the border inside to remove those additional parts.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:19.710
Well,

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:25.550
so we can set up the stroke as 0.25 to 88.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.770
It's more.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.290
I mean,

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.140
make it more sin.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.380
Uh,

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.500
make it more sin.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.450
Start human.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.790
Ah,

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.940
we're if you don't need this stroke.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.980
See you guys if you don't need to,

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.620
Suk,

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.950
uh,

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.350
it's enough to set it up as none like these.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.810
Now it's like the main model.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:58.390
You can select a pen tool to design these single shapes.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:07.890
You can create some triangles or even some poli gunnels is project where you can take Kobe

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:13.100
of these shapes by pressing all t to use them.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.740
Actually,

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:22.020
we can unify them and rotate them somehow.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.350
It's like a fracture.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:30.950
We can unify these parts and separated like these.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.270
Actually,

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.790
these processes up to you and it's desirable.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.770
We can use arrow teas to separate them from each other or modified him.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:41.410
Somehow,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:46.510
these parts are going to create these object.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.240
Yes,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.450
they're going to create these object,

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.690
take a copia of these little one again and irritated.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.180
And the form it Yes,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.720
actually do it in order to defend it from the previous one.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.610
We can bring this one here and unify it or teach.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.760
It's OK.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.060
Actually,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:14.760
it's the general form.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.570
And,

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.310
uh,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.770
C can increase or decrease the senses.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.650
Actually,

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.520
this is our main model,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.770
and see,

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.990
it's just important to learn how to design it.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.140
As you know,

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.660
we created some lines and match them together.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.070
Then we merge them and got them.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.970
Adul that group mud.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:38.740
Actually,

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.220
we designed three color patterns.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.190
Uh,

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.730
say gain three colored patterns.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.690
Uh,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.900
you can use your desire with colors,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:56.050
and actually you can call her each port with each pattern.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:04.250
Then we clicked on Phil Icon to use gradient tool in order to set a desire were angle for

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.110
each port.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.760
And finally we created these object.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.200
Yes,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.660
see?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.800
And finally,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.550
we created these object in the next port.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:25.950
We'll work on the other parts off our header sheets and raise it court.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.460
Actually,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.150
we'll work on the sighs,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.250
designing the patterns.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.450
Designing the Aikens will work on the capacities,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.230
and we'll work on them in for the shelf.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.050
Softer.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.120
Uh,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.720
so just be
