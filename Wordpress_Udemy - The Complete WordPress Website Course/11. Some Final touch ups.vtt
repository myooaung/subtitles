So more design options will be available in the pill version.

05:49.980 --> 05:53.100
This is not recommended for two by a provision.

05:53.090 --> 05:53.560
OK.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.080
And then you can add something like.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.210
Hear more about what you offer what you not offer.

05:58.350 --> 06:00.880
OK so this at

06:04.320 --> 06:05.740
smart packaging

06:11.020 --> 06:13.070
and that I want to add here.

06:18.230 --> 06:19.010
Custom

06:23.000 --> 06:28.800
custom officer support and Clarins

06:32.220 --> 06:33.440
custom officer support.

06:33.570 --> 06:34.870
OK.

06:36.170 --> 06:37.660
And here you can add anything.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.530
So this is basically a hardware company.

06:39.530 --> 06:44.630
Those who ship so they can give the custom officer Sipple how to clear your products from custom and

06:44.630 --> 06:45.400
something like that.

06:45.650 --> 06:48.860
If their products get stuck in that so you can add one more thing.

06:48.860 --> 06:51.990
And if you want to add one you can just come here and then you can add it.

06:52.180 --> 06:52.460
Hey

06:57.330 --> 07:04.730
now if I just come here you can see that I can add one like this but I don't need it so I'll just say

07:04.730 --> 07:05.160
I'm here.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.720
I'll just get this.

07:06.830 --> 07:09.670
Just leave it a few things we recreate at.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.100
So we create these things.

07:11.240 --> 07:11.750
OK.

07:11.750 --> 07:15.170
We go down and then we have the case study and something like that.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.360
So let's say that if you don't want this whole team.

07:19.460 --> 07:22.600
OK you want your home base to be the perfect or normal.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.470
So what you will do will publish.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.160
OK.

07:27.340 --> 07:33.130
And then what you have to do you have to go to the front page the Tastee.

07:33.610 --> 07:37.600
So you have to hit it OK.

07:37.740 --> 07:43.340
And then what you have to do you basically have to come here and you have to get at it for a mentor

07:43.350 --> 07:45.600
and you have to remove every time from here.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.920
So then you'll remove everything from here and you'll hit at that elementary then you get obviously

07:51.250 --> 07:53.250
added this whole page and

07:55.740 --> 07:59.760
customize your element tour bit belowdecks OK.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.200
You cannot edit this basically.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.800
I just hate it because this team cannot let me do that.

08:05.910 --> 08:06.380
OK.

08:07.260 --> 08:09.470
So I can change this as well if I want to.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.250
Might not do it perfectly.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.210
So what I'm going to do.

08:19.370 --> 08:22.130
OK here we have the page Condon's section.

08:22.130 --> 08:25.690
You can see that we have so many pages content in a pro version.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.660
I would not recommend you to buy this.

08:28.010 --> 08:29.490
OK.

08:29.630 --> 08:32.340
Now we're totally done with our website.

08:32.530 --> 08:38.420
OK you guys already know that how you can design it how you can customize it completely if you want

08:38.420 --> 08:42.560
to you can customize this home page from the section you have to just selected.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.350
It's going to come here.

08:43.370 --> 08:46.640
And indeed you have to click here and then you have to change it so if you want to change an image you

08:46.640 --> 08:50.150
can also change an image if you want to completely remove anything.

08:50.270 --> 08:51.340
You can just come here.

08:51.500 --> 08:55.600
And so if I am editing this one OK I'm just going to I'm here and I'm going to hit delete.

08:55.610 --> 08:59.810
And that's this is deleted so this is how you can completely manager.

08:59.810 --> 09:02.180
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

09:02.180 --> 09:06.700
And let's go ahead and let's hit publish and let's have a look at a Web site that we created.

09:06.740 --> 09:10.030
So this is how our Web site is looking.

09:10.300 --> 09:10.810
OK.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.430
I want to go to the visit site.

09:12.860 --> 09:17.210
And you can see this is how my day is looking if I just click to about us it's going to take me to the

09:17.300 --> 09:18.250
About Us page.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.220
That is the page that we have designed and created.

09:21.290 --> 09:23.840
And you can see that this is already looking amazing.

09:23.900 --> 09:30.290
And if I just go to the contact us or get get a coat you can see it is taking me to conduct page where

09:30.320 --> 09:34.240
I have to enter my name email and it takes to have a coffee with us.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.600
So I have everything right here.

09:36.640 --> 09:40.160
I go down I go down and there we go you have this what we do.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.570
And if I just click this it's going to take me to the contact display to get to this is how basically

09:44.570 --> 09:48.030
this works and if I just move down this logo is also changing.

09:48.190 --> 09:53.090
So I guess we're watching this we are now totally done with what say you have to just do a project you

09:53.090 --> 09:55.390
have to submit this saying hey to me.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.530
