WEBVTT

00:00.680 --> 00:04.930
What does a guy who's in want KMAX now and just when you were going to be working with this film we

00:04.930 --> 00:08.630
have to have a farm and then we have to add a map a map.

00:08.630 --> 00:09.010
OK.

00:09.110 --> 00:13.070
So first of all what we have to do we have to just skim here to the model settings OK and then we need

00:13.070 --> 00:15.960
to give some bedding so that it's aligned to the normal one.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.760
So I'm going to go to the design right here and I'm going to give you the spacing.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.410
Let's see that how much spacing we need.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.750
So let's add 50 pixels 50 pixels is very large.

00:24.770 --> 00:26.580
I'm going to go to 45.

00:27.350 --> 00:29.610
So I think 45 pixels looks cool.

00:29.690 --> 00:33.000
So you can see now everything is a line from.

00:33.050 --> 00:33.920
This is a line to this.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.740
This is a line to this.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.020
And this is a line to this.

00:36.020 --> 00:36.760
OK.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.320
Now here I want to add this.

00:38.330 --> 00:38.710
OK.

00:38.720 --> 00:42.730
But first let's get him here and let's remove this link that has been added here.

00:42.800 --> 00:49.730
So I'm going to come here I'm going to select here and here let's click here and let's click here Soledad.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.060
This link is removed.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.070
OK.

00:54.590 --> 00:54.890
Let's see it.

00:54.900 --> 00:55.710
OK.

00:55.770 --> 01:00.150
And lotted to us so you can see that link is removed from here.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.480
I'm going to come here and I'm going to add a form re here below.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.380
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to click this contact form.

01:06.390 --> 01:09.230
You can see this form is coming right here.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.000
What I want to do right now I want to just sit OK.

01:12.090 --> 01:14.750
And I want to just bring this divider to the top.

01:14.980 --> 01:15.350
OK.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.310
So this divider is right here.

01:17.340 --> 01:19.640
Now we have to work with this form right here.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.790
So we have the title right here if you want to add a title you can add a title but we don't want to

01:23.820 --> 01:24.510
add title.

01:24.510 --> 01:28.890
So the success message would be after the form and form submit.

01:28.890 --> 01:33.610
You can see if you click here type the message you want to display after a successful form submission.

01:34.130 --> 01:35.100
OK.

01:36.700 --> 01:42.940
Thanks for your message.

01:43.270 --> 01:51.270
You will get a call by one of our reporters in

01:55.360 --> 02:01.900
tade divs within two business days.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.480
OK.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.310
And then we have the Submit text button.

02:05.380 --> 02:05.850
OK.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.340
And everything looks cool.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.130
Here we have the name The e-mail address and the message as well.

02:11.140 --> 02:11.580
OK.

02:11.650 --> 02:15.760
So here what we have to do we have to just come here to the e-mail itself.

02:15.760 --> 02:21.120
And then here we have to enter that e-mail in the e-mail address where the message should be sent.

02:21.130 --> 02:21.520
OK.

02:21.640 --> 02:25.780
So we have to enter that e-mail where the message should be sent.

02:25.780 --> 02:31.210
I'm going to enter my e-mail address that is going to be this one.

02:31.350 --> 02:31.760
OK.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.110
And the message patter.

02:33.150 --> 02:35.910
So Kim here and let's see what it is.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.970
Here you can define the custom pattern for the e-mail message field should be included in the format

02:41.970 --> 02:42.720
field ID.

02:42.720 --> 02:49.530
For example if you want to include the field ID is equal say phone and field and field IDs equals a

02:49.530 --> 02:51.730
message then you can use leave blank for default.

02:51.870 --> 02:57.320
I would highly recommend you to use leave blank because why you want to just customize it customized

02:57.480 --> 02:59.210
a message you can understand it easily.

02:59.340 --> 03:02.850
OK let's see him here and let's get me here to the elements.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.360
So we have the display capture.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.940
This is really important because you have to display it.

03:07.110 --> 03:11.630
If you just uncheck it from a pier make sure to add that because this is really very important.

03:11.640 --> 03:16.950
Otherwise you will receive so many spam emails and they will spam you say they will slow down your server

03:16.980 --> 03:19.520
and something like that to make sure to add that's OK.

03:19.530 --> 03:22.610
And then we have the redirect and redirect humoral.

03:22.650 --> 03:27.010
This will happen if someone clicks here he will be redirected to a page where we don't want to redirect

03:27.010 --> 03:27.790
them to eBay.

03:27.810 --> 03:29.200
We just wanted to show them a message.

03:29.220 --> 03:29.800
OK.

03:29.850 --> 03:30.690
And this is like this.

03:30.690 --> 03:32.020
OK let me just confirm it.

03:33.070 --> 03:33.810
Yes.

03:33.980 --> 03:38.050
Then we have to backtrack and say if you want to add any background color you can pretty well add it

03:41.280 --> 03:42.280
but I don't want to add it.

03:42.300 --> 03:46.950
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit delete and then we have the Edmon label so leave this

03:47.040 --> 03:47.820
as it does.

03:47.910 --> 03:48.280
OK.

03:48.330 --> 03:52.370
And they'll come here to these settings right here.

03:52.410 --> 03:58.820
They say the name of the e-mail and the message and we can also add one more and this will be this going

03:58.820 --> 04:01.300
to be field via options.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.630
And then we have this conditional logic and everything.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.420
So let's come here to the field ID.

04:05.430 --> 04:07.640
So here we have to enter the unique fields.

04:07.650 --> 04:11.340
You should only use English correctors but those special characters and spaces.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.640
This is going to be fun.

04:12.930 --> 04:13.500
OK.

04:13.500 --> 04:23.610
And here my title is phone number OK and I want to go here to the feel option.

04:23.630 --> 04:30.000
This is going to be input field email field text area check boxes radio buttons.

04:30.360 --> 04:30.980
Like drop down.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.280
So this is going to be an input field.

04:33.410 --> 04:33.950
OK.

04:33.950 --> 04:38.370
And we can select the maximum length that how much maximum length we want here.

04:38.390 --> 04:40.430
So this can be the maximum like

04:45.530 --> 04:46.900
9000 or 28 thing

04:51.060 --> 04:51.900
OK.

04:52.220 --> 04:59.580
Maximum I think 15 that will be on that because no number is created than the 15.

04:59.920 --> 05:09.030
So then we have the maximum length of leaves you are to remove restrictions OK now here if I just try

05:09.030 --> 05:15.960
to add here you will see that I cannot go beyond the 15 that we have the allowed symbols so we just

05:15.960 --> 05:19.210
wanted the numbers only so only numbers are allowed.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.090
Yes.

05:24.270 --> 05:24.600
OK.

05:24.630 --> 05:27.180
This is a required field and the condition of logic.

05:27.180 --> 05:32.790
So you can condition conditional logic get that email address should be entered then this will appear.

05:32.820 --> 05:35.800
Otherwise this will not appear so let's just give here.

05:35.940 --> 05:44.880
If I just add the new rules an email address equals email address contains email address is not empty.

05:44.900 --> 05:51.650
Email address is empty email address if e-mail address is not empty.

05:51.690 --> 05:53.700
Then this will appear otherwise.

05:53.790 --> 05:54.940
This will not appear so.

05:54.950 --> 05:56.340
This is how you can cheat.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.140
Check these rules.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.040
OK now what I'm going to do.

05:59.040 --> 06:03.250
I'm just going to bring a thius right about.

06:04.410 --> 06:06.220
OK here we go.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.980
So you can see that this is how our form is looking.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.010
OK our farmers looking totally ok.

06:12.030 --> 06:15.320
I'm just going to go to the design and knowledge designer.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.580
So this should be totally OK but we need to change the button so we need to change the style for the

06:20.580 --> 06:20.880
button.

06:20.880 --> 06:26.350
I'm going to go down and I want to change the border of this button.

06:28.830 --> 06:35.740
An icon color button border color.

06:35.900 --> 06:44.850
I want it to be this one and the bird and text colors should also be changed.

06:45.180 --> 06:47.930
I want the icons so lets use an icon for this

06:54.490 --> 06:56.750
since we are see how have fit in here.

06:56.760 --> 06:57.670
Get a call.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.890
I think we should add a phone here.

07:04.620 --> 07:05.120
Cool.

07:05.380 --> 07:08.690
OK now you can see everything looks amazing right here.

07:08.760 --> 07:13.460
Everything is looking perfect if I just came here and I just save.

07:13.660 --> 07:17.160
You can see this is now totally safe.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.780
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit exit.

07:18.810 --> 07:24.180
The visual builder Let's see how our page looks so you can see this is our pages looking we have everything

07:24.180 --> 07:25.470
coming right here.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.740
This is if I just enter anything I just enter thing

07:32.520 --> 07:33.360
and then I go down.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.550
You can see the phone number is right here.

07:35.550 --> 07:37.390
So this is validating that you are dead.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.130
The email address should be here.

07:39.210 --> 07:40.610
Then the phone number will be here.

07:40.620 --> 07:50.010
OK so I'm just going to enter anything where I hear and to enter the message an A-plus for April to

07:50.140 --> 07:53.070
8 9 10 11 12 12.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.190
OK and I'm going to hit submit.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.990
So you can see we have only allowed.

07:59.320 --> 07:59.680
Please.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.490
Only numbers are allowed and the maximum correctors is 15.

08:02.490 --> 08:03.850
So let's add only numbers.

08:03.850 --> 08:14.630
OK I don't think we have 15 characters.

08:14.770 --> 08:15.840
This is the minimum lint.

08:15.850 --> 08:18.540
OK OK OK I have to just change it.

08:18.550 --> 08:20.010
OK I'll change it later on.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.180
I have to enter a minimum 15 characters.

08:22.180 --> 08:25.880
OK let's add some men and let's see how this is going to look.

08:26.050 --> 08:27.220
So here you can see.

08:27.220 --> 08:28.140
Thanks for your message.

08:28.180 --> 08:31.180
You will get a call by one of 5 Representatives.

08:31.270 --> 08:33.090
Into business day so this is working.

08:33.090 --> 08:38.890
The farm has been sent and if I just go to the G.M. dot com to see if I have received that email then

08:38.890 --> 08:40.780
he will see that I would have received the email

08:43.690 --> 08:48.100
OK I'm going to go to the spammers here and you can see this is right here.

08:48.100 --> 08:52.360
So this is the name from the e-mail address is coming and new message and next story events.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.580
This is the name.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.290
This is the phone number and everything.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.330
So this is the message and then this is the phone number.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.330
This is how it is working.

08:58.510 --> 08:59.140
OK.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.140
And now here it is how it is working.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.170
So I'm going to come here again.

09:03.190 --> 09:06.940
I'm going to hit this camera here so to I so I can manage it.

09:07.030 --> 09:10.950
I'm going to go from here to the e-mail address and I'm going to go to the field.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.610
Options to conditional logic.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.210
The field option specifically.

09:14.530 --> 09:14.790
OK.

09:14.830 --> 09:16.620
We have to work for the phone number.

09:16.630 --> 09:18.410
So I'm going to come here to the phone right here.

09:18.610 --> 09:19.220
Let's get him here.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.930
Let's get to the feel option and the minimum lent should be zero.

09:22.030 --> 09:22.560
OK.

09:22.570 --> 09:26.500
The maximum land can be 15.

09:26.740 --> 09:27.600
So here we go.

09:27.700 --> 09:33.730
And the numbers should be so to all because if someone wants to add the plus sign he can add the plus

09:33.730 --> 09:34.200
sign.

09:34.360 --> 09:34.750
OK.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.860
And that we have the relation on

09:40.460 --> 09:41.480
let's sleeted

09:44.240 --> 09:48.650
OK let's remove the conditional logic because we don't want to show any conditional logic.

09:48.740 --> 09:50.290
Everything should be visible.

09:50.420 --> 09:56.420
OK so you can see that we have the phone phone number and that signing is also totally OK so if you

09:56.420 --> 09:58.240
want to change anything you can make.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.270
You can change it.

09:59.420 --> 09:59.930
OK.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.940
You can make it full with if you want to.

10:02.110 --> 10:03.850
And you can make it to normal if you want to.

10:03.860 --> 10:06.710
And then you can share one more thing so you can show

10:10.340 --> 10:11.820
you're like to go to the design.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.510
Let's just bring in tray here.

10:13.550 --> 10:18.530
Let's go to the condensate here and let's bring this to the top three here so you can see this is coming

10:18.530 --> 10:20.240
right here and I'm going to change this.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.110
I'm going to come here.

10:21.230 --> 10:22.440
I'm going to go to the design.

10:22.470 --> 10:22.940
Al sorry.

10:22.940 --> 10:27.660
I'm going to go to the con then the field is going to be the USA.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.820
B U S I N E is s.

10:30.070 --> 10:30.590
OK.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.640
And then here would be

10:35.220 --> 10:35.690
cool.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.750
So business name if you are creating a business based Web site.

10:38.910 --> 10:43.680
But since I am just creating a normal web site this is for Event Management things so if I need to the

10:43.680 --> 10:44.300
business.

10:44.490 --> 10:47.920
So I'm going to come here to the phone right here and I'm going to make it full of it.

10:47.970 --> 10:53.500
Let's go to the advance design layout and make it full with so you can see this is how it is coming.

10:53.730 --> 11:00.180
So now we are totally done with everything you can see everything is totally up and running.

11:00.210 --> 11:02.710
The disk form is also sending that e-mail.

11:02.710 --> 11:06.430
So now let's go ahead and let's add a map right below here.

11:06.450 --> 11:10.280
So I'm going to I'm here I'm just going to click this camera here and here it takes to regler.

11:10.440 --> 11:15.870
So now I hope that you guys understand that speciality and Regel are between the different.

11:15.870 --> 11:23.040
I'm going to add the full width and now I need the full length map.

11:23.070 --> 11:23.800
Here we go.

11:24.130 --> 11:27.960
I need to come here to the map and I need to enter the API key.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.410
Google API key.

11:29.670 --> 11:34.700
You have to just click this question mark and then you have to hit this or that it takes you to that.

11:35.010 --> 11:36.910
Learn how to create your API key.

11:37.020 --> 11:41.790
So you have to click here and it will take you to a new page where it will tell you how very you can

11:41.790 --> 11:45.930
create an API so you have to go to the Google developers.

11:46.010 --> 11:46.420
OK.

11:46.590 --> 11:48.410
And then it will take you to them.

11:48.480 --> 11:56.240
And then here you have to enable the API fetching the API details and we have to select a project I'm

11:56.240 --> 11:58.000
going to select.

12:01.770 --> 12:02.180
OK.

12:02.370 --> 12:07.310
So you have to basically have two options either create a project so let's leave this here to continue

12:07.360 --> 12:09.490
it is creating a new project OK.

12:09.610 --> 12:15.420
It will take you to them and then you have to enter your details and your project will be created.

12:15.420 --> 12:15.980
OK.

12:19.350 --> 12:21.180
So this is enabling the API.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.440
Let's wait till this enable the API and then we will get the API.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.800
We have to enter that there.

12:28.040 --> 12:28.790
So here we go.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.090
You can see this is the API key one.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.550
I mean dislike the

12:36.240 --> 12:36.600
Create

12:42.350 --> 12:43.520
this is the API key.

12:43.670 --> 12:49.070

12:58.370 --> 12:59.390
And let's face it.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.760
And now let's come here and see if changes.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.100
So here should be the APHC done.

13:05.110 --> 13:07.720
Now we have to enter the address so I'm going to come here.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.200
I'm going to enter the address.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.230
And lotted find.

13:12.410 --> 13:16.390
So it is going to find us address.

13:16.490 --> 13:21.370
Basically this is not fitting the APHC.

13:21.580 --> 13:28.670
I have to just go back and then I have to click here and now we have to hit save first.

13:28.690 --> 13:29.090
OK.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.530
Well is it safe.

13:31.020 --> 13:36.520
Let's refresh our page so that it works because we have just submitted the API key and now we have to

13:36.520 --> 13:39.330

13:39.360 --> 13:39.780

14:21.370 --> 14:23.110
So this is pointing to this.

14:23.280 --> 14:27.370
You can change its location if you want to.
