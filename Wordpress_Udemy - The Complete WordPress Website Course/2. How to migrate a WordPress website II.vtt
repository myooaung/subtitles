00:00.580 --> 00:04.180
Hear what is up guys and welcome back so now in this video we will be working over the database.

00:04.180 --> 00:10.480
OK I'm going to show you how can you just import the database from your ph be my admin and then exported

00:10.480 --> 00:10.720
here.

00:10.720 --> 00:14.700
So what you have to do you have to just enter the BMI admin.

00:15.180 --> 00:15.620
OK.

00:15.820 --> 00:18.800
And then here you can see it full open here.

00:18.940 --> 00:23.830
So once this is opened you have to just basically come here to the WP.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.360
This is the database that we created.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.460
We didn't add anything here but you can see this is automatically added.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.650
What you have to do you have to just click export.

00:31.910 --> 00:32.440
OK.

00:32.500 --> 00:38.380
And on clicking a sport it is just going to open up a thing here and here which you have to do.

00:38.410 --> 00:41.990
You don't have to do anything here you just have to hit go.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.280
So this is going to export everything.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.710
Let's wait till this is done.

00:46.270 --> 00:49.290
And here is the blue dot as Cuil.

00:49.300 --> 00:54.880
Now what you have to do you have to just go to your see Battle of your website and then you have to

00:54.880 --> 01:00.550
go to my school databases so you have to basically create a new database and then you have to work with

01:00.550 --> 01:00.660
it.

01:00.670 --> 01:01.080
OK.

01:01.210 --> 01:06.190
And we will also create a user here a guy so you guys can understand it much easier.

01:06.190 --> 01:11.920
You have to create a new database so my database is going to be tansy on this core.

01:12.130 --> 01:15.040
And this has to be like W.P. OK.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.140
WP migrate so this is my basically my database name.

01:19.270 --> 01:19.840
OK.

01:20.210 --> 01:30.300
WP migrate or just the blue PM the WP is my new database name which is like this and this WP.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.060
This is my host gator username OK.

01:33.220 --> 01:38.300
I'm just going to go in and I'm going to create a database and this database is going to be created.

01:38.590 --> 01:42.050
Now here I'm going to go back.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.050
I'm sorry.

01:43.070 --> 01:43.370
OK.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.900
You can see that here I am.

01:44.930 --> 01:49.520
And now we have to assign a user here so you can see that this is a database that has been created.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.400
You must be seeing this only video.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.750
This only section.

01:52.910 --> 01:55.820
And now here I have to assign the user here.

01:56.030 --> 02:00.600
So I'm just going to go with I basically want to create a new user and that is going to be like WBM

02:00.670 --> 02:01.210
dialup.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.930
P. m. OK.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.170
And then I have to go ahead and create a password.

02:05.180 --> 02:07.970
So I basically have to use the password generator.

02:07.970 --> 02:09.830
So it's generated password.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.230
I have copied this password in a safe place.

02:12.260 --> 02:15.440
I'm going to copy all this and I'm going to paste it right here.

02:15.710 --> 02:16.130
OK.

02:16.340 --> 02:21.110
And this is basically my database password so you have to keep it safe.

02:21.170 --> 02:23.310
You just have to enter it and then you can forget it.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.460
Guys it doesn't matter.

02:25.470 --> 02:27.440
OK and then you have to use password.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.870
So this is right here.

02:30.260 --> 02:33.020
Now here I have to just click create user.

02:33.290 --> 02:36.950
OK so on just clicking to create user this user will be created.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.100
You can see it says you have successfully created a user.

02:42.110 --> 02:44.370
I'm just going to go with and I'm going to go back.

02:45.140 --> 02:45.580
OK.

02:45.740 --> 02:49.510
And you can see that the user has been created and it should be here.

02:49.580 --> 02:55.180
These are the users that are coming you can change your password you can rename them any here

02:59.370 --> 03:02.790
but in here it says I'm a privileged user.

03:02.800 --> 03:09.480
We haven't added any user to this database so we have to just come here and add a user to database.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.580
I'm going to select the user that we have created.

03:11.590 --> 03:12.970
So this should be the user.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.580
And this is the database that I want to assign.

03:15.580 --> 03:18.250
So this will be the user of the database.

03:18.370 --> 03:21.820
OK I have to just like add and this will be added here.

03:21.820 --> 03:25.530
I'm going to select all privileges and I'm going to hit make changes.

03:25.540 --> 03:32.140
So now you guys are going to see that this user vill be assigned to that database solist.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.450
Let me show you.

03:33.790 --> 03:36.990
If I just come here you can see a certain Z and the school W.P. them.

03:37.030 --> 03:42.580
And this is the privileged user what I have to do right now I just have to

03:47.330 --> 03:55.990
go back and I have to basically plug this control panel home so I can see that we have created a database

03:56.000 --> 04:01.640
we have assigned a user and now we have to log into the HP my admin so you can just open this up in

04:01.640 --> 04:02.300
a new type.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.610
And let's open up my Escuela database here as well because we need to copy some stuff.

04:06.620 --> 04:11.320
OK so now here you can see that ph be my admin is right here.

04:11.480 --> 04:17.570
What I have to do I have to open this up and here you must see this a user database that you have created.

04:17.630 --> 04:23.810
Now you have to hit import and on clicking import you can see it is right here you just have to drag

04:23.810 --> 04:29.750
the file that you have just upload it and you have to drop it so you can see this is being uploaded.

04:29.750 --> 04:34.640
And once this is uploaded and you have to just come here then and you have to refresh it.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.090
So let's just click here and you can see that all the database files are here.

04:39.620 --> 04:46.250
And now what we have to do is that we have to basically just work with the file manager.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.650
So I'm just going to go to the file manager.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.180
OK.

04:49.370 --> 04:52.970
And here you should see W.P. dash conflict.

04:53.150 --> 04:53.840
OK.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.560
Please pay attention to these guys because this is so important.

04:56.570 --> 04:59.660
You have to just open this up and you have to hit chord.

05:00.090 --> 05:00.560
OK.

05:00.590 --> 05:04.910
And unplugging the code added You have to just click edit right now so it's just going to open up a

05:04.910 --> 05:11.760
new window that will show up here and here it says the database name here it says the user name.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.850
And here take the password.

05:12.850 --> 05:15.730
Here it says to localhost and here it takes everything.

05:15.740 --> 05:23.240
So what I have to do I have to just skim here and my database name is basically just one.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.280
This is my database name.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.580
I'm going to copy this.

05:25.670 --> 05:28.130
I'm going to come here in the file manager.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.710
This file is W.P. dash config and I'm going to paste this database name.

05:32.870 --> 05:33.320
OK.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.720
So this is right here.

05:34.850 --> 05:37.160
Now here I have to enter the user name.

05:37.250 --> 05:43.280
So my user name was tansy let's just come here and here is the user name basically So I'm just going

05:43.290 --> 05:47.140
to go down and I'm going to copy the user name OK.

05:47.330 --> 05:52.650
Let's just get copy and let's come here to the file manager and let's paste it.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.210
You can see that user name is also here.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.530
And now what we have to do is that we have to enter the password.

05:58.530 --> 06:04.140
So this is the password that we created when we were just basically creating this user name didn't we

06:04.160 --> 06:06.560
use what we use the password generator.

06:06.660 --> 06:10.730
So we copied this password here in a new app I'm just going to come here.

06:10.950 --> 06:18.090
I'm going to copy this and I'm going to come here to this one and I have to paste it here so you can

06:18.090 --> 06:20.800
see that password is already here.

06:21.090 --> 06:25.270
And we have the hostname so you have to leave this localhost as it is.

06:25.270 --> 06:26.200
Guys OK.

06:26.370 --> 06:30.650
And now what we have to do is that we have to just go ahead and we have to hit save changes.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.380
So you can see it's a success.

06:35.490 --> 06:42.930
And now if you just come here and we will just hit you will see that this will not work but this error

06:42.960 --> 06:46.070
establishing a database connection will be gone.

06:46.080 --> 06:53.190
So this means that we have successfully assigned the database user to our website and database is totally

06:53.190 --> 06:53.730
up and running.

06:53.730 --> 06:57.030
We have to make some changes that we will be doing in the next video.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.220
So let's just come here and let's just refresh

07:03.800 --> 07:08.400
make sure that you come here and you just save the changes so that it should work OK.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.380
So you can see that it is not giving an error rate now now

07:15.220 --> 07:17.980
let's save the changes I hope the changes has been saved.

07:17.980 --> 07:23.380
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit close and let's get to here and let's just reload this so

07:23.380 --> 07:26.100
you can see that everything is working.

07:26.140 --> 07:31.580
Now what we have to do is that we have to just skim here to W.P. underscore users.

07:31.910 --> 07:32.510
OK.

07:32.620 --> 07:36.210
And then we have to come here and here it is.

07:36.750 --> 07:37.720
No no no no no.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.670
We have to go to W.P. underscore options.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.850
So here is the site you what it is.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.470
I basically have to change this.

07:44.470 --> 07:50.180
What I'm going to do I'm just going to double click here and here it is I'm going to copy my site.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.640
You are well from here.

07:51.850 --> 07:59.150
Let's just copy and let's come here and let's paste it.

07:59.790 --> 08:02.480
I don't know why the database is not still created.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.750
Let's come here to the Lupi dash conflict ph.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.980
B It is still giving the error.

08:08.130 --> 08:12.750
Let's just say code added And let's see if the database is already assigned to it.

08:14.540 --> 08:17.010
This is the database name that has the user name.

08:17.010 --> 08:18.720
This is the password.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.920
And then this is the localhost.

08:23.220 --> 08:24.590
Everything is totally up and running.

08:24.760 --> 08:29.370
OK let's come here and let's add the same exact thing to here as well.

08:29.370 --> 08:32.770
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to paste the exact word Al here.

08:33.020 --> 08:33.510
That's all.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.750
You just have to do this.

08:34.890 --> 08:39.120
And he can see that on just free freshening this it should work.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.140
If it doesn't work then we have to change the browser guys because there might be some caching issues

08:43.530 --> 08:44.870
that is doing this.

08:44.890 --> 08:48.930
OK let's just come here and let's open our website here into the Internet Explorer's.

08:48.940 --> 08:49.770
I'm just going to come here.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.520
I'm going to page that you are L..

08:51.750 --> 08:55.010
Alex refresh OK.

08:55.020 --> 08:58.700
I don't know why it is taking some time now.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.120
It is taking a lot of time.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.280
Let's just open up the Firefox Internet is already slow.

09:03.410 --> 09:07.620
You guys know that.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.200
Let's paste link.

09:09.660 --> 09:09.940
OK.

09:09.940 --> 09:18.430
This is still saying that after establishing a database connection it is giving the error because the

09:18.430 --> 09:20.400
database is still not created.

09:20.470 --> 09:22.820
We have to just skim here and we have to hit code at it.

09:22.840 --> 09:31.640
So I hope everything is working totally Mallet's see database password database user name database name

09:33.490 --> 09:38.900
and the localhost OK guys let's just come here and let's change the password.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.880
I think the password is doing some problems.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.270
I'm going to come here I'm going to change password and let's change the password to anything else so

09:45.600 --> 09:47.190
I'm going to enter a different password.

09:47.190 --> 09:53.760
Let's just add Q W E R.

09:54.700 --> 09:58.990
One 1 Three 3.

09:59.030 --> 10:03.270
Q Where do you 1 2 3 exclamation mark

10:08.000 --> 10:09.840
exclamation mark.

10:09.990 --> 10:14.360
Should save changes so you can see that I have successfully changed the user password.

10:14.600 --> 10:19.850
I'm going to come here and let's just come here and change the config file.

10:19.850 --> 10:23.490
So I'm going to add this q w e r t VI.

10:23.670 --> 10:25.960
One two three exclamation mark.

10:25.970 --> 10:26.420
OK.

10:26.570 --> 10:30.320
I'm going to come here and I'm going to say genius So this is my database password.

10:30.440 --> 10:30.960
OK.

10:31.070 --> 10:32.060
And now let's come here.

10:32.060 --> 10:35.280
Alatri fresher of say to see if it is running or not.

10:35.550 --> 10:35.770
OK.

10:35.780 --> 10:37.560
This is now running OK.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.580
I basically got the same thing.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.560
This was the password issue I think.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.480
I think we cheat it to be.

10:43.610 --> 10:47.450
Choose the wrong password or we just entered the wrong password.

10:47.450 --> 10:48.540
That is how it is working.

10:48.620 --> 10:51.100
But you can see that it is totally up and running.

10:51.110 --> 10:55.090
And this is the exact thing that is coming from here to the local host.

10:55.100 --> 11:00.140
If you just go to localhost slash W.P. then you can see this is the same.

11:00.230 --> 11:01.580
And this is also the same.

11:01.580 --> 11:07.880
So if I just open up the IF I JUST WANT TO GO TO THE LOG IN credentials of a WPA admin then you can

11:07.880 --> 11:15.940
see that on clicking this I can log into my website using the same username and the same password.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.280
OK.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.840
Luggin so you can see this is all running.

11:21.910 --> 11:24.550
You can see everything is totally up and running.

11:24.550 --> 11:30.350
I'll make sure guys make sure the guy has to go to the Lupi underscore options and change the you are

11:30.350 --> 11:32.730
l from here and here as well.

11:33.070 --> 11:36.700
And then your website will be totally up and running.

11:36.700 --> 11:40.840
So make sure to just implement this and then your website will be totally up and running so you can

11:40.840 --> 11:42.840
see everything is totally cool.

11:42.850 --> 11:43.920
Everything is running.

11:44.110 --> 11:50.740
And this is our data this is our whole WordPress that's has been migrated from local server to an online

11:50.740 --> 11:51.590
server.

11:52.060 --> 11:56.380
So say you guys and I hope that you understand everything.

11:56.380 --> 12:01.960
If there are still some confusions you can ask me and you to me forums or you can just relaunch this

12:01.960 --> 12:02.670
whole video.

12:02.770 --> 12:08.590
I know it is so confusing when we are doing it for the first time but when we do it and when we constantly

12:08.590 --> 12:10.340
do it we just are used to it.

12:10.360 --> 12:14.310
So they can see that it is totally up and running.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.110
So thanks a lot guys for watching this and I hope that you like this course.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.880
