00:00.720 --> 00:01.780
WHAT DOES IT guys it won't come back.

00:01.790 --> 00:04.020
So now here is the main part.

00:04.050 --> 00:05.290
That starts OK.

00:05.370 --> 00:11.550
And that is that how can you accept payments to say OK so this is really very important today is just

00:11.670 --> 00:15.380
please understand everything ok.

00:15.450 --> 00:20.820
If you don't want to have a pay pal account make sure you get it because PayPal is the most important

00:20.820 --> 00:22.970
thing that you should be having in your site.

00:22.980 --> 00:27.860
And most people do pay from Babe bell because there might be some do not.

00:27.860 --> 00:32.270
Some people do not provide their credit card information they just use bait bell.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.600
That is a secure way.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.530
And like that.

00:34.530 --> 00:41.220
So it totally depends that if you wan to add that credit card option you can added but payable is the

00:41.220 --> 00:42.000
most important thing.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.110
So what you have to do you just basically need to sign up at pay Bella calm.

00:47.650 --> 00:48.260
OK.

00:48.270 --> 00:50.980
And after you sign up you just have to log in.

00:51.000 --> 00:51.420
OK.

00:51.420 --> 00:54.570
And then it will be good.

00:54.750 --> 00:55.100
OK.

00:55.170 --> 00:57.750
So let me just go to

01:00.760 --> 01:02.370
I say my paypal account.

01:02.540 --> 01:07.290
Let me log in and you can see that this is here.

01:07.400 --> 01:13.820
I'm going to show you how can you just add a check and see that this is everything from my paypal account.

01:14.220 --> 01:18.810
You have the profile right here and this is my business profile basically.

01:18.830 --> 01:19.360
OK.

01:19.610 --> 01:24.200
So make sure that you go ahead you create your account and make sure that you create your business account

01:24.200 --> 01:27.060
here so that you you can accept payments.

01:27.080 --> 01:27.550
OK.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.880
And then you have to go to the products right here.

01:29.910 --> 01:33.470
Move Commerce and then you have to go to settings.

01:33.950 --> 01:34.320
OK.

01:34.320 --> 01:41.420
And in the settings you have to go to the shipping OK.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.060
I'm sorry.

01:42.070 --> 01:45.130
Check out the check out section you have to pay Beldi daily.

01:45.130 --> 01:52.400
So if I just go to Pay-Pal right now then here I have to enter the details so this is my e-mail address.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.270
OK.

01:53.470 --> 01:54.490
Advance options.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.550
This will be my paypal receiver ETEO.

01:57.640 --> 02:04.240
If you're mean Bill e-mail address defers from the bell e-mail and Duryea above in your mind receive

02:04.420 --> 02:05.920
e-mail for your account.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.750
This is used to validate Pinnacle's So this is my man.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.000
OK.

02:10.090 --> 02:12.950
And then I have a paypal identity token.

02:13.020 --> 02:18.190
OK so you have to grab it from the Beeb itself and then we have the invoice prefix so you can just leave

02:18.190 --> 02:18.780
it as it is.

02:18.820 --> 02:19.280
OK.

02:19.420 --> 02:24.790
You can you you can just use the B-ball standard one in there are not much necessary.

02:25.140 --> 02:25.610
OK.

02:25.660 --> 02:30.500
And they will be able to process the Fern's via people learn how to access your people.

02:30.610 --> 02:34.610
So we don't want to process referrals directly from our commerce here.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.150
OK.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.570
We've on duty from our friends from there.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.570
S. OK.

02:39.610 --> 02:44.410
I would not recommend you to add it otherwise if in future your site gets compromised and there might

02:44.410 --> 02:45.980
be some issues.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.580
OK so make sure that you do not add anything here.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.490
You just have to do it manually.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.280
I would recommend you to do it manually.

02:52.450 --> 02:52.810
OK.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.060
So here we have everything.

02:55.090 --> 03:02.300
But first what we have to do is that we need to test our payments.

03:02.320 --> 03:02.790
OK.

03:02.890 --> 03:03.850
And how are we going to do this.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.570
We just have to go to this developer adopt people dot com.

03:07.780 --> 03:08.170
OK.

03:08.170 --> 03:15.610
And then we have to pay both sandbox can be used to test payments this sandbox will be used to test

03:15.670 --> 03:16.440
our payments.

03:16.570 --> 03:24.910

03:24.910 --> 03:27.770
the next vid this or a get up.
