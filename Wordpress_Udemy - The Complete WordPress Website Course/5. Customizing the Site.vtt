Hit what is up guys in Malcolm X now in this video we will be working up in the designing of this website

00:05.070 --> 00:10.660
so let's just go ahead and let's just go to our dashboard OK and let's go to the Customize cell.

00:10.680 --> 00:14.280
Here in the Customize section we can design a web site you guys already know about it.

00:14.310 --> 00:18.790
So let's just view everything and let's see that how can we edit this theme so you can see that first

00:18.810 --> 00:22.760
we have the menu and then we have the categories and everything here.

00:22.950 --> 00:23.190
OK.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.260
We also have the blog.

00:24.330 --> 00:29.130
So let's just come here to the classified side you can just change it like how you want to change it.

00:29.130 --> 00:35.490
So I'm just going to change it to be like just make it like classifieds website and it is going to be

00:35.490 --> 00:39.250
just another word prescript say display site title and tag line.

00:39.250 --> 00:42.090
No I don't want to display this so we can see this is right here.

00:42.090 --> 00:44.330
And then we have the site icon which is this.

00:44.520 --> 00:44.940
OK.

00:45.090 --> 00:46.620
We go out and we have the site.

00:46.620 --> 00:51.730
So here it's like standard style directly to Derek Freestyle.

00:51.780 --> 00:53.350
So this will be like direct freestyle.

00:53.370 --> 00:58.560
If you just choose the layout to be like standard style and then you can see how the stylus So this

00:58.560 --> 00:59.570
is how this style is.

00:59.570 --> 01:02.590
There is no the ad categories right.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.550
So this is all looking pretty cool.

01:04.710 --> 01:05.060
OK.

01:05.070 --> 01:07.450
And then we have the search field.

01:07.530 --> 01:09.090
So this is like the search field.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.500
How you want it to be.

01:10.580 --> 01:14.790
So you can also make it like 50 percent.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.160
And so this will be like 50 percent.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.280
This is how it does.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.890
OK so but I will just keep it as the so that it looks pretty cool.

01:21.910 --> 01:24.210
And this is like full.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.410
And then we have a short time zone in the footer.

01:26.410 --> 01:32.140
So Showtime slash time zone in the footer so here I can see this is Phrag here.

01:32.220 --> 01:32.620
OK.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.930
So you can work with that you can change the times on make sure that you go to the settings right now

01:36.980 --> 01:38.530
and your dashboard OK.

01:38.530 --> 01:42.160
And then in the profile settings you can work with the times on guys.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.480
This should be you.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.020
You guys should know that because we have this so much time.

01:48.020 --> 01:48.350
Okay.

01:48.580 --> 01:53.680
And then we have the colors so we can just work with the colors like there are some color scheme like

01:53.680 --> 01:59.620
you can select a theme and for it return different style you can see and feel like blue it will turn

01:59.620 --> 02:00.360
blue.

02:02.850 --> 02:03.370
OK.

02:03.430 --> 02:13.190
And we have the green team so it will turn green and we have the red and the teal.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.560
So I think this is cool.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.060
OK.

02:16.070 --> 02:22.370
And I have the background color so I'm just going to make it the same color of this so top navigation

02:22.370 --> 02:26.200
links color you're going to copy this.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.720
I'm going to paste it right here.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.530
So this should be changed.

02:33.120 --> 02:33.370
OK.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.070
This is this.

02:34.100 --> 02:34.920
OK.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.790
I think it looks pretty cool.

02:37.220 --> 02:38.810
Yes it looks so great.

02:38.810 --> 02:39.380
OK.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.460
So top navigation links color.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.140
This is just matching exactly the same.

02:44.180 --> 02:51.170
We have top navigation text color and we also have the main background color which is this main background

02:51.230 --> 02:52.640
bar color.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.950
So this I think.

02:54.220 --> 02:54.660
OK.

02:54.830 --> 03:00.930
And then we have the Burtons color and we have the bird and text color and things color or background

03:00.930 --> 03:06.520
color and everything so it is just working exactly the same and again see how Peter Ramsay blogs.

03:06.780 --> 03:11.760
OK we go down and we have the header image so if you just want to change the header image you can just

03:11.760 --> 03:13.620
change it.

03:13.630 --> 03:14.580
