00:16.370 --> 00:20.750
So I'm sure that I'm not missing anything really done with this as well you're done with the text we

00:20.780 --> 00:24.240
done with the toggle I think yes we're done with the toggle.

00:24.440 --> 00:28.400
And then we have the video and the video sliders so you can just come here to the video right here and

00:28.400 --> 00:29.600
then you can enter the video.

00:29.600 --> 00:36.320

00:43.190 --> 00:45.510
So here we have the I mean you're really you are.

00:45.530 --> 00:50.120
And then so you have to grab the before you are able to get that.

So let's see if YouTube for it here because I don't know if Daveys of words YouTube.

01:02.070 --> 01:03.960
Let's see if we can add this.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.180
I'm just going to come here.

01:05.180 --> 01:12.880
I'm going to grab anything.

01:12.970 --> 01:16.920
This one I just love this guy.

01:17.450 --> 01:18.880
He's amazing.

01:18.900 --> 01:19.930
This explains everything.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.360
I'm not promoting everyone right here but I just love his channel and I love his steps.

01:24.400 --> 01:24.860

OK so this is coming right here.

01:33.850 --> 01:34.560
OK.

01:34.720 --> 01:39.100
You can go to the design right here and then you can go to the play icons you can change the play icon

01:39.100 --> 01:46.560
color ok since we have this already on the YouTube one that is why this has imbedded so when then we

01:46.560 --> 01:47.840
have the sizing right here.

01:47.970 --> 01:51.470
So you can manage the sizing the module.

01:51.610 --> 01:57.620
You can bring this a center and then we have the padding border so you can pretty well manage for that.

01:57.790 --> 01:58.200
OK.

01:58.330 --> 02:00.840
And then we have the last one is the video slider.

02:00.850 --> 02:02.250
So let's add that as well.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.340
That's why I'm here.

02:03.380 --> 02:06.760
And add the video slider.

02:06.930 --> 02:09.840
And here we need a pretty well so many videos right here.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.280

02:12.960 --> 02:13.570
OK.

02:13.770 --> 02:15.400
Let's go back.

02:15.420 --> 02:16.200

02:20.510 --> 02:22.920

02:44.640 --> 02:47.610
I mean to just come here and this is the video that is right here.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.840

So here we have the first one is right here.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.030
I'm going to infer that you are real.

03:07.060 --> 03:12.000
I'm going to paste it and here we have the Alex Costa video.

03:12.130 --> 03:12.580

03:18.040 --> 03:19.950
So here would be the same Meteora here.

03:28.990 --> 03:35.200

03:39.640 --> 03:40.730
Welcome to my channel.

03:40.730 --> 03:43.860
You should probably just hit that subscribe button below.

03:43.930 --> 03:49.530
Today I want to talk about a few tips and tricks that I use so you can see how to shed luck.

03:52.510 --> 03:54.660
You can see this is how the slider is looking.

03:54.670 --> 04:00.950
You can also show them arrows if you want to and the sliders should be coming up totally OK.

04:00.950 --> 04:04.020
You can see if I just come here and I just click this guy right here.

04:04.210 --> 04:10.780
The new video is coming up like this so use Tufnel track use dot navigation so you can use a dot navigation

04:10.810 --> 04:13.690
instead of the thumbnail track and you can see this.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.110
This is how the video is looking.

04:15.280 --> 04:15.780
OK.

04:17.900 --> 04:20.410
So now here now we are totally done.

04:20.480 --> 04:26.240
All the blurb Madhi Ewell's sorry all the DV models and you can see that everything is totally coming

04:26.240 --> 04:26.690
right here.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.950
If you want to make it full if you can also make it full it just come here to the alignment sizing make

04:30.950 --> 04:34.320
this riffle with Testim got to read use one.

04:34.670 --> 04:35.270
OK.

04:35.270 --> 04:36.240
And here we go.

04:36.270 --> 04:37.350
She can see.

04:37.350 --> 04:39.240
This is the dog coming like here.

04:39.290 --> 04:44.420
And you can also pretty well change the color and everything to control a color as you can to you can

04:44.420 --> 04:48.290
make it dark and this is how this is coming.

04:48.300 --> 04:54.120
So you can make the play icon color because since we have uploaded from YouTube that is why this is

04:54.120 --> 04:57.300
the copyright thing that we can not remove them.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.510
So now you can see that everything is looking totally awesome and OK.

05:01.650 --> 05:04.370
And now we're totally done with it.

05:04.500 --> 05:10.830

05:17.440 --> 05:18.360
something like that.

05:18.490 --> 05:23.830
