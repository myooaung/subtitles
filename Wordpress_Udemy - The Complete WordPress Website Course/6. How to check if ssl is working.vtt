00:00.280 --> 00:01.780
Hear what is up guys and welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:09.480
So the first step for the SSL here and this is that we need to upload a file to our NZL dot com slash

00:09.540 --> 00:12.960
SSL lot h mail or any file that you want to add.

00:12.960 --> 00:19.350
So for that you have to go to home and then you have to just launch to see battle to make some edits.

00:19.470 --> 00:19.910
OK.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.140
And then I'll show you how to work that more.

00:22.290 --> 00:28.010
You can directly just come here and you can also type iTunes dot com slash see battle.

00:28.250 --> 00:28.690
OK.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.640
And you will be redirected to see Baltz self.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.900
Let's just go ahead and let's just launch to see battle for iTunes deal.

00:36.330 --> 00:37.020
OK.

00:37.290 --> 00:46.320
And now I basically have to upload the file for my I can deal dot com so I have to see the document

00:46.320 --> 00:47.030
Crood for it.

00:47.100 --> 00:50.050
So make sure that you know your document Trude.

00:50.070 --> 00:54.080
Let me show you what the document through Does what happened to this.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.520
Let me just refresh this because it seems to be not working at all.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.250
OK.

00:59.430 --> 01:04.160
I have to enter this or log in.

01:04.950 --> 01:07.440
I don't know why I always forget my password.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.930
So I'm sorry you guys for that.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.520
Yes that's that's dumb.

01:13.670 --> 01:14.090
OK.

01:14.090 --> 01:16.990
So you can see that I am logged into my seat battle.

01:17.210 --> 01:17.840
OK.

01:17.870 --> 01:23.670
And they I I'm in the sea battle and now I have to find a document Trude for basically it unsealed or

01:23.710 --> 01:25.040
cop for that.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.470
I just have to go to the add on domains.

01:27.740 --> 01:28.480
OK.

01:28.490 --> 01:39.270
And then here it will give me the root of my domain so no wait I have to go to the files basically.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.090
OK.

01:40.130 --> 01:45.200
And in the files I have to go to File Manager which is this.

01:45.770 --> 01:50.950
And it's going to redirect me to file manager and here should be my domain name.

01:51.030 --> 01:56.950
So w w w dot basically refers to default domain.

01:56.990 --> 02:01.330
With downness I've NZL that is associated with my domain name.

02:01.430 --> 02:06.260
OK so if you have an add on domain that you have added then it should be in the domain for the root

02:06.350 --> 02:06.940
of that.

02:07.070 --> 02:08.870
I hope that you are following what I'm saying.

02:08.950 --> 02:09.400
OK.

02:09.530 --> 02:14.600
So in the add on domains you should be seeing this complete double chorus dot com and if I just add

02:14.600 --> 02:19.850
anything here that will be added to the route if I just want to add in the subdomains I can added in

02:19.850 --> 02:20.530
the subdomains.

02:20.540 --> 02:28.910
But since I want to add in my main domain OK if I just go to this one right here that is w w w dot to

02:28.910 --> 02:32.110
that as my main domain that is either NZL.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.220
Now what is the main domain the main domain should be coming here.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.300
That is the number one.

02:36.380 --> 02:36.780
OK.

02:36.950 --> 02:40.070
So Or if you go to the portal there should be the main domain.

02:40.070 --> 02:42.980
So I just have to add a file here.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.120
OK that can be like an email file.

02:46.190 --> 02:52.980
I just have to just click file and then I have to add in here.

02:53.450 --> 02:54.680
Hello dot.

02:55.460 --> 02:56.530
OK that's all.

02:56.810 --> 03:00.950
I just have to create new file and the file should be created.

03:00.950 --> 03:02.600
So this is right here.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.470
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit h t m l at it.

03:05.570 --> 03:10.890
That's all you have to do have to just click here again and then you have to enter something here.

03:10.940 --> 03:15.140
So you can enter here like a hello world or anything.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.520
I'm going to be clicking Hello World.

03:18.290 --> 03:19.390
That's all I have to do.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.250
I have to just save it and the file is saved.

03:22.310 --> 03:27.350
So I have to now go to iTunes yeld or com slash.

03:27.650 --> 03:35.030
Hello dot h d l the top and it's going to view the file so you can see this hello world is appearing.

03:35.030 --> 03:37.640
This means that the file is coming perfectly.

03:37.640 --> 03:45.160
So now we have to add the CBS coolants last line to check if the HD DBMSs is delivered to me or not.

03:45.170 --> 03:48.040
You can see that I am getting an error.

03:48.050 --> 03:53.100
This means that HTB a certificate is not given to me.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.220
Ok this not issued to me so I have to wait for 24 hours.

03:58.250 --> 03:58.690
OK.

03:58.820 --> 04:04.650
And then when this will turn to green then I will apply the SSL certificate.

04:04.670 --> 04:09.400
So you have to wait for 24 hours so that your SSL is given to you.

04:09.470 --> 04:14.720
And when this is turned to green and everything is done then I'll show you how can you change your whole

04:15.260 --> 04:18.490
site into the SSL horrific 8 stadium guys.

04:18.530 --> 04:21.240
And in the upcoming video I'll show you how to work with it.

04:21.270 --> 04:21.630
Goodbye.
