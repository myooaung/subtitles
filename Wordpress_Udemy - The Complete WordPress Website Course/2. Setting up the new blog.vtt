00:07.700 --> 00:08.870
So let's get started.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.260
So first of all we need to create a subdomain name.

00:11.420 --> 00:13.410
You have to log into your SEE panel.

00:13.420 --> 00:18.400
I'm going to enter my password and it will take me to my portal basically.

00:18.400 --> 00:18.810
OK.

00:18.980 --> 00:23.510
I want to log in to my portal and then again see how this is going to look.

00:23.510 --> 00:24.010
There you go.

00:24.020 --> 00:28.620
We are in the portal right now and I want to just click here and I want to hit launch see battle.

00:28.730 --> 00:35.540
So we basically want to create a subdomain name that will be s to now complete course shot.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.200
OK.

00:36.230 --> 00:40.580
And for that we need to install Word Press in it.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.730
So I'll just do that just right now.

00:42.870 --> 00:43.440
Okay.

00:43.490 --> 00:45.350
And then you'll see how this is going to work work.

00:45.380 --> 00:47.790
I'm going to go to the subdomains right here.

00:48.620 --> 00:49.090
OK.

00:49.140 --> 00:57.780
I don't want to create a new subdomain name that will be asked to dot complete tilde Lupi course dot

00:57.780 --> 01:04.640
com and my subject this is going to be sub and this core domains.

01:04.650 --> 01:05.330
OK.

01:05.490 --> 01:17.170
And then slash and then s to complete the Lupi course dot com call what I want to do right now I want

01:17.170 --> 01:19.220
will just come here and I want to create.

01:19.230 --> 01:21.110
So it's going to create this right now.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.950
And now what we want to do we want to install WordPress in it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.990
So what we have to do we have to install the latest version.

01:27.060 --> 01:29.050
So the latest version has been released.

01:29.070 --> 01:32.020
OK what I want to do I want to go to the download section.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.840
He can see that every video that I have created right now is here.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.760
I want to go to the compress one.

01:36.870 --> 01:37.670
I want to get this.

01:37.710 --> 01:40.060
And I also want to go to the press right here.

01:40.140 --> 01:45.150
So I just want to shift and delete and I want to install I want to download the newer version so I'm

01:45.150 --> 01:46.980
going to go to war.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.070
And then I want to download that version.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.320
Let's come here and let's get like download.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.160
Let's click this and it's going to be downloaded.

01:54.160 --> 02:01.080
So it says Add to that duplicate file with the Neumark finally.

02:01.160 --> 02:01.710
OK.

02:02.060 --> 02:02.750
Have a go.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.920
I want to come here and I want to start download too.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.030
It's just downloading this.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.760
We have to wait for this till this is download.

02:09.850 --> 02:14.090
And I want to go to the files right here and I want to go to the file manager and I want to upload that

02:14.090 --> 02:14.590
file.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.280
OK.

02:15.350 --> 02:18.340
So don't install this with the installer OK.

02:18.350 --> 02:23.110
Always try to make sure that you install it there so that you don't have to create multiple databases.

02:23.120 --> 02:23.490
OK.

02:23.510 --> 02:29.810
And multiple databases slowdown your hosting so make sure that you run only one database and then everything

02:29.840 --> 02:31.220
is managed under that database.

02:31.220 --> 02:37.760
I want to go to the subdomain for a here and here is a subdomain name that will be tooled up this dot

02:37.760 --> 02:40.880
com I want to hold it open folder.

02:41.380 --> 02:42.210
OK.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.050
And there we go.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.110
I want to just extract it.

02:46.220 --> 02:47.840
It's an extract here.

02:50.530 --> 02:53.870
You can sell to it extract

02:57.880 --> 02:59.200
extract to this.

02:59.230 --> 02:59.590
OK.

02:59.680 --> 03:05.240
So it is extracting right now after this is extracted I'm going to show you how this is going to look.

03:05.390 --> 03:08.390
So here should be avoid stressful point 9.1.

03:08.430 --> 03:10.570
I will open this up and I want to select it all.

03:10.580 --> 03:16.160
I don't want a head at 2 or a cave and I want to select that.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.400
So you basically need a venue for that.

03:18.420 --> 03:25.130
If you don't have it already you can go to when you are dot.com and you can just download our software.

03:25.140 --> 03:27.940
So this is used for just zipping and unzipping.

03:28.040 --> 03:28.560
OK.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.130
Now this should be done.

03:31.140 --> 03:35.390
I want to go to this right here and I want to hit upload sowars upload

03:39.240 --> 03:40.640
Oh my God I cannot see it.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.610
This is here it is.

03:44.700 --> 03:45.180
OK.

03:45.240 --> 03:49.360
I want to hit select file and I want to go to the downloads right here.

03:49.410 --> 03:56.470
I want to go to the compress right here and here should be we press we press and press it.

04:00.770 --> 04:03.260
So this is being uploaded when this is uploaded.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.960
I'll show you how we can extract it.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.430
So you guys already know it.

04:06.470 --> 04:08.960
So make sure that you try installing it with this method.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.320
OK.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.770
I'm going to come here and I'm going to hit extract right here.

04:13.790 --> 04:19.430
Track files OK and I want to get close.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.830
So this should be right here.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.590
We have to refresh this first reload.

04:24.590 --> 04:25.120
There we go.

04:25.130 --> 04:27.180
I want to come here and I want to hit delete.

04:28.720 --> 04:33.120
Skip trash and permanently delete confirmed so you can see this is done right here.

04:33.650 --> 04:44.720
I want to go to this my desk to the desk to drop complete double chorus.

04:44.790 --> 04:50.280
So if this doesn't open up we have to wait for some day to access it because when we create a subdomain

04:50.280 --> 04:57.520
names it approximately takes 30 minutes one hour or it sometimes is done instantly.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.970
So we have to see if this is up and running.

05:00.420 --> 05:00.870
OK.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.250
We have to wait for some time.

05:02.310 --> 05:09.540
This is going to 404 page not found right now but we have to wait for something like 10 minutes or something

05:09.540 --> 05:10.110
like that.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.160
And when it will be done I'll show you how this is going to look.

05:13.170 --> 05:18.780
But first let's go to the myy sequel database and we need to integrate these that way.

05:18.780 --> 05:22.140
So I'm just going to hit I'm just going to install this on this database.

05:22.140 --> 05:24.480
You can see that we have the see the course.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.860
We also have the user name.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.880
And so when this is done I'll be back.

05:29.120 --> 05:29.530
OK.

05:29.610 --> 05:30.770
So I'll just try.

05:30.780 --> 05:34.030
Try try a trade and when it is done I'll show you how this is going to work.

05:34.250 --> 05:34.790
OK.

05:34.890 --> 05:38.400
So I'm just pausing my radio right now and I'll install WordPress.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.250
I'll be back.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.330
