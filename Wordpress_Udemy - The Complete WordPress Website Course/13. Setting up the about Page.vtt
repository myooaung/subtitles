And now in this video we're going to be working up about page and then contact page so we will be covering

00:11.020 --> 00:16.750
these two pages and then we'll be working up with more of these animations in the mobile optimization

00:16.750 --> 00:19.650
to basically owlish just showing you these three pages.

00:19.750 --> 00:25.690
The risks you can create the more you just have to basically understand that how design what is the

00:25.690 --> 00:28.120
design and how designing a website is done.

00:28.120 --> 00:28.660
OK.

00:28.900 --> 00:32.800
So you can see that we have saved this and now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit axid the visual

00:32.800 --> 00:38.330
builder and now we have to move to the About page so you can see our home page is totally ok.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.570
Totally amazing.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.210
And now we have to work with the About page.

00:42.220 --> 00:42.840
Here we go.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.390
And this is how my about pages looking.

00:45.450 --> 00:45.800
OK.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.180
So I'm going to come here and I'm going to enable the visual Polder because I want to design it but

00:50.180 --> 00:54.040
the visual Bilour and you can see that this visual Bilbrey be enabled.

00:54.040 --> 00:54.570
OK.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.820
And now first thing we have is to create a short header.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.380
OK.

00:58.420 --> 01:01.920
And that will displayed about us or about OK.

01:01.930 --> 01:05.050

01:20.170 --> 01:22.390
Make sure that this is the one not the two.

01:22.390 --> 01:27.550
So your heading of the header should be all these to each one because this is good for SEO.

01:27.550 --> 01:30.520
We'll be discussing it later on.

01:30.730 --> 01:31.210

01:36.030 --> 01:36.360
OK.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.550
And you can see that we're done still here.

01:38.650 --> 01:39.460
I'm just going to come here.

01:39.460 --> 01:44.420
I'm going to delete it and you can see this is my about a section so I'm going to come here.

I want to go with the black and the golden.

02:00.010 --> 02:00.470
OK.

02:00.650 --> 02:04.760
And now I want to go with that gradient degree.

02:04.850 --> 02:10.160
So I want it to be this the start position and then position should go like this.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.170
I'm just going to call it like this.

02:12.190 --> 02:15.560
It's just build it.

02:15.590 --> 02:17.880

02:39.910 --> 02:41.090
This is looking cool a bit.

02:41.230 --> 02:46.790
And then we can make the end position to be like normal like this.

02:46.810 --> 02:47.370
OK.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.700
And change the start position to be here.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.660

12:34.200 --> 12:35.080
Term that one.

12:35.090 --> 12:35.290
