00:00.650 --> 00:02.070
What is it guys and welcome.

00:02.070 --> 00:05.850
So in this video we're going to be working up with our footer section.

00:05.980 --> 00:09.260
OK so you have two options for footer if you want to go ahead.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.850
You can in and create it with elementary and you can either create it.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.740
But I would recommend you to go with the default function of the ocean.

00:16.770 --> 00:21.950
You do not go with the elementary because you can not assign this element to every pages.

00:22.140 --> 00:27.880
OK so now here we're going to be raking up this elementary I'm going to go to the customized right here

00:27.910 --> 00:29.890
and there are going to go to the for column.

00:29.890 --> 00:30.360
OK.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.930
And then we're going to work with it.

00:32.230 --> 00:33.180
So let's wait.

00:33.480 --> 00:33.850
OK.

00:33.850 --> 00:40.720
And here you can see that we basically first removed that for when we were creating our website if I

00:40.720 --> 00:41.710
just show it to you.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.390
NZL dot com you can see that in this website.

00:44.590 --> 00:48.570
We removed this whole For didn't add any.

00:48.670 --> 00:51.430
After the race here we can see OK.

00:51.520 --> 00:57.010
So what I want to do right now I want to add the footer right here because this is the blog in I think

00:57.370 --> 00:59.650
it is recommended for me to outfitter.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.080
So I'm just going to come here to the footer where I can just style everything.

01:04.210 --> 01:10.420
You can see in the form of a can style lead if I want to disable on height on mobile and other devices

01:10.780 --> 01:11.860
I can also do that.

01:12.010 --> 01:17.020
And then we have the parallax effect here so you can also add a parallax effect to your foot or if you

01:17.020 --> 01:20.130
want to play.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.310
You can see how this footer is coming.

01:22.540 --> 01:26.140
This page is going above and this footer is still behind this.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.390
You can see this effect is called the parallax effect.

01:29.410 --> 01:32.980
OK so I'm not going to answer any of the parallax effect.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.460
You think normal looks fine.

01:35.470 --> 01:42.240
So this is how the normal what's OK if you can also move on with the columns that how many columns you

01:42.240 --> 01:42.830
want to add.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.850
So I'll be just adding the for column.

01:44.850 --> 01:46.210
I think we have the container.

01:46.260 --> 01:47.720
I will be adding the container.

01:47.820 --> 01:50.080
And then let's go back to the fidgets right here.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.700
So here we want to add the Vidyut OK.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.320
I'm going to go to the for one right here.

01:54.330 --> 01:59.070
I'm going to hit out of it and let's decide the fate that we want to add.

01:59.070 --> 02:02.430
So first of all I want to add the About section.

02:02.570 --> 02:03.290
OK.

02:03.630 --> 02:06.790
I want to go to the custom made here mail order text.

02:07.030 --> 02:09.990
For text OK.

02:10.170 --> 02:11.200
And here we go.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.080
This is right here.

02:12.180 --> 02:15.700
I want to add here about us.

02:16.070 --> 02:16.450
OK.

02:16.620 --> 02:20.350
And here I want to add about me or about this block.

02:20.520 --> 02:26.430
OK so I'll be adding blue collar is

02:29.240 --> 02:44.180
the best tech blog Sorry tech blog is the first ever technology blog.

02:45.140 --> 02:48.410
And I just want to copy it.

02:48.490 --> 02:54.080
Cuppy and paste.

02:54.290 --> 02:57.880
OK now you can see that here should be the content tray here.

02:57.950 --> 03:01.740
You can see in today's tech blog is the first ever technology blog.

03:02.060 --> 03:05.840
And here is about a section so I want to add one more.

03:05.940 --> 03:06.900
In a foot or two.

03:07.070 --> 03:07.400
OK.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.350
I'm just going to come here and here should be

03:12.330 --> 03:17.700
the category so you can show the categories if you want to or you can show some recent boast as Bob

03:19.380 --> 03:20.360
OK.

03:20.680 --> 03:25.630
I'm going to add the recent post right here and here we go you can see it going also show you the number

03:25.780 --> 03:27.430
how many posts you want to add.

03:27.820 --> 03:28.260
OK.

03:28.270 --> 03:36.000
And the title is going to be recent boast recent posts would be three of the three post right here.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.790
And then we have the both supposed it's going to show the post.

03:38.790 --> 03:41.590
You can also show you my library.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.110
OK.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.810
I'm going to go to the post right here.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.880
And then we have Querrey by taxonomy so you can also show category here.

03:50.100 --> 03:50.580
OK.

03:50.610 --> 03:55.400
If we select category you can see three categories are going to appear right here.

03:55.800 --> 04:00.810
So you can enter the terms to create like this so you can select the terms.

04:00.810 --> 04:07.710
OK so if I just add I guess it's going to show me all the post that has the category assigned as the

04:07.710 --> 04:08.560
Iowas.

04:08.690 --> 04:09.280
OK.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.890
So you can also carry it by the category.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.370
You can carry it by tag.

04:13.380 --> 04:20.460
So if I just add the tag to be amazing then it's going to show you all the post that has the category.

04:20.460 --> 04:23.430
Amazing that has a text amazing.

04:23.510 --> 04:26.200
So you can see this Dagh is only assigned to this.

04:26.220 --> 04:28.350
That is why this post is coming so this is outrageous.

04:28.380 --> 04:28.960
OK.

04:29.220 --> 04:32.070
I'm just going to go to the No because I want to show recent post.

04:32.160 --> 04:32.610
OK.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.260
And then we have to push Ray here.

04:34.280 --> 04:41.740
The autre is descending because I want to show the recent post and then we have the order by date so

04:41.740 --> 04:43.630
you can order it by randomly.

04:43.630 --> 04:45.250
You can also show some random polls.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.860
You can also show some modified polls that were recently modified.

04:49.030 --> 04:52.200
And then just basically one and the recent polls right here.

OK I'm going to go back right here and I want to go to the for three and let's add one more.

04:57.520 --> 05:06.360
So for this I think I should be adding the list of all the pages that that that my web site has.

05:06.690 --> 05:16.240
So it's going to sort by pages you can also go with the page I.D. page order and you can see all pages.

05:16.530 --> 05:17.860
