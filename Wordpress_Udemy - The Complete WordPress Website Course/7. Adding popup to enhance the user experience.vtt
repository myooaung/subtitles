00:00.740 --> 00:05.130
What is a guy who's in Malcolm X now in this video we will be working up the integration of the pages

00:05.130 --> 00:10.830
so basically you can create two types of functionalities like if someone clicks this than they should

00:10.830 --> 00:12.100
take us to the page.

00:12.270 --> 00:16.330
Or if someone clicks does a pop up should be open so you have two options.

00:16.350 --> 00:21.120
What you can do if you want to go with the page there what you can do is you can come here and then

00:21.120 --> 00:25.370
you can just go ahead and you can create a new page like this and you.

00:25.530 --> 00:26.080
OK.

00:26.100 --> 00:29.120
And then here you have to just enter like a hotel.

00:29.270 --> 00:29.520
OK.

00:29.520 --> 00:34.960
So for hotel it should be hotel and there should be a page automatically created.

00:34.980 --> 00:37.750
I want to come here and I just want to go ahead and I want to hit publish.

00:37.750 --> 00:40.670
So let's just go ahead and let's sit at it for the elementary.

00:40.860 --> 00:43.970
So just clicking Edelmann Tory you just have to just hit save.

00:43.980 --> 00:48.630
Now Alice come here and it should take us to the elementary page.

00:48.870 --> 00:51.650
Let's just click here again.

00:52.140 --> 00:52.770
And here you go.

00:52.950 --> 00:53.550
You can see that.

00:53.550 --> 00:54.180
Here we are.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.770
So here we can design this page completely.

00:56.940 --> 01:00.440
And once you design everything you have to just remove this as well guys.

01:00.550 --> 01:00.810
OK.

01:00.830 --> 01:01.870
This is also important.

01:02.070 --> 01:04.870
And once you design everything then you need to add a new section.

01:04.980 --> 01:05.430
OK.

01:05.550 --> 01:10.050
And then here you have to add it so how you will that it's you just have to come here.

01:16.140 --> 01:22.180
Divo commerce product commerce Vuh elements elements you have to just grab this and then you have to

01:22.180 --> 01:23.050
paste it right here.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.570
So here you have to select like a single product page.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.410
So a single product page.

01:28.540 --> 01:30.470
You have to select it like for hotel.

01:30.490 --> 01:35.500
We need to grab the hotel thing in here so you can see it says you call a hotel.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.990
This will be right here.

01:37.150 --> 01:37.810
And this is great.

01:37.810 --> 01:39.610
Now you can see how this is coming.

01:39.880 --> 01:44.470
So if I just come here and I just say it now and then I just go ahead and move the space and you will

01:44.470 --> 01:48.640
see this is how my page will be looking and everything will be like this.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.660
You can see everything is coming here to have this right now.

01:51.820 --> 01:56.530
I can just choose the room that if it's true my won and then I can just design it and then I can just

01:56.530 --> 01:59.570
sit back now and everything.

01:59.650 --> 02:01.090
So you can see how this is looking.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.360
So this is how you can work with it.

02:02.380 --> 02:06.820
You can work with it how you want it to be and then you can also just add it so.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.120
But instead of this I want

02:13.550 --> 02:15.440
I basically want to show a pop up.

02:15.530 --> 02:17.690
You can see this revues is coming right here.

02:17.750 --> 02:22.010
So I just wanted to disable the revues So let's just come here to the products and then let's go to

02:22.040 --> 02:23.430
all products right now.

02:23.870 --> 02:31.330
And now here we have to go to the bucolic hotel and then let's head at it.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.170
OK.

02:32.270 --> 02:34.280
And then we have to go down to advance

02:38.470 --> 02:40.990
and the just disable the reviews from here.

02:40.990 --> 02:45.390
So let's just go ahead and let it update and you will see that here it'll be only only.

02:45.400 --> 02:50.410
Only this product will be appearing and nothing else so you can see this product is just appearing and

02:50.410 --> 02:51.990
it is showing book now.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.890
So we want this to be shown in that thing.

02:55.900 --> 02:56.250
OK.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.190
We don't want anything else to show.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.790
We don't want this be doing this.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.250
We want a pop up to be.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.460
So how we will do that.

03:02.620 --> 03:03.070
OK.

03:03.190 --> 03:05.120
We need a pop up plug in for that.

03:05.170 --> 03:05.560
OK.

03:05.560 --> 03:11.450
And that pop up plug in that we will be using is basically called bulk up for elementary.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.030
OK.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.630
So you need to grab this plug in.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.040
OK.

03:14.160 --> 03:19.470
You just have to come here and then you have to go to the appearance and then you have to go to.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.610

03:36.330 --> 03:42.450
Yes this is Bob baulks for elementary.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.140
So you can see this is right here.

03:44.150 --> 03:48.520
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit this so you can see this is being installed right now.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.840
And once this is installed we have to work with it.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.290
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit activate and this will be activated.

03:54.290 --> 03:57.740
So now you can see that we have added this pop a box.

03:57.740 --> 04:01.370
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to go to pop boxes and I'm going to hit add new pop up boxes

04:01.820 --> 04:05.960
and first of all what you have to do is that you need to go to all of the products and make sure that

04:05.960 --> 04:11.190
you just remove the review system because we just want to show the pop up and that's all.

04:11.200 --> 04:17.630

04:17.750 --> 04:20.990
I want to come here to advance and disable the reviews.

04:21.140 --> 04:22.770
Let's come here to debate.

04:22.840 --> 04:28.070
Let's come here and let's go down and let's get to advance and let's disable the radios so you can see

04:28.340 --> 04:33.830
the reviews would be disable and now everything will be totally OK and viewable.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.000
So you can see this is right here.

04:35.000 --> 04:35.870
Everything is disabled.

04:35.870 --> 04:37.000
Now we want to come here.

04:37.120 --> 04:41.710
And first I need to just go ahead hotel pop up.

You can see you can see how this is looking.

10:45.530 --> 10:47.830
You can also slide the persons and only persons we want.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.580
And then we can just sit back now.

10:49.760 --> 10:53.400
So in the book now you can see that it is going to take us to the card page.

10:53.440 --> 10:53.660
OK.

10:53.660 --> 10:55.830
It is not taking us any vear.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.950
This is not taking us anywhere.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.410
So if we then go to the card right now

11:03.390 --> 11:05.210
then you can see this is right here.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.250
So I just want it to be like direct check.

11:07.260 --> 11:11.610
There should be direct check out so that the person can directly check out his himself.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.650
So we're going to work for that.

11:13.830 --> 11:14.170
OK.

11:14.190 --> 11:19.830
