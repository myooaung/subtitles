00:00.710 --> 00:05.660
What is it guys and what KMAX are now in this video he'll be writing a page or a post so it totally

00:05.660 --> 00:06.200
depends.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.850
Both are the same.

00:08.060 --> 00:14.150
All of the way you can rank anything so the page is like if you want to build a business website like

00:14.150 --> 00:18.050
what we build here like is freed up complete of course.

00:18.080 --> 00:22.340
If I just show you and I can see this post does not have any of that page.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.680
OK.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.040
Sorry it does not have any of the post but it only has the pages.

00:28.040 --> 00:34.940
OK you can see we have this home about and contact so you have to make sure that you design your page

00:34.940 --> 00:41.150
in a way so that you make your keyword stuffing to be great.

00:41.420 --> 00:51.290
OK so now let's go ahead and let's close this let's come here to our name and let's go to the post right

00:51.290 --> 00:51.680
now.

00:51.890 --> 00:55.850
Let's suppose that I wanted to write a post on how to create a Word Press Site.

00:56.030 --> 00:59.490
OK and I want to rank it on on Google.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.170
OK not on the top page.

01:01.190 --> 01:08.440
Ok my aim is to tar and Connett it on a page but I have to face the reality.

01:08.450 --> 01:09.430
My site is new.

01:09.580 --> 01:10.080
OK.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.970
And my site page rank is not developed yet.

01:13.160 --> 01:13.650
OK.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.580
And I have to just be clear with the reality.

01:18.590 --> 01:21.670
OK so you have to make everything the best.

01:21.820 --> 01:25.800
Ok then your page rank fill in trees and it takes nine.

01:26.000 --> 01:26.560
OK.

01:26.570 --> 01:29.000
So let's just go ahead and let's add the title here.

01:29.150 --> 01:38.940
OK so my title was how to build a WordPress website 2018.

01:39.210 --> 01:39.460
OK.

01:39.470 --> 01:41.640
So this is my title at topos OK.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.700
And I want to rank it.

01:43.820 --> 01:46.800
Now you can see that this is totally sane.

01:46.820 --> 01:55.250
It says everything is tame but we have a new thing here that is used to see what is this and how it

01:55.310 --> 01:56.270
will help us.

01:56.290 --> 02:00.830
OK so now here the number one tip that I wanted to give you right now before getting it started is that

02:00.830 --> 02:04.650
you can see this is right here coming which is not good.

02:04.820 --> 02:09.700
OK so if you have these type of links then I actually change it right away.

02:09.860 --> 02:14.800
So you have to go to settings and then you have to go to permalink and then you have to open it up to

02:14.880 --> 02:19.420
make sure to open it up and then let it go to post name and then let's hit save changes.

02:19.420 --> 02:24.050
So now what I'm going to come here and I am going to save it a draft.

02:24.200 --> 02:24.680
OK.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.770
And I am going to open this up.

02:27.010 --> 02:28.440
OK let's just open this up.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.950
You can see this is totally changed now.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.440
So my word is changes just like how to build a WordPress website.

02:35.590 --> 02:42.820
Now you can see that this is how my page is going to look in the Google.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.640
OK so this is a title.

02:44.690 --> 02:49.580
This is the that is going to appear in and this is a description Ashar description that is going to

02:49.760 --> 02:52.460
appear if you just go to that court press tutorial.

02:52.460 --> 02:59.240
If I just search for a game you can see here we have the description here we have the link and then

02:59.240 --> 03:00.670
here we have the title.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.740
So this is how it's going to work.

03:02.750 --> 03:08.800
Now let's come here and let's just add a paragraph here.

03:08.930 --> 03:11.090
So how you have to write the paragraph.

03:11.090 --> 03:15.860
I hope that you have got the idea that how you have to write the paragraph like if you just come here

03:16.330 --> 03:18.820
and you just open any of the post OK.

03:18.890 --> 03:26.940
Like I come here and I just open it up and I can see this post is coming here.

03:26.960 --> 03:34.670
Now if I just press control f and I just search for Wordpress tutorial so WordPress tutorial itself

03:34.760 --> 03:36.730
is mentioned 12 times.

03:36.730 --> 03:37.220
OK.

03:37.460 --> 03:38.840
You can see this is right here.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.990
If I just click here it's going to take me down down down down.

03:42.260 --> 03:48.020
And if I just make it shorter I just make it to be like Wordpress pension's mentioned 159 times so you

03:48.020 --> 03:53.050
can just imagine that how many times it is mentioned here you can see.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.950
OK so so many times so many times so many times where press is being mentioned here.

03:57.950 --> 04:02.380
So you have to make sure that you have to make a key very OK.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.950
And then you have to mention it here.

04:04.120 --> 04:04.520
OK.

04:04.550 --> 04:12.520
In your content area and when you add it it will be so create for your ACL and make sure that your keyboard

04:12.530 --> 04:18.030
is coming most of the time because it will help you succeed in the seal.

04:18.270 --> 04:18.810
OK.

04:18.830 --> 04:26.240
So now we have the keyword the keyboard that you have chosen which is WordPress website 2018.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.240
I have chosen a very long tail keyword.

04:29.360 --> 04:35.180
That is because my website is not like a huge Web site.

04:35.180 --> 04:35.590
OK.

04:35.780 --> 04:44.080
I'm just starting it and I don't know anything about SEO that is why I want to keep going from the start.

04:44.180 --> 04:50.960
OK so start habitues tweak key word to word keyword and then one single keyword then you can rank one

04:50.990 --> 04:57.510
single keyword because it is so hard to rank a one key word if your website is not good in a CEO.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.730
So this is how you have to make sure that you do everything.

05:01.730 --> 05:05.040
So now here I'm going to be entering the content.

05:05.180 --> 05:05.480
OK.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.750
And here I have to make sure that the key word is coming here.

05:09.780 --> 05:17.370
Key word is also coming here in the word L and Q is also coming here in the description.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.430
So you can add it right here.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.990
OK you can add it like Word Press tutorial.

05:25.270 --> 05:26.870
OK I like this here.

05:28.250 --> 05:34.400
And now here we make sure that you add it to be like here so that this color that is coming is green.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.510
So when it will be green your better description will be perfect.

05:38.510 --> 05:41.540
So I'm going to be entering the Laura ipsum.

05:41.600 --> 05:47.280
OK let's just go ahead and let's add the dot com slash feed's like e-mail.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.100
Now here I'm going to grab the lips.

05:49.190 --> 05:55.310
So let's just go ahead let's grab it from here to here and get a copy.

05:55.320 --> 05:59.890
I'm going to come here and I am going to paste it right here.

05:59.900 --> 06:06.500
Now here you can see that my method description is green here and it's just totally coming the perfect

06:06.500 --> 06:07.020
way.

06:07.270 --> 06:07.750
OK.

06:07.850 --> 06:12.860
So I can teach to my biology to see how it's going to appear in a mobile.

06:13.010 --> 06:14.510
Now here this is my slug.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.310
That is like you are.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.140
Let's come here and here I'm going to be entering WordPress website is my keyboard to I mean I'll be

06:24.140 --> 06:26.940
entering a WordPress Web site.

06:27.130 --> 06:27.720
OK.

06:27.950 --> 06:30.800
I'm WordPress Web site is my keyword Let's suppose.

06:31.040 --> 06:31.470
OK.

06:31.670 --> 06:35.480
And then here I'm going to be entering a WordPress Web site.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.660
OK.

06:36.740 --> 06:43.110
I'm going to come here and I am going to just add WordPress Web site.

06:43.360 --> 06:43.660
OK.

06:43.690 --> 06:46.740
And here I'm going to copy it.

06:46.810 --> 06:47.640
Make sure to copy it.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.190
OK.

06:48.310 --> 06:53.940
So now here I'm going to come hanging coming here and I am going to copy this whole paragraph.

06:54.040 --> 06:54.850
Copy.

06:54.850 --> 06:57.260
Come here come here and let's paste it.

06:57.340 --> 06:58.910
So it is right here.

06:59.260 --> 06:59.550
OK.

06:59.560 --> 07:05.410
I'm going to be coming here and I am going to just copy the Wordpress website and I'm going to paste

07:05.410 --> 07:08.200
it so many times like here.

07:08.610 --> 07:09.450
OK.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.750
Here.

07:14.310 --> 07:15.180
Here.

07:15.510 --> 07:19.500
And to make sure that you try posting it so many times.

07:19.510 --> 07:26.730
So now here you can see that I have posted pasted the WordPress website keywords so many times.

07:26.730 --> 07:29.720
OK so let's go here.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.150
OK.

07:31.200 --> 07:36.850
Let's just go ahead and let's come here to the publish.

07:36.900 --> 07:37.370
OK.

07:37.480 --> 07:42.690
I'm going to be coming here and I'm going to be just clicking save draft so now can see that my seal

07:42.750 --> 07:45.340
is said to be good.

07:45.650 --> 07:46.180
OK.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.700
So this is creating for you.

07:48.780 --> 07:48.980
OK.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.580
No images appear in the page.

07:50.580 --> 07:55.710
So you have to add the images and the eternal links which we will be talking in the next video.

07:55.830 --> 07:56.220
OK.

07:56.370 --> 08:03.240
And we have the readability So the copy's scores 15 and fresh reading and it was difficult to read trying

08:03.620 --> 08:09.110
to make short a sentence using less difficult words to improve readability.

08:09.330 --> 08:10.770
Any subheading.

08:11.130 --> 08:13.260
So we have to we have to add a subheading.

08:13.260 --> 08:23.340
OK I'm going to be using this I mean I'm making it my subheading So this embedding is going to be heading

08:23.340 --> 08:25.970
to to see if it is gone.

08:26.070 --> 08:26.700
OK.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.210
So here is gone.

08:29.280 --> 08:36.300
I'm going to be adding one more subheading which is going to be this so that my subheading is perfect.

08:36.540 --> 08:36.960
OK.

08:37.110 --> 08:38.550
I have no improvement trade here.

08:38.550 --> 08:39.990
Everything is good here.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.940
The copy scores fifteen point three Flesch reading test.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.120
OK I don't know what it says.

08:44.280 --> 08:50.550
So don't just for just be like OK which is considered very difficult to read try make to try to make

08:50.550 --> 08:52.000
shorter sentences.

08:52.140 --> 08:57.710
Since we have copied everything from the alarm system that is why the saying two shorter short your

08:57.720 --> 08:58.310
sentence.

08:58.350 --> 09:01.600
So you have to short your sentence so that it is easy to read.

09:01.620 --> 09:08.190
So when you when you are reading when you are writing ok then make sure to make sure that your everything

09:08.190 --> 09:13.520
that you have frit in here is easy to Alasan transition words.

09:13.740 --> 09:19.530
OK so it is saying zero person off the sentences contain a transition word or phrase which is less than

09:19.530 --> 09:23.620
recommended minimum so you can just read it OK.

09:23.790 --> 09:27.660
But the readability is not like very important.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.500
The main thing is the key word.

09:29.790 --> 09:30.280
OK.

09:30.390 --> 09:32.910
Readability is a Google factor.

09:33.390 --> 09:34.000
OK.

09:34.080 --> 09:34.860
Like gum.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.940
But you can see that we have already four here.

09:37.950 --> 09:39.470
So it doesn't matter.

09:39.480 --> 09:46.910
But if you short your center or if you just add a transition word a phrase then that would be good.

09:46.950 --> 09:51.940
So let's come here and let's come here to our website and you can see that our website is totally done.

09:51.960 --> 09:59.340
We now basically have a basic understanding of how key word works and how a WordPress website is work.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.360
OK so you have not used the focus keyword.

10:02.370 --> 10:09.680
No I don't think that as your title is the focus but it does not appear in the beginning the slug for

10:09.700 --> 10:18.020
this page contain stop words consider removing them stop words so there are also the stop words which

10:18.020 --> 10:22.600
are filtered out before processing the dud take that.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.650
So like how to how to build.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.330
OK.

10:26.360 --> 10:31.550
So it can be like build a WordPress website it doesn't I mean if I just change it and I just change

10:31.550 --> 10:38.480
it to be like great if we just change it to be like this you can see that my thing has gone down.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.050
Gone.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.060
OK so it is right here.

10:41.060 --> 10:47.120
So make sure that your slug is also like this build WordPress website doesn't 18th and I can see that

10:47.150 --> 10:54.130
this whole SEO is going to give you some of the tips that it can take from your website.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.300
And this is so amazing guys.

10:57.530 --> 11:06.020
If you are doing everything correctly then I am 100 percent sure that your web site will come on the

11:06.020 --> 11:07.330
number one page result.

11:07.340 --> 11:07.720
OK.

11:07.850 --> 11:08.880
But it will take time.

11:08.990 --> 11:10.420
You have to be very patient.

11:10.570 --> 11:10.960
OK.

11:11.180 --> 11:14.770
So here you can see that this is our one focus keyword.

11:14.780 --> 11:19.970
You can also add more keywords here like if you want to target more keywords then you can also add them

11:19.970 --> 11:24.390
here and then just get an idea of how your page is ranking.

11:24.890 --> 11:30.380
So now in the next video I'll be showing you how to write and how to add an image and how to just work

11:30.380 --> 11:33.770
with the internal links and also the outbound links.

11:33.830 --> 11:37.060
So in the next video you'll be working up at that by guys.
