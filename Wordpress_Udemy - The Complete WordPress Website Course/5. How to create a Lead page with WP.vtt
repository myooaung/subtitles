OK.

00:36.410 --> 00:42.560
So you basically create a website for your company but you create a lead page for your product in which

00:42.590 --> 00:49.220
you describe the product that way so that the customer who wants to buy your product should buy.

00:49.250 --> 00:55.500
He should not wait a single second should be like No I just want to buy it right now.

00:55.550 --> 00:56.350
It should be like that.

00:56.450 --> 00:56.760
OK.

00:56.840 --> 01:04.340
And if you are creating a lead page then you will receive that you yourself will see that your

01:08.070 --> 01:10.200
sale will be 50 percent increased.

01:10.200 --> 01:10.560

01:20.700 --> 01:25.820
This is basically called the landing page conversion course like this one.

01:26.060 --> 01:26.570
OK.

01:26.580 --> 01:29.600
And if you go down you can see how it is.

01:29.730 --> 01:35.730
If I just go down I can see this is the another lead page like almond take is like generate even more

01:35.790 --> 01:41.230
leads from your blog so you can see I'm turn your blog customers readers into customers.

01:41.270 --> 01:43.530
OK then this is like the page and it's.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.490
Get it now.

01:44.550 --> 01:50.190
And here is the everything so if someone wants to get anything they can just come here or they can just

01:50.250 --> 01:53.070
enter the information and then they're going to get it.

01:53.070 --> 01:59.040
So basically how does this work how you should create lead pages and why you should go with this so

01:59.040 --> 02:01.030
you can see if you have a lead based.

02:01.050 --> 02:07.470
Basically Trust me guys trust me you will receive that your sales will be 50 percent increase because

02:07.820 --> 02:09.850
lead pages work a lot.

02:09.870 --> 02:18.420
You not only get the customers what we say the e-mail but you also get to sell more product so you have

02:18.420 --> 02:19.710
to create a lead bid for that.

02:19.710 --> 02:23.470
So we are going to create a lead Bage.

02:23.580 --> 02:28.440
And now here I am just going to show you how to create so you can see these are just two examples of

02:28.440 --> 02:30.830
the lead pages if you want to get more.

02:30.840 --> 02:35.010
You can just go ahead you can just go to images right now and he should be seeing some of the lead page

02:35.010 --> 02:38.700
example you can see lead pages true pull in he can see lead pages.

02:38.700 --> 02:44.910
This is called The Lead pages lead pages can be like called as the page that drive you the sale.

02:44.910 --> 02:48.840
So we want it we want to get CLV doing everything for business.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.750
If I'm creating course I'm just earning money.

02:50.750 --> 02:51.640
That is what I'm doing.

02:51.870 --> 02:54.800
If you are just creating a Web site you want to earn money.

02:55.260 --> 02:58.650
So whatever we're doing we just want to earn money.

02:58.650 --> 03:03.240
That is why even the people who just create freak free Condren on YouTube they just earn money from

03:03.240 --> 03:04.640
the ads and everything.

03:04.830 --> 03:10.560
So I want to just earn money that is my main thing.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.140
OK.

03:11.250 --> 03:17.100
And if I have a product like if I have an e-commerce based website and I want to create a lead paid

03:17.100 --> 03:18.540
for being paid for that.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.880
So how will they do that.

03:19.890 --> 03:27.630
OK so let's suppose that I am doing a lead page for like on an iPhone or for a software or for something

03:27.630 --> 03:31.860
like that and I want to build a website and inside that I just need a form.

03:31.890 --> 03:38.970
So in that form the person just has to just enter his name his address has his name his last name and

03:38.970 --> 03:44.670
the email address and then he has to just sign up now and then after that we have to that give him the

03:44.670 --> 03:49.690
information that what was that an entrant or and what we are getting basically we are just getting his

03:49.710 --> 03:54.080
e-mail address and he's also buying something from us that is a great thing.

03:54.660 --> 03:54.920
OK.

03:54.930 --> 03:55.680
So let's get started.

03:55.680 --> 04:00.390
First of all what we have to do is that we need to go to WordPress right now and we have to install

04:00.390 --> 04:05.550
WordPress So I'm just going to go ahead and since this is the complete word press corps and I'm doing

04:05.580 --> 04:07.890
everything that relates WordPress to it.

04:07.890 --> 04:12.960
So since this is related to WordPress that is why I am teaching you that and even one of my students

04:12.960 --> 04:20.100
said that certain said that that if you are creating the complete course then you should add that so

04:20.120 --> 04:23.030
I'm just adding this just because it is related to WordPress.

04:23.220 --> 04:28.210
OK so those things that are related to WordPress since this lead page can be build on wordpress.

04:28.230 --> 04:29.460
That is why I'm showing you.

04:29.610 --> 04:33.380
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit site title and here I wanted to I want to just add

04:33.380 --> 04:38.450
a site titles and title is going to be lead page example.

04:40.070 --> 04:40.810
OK.

04:41.180 --> 04:46.970
I'm just going to enter my name and I'm here I want to add the password to

04:50.090 --> 04:50.680
I want to hide it

04:56.040 --> 04:58.080
and I'm here I want to enter the password.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.140
Oh sorry that email.

04:59.380 --> 05:04.090
And I want to go ahead and I want to just install WordPress so it should install WordPress in a minute

05:04.270 --> 05:05.920
and I can see the word Press is right here.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.330
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to log in.

05:07.330 --> 05:11.360
So if you do not know how to install WordPress then please watch the premise video.

05:11.470 --> 05:18.460
The video that tell you is how to install how to fit a theme or how to work the blog or how to just

05:18.460 --> 05:19.590
build a business website.

05:19.660 --> 05:25.330
So just make sure to go ahead and just see that page and then you will learn how to install WordPress

05:25.330 --> 05:27.430
manually with the database and everything.

05:27.450 --> 05:28.950
So make sure to go ahead and check that out.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.630
So now go ahead and let's just log ourself in the email of the things that we have here right.

05:33.640 --> 05:39.040
So I'm just going to enter the details right now and am just going to lock myself in so you can see

05:39.040 --> 05:44.110
everything is right here and here we just want to create a simple lead based solely because I don't

05:44.110 --> 05:44.910
have the menu.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.790
OK it's just a single page.

05:46.810 --> 05:49.380
You can create a website if you have so many pages.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.380
That is called basically a website.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.080
So there two guys there's a difference between laide page.

05:54.120 --> 05:58.560
There is a difference between the Web site and the lead page Leite page is just a single page.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.430
We don't have many.

05:59.430 --> 06:00.400
We don't have anything.

06:00.400 --> 06:06.880
This is just a page that describes your product so if this is my website OK and I want to create a lead

06:06.880 --> 06:09.010
page on this how will I do this.

06:09.040 --> 06:09.910
WordPress.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.830
So I'm going to show you what you have to do we have to just go to dashboard right now.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.980
OK and then you have to go to the permalink.

06:15.010 --> 06:19.360
Oh so OK we don't want to care about the permalink we don't want to care about anything because it is

06:19.360 --> 06:24.850
not related to dealings anything we just have to care about a theme and a plug in there we're going

06:24.850 --> 06:31.270
to use in this of to just work with that so we don't need any of the team OK.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.930
Yes yes yes yes yes.

06:32.950 --> 06:34.750
We don't need any of the team for that.

06:34.750 --> 06:39.370
OK we don't need the ocean we don't need anything we just need to plug in and that is called the elementary.

06:39.430 --> 06:45.430
OK so we have to just go ahead we have to just like for elementary and then we have to just hit this

06:45.730 --> 06:51.730
OK and now here we have to just install this elementary page builder.

06:51.740 --> 06:55.350
So I want to just install this right now and you can see it is installed.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.860
I'm just going to activate this right now and it should be activated so this is activated.

06:59.900 --> 07:06.020
What I have to do right now I just have to go to the pages and I have to go to all pages so and here

07:06.050 --> 07:09.520
I want to create a page and then I will assign that as the home page.

07:09.620 --> 07:13.520
But first what we have to do is that we need to install the procession of days in order to create delete

07:13.600 --> 07:19.020
pages guys because of the protrusion you cannot go further and you need to protiens.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.840
If you do not know how to get the protrusion then the video that you are watching right now you just

07:23.840 --> 07:26.000
have to open that up.

07:26.150 --> 07:30.260
So here as you can see Tay's resources available you have to just click it and then you have to click

07:30.260 --> 07:34.740
there and you can see that it's going to take you there and here to take your design to the next level.

07:34.790 --> 07:35.660
Make sure you buy it.

07:35.660 --> 07:40.260
You can write for business like for three websites or for personal and interest for one made say OK

07:40.460 --> 07:45.020
so you can buy any of the plan it is for a limited website so you have to just buy it and then you have

07:45.020 --> 07:47.180
to just go ahead into your account.

07:47.240 --> 07:51.500
You have to log yourself and in your account you have to download it so after you have downloaded it

07:51.680 --> 07:52.850
you're happy just upload it.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.470
I'm going to show you how you can upload it.

07:54.470 --> 07:58.690
We'll have to just go to the plug in time to hit add new and then you have to upload plug in.

07:58.760 --> 08:04.070
And then here you have to choose the file so I'm going to choose a file that will be the talk humans

08:04.120 --> 08:07.720
download and it should be elementary.

08:07.850 --> 08:11.270
So this is the one that I have downloaded right now and I'm just going to go with and I'm going to install

08:11.270 --> 08:14.230
now so this is the program and make sure that you.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.290
I just bite my cheeks.

08:16.310 --> 08:16.760
Oh my gawd

08:20.260 --> 08:23.400
so now you have to just go ahead and activate plug in.

08:23.670 --> 08:28.230
OK and I can see that the plug in has been activated to make sure that you don't go go and do that.

08:28.240 --> 08:28.700
OK.

08:28.810 --> 08:31.920
And now what we have to do is that we need to just go and create a page.

08:31.930 --> 08:32.490
OK.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.320
Make sure that you don't have any of the page.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.050
OK.

08:35.050 --> 08:36.370
Sorry sorry sorry sorry.

08:36.370 --> 08:37.440
I have to go back.

08:37.780 --> 08:39.760
And now we have to just trash it.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.150
OK.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.970
So make sure you don't have any Bage.

08:42.100 --> 08:47.240
You don't have any post go here and remove all the polls remove everything and do not care.

08:47.350 --> 08:47.770
OK.

08:47.890 --> 08:51.110
And now what we have to do is that we need to go to page and then we have to hit add.

08:51.130 --> 08:54.790
So in here I have to just create a new page and that will be my home page.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.220
And we just have to work with it.

08:56.260 --> 08:56.820
OK.

08:56.830 --> 09:02.750
You have to just go ahead and you have to hit publish right now and then you have to go to the settings.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.630
So here you can see this is the homepage right now.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.710
If I just open this up this is how it is looking.

09:06.710 --> 09:07.820
OK.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.710
If I just open the homepage but I want to assign this page as a homepage I'm just going to go to the

09:12.710 --> 09:14.650
city right now and I get to go to Reading.

09:14.660 --> 09:19.490
And then here I want to go ahead and I want to like this home page and it should be the home page and

09:19.490 --> 09:20.500
I'm going to save changes.

09:20.510 --> 09:21.660
And it should be done.

09:21.740 --> 09:25.750
So if I just come here and I just refreshed this and will see this is how my homepage looks.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.330
OK.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.890
Now here are the main page.

09:27.940 --> 09:33.200
Main thing starts and that is that how are we going to just make it the leading page so for that we

09:33.200 --> 09:36.730
have to just come here and that we have to go to.

09:36.860 --> 09:38.150
Pages and pages.

09:38.150 --> 09:46.000
Let me just close all these down so it doesn't just go make us like confuse.

09:46.000 --> 09:46.630
I'm just going to I'm here.

09:46.630 --> 09:47.930
I mean I'm just remove all this.

09:47.950 --> 09:48.480
OK.

09:48.550 --> 09:50.760
And then here I want to just go ahead and I want to get at it.

09:50.770 --> 09:53.240
So here I just want to add this.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.940
But first what I have to do I have to just click here and it's elementary can loss can mass.

09:58.060 --> 10:01.630
And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit update make sure that you select it so that it is now

10:01.630 --> 10:03.140
said to elementary canvass.

10:03.160 --> 10:08.650
And now if you just come here and you just view your page you can see this is just it is like it is

10:08.650 --> 10:09.800
looking like this.

10:09.820 --> 10:14.170
So now we have to just come here and we have to just select Edit that elementary and you can see it's

10:14.170 --> 10:15.080
going to take us here.

10:15.310 --> 10:18.740
And then here we're going to design our whole lead page basically.

10:18.850 --> 10:23.110
So now we can design everything we can design anything with that sig and see.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.400
This is like this.

10:24.400 --> 10:28.730
So first of all let's just come here and let's just see how does the lead page looks like so we have

10:28.730 --> 10:34.850
to just not just copy it but we first have to just look at the lead based that how does it look.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.730
Which type of thing we should focus on.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.790
How can we create it.

10:37.810 --> 10:44.380
And so because I just create a website I just look at the other website and I just can just have get

10:44.380 --> 10:44.900
the idea.

10:44.900 --> 10:50.290
So since this is my first experience with the elements we're creating an leading piece that is why I

10:50.290 --> 10:52.170
did not have any of that experience.

10:52.580 --> 10:52.910
So

10:56.110 --> 10:58.170
you can see this is the lead that we can go ahead.

10:58.180 --> 10:58.850
OK.

10:58.990 --> 10:59.760
Just like this.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.570
This is the arrow.

11:00.570 --> 11:01.530
This is like this.

11:01.540 --> 11:04.610
And so you can just create it like a single page with that.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.610
OK.

11:05.670 --> 11:06.150
So

11:10.170 --> 11:12.600
you can also include the pricing table and something like that.

11:12.600 --> 11:19.590
So let's just go ahead and let's just click here and let's just add a title here first so I just want

11:19.590 --> 11:24.760
to go ahead and I want to just add a template so let's see if we have any of the template for that.

11:24.780 --> 11:27.410
So because I'm treating that is so hard for me.

11:27.630 --> 11:34.710
So if you have a nap any you need I'm like that a lead bid for that you just can just go ahead and insert

11:34.710 --> 11:35.040
it.

11:35.190 --> 11:39.450
Or if you have a product so you can just go ahead and you know I was just inserted.

11:39.650 --> 11:40.160
OK.

11:40.170 --> 11:44.940
So this is how it is looking we have fitness home page restaurant

11:47.730 --> 11:48.390
agency

11:53.490 --> 11:54.540
which one to go

12:05.580 --> 12:07.340
OK let's just go ahead and let's design it.

12:07.410 --> 12:07.960
OK.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.210
I mean I think we should design some.

12:09.230 --> 12:09.930
I'm just going to go ahead.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.510
I'm just going to add this right here and first thing I want to go ahead.

12:13.530 --> 12:14.820
I just need a background image.

12:14.840 --> 12:20.250
So the background image is not the image I need the color so the color is going to be a classic and

12:20.250 --> 12:21.840
I want it to be the blue.

12:21.860 --> 12:28.350
So blue blue I need.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.810
I think it looks pretty cool.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.090
If I just click here you can see this will be right here above.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.950
So now here I just want to add titles.

12:36.070 --> 12:42.880
So the title is going to be a heading basically and that will be like lead page example so you can just

12:42.910 --> 12:43.490
enter this.

12:43.510 --> 12:46.090
You can just enter your thing that you want to add.

12:46.090 --> 12:51.550
So I'm like if I am creating a lead page for the word press complete complete WordPress course complete

12:53.040 --> 12:57.300
word press of course.

12:57.740 --> 12:58.030
OK.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.050
This is like here.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.630
I'm just going to bring it right here.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.620
And so now let's click this and see.

13:03.730 --> 13:04.490
This is right here.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.410
This is complete press corps.

13:06.590 --> 13:07.590
Everything is here.

13:07.840 --> 13:12.250
So first of all what I have to do I have just come here and I have to just select the color for the

13:12.250 --> 13:14.140
color is going to be white.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.990
So this looks pretty cool right now.

13:16.200 --> 13:16.410
OK.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.520
You can also make it bogs if you want to.

13:18.610 --> 13:18.950
OK.

13:18.960 --> 13:19.680
How you can do that.

13:19.690 --> 13:23.980
You just have to come here to the content and basically select the whole style.

13:24.160 --> 13:24.540
OK.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.390
And then you have to come here to the content.

13:26.410 --> 13:32.370
So Condon said you can just get up but come here and you have this raid here and the columns gap so

13:32.380 --> 13:36.940
you can also stretch it and you can just pretty well very good at that how you want it to be so you

13:36.940 --> 13:39.580
can see there's a box layout but I don't want it to be the box.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.300
I just want it to be full of it.

13:41.790 --> 13:43.030
OK.

13:43.230 --> 13:43.860
Here it is.

13:43.870 --> 13:48.340
This is just looking OK and everything pretty well looks cool.

13:48.340 --> 13:50.090
So if you wanted to be the box.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.670
I want to show you how you can do that.

13:51.670 --> 13:53.920
So first of all what you have to do is just come here.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.770
You have to just copy this color code.

13:55.810 --> 13:56.220
OK.

13:56.350 --> 14:00.560
How to just copy it and then you have to come here just clear it.

14:00.690 --> 14:06.670
OK and let's him here and let's just skim here into the box and in here we have to just assignats of

14:06.700 --> 14:06.900
it.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.690
So this let's suppose this is it.

14:08.890 --> 14:13.750
And now I have to go to the edit column and now in the column I have to go to the style and I may have

14:13.750 --> 14:18.370
to apply the water color shell in this raid here I can just add the water colors and this will be like

14:18.370 --> 14:25.860
that so you can just make sure that your lead page will be of this size so you can just control the

14:25.860 --> 14:27.610
size that how you want the size to be.

14:27.630 --> 14:31.140
But since I wanted to be the full bitrate now so I'm just going to make it for that I'm just going to

14:31.140 --> 14:35.090
add the header here and this will be applied to this whole section so I'm just going to go I'm here

14:35.100 --> 14:36.980
I'm just going to come here I'm going to taste it.

14:37.050 --> 14:41.430
I'm just going to I'm here and I'm going to paste the code right here so that it matches everything

14:41.430 --> 14:42.700
and it works pretty cool.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.520
OK.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.680
Now we're done with this in the next section.

14:45.690 --> 14:51.180
We can just add a two column row where we can add some headings and then we can add some videos right

14:51.180 --> 14:53.450
here so that we can just manipulate everything.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.230
I'm just going at it right now and I can see two sections are EDID right now.

14:57.270 --> 15:01.650
First thing we want to add would be.

15:03.700 --> 15:04.590
The heading.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.140
OK.

15:05.180 --> 15:09.860
And then here I want to video oranges here should be the video and then here would be heading in that

15:09.860 --> 15:12.530
content so I'll just go ahead and shoot at the video.

15:12.530 --> 15:15.320
So in the video we can just add any of the video.

15:15.390 --> 15:20.480
OK let's just come here and can see this is the video that is already here at this elementary place

15:20.480 --> 15:21.420
holder video.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.330
OK.

15:22.370 --> 15:23.470
This is the video break here.

15:23.480 --> 15:27.600
This is already coming so you can just basically add any video instead of this.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.770
I'm just using this one to just show you how it's going work.

15:30.770 --> 15:34.990
Oh let's just go ahead and let's just go to YouTube to get some video so I'm just going to go ahead.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.510
I'm just going to go in search for explainer videos explainer video animation.

15:41.510 --> 15:45.200
So you have to basically create these explainer videos in order for it to work.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.400
So I just need the short video ever.

15:47.690 --> 15:48.410
That's going to work.

15:48.410 --> 15:49.960
So I'm just glad I'm here.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.720
Let's just go with this one.

15:51.740 --> 15:57.770
This is a business owner advertising in mainstream media will cost you an arm and a leg and you can

15:57.770 --> 16:01.460
opt for cheaper alternatives like printing and distributing flyers.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.250
But it's difficult to measure the performance.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.040
You've heard about new media.

16:06.340 --> 16:06.620
OK.

16:06.710 --> 16:10.010
I'm just I'm here I'm going to copy all this and I'm going to come here and I'm going to paste it right

16:10.010 --> 16:10.220
here.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.300
So let's just get him here.

16:11.300 --> 16:18.200
Let's select all spaced spaced and here you can see this is right here animated explainer video so this

16:18.200 --> 16:19.110
is the explainer video.

16:19.110 --> 16:24.470
Make sure that you have any for you are of course content or for that so you can see it right here and

16:24.470 --> 16:25.980
here I need some content.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.570
And then here I need a call to action are numbered.

16:28.560 --> 16:34.520
And so if someone just enters his information to add then that information will be just giving him a

16:34.520 --> 16:37.290
20 percent discount or something like that so there's that right here.

16:37.350 --> 16:37.660
OK.

16:37.710 --> 16:42.870
And now here I need to add some like the text or something like that.

16:43.040 --> 16:48.050
So first I just want to come here and I want to add a background so for the background and I want to

16:48.050 --> 16:53.030
come here and I want to select the classic And I want to color show the colors that I want right here

16:53.120 --> 16:54.110
is going to be

17:00.100 --> 17:08.480
like green so mostly people do prefer that when you are creating a lead page make sure that you use

17:08.710 --> 17:14.820
green because green as like for success or for something like that so you will be just using up at this

17:14.820 --> 17:15.600
rate here.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.290
So this is just an example you.

17:17.310 --> 17:20.370
You guys now already know that how you can design anything.

17:20.370 --> 17:24.270
So I'm just telling you an example that how lead pages work how.

17:24.420 --> 17:28.140
And what is the reason behind creating a lead page and why we should create it.

17:28.140 --> 17:31.520
So this is right here and now here I want to add one more show.

17:31.650 --> 17:32.990
This would be like a heading here.

17:33.000 --> 17:42.140
And then I want to sail like something like that so this will be like heading and the best it should

17:42.140 --> 17:43.860
be like a best.

17:44.010 --> 17:44.690
They did.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.020
Of course.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.360
So this is right here.

17:48.380 --> 17:53.180
I'm just going to I'm here and here I want to just I need to center.

17:53.490 --> 17:53.790
OK.

17:53.790 --> 17:54.530
I want to go ahead.

17:54.540 --> 17:58.640
I want to just come here and I'm going to change the color of this so there's the color right now.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.090
Let's make it full.

18:01.100 --> 18:01.650
White.

18:01.670 --> 18:02.240
OK.

18:02.240 --> 18:02.700
This is here.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.430
I want to go ahead and I want five stars right below.

18:07.430 --> 18:12.560
So for that I want to just go ahead and I want I like to call them so select the columns right here

18:12.590 --> 18:15.760
and let's just drag it right here so you can see these columns are here.

18:15.770 --> 18:17.920
I want to come here Ellen just to placate.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.430
OK.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.040
Let's just get him here just delete it.

18:20.270 --> 18:24.490
And I want to just go ahead I want to select this and I want to go ahead and I need an icon.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.860
So I want to just bring it right here and you can see this icon is right here.

18:27.860 --> 18:29.300
So this is a star icon.

18:29.420 --> 18:29.840
OK.

18:29.930 --> 18:36.170
I need five star reviews so five star and the color color of the star is going to be white black blue

18:36.380 --> 18:37.970
or yellow or anything that you want to add.

18:37.970 --> 18:45.470
So I want to just change a primary color and it can be like Yellow Black Blue to be yellow.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.520
So it just mass matches this.

18:47.520 --> 18:47.940
OK.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.270
I want to make it full yellow.

18:49.330 --> 18:50.750
This is right here.

18:51.390 --> 18:57.510
What I want to do right now is that I want to go to disarm now or someone bring this Mauser worry that

18:57.510 --> 18:58.460
I need some effects.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.050
OK.

18:59.350 --> 19:02.640
Icon and Holbert So if someone brings a spouse or married then it should turn to crime.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.290
So if so many mouse you can see this is gone.

19:05.280 --> 19:11.310
So this does give a big impact to make sure that you have a little bit of hoovering animation.

19:11.340 --> 19:12.710
So you say to that you're busy.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.680
Feels good.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.210
OK.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.920
And if you say it feels good your client will feel good.

19:16.930 --> 19:19.570
And if your client feels good he will buy a product.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.500
Make sure to just focus on that.

19:21.510 --> 19:22.000
OK.

19:22.140 --> 19:25.690
Now what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go ahead and I want to go ahead and I want to get

19:25.750 --> 19:28.260
colon duplicate can duplicate Tom duplicate.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.670
So you can see that we have five columns right now and this is how it is coming

19:34.620 --> 19:38.830
so you can see how it is looking if I just bring memos where it you can see this is coming or read this

19:38.860 --> 19:42.940
but I just want to come here and I want to chillum just decrease the size of it.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.390
So I want to go ahead.

19:44.410 --> 19:57.500
I want to just change this I use this to be more columns gapping should be like white capping.

19:58.220 --> 20:01.430
OK this is it I think is fine.

20:01.970 --> 20:02.780
OK.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.480
We also want to make sure

20:09.590 --> 20:15.840
extended.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.770
So I think this one the writer looks cool.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.830
So this looks pretty cool.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.850
OK we have the best rated course.

20:22.880 --> 20:26.430
And then we have everything right now so you can see how this is looking.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.490
OK.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.010
Now here I just want to add one more thing.

20:30.020 --> 20:36.350
So it should be like a call to action like get 90 percent off or 20 percent off or 10 percent off or

20:36.350 --> 20:36.980
something like that.

20:36.980 --> 20:41.800
So here I'm just going to come here and I need a button.

20:41.810 --> 20:42.170
OK.

20:42.170 --> 20:46.720
And that button will be sewed for the burden.

20:46.730 --> 20:50.380
I have to crop this so I just want to drag a trumpet grade here.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.240
And the burden should be appearing.

20:52.490 --> 20:53.250
OK.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.720
We're going to drag it right here and you can see it's like me.

20:56.870 --> 21:00.220
So here I need to just slide into center OK.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.040
And I want it to be precise.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.540
This is just good style.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.930
And let's just design this so the background color should be the red

21:13.180 --> 21:14.180
OK.

21:16.750 --> 21:17.990
The background color is red.

21:18.040 --> 21:23.060
And on Hoeber it should do the background color should be removed.

21:23.260 --> 21:23.680
OK.

21:23.680 --> 21:27.290
So if I just bring memos sure you can see that there is no bar colors.

21:27.310 --> 21:30.600
This is looking OK and it looks pretty cool.

21:30.610 --> 21:34.810
I want to just go ahead and I want to give some padding so just give some padding so.

21:34.940 --> 21:35.290
OK.

21:35.290 --> 21:36.810
This is the spelling sorry.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.620
Sorry guys I just want to go ahead.

21:38.620 --> 21:43.270
I want to go to advance and I want to give some margin to the top so it should be 25 pixels so you can

21:43.270 --> 21:45.140
see we have some margin.

21:45.190 --> 21:45.450
OK.

21:45.450 --> 21:47.670
And then we have to come here to the content right here.

21:47.680 --> 21:52.670
And I want to just come here and it should be like click me instead of me.

21:52.670 --> 21:56.320
It should be like GRABBE

21:58.820 --> 22:04.670
line complete work press

22:08.930 --> 22:12.340
for dollar.

22:12.740 --> 22:13.400
OK.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.570
So here you can see this is learn complete WordPress for a hundred dollars.

22:18.580 --> 22:19.080
OK.

22:19.180 --> 22:23.820
And if I just come here and I want to make it like extra large you can see a complete WordPress $400

22:23.910 --> 22:24.920
if someone clicks it.

22:25.270 --> 22:26.790
It's going to take us to the down page.

22:26.790 --> 22:32.030
So here in the down section we need that farm sign up for.

22:32.140 --> 22:32.490
OK.

22:32.590 --> 22:35.720
So this here I need a full freight now.

22:35.980 --> 22:41.910
OK and in here I just need a title and this would be the animated title.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.140
So the animated title is going to be like

22:47.300 --> 22:48.050
yes.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.860
So this is right here.

22:49.860 --> 22:56.780
I want to come here and I want to just select it to be like a circle another circle but it should be

22:56.780 --> 22:58.160
like strikethrough.

22:58.270 --> 22:59.630
Now this strikethrough what it should be like.

22:59.630 --> 23:01.160
EX OK.

23:01.190 --> 23:02.160
This is this looks cool.

23:02.300 --> 23:10.540
So when I come here and this should be like this and it should be like dollar hundred three dollar 200.

23:10.910 --> 23:15.350
And here I just want to add the dollar hundreds.

23:15.410 --> 23:20.080
So this is like this so you can just design it the way you want it to be.

23:20.090 --> 23:20.780
OK so you can see.

23:20.780 --> 23:26.150
You can also bring it right here if you want to like it just bring it right above here you can see how

23:26.150 --> 23:27.180
this is going to look.

23:27.440 --> 23:27.710
OK.

23:27.710 --> 23:31.790
I want to come here I want to come here and I just want to get this time right now.

23:32.000 --> 23:44.510
I want to change the color of the shape so the shape color is going to be the red.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.900
So you can see the shape color is not red.

23:46.950 --> 23:50.200
I want it to be in the front so it should just cross it totally.

23:50.320 --> 23:50.850
OK.

23:50.860 --> 23:54.970
And then we have the round edges so you can also round the edges and we have the vet so if you want

23:54.970 --> 23:57.200
to increase the bit you can increase the bit.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.700
So I think this much looks cool.

23:58.900 --> 23:59.140
OK.

23:59.140 --> 24:00.420
And this is like here.

24:00.420 --> 24:06.010
So the headline in the headline we have the text colors so the text color in the headline should be

24:06.040 --> 24:06.900
a full screen.

24:07.100 --> 24:15.670
So since the green is like already green so many changes to be yellow and we can see how crazy it looks.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.250
OK.

24:16.490 --> 24:17.980
$20 $290.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.340
Cities are in complete WordPress forages 200 bucks.

24:21.550 --> 24:23.190
And then we have the meeting.

24:23.350 --> 24:24.720
The meeting starts here.

24:24.730 --> 24:25.630
I want to just add it.

24:25.720 --> 24:31.300
Fill the form below fill the form below to get the access so I'm here.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.200
I just want to add something.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.340
Now today is

24:39.420 --> 24:43.450
you can also add the price table if you want to like on adding the price table.

24:43.470 --> 24:48.110
And if someone just added so if you are selling anything you can also add the price table.

24:48.150 --> 24:54.410
But I just want to add the code so for Dad I just want to create an a list of the email marketing.

24:54.610 --> 24:55.250
OK.

24:55.290 --> 25:01.160
And then here if someone subscribed to that list I also want to send a coupon code for my course that

25:01.180 --> 25:09.000
will give him like 50 percent off and then I will also get his e-mail address so if he just subscribed

25:09.000 --> 25:16.620
to Ed than if you just buy him a course basically if you just buy my course with that link then he will

25:16.620 --> 25:21.770
be like automatically tene taken to the next e-mail address so basically.

25:21.780 --> 25:24.180
Now what we have to do is that we need to.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.460
So you can see everything looks pretty cool.

25:26.520 --> 25:31.860
You can also work with this like if you want to go ahead and you want to add something here or you can

25:31.860 --> 25:36.190
just go to Stylo right now and you get to go to advance section and.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.000
OK.

25:37.200 --> 25:43.020
I want to just go ahead and I want to edit this whole budget so I can also just go with like player

25:43.020 --> 25:44.040
or title and action.

25:44.040 --> 25:49.260
So if I just remove it you can see there would be no player title and action series just this right

25:49.260 --> 25:51.210
here the play button and the YouTube itself.

25:51.240 --> 25:51.990
OK.

25:52.110 --> 25:56.240
So then we have the image overlay if you want to add the image overlay you can also add the image will

25:56.230 --> 25:59.310
look like if you want to add any other image you can do at it.

25:59.320 --> 26:02.280
So if I want to add something like

26:12.120 --> 26:14.090
all let's suppose that I need this image OK.

26:14.210 --> 26:15.090
And I just upload it.

26:15.090 --> 26:18.500
So then after uploading it you'll see this will be here.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.930
So this is right here.

26:24.850 --> 26:25.380
OK.

26:25.540 --> 26:26.610
Let me choose another image.

26:26.620 --> 26:31.940
I'm just going to click select files and I'm going to go to the desktop right now and in here let's

26:31.950 --> 26:32.680
like any other.

26:32.680 --> 26:38.460
So let's suppose that I just want to add this image so I can just add the whole overlay effect.

26:38.650 --> 26:40.630
And then here you can see this image would be here.

26:40.630 --> 26:46.360
So then I can just insert the media so on disinterring it you will see this image will be the background

26:46.360 --> 26:49.570
image and the play button would be coming on that image.

26:49.570 --> 26:55.230
So let's just insert media and see how this image will look so let's see

26:58.730 --> 27:03.800
play icon should be is OK and then we have the Lightbox So if you select this and then we just click

27:03.800 --> 27:08.020
the image you'll see that the image will be like that so you can see this is how this is looking.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.330
We have the play icon as well.

27:10.430 --> 27:10.960
OK.

27:10.970 --> 27:15.280
And then if someone clicks it you can see this is turning into the a business.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.570
So this is how it works.

27:16.590 --> 27:19.450
OK you can pretty well just open this up in a light box as well.

27:19.460 --> 27:24.260
So if someone just opened this up that light box will be popped up onto the screen and then it'll work.

27:24.260 --> 27:29.870
So I'm if I just open this up you can see the light boxes here.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.800
You can pretty well do that as well.

27:31.820 --> 27:32.570
I'm just going to come here.

27:32.570 --> 27:37.850
I'm just going to edit this whole widget again and then I want to go to the Lightbox So here you can

27:37.850 --> 27:42.310
just design that how you want the light box to be how you want it to be the top position the entrance

27:42.320 --> 27:43.560
animation as well.

27:43.700 --> 27:51.230
And then we have the background color and we also have the background OK the background the background.

27:51.390 --> 27:55.790
I want to go ahead in this.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.440
And then we have the border right here.

27:57.450 --> 28:00.640
So you can also give the border that how you wanted the border to be.

28:00.660 --> 28:05.510
So I just wanted to be solid so you can see that a border is right here and in here you can just work

28:05.510 --> 28:05.790
with it.

28:05.790 --> 28:12.130
So you also have your responsiveness you can hide on tablet desktop and everything.

28:12.270 --> 28:13.760
And you also have to customize the SS.

28:13.780 --> 28:17.640
You can see everything looks pretty cool and amazing.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.210
OK so now we're totally done with this.

28:21.290 --> 28:23.210
Now here we want to design this so.

28:23.300 --> 28:27.620
But first let's just come here and let's make it the full that so let's just make it full of it or just

28:27.620 --> 28:32.350
let's just give some padding to the top so I'm just going to give some padding to the top and the bottom.

28:32.450 --> 28:32.900
OK.

28:32.990 --> 28:38.640
I want to come here I want to give some padding and in here I want to give 100 trouting to the bottom.

28:38.630 --> 28:40.090
So this is like this.

28:40.100 --> 28:40.680
OK.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.240
This is like this.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.720
It looks pretty cool.

28:43.730 --> 28:48.050
I want to come here I want to change the style of the headings so I want to Stern on the topography

28:48.140 --> 28:51.750
and here I wanted to be the families to be open and

28:54.620 --> 28:55.970
and here is your telescope.

28:56.690 --> 28:57.240
OK.

28:57.310 --> 28:59.120
And I want to wait to be 100.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.410
So it should be just like that.

29:01.660 --> 29:08.780
And just increase the size so it is best rated course so it is learn the complete word press for $10.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.180
And this is the promo video that you can this add on the explainer video.

29:12.250 --> 29:19.420
And in here we want to give some first of all we have to just dumb give the ID this idea so it should

29:19.420 --> 29:21.030
be like hash tag go.

29:21.150 --> 29:24.250
OK sorry hash go.

29:24.360 --> 29:24.760
OK.

29:24.940 --> 29:28.490
And in here I want to just add the link so it should be hash goes.

29:28.510 --> 29:30.960
If someone places then he should be taken down.

29:31.030 --> 29:37.610
And here we want to add some stuff so you can add it like I'm pretty well a counter here.

29:37.770 --> 29:38.080
OK.

29:38.080 --> 29:38.800
That means like

29:46.710 --> 29:54.680
grab and grab this for now.

29:55.530 --> 29:55.890
OK.

29:56.050 --> 30:01.840

30:01.840 --> 30:03.720
word press guys seriously.

30:03.790 --> 30:04.870

30:22.960 --> 30:25.690
And we can also choose it to be the blue color purple.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.320
So it totally depends.

30:27.370 --> 30:31.780
But I just want to go with the black color and I want the typography.

30:31.810 --> 30:35.320
So let's just hit typography on and let's increase the size.
