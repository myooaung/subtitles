I just really like it.

03:17.020 --> 03:17.340

This is right here and I want it to be 30 days so we have 30 days left for sale and 22 are.

03:45.240 --> 03:49.140
So you can change it like it will be on 19 Jan..

03:49.360 --> 03:56.290
So we have 19 and we can also change it to 31 and you'll see that will be increased.

03:56.350 --> 04:01.900
We have 42 days 22 hours and 20 minutes and 13 seconds so this is going to be block.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.880
You can also choose to be in line.

04:03.970 --> 04:05.260
So it looks great.

Twenty two minutes and 1959 seconds and this is how it's going to work.

04:14.470 --> 04:15.660
But I'm just going to add it.

04:15.940 --> 04:20.050
And we have this show label so you can also just hide it and the label will not be shown.

04:20.050 --> 04:21.480
So this is how it's going to work.

04:21.610 --> 04:25.540
But I want to show the label then you can also choose it to be like custom labels so you can change

04:25.540 --> 04:30.950

04:37.060 --> 04:38.820
You can also move all of that.

04:39.100 --> 04:43.210
I'm not going to come here and there's going to be no custom labeling the default labeling should be

04:43.210 --> 04:44.030
here.

04:44.090 --> 04:45.730
Now what good is style right here.

04:45.730 --> 04:50.160
And then we have the container so you can change the container of it to be like how you want it to be.

04:50.230 --> 04:52.160
But I just want it to be 100 percent.

04:52.270 --> 04:57.610
OK you can continue to be like pig so if you need it on pixel basis you can just increase it and then

04:57.620 --> 04:59.610
your container of it would be OK.

04:59.620 --> 05:04.300
But I read on it on the person daj basis that it should be 100 percent OK.

05:04.420 --> 05:09.670
And then we have the background color for the boxes so it can change how the background color is going

05:09.670 --> 05:10.240
to look like.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.640
I just want it to be a bit of pre OK.

05:13.880 --> 05:19.200
Or you can make it to be like full Fullbright.

05:19.360 --> 05:19.870
OK.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.210
And the water sorry.

05:23.380 --> 05:24.890
Let's come here to the water here.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.720
And I want to give some water so let's just give one pixel to everything.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.130
The water should be solid.

05:30.190 --> 05:32.650
So here should be the water right here.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.240
OK let's give one pixel to everything.

05:37.790 --> 05:40.570
And the color is going to be black.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.150
So here we have the water right here.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.570
But I don't think so if I need the water we can lower the Dasht one.

05:46.730 --> 05:48.450
Let's just make it month OK.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.110

05:51.110 --> 05:52.990
So here is my digital label.

05:53.060 --> 05:54.890
So I want to make it this way.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.380
And then we have that color.

05:56.390 --> 06:04.740
So I want it to be the blue.

06:05.030 --> 06:05.750
Let's here.

06:05.980 --> 06:06.750
Let's come here.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.500

So this looks cool.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.130

You can make a full red if you want to but I'm going to make it a little bit Faid OK.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.680
This is how it is looking for the two days left.

06:18.700 --> 06:23.680
And there's days left for the sale to end and then the sale will be and the sale will be from here.

06:23.770 --> 06:27.030
So you guys already know that how long you want to schedule the sale.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.610
You guys already know about the scheduling so make sure you keep it simple.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.910
If you are adding the counter make sure that you add it here as well.

06:33.910 --> 06:39.480
That sale will be and after 42 days in this month so make sure to just add it and implement it.

06:39.490 --> 06:43.150
And you guys already know about how to implement it if you still don't know.

13:13.010 --> 13:16.240
It's on time.

13:19.730 --> 13:22.770
Cause I want the image so the image is going to be the person image.

13:22.770 --> 13:23.960
So I need the person.

13:23.960 --> 13:29.730
So for a person I have my self image that I always use when I am adding a person image so I'm going

13:29.730 --> 13:33.540
to go to this right here this way here.

13:35.090 --> 13:36.890
Landing Page just one.

Me.

13:40.270 --> 13:42.120
So this is coming right here.

13:42.290 --> 13:46.700
You can see Booster is the best shot I've ever seen it deliver products on time.

13:46.740 --> 13:50.610
OK we have the slide number one seem like this we have to work on number two.

13:50.650 --> 13:51.940
I want to upload the image first.

13:51.950 --> 13:56.330
I don't want to edit the content so I'm going to come here right now and I want to upload the image

13:56.360 --> 13:59.840
so they can see the images would be uploaded now.

14:00.380 --> 14:05.400
OK what I have to do right now we have the skin so skin is going to be difficult.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.840
And we also have the bubble.

14:07.070 --> 14:10.180
So let's just have the bubble skin so you can see this is how the bubble works.

14:12.910 --> 14:15.540
We have to lay that saves a change in line.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.440
I mean stacked.

14:16.710 --> 14:17.240
OK.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.670
This is like this image above

14:22.350 --> 14:22.700
OK.

14:22.750 --> 14:23.410
It means left

14:26.270 --> 14:27.500
and we have the main trait.

14:27.510 --> 14:30.070
So I think you mean life like Scott.

14:30.350 --> 14:32.830
Let's just go with the image in line I think

14:35.520 --> 14:41.670
yes let's get slide's purview is going to be to see you can show two slides Burby you can see how this

14:41.670 --> 14:44.690
is looking OK.

14:44.830 --> 14:45.820
This is cool.

14:45.950 --> 14:46.960
I have the bed tray here.

14:46.960 --> 14:47.890
I can also change the bed.

14:47.930 --> 14:53.930
And I have some additional options that we have so you can show the arrows or hide it and you get on

14:53.930 --> 14:54.400
of late.

14:54.410 --> 14:58.760
And then we have the nation you nation is going to be dots so you can just remove it.

14:58.760 --> 15:07.000
You can also make the fractions of fraction on fraction bases that page nation would be and the progress.

15:07.070 --> 15:11.400
OK so transition duration is going to be 500 milliseconds.

15:11.860 --> 15:14.770
OK and the auto speed is this infinite loop.

15:14.770 --> 15:19.530
So if you just click here you can see it's going to take 500 milliseconds to just go it like Privett

15:19.530 --> 15:20.960
just like a half of second.

15:21.160 --> 15:21.700
OK.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.120
So this is how it's going to work.

15:23.230 --> 15:27.760
And then let's come here to the slides and let's just duplicate them duplicate duplicate duplicate duplicate

15:27.760 --> 15:28.460
duplicate.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.990
We have so many slides right here.

15:30.090 --> 15:30.670
OK.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.570
I'm just going to go I'm here.

15:31.570 --> 15:32.530

15:32.530 --> 15:37.720
Do it like just to do it and you can see we have this like this testimonial.

15:37.740 --> 15:42.560
So if I just click here and we can see how this is looking so we have borders.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.460
Slay your customer testimonials.

15:44.610 --> 15:49.630
And you can see this is tabard that is the progress of the testimonial.

15:49.630 --> 15:51.290
So this is increasing.

15:51.350 --> 15:58.700
OK I'm going to go to the additional option and we have the page anation so I'm going to go to Steinway

15:58.750 --> 16:01.260
here and we have the navigation.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.160
So we have the nation Tabaret here.

16:03.160 --> 16:07.700
I'm going to change the color of this to white gray.

16:07.830 --> 16:09.970
Oh it seems to be Chri.

16:10.150 --> 16:13.130
So now let's come here and let's just make it full of it.

16:13.380 --> 16:14.760
Now it would be visible to you.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.440
Let's see it.

16:15.460 --> 16:16.110
Let's see.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.180
You can see how this nation is looking.

16:18.190 --> 16:21.390
So this is increasing the way we want it.

16:21.430 --> 16:26.860
So we also have this like we can also drag and drop it right here and it can see how this testimonial

16:26.860 --> 16:28.010
is increasing.

16:28.060 --> 16:31.520
So you can also delete some of the more testimonials that you want to delete.

16:33.220 --> 16:38.840
OK and we have just four to four and for four we have just two of the testimony.

16:39.060 --> 16:39.910
OK.

16:40.690 --> 16:43.550
Now we're done with this.

16:44.140 --> 16:46.790
We have to give some betting to the top to the bottom.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.090
That is also important.

16:48.130 --> 16:53.410
So I'm going to go to the Steinway here and I want to go to the advance and the bottom should be for

16:53.410 --> 16:55.740
the pixel turned turtle.

16:56.080 --> 16:56.490

16:56.630 --> 16:59.020
All the 40.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.490
OK what Boost your customers say.

17:01.740 --> 17:04.730
So you can see everything is totally up and running.

17:04.740 --> 17:09.250
We can also design this if you want to we can make it like a bit much changed.

17:09.390 --> 17:13.250
If I just go to the content and the

17:16.570 --> 17:19.450
SO WE HAVE THE BACK FROM colors Let's change the background color of this.

17:19.450 --> 17:20.940

OK.

17:29.040 --> 17:29.340
Sorry.

17:29.350 --> 17:30.310
This is the title.

17:30.310 --> 17:30.550
OK.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.510
And then we have the image.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.180
So this is the image size and everything.

17:34.330 --> 17:35.560
And this is the bubble right here.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.130
So I want I want to change the color of the bubble a bit.

17:58.260 --> 17:59.690

17:59.690 --> 18:02.470
We can also assign the bottom to it if you want to.

18:02.490 --> 18:07.530
So we can increase the border size but I don't want to assign any border so you can see we're done with

18:07.530 --> 18:09.260
that testimonial right now.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.510
This is how our website is looking.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.850
I want to bring this down below.

19:20.850 --> 19:22.540
You can see this is how it is looking.

19:22.590 --> 19:26.790
I don't want to duplicate it so obligated to placate duplicate.

19:26.820 --> 19:29.160

22:19.880 --> 22:20.770
It is on this.

22:20.950 --> 22:21.490
OK.

22:21.620 --> 22:25.720
The letter spacing so a letter spacing is not recommended I think.

22:25.880 --> 22:30.160
I want to go to icon and I want to give some speccing.

22:30.340 --> 22:31.530
So this comes to descenders.

22:31.540 --> 22:34.660
She can see everything looks cool right now.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.340
Now now we have to work on the designing of this.

22:37.390 --> 22:42.100
First of all what we have to do is that we need to come here to this section right here on the content

22:42.130 --> 22:43.760
box to be full for it.

22:44.040 --> 22:44.460
OK.

22:44.530 --> 22:53.010
So you can see this is now full at I want this to be center left

22:56.100 --> 23:06.950
what we have to do now is that we need to get the style.

23:07.950 --> 23:08.380
OK.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.660
Now we have to design this.

23:09.670 --> 23:10.400
I'm going to come here.

23:10.450 --> 23:13.830
I'm just going to click here and I'm going to hit this and fidget.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.990
No no no no no wait just come here.

23:16.030 --> 23:18.620
Let's just edit this column OK.

23:18.760 --> 23:23.460
And I want to go to style and I want to change the column color so call and color is going to be black.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.040
OK.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.970
Let's make it black.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.910
Black looks cool.

23:29.210 --> 23:29.440
OK.

23:29.440 --> 23:36.700
You can see how this column is OK if someone brings his mouse over it then the color is going to be

23:36.700 --> 23:41.290
changed and the color of it be not the image the color would be

23:48.150 --> 23:50.940
the color would be white white.

23:50.940 --> 23:51.640
Looks school.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.420
OK so I can see everything looks cool.

23:53.420 --> 23:56.970
So what I'm going to do now I'm just going to come here and I'm going to duplicate this column.

23:57.120 --> 23:57.680
OK.

23:57.780 --> 24:01.590
I'm going to duplicate this color and duplicatable again you can see that we have for a here and I'm

24:01.590 --> 24:02.640
going to delete this column.

24:02.820 --> 24:04.920
So I'll just hit delete.

24:05.030 --> 24:05.780
Let's just hit delete.

24:05.790 --> 24:08.290
You can see we have three services right here.

24:08.670 --> 24:09.420
OK.

24:09.420 --> 24:12.330
We have seen that delivery same delivery same to the liberty so that is going to be

24:15.060 --> 24:20.410
24 7 support.

24:21.010 --> 24:21.300
OK.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.190
And the car.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.960
So this should be a headphone right here.

24:24.150 --> 24:28.320
I just need a headphone and this should be

24:35.150 --> 24:38.990
gift packaging awesome packaging.

24:46.080 --> 24:50.220
I'm just going to I'm here and I need gift.

24:50.250 --> 24:50.760
Here we go.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.960

So this looks seriously amazing guys.

25:03.820 --> 25:05.770
And I just like this design.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.290
So you can see we have free services and everything.

25:08.380 --> 25:11.270
And I can see that we are totally done with the home page.

25:11.350 --> 25:15.240
I just like it so much so you can see everything looks cool.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.790
Everything looks well here.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.810
I just I just don't like this divider because this is right here.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.120
So I think we should move to a divider from here.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.720
So let's come here and let's just remove it.

25:24.730 --> 25:25.270
OK.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.210
This looks cool.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.160
So I'm just going to go ahead.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.230
I'm going to see if you can see that we were totally done with the home page and the next video will

25:31.240 --> 25:35.700
be working up the designing of this whole site and some of the buttons and some depth.

25:35.890 --> 25:37.630
So stadium guys and Buh-Bye.
