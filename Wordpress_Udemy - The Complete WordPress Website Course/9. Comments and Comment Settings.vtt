00:00.870 --> 00:02.520
What is it guys and welcome x.

00:02.520 --> 00:07.990
Now in this video I'm going to be showing you about the comments and this discussion.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.800
So let's just go ahead and let's work for the common stop.

00:10.850 --> 00:17.330
So first of all I want to go to the post and let's quickly go ahead and add a comment on any post.

00:17.330 --> 00:20.810
Let's suppose that this is the guy and he's posted.

00:21.020 --> 00:25.680
And a guy just comes over to our Web site in a new tab.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.220
OK.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.530
He is like a new person and he is not logged into our website.

00:31.650 --> 00:35.870
OK anyone who post so you can see Tay's leave a reply.

00:35.990 --> 00:41.130
Ok your e-mail address will not be published required fields are marked as this.

00:41.130 --> 00:43.850
So let's suppose that he likes it so much.

00:43.850 --> 00:45.300
He's the hello world.

00:46.190 --> 00:48.880
And he says ha ha ha.

00:49.070 --> 00:51.420
This is so funny.

00:51.740 --> 01:01.760
OK so he just added and then he want to add his name so his name is going to be John Doe.

01:01.950 --> 01:02.380
OK.

01:02.610 --> 01:08.610
And his e-mail will be small just like this.

01:08.890 --> 01:11.490
I don't and this WordPress make this mistake.

01:11.620 --> 01:12.550
OK.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.230
So this e-mail will be ok.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.690
I think this is I but this is looking like a fool here.

01:19.860 --> 01:20.810
OK I'm sorry.

01:20.820 --> 01:26.880
So now I'm going to add his e-mail and that is going to be like info at exemple dot com so you can add

01:26.910 --> 01:28.380
any e-mail right here.

01:28.440 --> 01:28.910
OK.

01:29.130 --> 01:33.610
And then his Web site so he don't have any web site and this is not required field as well.

01:33.690 --> 01:34.100
OK.

01:34.230 --> 01:37.470
So I'm going to go in and I'm going to hit post comment and that's all.

01:37.470 --> 01:42.050
Now here you can see it say's that comment is baiting moderation.

01:42.230 --> 01:42.680
OK.

01:42.830 --> 01:48.560
Let's just go ahead and let's quickly viewership of a page and let's go to a dashboard.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.420
So here and I go here it's easy common.

01:51.450 --> 01:51.900
OK.

01:52.110 --> 01:58.950
And here this is also read here this is from John Doe on hell lowballed this is bending and this is

01:58.950 --> 02:02.270
coming in the home section and states how this is so funny.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.030
I can approve this comment.

02:04.200 --> 02:04.720
OK.

02:04.920 --> 02:09.530
I can just reply to this comment and I can add it or I can even spam this guy.

02:09.660 --> 02:10.200
OK.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.180
And I can even trash this comment so let's just go out on its.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.490
Approve this comment and reply to it.

02:15.570 --> 02:18.640
OK so I'm the admin and I wanted to reply.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.230
What is so funny.

02:22.570 --> 02:23.020
OK.

02:23.110 --> 02:32.280
And I mean just the question look at the replies I said you can see I am the author of this post and

02:32.280 --> 02:35.540
I have replied to him that what is so funny about this man.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.330
Why are you just laughing.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.040
OK.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.490
And that guy will come here or he will get an e-mail basically.

02:41.720 --> 02:42.020
OK.

02:42.030 --> 02:46.180
And here we go down in here you can see is what is so funny.

02:46.230 --> 02:48.910
So to reply so I'm just replying to that.

02:48.930 --> 02:56.180
So this is how it is so the guy will just reply to it and he will just say I don't know.

02:56.870 --> 02:57.380
OK.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.430
And that I just come here and I just refresh it.

03:00.930 --> 03:01.980
You will see that.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.920
Now my commande is not held for moderation.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.380
OK so this is how it works guys.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.870
Now you can see that I have already posted a comment.

03:10.980 --> 03:14.740
That is why my comment is not healthy for the moderation.

03:15.030 --> 03:21.930
So now here in the comments area I can work for the all of the comments that are posted.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.930
So here are the Jondo has posted like this.

03:25.030 --> 03:29.030
I can even prove his comment and his comment will be held for moderation.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.560
I can even edit his comment.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.750
OK.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.940
And I can even just go ahead and I can trash this comment like if I don't like his comment and I'm like

03:38.970 --> 03:41.540
OK I didn't like his and I'm going to go and I'm going to.

03:41.540 --> 03:45.400
Trash talk has come and is now added into the trash.

03:45.540 --> 03:52.060
And his comment must be deleted if I just come here and I'll just go ahead and I just refresh you say

03:52.420 --> 03:56.920
let's go down let's go down let's go down and there you go you can see that the comment has been deleted.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.320
So this is how everything works.

03:59.320 --> 04:06.350
You can see that WordPress is a best content management system and how everything is done with the word

04:06.350 --> 04:06.700
Press.

04:06.730 --> 04:07.330
OK.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.820
So you can see how great it is.

04:09.850 --> 04:14.860
Now you guys already know about these about these and about these how the how to edit.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.650
How do you just spam it how to trash it and how to do work with it.

04:19.330 --> 04:24.940
But now people learn about the settings of that so let's just go ahead and let's just go to the discussion

04:24.940 --> 04:27.230
settings and let's just work with it.

04:28.290 --> 04:29.610
What is it guys and welcome back.

04:29.730 --> 04:33.020
So now in this video we'll be working out what this discussion settings.

04:33.030 --> 04:33.490
OK.

04:33.750 --> 04:37.910
So now you can see it's attempt to notify any blogs link to the article.

04:37.980 --> 04:38.220
OK.

04:38.220 --> 04:46.800
This is not much risk it necessary but what it will do is that when you will add a link of any other

04:46.800 --> 04:56.270
blog to your post then that post will notify that other blog that you have been mentioned and that I

04:56.270 --> 04:57.200
Tansey.

04:57.250 --> 05:02.510
So this is like the mentioning someone on the Facebook Like when you put a status.

05:02.640 --> 05:03.150
OK.

05:03.240 --> 05:09.620
Like if I just want to put a status on my Facebook like I wanted but it's status and I just this and

05:09.630 --> 05:17.970
I want to mention someone so if I want to mention this right here and I just had it and I'm just going

05:17.970 --> 05:20.020
to go ahead and I'm going to go in and I'm going to hit post.

05:20.100 --> 05:26.200
So when I just posted this guy or girl they'll be notified.

05:26.220 --> 05:28.920
So this is how it works guys.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.260
OK.

05:29.490 --> 05:32.270
So now let's go ahead and let's just leave.

05:32.300 --> 05:35.330
So this is how that pink bag works.

05:35.370 --> 05:35.830
OK.

05:35.880 --> 05:43.550
And allow link a notification from other blogs to new articles allow people to post comments on new

05:43.560 --> 05:44.220
articles.

05:44.280 --> 05:44.770
OK.

05:44.880 --> 05:51.480
This is like these settings maybe overbred hidden for individual articles like allow people to post

05:51.480 --> 05:53.220
comments on new articles.

05:53.220 --> 05:59.280
This is very important and make sure that this is checked like if anyone wants to add a comment then

05:59.310 --> 06:03.770
this must be checked so that the comments are turned on.

06:03.810 --> 06:04.200
OK.

06:04.350 --> 06:07.260
And then we have the column and other settings.

06:07.290 --> 06:11.070
It should be like common author must fill out name and email.

06:11.100 --> 06:18.990
This is what like the check that OK if I just go ahead and I just close this OK and then I just go ahead

06:18.990 --> 06:23.100
and I just hit like users must be registered and logged in to comment.

06:23.220 --> 06:25.400
And I just go ahead and I just hit save changes.

06:25.410 --> 06:25.900
OK.

06:26.160 --> 06:32.340
And then on just clicking here when I Guyville come here to my website.

06:32.650 --> 06:32.930
OK.

06:32.940 --> 06:36.550
I just opened this up in a new job which is my private window.

06:36.750 --> 06:41.510
And then he is going to the blog page ok like this is the blog.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.920
And he just come here.

06:42.930 --> 06:47.680
He just opened up this post and I suppose want to add the thing.

06:47.790 --> 06:55.080
So it takes you must be logged in to Post.com and so we have just like that that thing that I mean users

06:55.110 --> 06:58.590
must be registered and logged in to post a comment.

06:58.590 --> 06:59.890
So this is how it works.

06:59.910 --> 07:00.340
OK.

07:00.510 --> 07:05.870
So I would recommend you to uncheck this because you want the user to be registered and then to post

07:05.880 --> 07:06.200
comment.

07:06.240 --> 07:06.650
OK.

07:06.780 --> 07:12.120
So then we have automatically close comments on articles older than 14 days.

07:12.150 --> 07:19.230
I hope that this explains you what it is like if an article is older than 14 days like you can see this

07:19.230 --> 07:21.060
was posted on January 12th.

07:21.090 --> 07:28.530
If I just go ahead and I just edit this article to be like it was posted like so many days before I

07:28.650 --> 07:34.290
can change that I can change it to be like publish it on and I'm going to change it to be like it was

07:34.290 --> 07:39.170
published a year ago so I'm changing it to be like it was published on 2017.

07:39.330 --> 07:46.760
And then I just go ahead and I open this up event you will see that I will not be able to reply to it.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.640
I can reply to it because I am the administrator.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.320
OK.

07:50.400 --> 07:50.740
But

07:53.780 --> 07:55.520
OK this is not checked as well.

07:55.550 --> 08:00.980
Let's just close it automatically close comments on articles older than 14 days so let's just check

08:00.980 --> 08:03.320
it and let's just go ahead and let's refresh.

08:03.320 --> 08:06.730
I think I will also not have the access to reply.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.500
Ok see it comments are closed.

08:09.500 --> 08:09.950
OK.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.110
So this is how it works guys.

08:12.140 --> 08:16.070
Now we have the Enable Trece treaded comments like nested Goman.

08:16.070 --> 08:22.260
So what it is like and people can just reply to it and it'll be like the mean common subs subs subs

08:22.290 --> 08:25.200
so so it can go like more than five.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.250
Not beyond that.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.520
So this is overtricks.

08:27.520 --> 08:27.860
OK.

08:27.980 --> 08:32.510
If I just go out and I just uncheck this and I just go hit and I just save it then you will see that

08:32.510 --> 08:35.270
it will be not like that nested treated.

08:35.270 --> 08:38.810
And this picture is so big and this is like this is not the reply.

08:38.810 --> 08:39.860
This is another comment.

08:39.890 --> 08:40.280
OK.

08:40.460 --> 08:44.370
So I would recommend you to check this because this is important.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.110
And then we have great comment in two pages with 50 top level.

08:48.110 --> 08:51.290
So this means like the top 50 will come on top.

08:51.470 --> 08:53.190
And these are the settings.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.320
So then we have e-mailed me whenever anyone post a comment.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.500
A common is health for moderation.

08:58.490 --> 09:06.830
So you guys already know what is a moderation like if someone adds a comment and then it will be held

09:06.830 --> 09:10.270
for moderation that I have to approve that vendor to approve that comment or not.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.930
That is called the moderation.

09:11.960 --> 09:17.240
So I would recommend you to uncheck this and check this because if a comment is held to moderation you

09:17.240 --> 09:18.210
should approve them.

09:18.470 --> 09:25.990
And then we have before a comment Piers comment must be manually approved comment author must have a

09:26.030 --> 09:27.700
previously approved comment.

09:27.700 --> 09:34.340
So this is obviously checked like if a new author is tour of its site and he's posting something then

09:34.340 --> 09:40.270
his comment must be a previously approved so that we know so that this blog know that that guy is authentic

09:40.280 --> 09:41.730
and he posts the comments.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.910
Revelent to this stuff that is above the post.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.600
OK so this is like that.

09:46.760 --> 09:53.570
OK and then we have the next thing and that is comment moderation hold the common Q If it contains two

09:53.600 --> 10:01.130
or more links so it can be like if that guy is promoting other content like if that has one single link

10:01.400 --> 10:07.070
and he's promoting other content and we want to hold that common for our kids that we should manually

10:07.070 --> 10:13.340
approve that what that common good Daines any of these words name you Ardell or IP address.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.640
It will be held in the moderation queue.

10:16.250 --> 10:20.990
So it can be like one award or IP address per line.

10:20.990 --> 10:34.110
So if anyone is abusing something like he just said hell or like sacque or something like that so if

10:34.110 --> 10:40.590
someone is using abusive vord then we will just make it into the moderation or we can just directly

10:40.590 --> 10:43.870
blacklist them when that comment contains any of these words.

10:44.130 --> 10:44.600
OK.

10:44.760 --> 10:51.030
It will be automatically put in the trash so if you just added to it like porn or like pornography or

10:51.030 --> 10:56.910
something like that so it is just like it will match the inside word so press will match WordPress so

10:57.230 --> 11:00.750
often like pornography will also be banned by this porn.

11:00.750 --> 11:01.660
So this is how it works.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.090
OK.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.070
And then we have the show avatars.

11:04.070 --> 11:04.980
This is important.

11:05.070 --> 11:07.560
So you can show the Avatar if you want to.

11:07.680 --> 11:12.930
And then let's go ahead and let's save changes so now we're totally done with the discussion.

11:13.290 --> 11:13.600
OK.

11:13.620 --> 11:19.090
If there are still confusions then do not worry guys I'm telling you once again to not very.

11:19.140 --> 11:24.310
Because we will be waking up in the professional blogs you will understand it much better.

11:24.410 --> 11:24.820
OK.

11:24.930 --> 11:30.330
So this is just for the overview purposes like how to build a basic website and how to build an amazing

11:30.330 --> 11:31.500
website and stuff like that.

11:31.590 --> 11:34.620
And I can see that we are totally done with these settings and everything.

11:34.710 --> 11:36.600
And on the next video I'll show you why that.

11:36.650 --> 11:40.290
What are the customization how to do that and how to work with it.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.970
And then we are going to be working up with that team that what are the teams and work to do with that

11:45.250 --> 11:46.770
and never going to be working up in the plugin.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.690
So Stadion guys and Buh-Bye.
