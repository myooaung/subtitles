00:00.810 --> 00:06.570
Was a guys and what KMAX now in this video vidoe will be working up with that how can we accept credit

00:06.570 --> 00:09.420
card debit card payment into this account.

00:09.420 --> 00:16.460
So basically you can accept that you can accept that from there you can accept from the paper itself.

00:16.470 --> 00:21.270
OK if I just come here and I just said to to check out OK I'll be taken to the checkout page and it

00:21.270 --> 00:22.580
says pay bill OK.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.840
And then I just proceed to Pay-Pal you can see OK I have to accept the terms and conditions.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.790
I don't know why I just forget it.

00:29.790 --> 00:32.490
OK so when I just proceed to pay bill.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.290
It's going to take me 10 to the baby.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.540
And then year I can be.

00:37.860 --> 00:41.280
OK I can be with my credit card if I just click here.

00:41.310 --> 00:48.660
David debit credit card he can see that I can enter the debit card details in every detail and my payment

00:48.660 --> 00:49.570
would be processed.

00:49.590 --> 00:49.990
OK.

00:50.010 --> 00:52.440
Let me show you Let me show you how this is going to work.

00:52.590 --> 00:55.500
OK.

00:55.730 --> 00:58.970
You can see that it is loading it is loading right now.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.990
So let's wait till this is done.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.060
OK you can see this is how we have.

01:03.080 --> 01:03.810
OK.

01:04.070 --> 01:07.030
This is how we have to choose to be and everything.

01:07.040 --> 01:07.330
OK.

01:07.340 --> 01:08.180
I'm just going to hit.

01:08.190 --> 01:09.600
Don't have a bell account.

01:09.650 --> 01:10.160
OK.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.680
I'm just going to click here and here.

01:12.740 --> 01:19.040
Then I have to enter my credit card details in every detail and then I have to hit B and that will be

01:19.040 --> 01:22.970
paid automatically so I'm just going to come here I'm going to incur any of that credit card right now.

01:27.970 --> 01:33.870
So let's suppose that my money is seven my year is 22 C A C is.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.120
Yes.

01:35.260 --> 01:41.160
And then I have this right here and then I have to enter the address optionals city

01:46.400 --> 01:47.600
and I have to hit B.

01:47.930 --> 01:52.190
So you can see this bill authenticated and then it'll be OK.

01:52.250 --> 01:55.970
So since my address debit card is incorrect that is why it is not paying.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.020
But the person can then go ahead and be.

01:59.330 --> 02:02.530
So this is how the person can go ahead and pay.

02:02.570 --> 02:08.300
But if they do not want to pay a bill if he wants to save it in the credit card service.

02:08.420 --> 02:15.050
So we basically have to go ahead vaid service that we have to sign up and then we can accept the payments.

02:15.050 --> 02:15.490
OK.

02:15.530 --> 02:18.290
And that is called basically do check out.

02:18.380 --> 02:18.810
OK.

02:18.870 --> 02:22.360
So a payment is recommended by me.

02:22.460 --> 02:28.070
OK because you can't accept credit card payments and people will be like Paypal does not work in some

02:28.070 --> 02:28.540
countries.

02:28.540 --> 02:29.890
So what would you do.

02:29.990 --> 02:34.760
OK you just have to accept the credit card in your account in your website.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.780
So what would you do.

02:35.900 --> 02:39.590
OK so what you're having Do you have to just go to do check out Delcam.

02:39.740 --> 02:40.150
OK.

02:40.150 --> 02:45.800
This is the service that I personally recommend that and that I personally use for my clients.

02:45.830 --> 02:46.390
OK.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.400
And also for myself I'm just starting up for this.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.460
I'm starting up my business right now on this and other business.

02:52.460 --> 02:55.770
OK so you can go with it to check out precessing payment.

02:55.790 --> 02:56.120
OK.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.650
And then they will process your payment and then they will work.

02:59.690 --> 03:03.500
You can see it works amazingly but commerce.

03:03.740 --> 03:05.600
So I'm going to go to rates right now.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.440
Let me tell you what are the rates for this and then I'm going to show you how this is going.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.190
So we have to select a country.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.490
Your payments are synchronizing calculators.

03:13.490 --> 03:21.580
I'm going to select my country and this is the one so it is charging me 3.9 percent plus 45 cents per

03:21.580 --> 03:23.510
cent senseful transaction.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.020
OK.

03:25.030 --> 03:33.040

04:13.240 --> 04:15.920
And in the complete application they have a requirement.

04:15.940 --> 04:16.290
OK.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.680
Let me tell you what is the requirement.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.280
The first one is that you your web site must be having an address.

04:21.280 --> 04:21.920
OK.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.390
And you're in the Contact Us page so you shouldn't be having a Contact Us page.

04:26.410 --> 04:26.890
OK.

04:26.920 --> 04:33.580
And there you should be having an address your office address and the same address should be here in
