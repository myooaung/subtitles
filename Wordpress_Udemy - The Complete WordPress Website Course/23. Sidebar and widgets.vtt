WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:04.370
What is it guys and what KMAX and how you can see that everything is looking totally OK.

00:04.380 --> 00:08.130
This is our site it's looking and now we're totally done with the e-commerce stuff.

00:08.190 --> 00:09.920
We now know everything about it.

00:10.020 --> 00:14.660
OK so let's just have a look at our veggie section and then we'll move forward to the next one.

00:14.660 --> 00:19.110
So let's go ahead and let's go to the shall pray here and you can see that this is the vivid section

00:19.110 --> 00:20.460
that we have right here.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.750
And I know that this is not looking good.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.030
So we have to work on it a little bit.

00:25.050 --> 00:28.630
And then we'll move forward so let's just go to the dashboard right here.

00:28.740 --> 00:29.120
OK.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.650
And then let's open this up.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.100
OK.

00:31.140 --> 00:35.720
So I want to go to the tray here in their appearance and then I'm going to go to the tray here.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.210
OK.

00:36.270 --> 00:44.850
So here basically I want to show something there that extends my website.

00:44.930 --> 00:45.340
OK.

00:45.420 --> 00:50.190
So let's just go to your let's just remove everything from here because we don't want them so I'm just

00:50.190 --> 00:50.950
going to come here.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.570
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to hit delete too here.

00:53.860 --> 00:54.890
Just delete everything.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.020
I just delete everything that we want.

00:57.170 --> 01:04.080
We've added later on but I'm just doing this for the title purposes so let's just come here let's just

01:04.080 --> 01:05.370
delete it.

01:05.610 --> 01:07.180
Alonge delete this as well.

01:07.410 --> 01:14.100
So now first of all what we need is that we need to just add the filter products by price.

01:14.100 --> 01:19.260
I just really like it and the some of the websites do uses this like eBay use this.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.910
Let me show you how to use this.

01:21.030 --> 01:27.480
So what is is like you can filter the products by price so if you search a product then also you can

01:27.480 --> 01:31.400
filter the products by price in here and it's worked really amazing.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.550
So let's me let me just come here.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.500
To display here.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.090
OK.

01:36.280 --> 01:41.070
If I just search for hoodie.

01:41.280 --> 01:41.940
OK.

01:42.100 --> 01:46.740
So let's suppose that I searched here and then you can see that here would be the filter price option

01:47.230 --> 01:48.350
to go down.

01:48.520 --> 01:48.840
I we go.

01:48.870 --> 01:54.420
You can see this is the folder price that I just really like it you can see I can enter the dollar here

01:54.810 --> 01:56.190
and then this would be the $2.

01:56.220 --> 02:00.840
How much dollars and then I'm going to hit this and then it's going to show the price range that we

02:00.840 --> 02:03.930
have so Same like this we have the condition we have this like this.

02:03.930 --> 02:08.500
So I'm just going to add the filter by price.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.290
Let's come here and let's say like this to be like the ad budget so you can see that aren't clicking

02:13.290 --> 02:15.380
this I'm going to come here.

02:15.420 --> 02:16.920
I'm just going to I'm here and I'm going to hit this.

02:16.920 --> 02:23.190
You can see it and tell me this filter by price so it is just showing me the full price and the lowest

02:23.190 --> 02:24.810
price is 10 to 30.

02:24.810 --> 02:29.400
So if I just could make it below here like 10 to 20 then I'm going to hit filter right now and it's

02:29.400 --> 02:31.170
going to filter all the products that we have.

02:31.170 --> 02:35.600
So we have five results and you can see they are just filtered.

02:35.740 --> 02:40.820
If I just make it a little bit more smaller I may get 10 and then I hit filter then you can see.

02:40.940 --> 02:45.570
And this is just swing the 10 of the product.

02:45.690 --> 02:48.590
Only the product that has the minimum 10 dollars.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.010
OK.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.780
So this is how the filter price works.

02:50.790 --> 02:51.840
I just really like it.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.000
That is why I am just getting it.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.680
And I would recommend you to add this because it enhance the look of your site and your sake looks good.

02:58.680 --> 03:02.730
So I'm just going to go down and now I am going to just add one more.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.220
OK.

03:03.330 --> 03:07.320
And that will be the filter products by reading just like this one.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.910
So I'm just going to add this and

03:12.210 --> 03:14.970
most graded products

03:18.080 --> 03:24.660
average products so it's going to filter the products that are on the rating of basis on the basis of

03:24.660 --> 03:25.080
rating.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.320
So let's just come here and let's just refers to shop page.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.580
You didn't see that we have the average rating so I'm going to select the rating that I want.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.140
So.

03:33.320 --> 03:39.690
So since we only have one product with the rating I can just work with those and rating filter is equal

03:39.690 --> 03:40.300
to 1.

03:40.410 --> 03:44.320
So it is just showing the fun rated products so you can use this.

03:44.430 --> 03:50.790
But I would not recommend you to go with this just because you don't like it and you should not be having

03:50.790 --> 03:53.160
this the average reading on something is going to come here.

03:53.160 --> 03:57.180
I'm just going to click here and I'm going to delete this so we have filter products by attribute as

03:57.180 --> 04:01.560
well like display a list of attribute to filter your products in your store.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.680
So this is important.

04:02.690 --> 04:03.700
You should be doing that.

04:03.770 --> 04:04.500
OK.

04:04.610 --> 04:12.130
An attribute is should be the filter by the attribute so it is not showing the attribute trait.

04:12.140 --> 04:16.030
Now let me come here let me just say like this.

04:16.210 --> 04:23.500
OK let's just come here and let's refresh dissipates so on refreshing it you show that we have nothing

04:23.750 --> 04:27.820
that is going to go ahead I'm going to delete this and I'm going to add a list of dropdown categories

04:28.120 --> 04:32.490
for the product so I just want the product categories right here and I wanted to add the widgets.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.490
This is important.

04:33.590 --> 04:34.380
You should be doing that.

04:34.390 --> 04:36.560
And then we have the category order the name.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.030
So I'm just going to go with the show as drop down.

04:40.030 --> 04:44.720
You can also show show product can only show children of the current category.

04:44.830 --> 04:48.100
OK so height empty categories to children means Dad.

04:48.580 --> 04:53.300
What is the main categories that is appearing and the other one is a subcategory that is the children

04:53.320 --> 04:59.450
so you can work with this like only show the children like the subcategories do not show as appear in

04:59.440 --> 05:03.250
categories so then you have to hide M.D and be honored by his name.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.460
So I'm going to go ahead I'm going to get done right now.

05:05.500 --> 05:12.360
Let's come here and let's refresh our site.

05:12.530 --> 05:13.370
So here we have it.

05:13.370 --> 05:16.710
You can see that number one we have accessories and we have hoodies.

05:16.730 --> 05:19.180
We have Nandu Behati Jeopardy's T-shirts.

05:19.190 --> 05:22.690
Men and women to every category is right here.

05:22.730 --> 05:29.670
We also have it like here so you can see it is totally up and running and it's totally working.

05:29.910 --> 05:31.730
Now I'm going to go to

05:35.050 --> 05:36.220
the products my reading.

05:36.240 --> 05:36.680
OK.

05:36.690 --> 05:37.800
This is all important.

05:38.010 --> 05:42.650
So I'm just going to hit top rated products and number of products to show you all five products.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.040
I just want to show three products.

05:45.060 --> 05:45.520
OK.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.870
I go I'm just going to come here I'm going to refresh my site you know let's have a look.

05:50.890 --> 05:53.260
So it is just showing the top rated products.

05:53.260 --> 05:55.330
This is a top rated product obviously.

05:55.330 --> 05:58.240
So that is why it is showing only one single.

05:58.450 --> 06:03.120
Ok now I'm going to add one more and that will be the seal product so

06:08.100 --> 06:13.620
products OK let's just add this away and it's going to show on sale products.

06:13.620 --> 06:14.030
OK.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.580
So I'm going to enter the title name so geben

06:20.310 --> 06:21.220
grab them.

06:22.620 --> 06:25.610
Before they are gone.

06:26.760 --> 06:31.740
OK so the number of products would be like any show to pay.

06:31.740 --> 06:34.900
And the autobody is this hide free products show hidden products.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.300
No.

06:35.430 --> 06:39.390
So I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to say right now and let's just go ahead and let's have a look

06:39.390 --> 06:40.210
at her site.

06:40.260 --> 06:45.010
So this would be totally up and running so you can see grab them before they're gone.

06:45.010 --> 06:47.030
So you can see that we have this right here.

06:47.040 --> 06:47.740
OK.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.970
Now I want one more thing and that is our Facebook page like dogs.

06:50.970 --> 06:51.660
That is important.

06:51.690 --> 06:52.160
OK.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.800
So that we can go with

06:58.480 --> 06:58.990
the plug in.

06:59.050 --> 07:02.900
OK so let's see that we have any of the Facebook page like box in here.

07:03.250 --> 07:03.660
OK.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.470
If you don't have it we can install the plug in.

07:05.470 --> 07:07.070
So I'm just going to go to you.

07:07.150 --> 07:07.600
OK.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.650
So if you want to do anything there is a plug in for that.

07:10.690 --> 07:13.440
Seriously you just have to search it like Facebook.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.140
OK.

07:14.140 --> 07:16.480
And on and on after searching it you will find it

07:20.340 --> 07:21.210
I think I like this one.

07:21.210 --> 07:25.310
I'm going to go ahead I'm going to hit install right now and you can see that it should be installed

07:25.320 --> 07:26.840
so let's wait till this is done.

07:26.850 --> 07:29.450
I'm just going to activate right now and it should be activated.

07:29.610 --> 07:32.070
So now I'll just go back to the widget section.

07:32.370 --> 07:33.170
OK.

07:33.540 --> 07:33.770
OK.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.370

Let's wait till this is done.

07:36.660 --> 07:36.990
OK.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.160
And once it is done we'll just have to move forward.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.530
So this is that using Facebook like box is right here.

OK.

07:43.440 --> 07:49.260
And who is showing how to use plug in how to use this but you don't have to use it because it will automatically

07:49.260 --> 07:51.530
create the settings in the Brigitte's areas.

07:51.540 --> 07:55.000
I'm just going to go back to deteriorate here and I'm going to refresh my dismay.

07:55.020 --> 08:00.620
So we should be having the Facebook page lightbox easy Facebook like box.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.580
So here we have to enter the Facebook page you are in hell.

08:08.610 --> 08:10.650
So going to the Facebook page you are out.

08:10.710 --> 08:14.900
And then I want the titles so the title would be fine.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.890
On Facebook.

08:19.210 --> 08:22.060
Hey now I have to go down and we have everything here.

08:22.090 --> 08:24.330
Make sure that you just keep it as default.

08:24.340 --> 08:28.660
There are some things that you can move on that is responsive so it should be responsive because it

08:28.720 --> 08:32.800
will just drag it size it will just keep it to you according to the sidebars and make sure that you

08:33.070 --> 08:33.810
use this one.

08:33.820 --> 08:35.130
And we don't want to show boast.

08:35.140 --> 08:39.410
We don't want to hide the cover photo hide the CDA burden.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.820
No you small.

08:40.870 --> 08:41.250
OK.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.050
Let's just go hey let's just save and let's have a look at our Web site right now.

08:45.070 --> 08:50.950
So I'm going to refresh and her go this is being loaded.

08:51.100 --> 08:55.930
So one is once it is loaded you can see how this is and it is also responsive.

08:55.930 --> 08:56.170
OK.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.230
And make sure that you check it.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.510
If you do not check it and then its size would be like it would be coming here or it would be coming

09:01.510 --> 09:06.730
here and the full page be like grabbing so make sure that you check the responsive one and now you can

09:06.730 --> 09:10.690
see that we are totally done with our Facebook page.

09:10.840 --> 09:11.190

09:19.150 --> 09:22.410
OK so you can see that it is showing six products here.

09:22.420 --> 09:27.750
So once you add more products then they would be the page anation then you can move forward to this
