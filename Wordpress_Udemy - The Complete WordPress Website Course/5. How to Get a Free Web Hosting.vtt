WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:05.820
What is it guys and Oakmark so as in the video we work with or this Web site we install word person

00:05.830 --> 00:06.300
it.

00:06.420 --> 00:13.020
And if you are not willing to buy web hosting right now or if you think that you should not invest then

00:13.140 --> 00:19.020
and you are here for just learning purposes then you have another option and that is to get the hosting

00:19.020 --> 00:26.870
for free and also the domain name but this is not recommended by me cause your that is the free web

00:26.940 --> 00:33.860
hosting and free web hosting servers can not support much traffic so that after when your website will

00:33.900 --> 00:40.440
receive some traffic your website will be suspended by them and they will basically suspend your account

00:40.440 --> 00:42.320
and you cannot access your website.

00:42.340 --> 00:46.590
OK so that is why your account will be deleted and your date data will be deleted.

00:46.590 --> 00:52.020
That is why I would highly recommend you to go with this professional matter invest just $150 and that

00:52.020 --> 00:53.650
is only for three years.

00:53.670 --> 00:59.430
You dont have to invest it after that but if you still don't want to invest right now then you have

00:59.430 --> 01:03.950
another option and that is to go over the next dot.com.

01:03.990 --> 01:06.040
So it is the next dot.com does not work.

01:06.130 --> 01:09.100
Crome I don't know why they must have some problem.

01:09.150 --> 01:13.300
You can go with the Internet Explorer and you can just create your account there.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.140
So let's go ahead and let's get to cynics dot com.

01:16.190 --> 01:16.650
OK.

01:16.770 --> 01:21.320
And then this website gives you free web hosting and a free domain name.

01:21.420 --> 01:21.810
OK.

01:21.870 --> 01:22.960
So let's go down.

01:23.010 --> 01:27.370
And here we can see that we have a button that says register now I have to just click this and it's

01:27.370 --> 01:28.750
going to take me down.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.640
I have to basically sign up right now here.

01:31.740 --> 01:40.040
So the domain name that I'm going to be registering that be my great site.

01:40.280 --> 01:40.640
OK.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.800
So my you are really getting to be my creed tell you that it isn't dot com.

01:44.900 --> 01:52.010
My password is going to be this and my e-mail address is going to be this.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.600
OK now I have to enter the capture

01:57.040 --> 01:59.330
0 see nine three three.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.450
Let's go ahead and sign up.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.290
And there we go.

02:03.380 --> 02:07.570
You can see that it sees an activation e-mail has now been sent to the e-mail address.

02:07.570 --> 02:10.990
Please click the activation link in the e-mail to activate this account.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.900
OK what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead.

02:13.910 --> 02:16.430
I'm going to open up my mail account.

02:16.550 --> 02:19.920
I'm going to go to Outlook

02:22.850 --> 02:23.630
and

02:28.720 --> 02:30.020
let's go to there.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.080
Let's see if we have received that e-mail.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.280
So we haven't received that e-mail right here.

02:34.280 --> 02:39.400
I'm going to go to the junk e-mail to check if I have received any email in the junk section.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.200
OK.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.750
I haven't received the e-mail yet.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.210
OK let's get him here.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.030
And you can see that it says if you have not received that e-mail after 10 minutes please click here

02:50.030 --> 02:51.110
to rescind that e-mail.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.500
So it hasn't been 10 minutes you have to wait approximately 10 minutes.

02:54.560 --> 03:01.080
Make sure to keep keep check keep a check on your debts and your junk items as well.

03:01.310 --> 03:01.620
OK.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.020
So you Vold receiving Electress offers some time.

03:05.180 --> 03:09.310
So let's wait.

03:09.540 --> 03:13.960
OK so here you go you can see that it says it in dot.com activation link.

03:14.010 --> 03:19.200
So give me that e-mail right after like four minutes approximate.

03:19.380 --> 03:19.740
OK.

03:19.740 --> 03:23.880
I'm going to go and I'm going to hit those and her go can see place clicked on the link below to activate

03:23.880 --> 03:24.610
your account.

03:24.630 --> 03:27.780
I'm going to go head I'm going to hit this and my account should be activated.

03:27.870 --> 03:31.330
So it is authenticating it is initializing the user name.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.720
You have to wait.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.420
User name has been created.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.840
You have to wait till everything is done.

03:36.900 --> 03:41.590
It is installing the Apache speed.

03:41.630 --> 03:43.460
Wait wait till it is done.

03:43.490 --> 03:47.120
If don't don't don't just close this tab and don't do anything wrong.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.220
Otherwise you're saying the site won't load OK.

03:49.310 --> 03:52.640
So you can see that it says DNS zone created and everything.

03:52.640 --> 03:59.980
So let's wait and let's see.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.240
So this is stuck.

04:01.370 --> 04:01.960
OK.

04:01.970 --> 04:05.080
This is this is this usually happens to free web hosting.

04:05.090 --> 04:12.080
Basically I use I don't know why but since they are giving you everything for free that is why their

04:12.080 --> 04:14.450
servers are also not so good.

04:14.450 --> 04:14.800
OK.

04:14.870 --> 04:18.650
So you can see that if this doesn't load then go and check your meal.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.870
Not close this tab until your account is fully active.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.400
You can see that it says your new hosting account.

04:24.470 --> 04:32.080
Make sure that you copy your you are real OK and then paste the trade here and see if your website Lote's

04:32.340 --> 04:32.780
OK.

04:33.660 --> 04:35.270
You can see that it says congratulations.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.850
Your account has been activated.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.880
Log into the sea battle to make some edits.

04:38.890 --> 04:42.070
If this window does not come do not close this window.

04:42.150 --> 04:42.580
OK.

04:42.660 --> 04:48.030
Since this is coming this means that our Web site is totally done and we can close this up.

04:48.060 --> 04:48.740
OK.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.200
And now we have to log into our sea battle.

04:51.210 --> 04:54.700
So how we are going to log in we have to copy the panel you are l.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.550
I'm going to go ahead.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.790
I'm going to come here and I'm going to base this you are Al.

04:59.010 --> 04:59.660
Here we go.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.450
I'm going to copy my user name

05:07.740 --> 05:14.470
and now here I'm going to copy my password so I have to paste it right here.

05:14.860 --> 05:15.300
OK.

05:15.370 --> 05:17.340
I'm going to go in and I'm going to get log in.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.830
And here we go you can see that I am in the C panel here.

05:20.830 --> 05:22.200
I can manage everything.

05:22.340 --> 05:29.780
What I have to do I have it go down and here I see the soft calculus apps installer and the software

05:29.790 --> 05:35.350
up and I have to just open this up and it's going to open a new window and we have to install WordPress

05:35.380 --> 05:39.020
basically into our sea battle or in our domain name.

05:39.140 --> 05:43.210
OK what I'm going to do I'm just going to come here I'm going to hit install and this WordPress should

05:43.210 --> 05:44.140
be installed.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.330
And it can see that the domain name is coming might create side.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.850
Ideas in stock.

05:49.170 --> 05:52.990
OK I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to choose the root directory because I want to install it on

05:52.990 --> 05:58.840
the root directory or the main directory so that if someone visits this page he should see or press

06:02.540 --> 06:03.220
right here.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.600
We have our say name.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.650
You can enter your site name here.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.790
That should be like this.

06:07.790 --> 06:13.280
You can see that if Hoover memos you can see it says this site name consider Amaan and just another

06:13.290 --> 06:16.070
WordPress Web site is the tag line.

06:16.070 --> 06:16.580
OK.

06:17.650 --> 06:22.480
So you can see that site name and site description is going to be my blog my wordpress blog.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.010
And then we have the Edmon username and password.

06:25.540 --> 06:32.050
So I'm going to choose the Edmon username to be this and the password is going to be this.

06:32.080 --> 06:32.640
OK.

06:32.650 --> 06:34.810
You can enter your e-mail address here.

06:34.810 --> 06:40.340
You have to go down down and you have to hit install now and it should be installed right now.

06:40.480 --> 06:40.880
OK.

06:41.050 --> 06:44.940
So you have to wait for like 10 seconds or five seconds.

06:44.980 --> 06:45.500
OK.

06:50.620 --> 06:51.270
Her Go.

06:51.290 --> 06:53.100
You can see that it says congratulations.

06:53.150 --> 06:55.070
The software was installed successfully.

06:55.190 --> 06:55.850
I'm going to go ahead.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.430
I'm going to open up in a new tab.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.640
Or you can just come here and refreshed this window.

07:00.650 --> 07:05.830
Here we go we can see that it says my blog my wordpress blog and here it is this and this.

07:05.840 --> 07:11.540
So this is totally same and everything is same but there is a difference between servers and everything.

07:11.540 --> 07:18.070
If this site goes live and people started visiting this Web site like FBN real words or hundred viewers

07:18.070 --> 07:19.320
per day comes this way.

07:19.460 --> 07:25.670
This Web site this Web site is going to go down and if thousand and more than thousand or hundred thousand

07:25.670 --> 07:27.510
viewers come to this Web site.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.020
This web site is never going to go down.

07:30.020 --> 07:34.370
So there is a difference between the need web hosting and the free web hosting that is why I would recommend

07:34.370 --> 07:39.200
you to go with the main domain name your perfect domain name and instead of this one.

07:39.290 --> 07:39.610
OK.

07:39.650 --> 07:41.890
So let's go ahead and let's log into the see panel.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.780
Let's let me show you how this is going to work.

07:43.790 --> 07:44.230
OK.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.400
Have we just entered the W.P. dash.

07:46.510 --> 07:47.270
Am I.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.080
OK.

07:48.140 --> 07:49.620
It's going to take you to the new page.

07:49.700 --> 07:54.380
And here we have to enter the username so my user name is going to be deaths and my password would be

07:54.680 --> 07:54.950
this

07:58.040 --> 08:01.850
OK I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to log in and it's going to log me into my dashboard so you can

08:01.850 --> 08:04.620
see that this is how my dashboard is looking.

08:04.840 --> 08:05.340
OK.

08:06.930 --> 08:11.530
Let me just close this window and decided that was Val

08:15.130 --> 08:15.550
OK.

08:15.700 --> 08:18.330
So you can see that this is how am I to say is looking.

08:18.370 --> 08:20.750
Everything is exactly same as this.

08:20.770 --> 08:30.000
OK if I just open this up you can see that this and this is totally same side of this title and this

08:30.010 --> 08:30.620
title.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.020
OK so you can change your title.

08:32.020 --> 08:37.900
I'm going to show you an in depth of the overview of where press water everything what are post media

08:37.900 --> 08:40.490

08:43.150 --> 08:48.280
What are the menus What are the header and what are the plugins users tools settings and something like

08:48.280 --> 08:48.550
that.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.550
OK so I'm going to show you each and everything in this course.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.920
