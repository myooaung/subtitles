00:00.660 --> 00:04.560
What is a guy who's in Malcolm X now in this video we're going to be working up in the permalink.

00:04.600 --> 00:07.150
And then we're going to move forward with our blog settings.

00:07.180 --> 00:07.690
OK.

00:07.930 --> 00:12.120
And our more setting so let's just go ahead and let's open up any of the post from the blog.

00:12.220 --> 00:12.820
OK.

00:12.820 --> 00:19.390
If I just open up this post and you can see that it it doesn't 18 slash 1 slash 12 and then the title

00:19.480 --> 00:25.050
of the Borst which I do not like and I would highly recommend you to change that.

00:25.060 --> 00:28.550
I want it to be the simpler like it should be like this.

00:28.570 --> 00:33.960
If I just cross it and I just poke at this then you can see it takes me directly here.

00:33.970 --> 00:35.370
And this is the link that is coming.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.910
I don't want this how I'm going to prevent this to happen.

00:39.910 --> 00:43.660
So for that I have to go to the dashboard OK.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.580
And then I have to go to settings and then I have to go to Permalink.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.790
So this is the number one step that you have to do.

00:49.990 --> 00:52.020
And you can see that it sees common settings.

00:52.020 --> 00:57.300
So for the post a link it will appear like the name.

00:57.390 --> 01:01.070
This this this and then it will show the post.

01:01.240 --> 01:06.670
So if you just choose to be like plain then it's going to show the post ID it would be like month and

01:06.670 --> 01:08.550
name that it's going to add the month.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.930
That's an the name.

01:11.080 --> 01:16.290
If he had it to be like numeric then it's going to be like this if you had it to be like post-game then

01:16.300 --> 01:22.000
it will be the simpler that I want and I would highly recommend you check this whether you like it or

01:22.000 --> 01:25.460
not because this is good for the purposes as well.

01:25.630 --> 01:25.910
OK.

01:25.910 --> 01:29.550
You'll understand that as he played her on what is it and why is it necessary.

01:29.650 --> 01:30.740
But let's just go ahead.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.800
Let's just select this and let's save the changes.

01:35.020 --> 01:38.760
And now when we will go to our Web site you will see how this is like.

01:38.770 --> 01:46.000
So if I just go to the blog and then I open this up you can see this is simple and simple just looks

01:46.000 --> 01:46.590
amazing.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.180
OK.

01:47.260 --> 01:50.350
Because I don't know but I am attracted to this.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.050
There's the simple Eurail.

01:52.140 --> 01:52.520
OK.

01:52.600 --> 01:58.210
So you can see that we are done middlings and knowledge work the settings of our reps say.

01:58.840 --> 02:05.110
So I'm going to go to the dashboard right now and any Here we have these these these and these so you

02:05.110 --> 02:06.150
guys know about the media.

02:06.150 --> 02:11.170
So in the media lab Rudi is going to show all the images that you have added to your post so you can

02:11.170 --> 02:14.630
see that we add just one single image and that is our.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.840
And like a thief image when we were telling.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.430
So that is why it is here so I don't know if I have to tell you about it.

02:20.440 --> 02:25.080
We have the comments and then we have the plug in that appearance which we will learn about more later.

02:25.150 --> 02:27.410
And then we have the users which we will learn more.

02:27.490 --> 02:33.850
The tools is not really much useful to our website.

02:33.930 --> 02:34.440
OK.

02:34.540 --> 02:37.440
Because I'm in here it just worked like import and export.

02:37.470 --> 02:42.750
When you want to migrate Web site or something like that so it cannot but it does understand.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.670
But it is explained in this course.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.090
So I'm not just explaining it to you right now.

02:47.290 --> 02:52.240
Let's just quickly go ahead and let's just over if you are sitting so in the general time you can basically

02:52.240 --> 02:59.780
manage the general settings to your say it like the site title The tag line the owl and everything.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.850
And this membership's So we will be working up with this membership's later on.

03:03.860 --> 03:05.550
So I don't have to explain you this.

03:05.640 --> 03:10.090
I mean we will be working with our projects then we will understand about this membership.

03:10.090 --> 03:14.510
How does membership looks and how you can manage that.

03:14.560 --> 03:20.650
So then we have this and everything so we can work with the date format the site language and the time

03:20.650 --> 03:21.720
format as well.

03:21.850 --> 03:29.200
And the Veeck starts on Monday so you can select that venue or start the next step we have here is the

03:29.200 --> 03:32.770
right thing so it's going to be like the default post category.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.440
So when we just want to add a new post.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.600
OK let's suppose if you want to add this.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.120
OK.

03:38.320 --> 03:43.110
And now here you can see that the default post category would be set to news.

03:43.120 --> 03:52.090
If I just add it like hello world and I just paste the link here.

03:52.090 --> 03:56.070
The dummy text and then I VIDOT selecting any category.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.780
I just go ahead and I just publish it.

03:58.050 --> 03:58.560
OK.

03:58.830 --> 04:04.120
And then you can see that the default post category would be selected as news sent like this.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.120
It is applied to the default post format.

04:07.140 --> 04:11.080
We will be working up to the format later on when we will build a professional blog.

04:11.160 --> 04:15.240
Don't get yourself confused with the format right now.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.380
Just leave it.

04:16.450 --> 04:19.650
We'll just leave it as it is and let me have the post via email.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.650
So post-White email is not recommended by me.

04:23.700 --> 04:30.240
This happens like when you want to post anything with the email and it is recommended by most of the

04:30.240 --> 04:35.250
blogs and most of the people that you should not be using that because when you can log in easily to

04:35.250 --> 04:40.920
your WordPress website and post anything then you have to do it so you can just work it out if you want

04:40.920 --> 04:42.890
to but this is not recommended.

04:43.230 --> 04:48.810
OK and then we have the reading settings so in the readings are things you can see that here we have

04:48.810 --> 04:53.280
the main settings so we have worked with this already.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.400
That is why I don't have to explain this.

04:55.420 --> 05:02.370
But now if I just select to be like your home page displays latest post then you will see that my home

05:02.370 --> 05:08.640
page will be actually the blog page and will display all the latest polls like this.

05:08.650 --> 05:11.100
OK so this is how it works.

05:11.220 --> 05:15.590
OK and now we have the blog pages show at most 10.

05:15.590 --> 05:22.890
Post what this means that this page is going to show the 10 posts only and after that it's going to

05:22.890 --> 05:29.420
show the view more or something like that but the page nation like it was with the Apple Dotcom's so

05:29.490 --> 05:35.930
I pulled dot com slash NEWSROOM and now here you can see that we go down down down down.

05:36.060 --> 05:42.360
They can see it says this view more so it is showing a number of posts here and then it shows the view

05:42.360 --> 05:42.690
more.

05:42.720 --> 05:48.020
If someone clicks here then he is redirected down and that person can then just again click here.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.150
So this is outrageous.

05:49.170 --> 05:56.590
OK so now I can just choose to be like Plock pages show at most to boast.

05:56.840 --> 06:03.290
And I just go ahead and I just said Save changes and I'm mean come here and I'm going to refresh.

06:03.660 --> 06:05.350
Now here we can see how this is looking.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.170
So we have this hello world.

06:07.170 --> 06:09.470
I have another post and then we have this.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.980
I'm just going to click here and that's going to take me to the page 2 and then I have this.

06:14.010 --> 06:15.350
So this is how it's looking.

06:15.550 --> 06:24.440
OK now here if I just select it like this to be like 10 I want it to be like normal.

06:24.590 --> 06:33.800
OK and then let's go ahead and let's just hit this and let's refresh so I can see that it will show

06:34.160 --> 06:35.980
all the posts here only to 10.

06:36.010 --> 06:41.050
But Meeson's since we don't have 10 that is why this is not showing the nation right here.

06:42.050 --> 06:44.020
So this is how it works.

06:44.030 --> 06:44.450
OK.

06:44.630 --> 06:52.580
And now we have this one syndication feed and this for each article in a feed which is not much recommended

06:52.640 --> 06:54.540
or it is not useful.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.920
So we'll be doing that and upcoming videos and we'll work actually.

06:58.070 --> 06:59.190
I'll tell you about this.

06:59.240 --> 07:06.350
So just leave it as it is and you can see that we're also done with this so now we have this discussion

07:06.980 --> 07:11.240
and then we have the media and the permalink permanent you guys already know and this media you will

07:11.240 --> 07:18.140
know right now and for the discussion I will create a new specific video so because discussion is the

07:18.140 --> 07:18.760
comments.

07:18.770 --> 07:19.180
OK.

07:19.370 --> 07:23.630
And then the next video will just understand and BODEY comments and then the discussion and then we'll

07:23.630 --> 07:24.250
move forward.

07:24.320 --> 07:30.260
So in the media section you can just worry that the Tufnel size and the medium size and the large size.

07:30.260 --> 07:30.820
OK.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.180
So like if you add any media.

07:33.380 --> 07:40.220
And then here we just add up to be like three sizes like it should be like a medium sized medium sized

07:40.220 --> 07:47.150
pixel would be like 300 by 300 and large size would be like 1 0 2 4 5 and 0 2 4.

07:47.150 --> 07:50.360
So this is called the large size this is called the medium size.

07:50.360 --> 07:54.530
And this is called the thumbnail size scrub thumbnail to exact dimensions.

07:54.540 --> 07:55.820
This is selected as well.

07:56.120 --> 08:03.290
So now here it says you guys must have understanding this if you have not then you will understand this

08:03.290 --> 08:08.870
later on and you will be working up to their e-commerce site and we will work more into the customization

08:08.870 --> 08:10.420
then you will understand it.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.900
So just keep it as the overview.

08:12.980 --> 08:17.310
This one is like I'm organized my uploads into month an error based folder.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.080
What is this.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.550
I'm going to open up the picture OK.

08:22.630 --> 08:23.830
This is a picture that I have.

08:23.860 --> 08:24.920
I just track this.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.060
OK let me just open it up and I just drag this OK.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.390
I'm going to copy the URL of this picture.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.120
OK.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.990
And I just come here and I just paste it right here.

08:35.080 --> 08:43.240
Then you can see that my picture is organized in month and either based folder which is selected if

08:43.240 --> 08:46.000
I don't want this if I just be like I don't like it.

08:46.030 --> 08:47.700
I just want it to be like Slash shiploads.

08:47.740 --> 08:51.910
And then this then I'll just seem like I'm here I'll just sit like this and I'm going to go ahead and

08:51.910 --> 08:53.200
I'm going to had saved changes.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.370
That's all I have to do.

08:54.640 --> 09:01.220
And when I vill add new images it will not be organized so I want to add any image.

09:01.240 --> 09:06.280
Let's suppose then I want to add this image.

09:06.330 --> 09:06.690
OK.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.580
So this is the image that I have added.

09:08.730 --> 09:10.450
Ok this will be uploaded right now.

09:10.530 --> 09:15.720
And this is the image that is coming if I just open it up and I just grabbed the link and then I just

09:15.720 --> 09:17.290
come here and I just paste it.

09:17.460 --> 09:20.180
Then he can see that this is like a slash shiploads.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.500
See the blue Peasey slash the image name.

09:22.530 --> 09:24.380
And then it just looking.

09:24.420 --> 09:29.610
So this is how it works guys and it works seriously and really amazing.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.840
So I can see that we are totally done with these settings.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.590
OK these were so easy.

09:34.590 --> 09:37.450
And now you can see that you have understanded everything.

09:37.470 --> 09:41.850
So in the next video we'll be working on for the comments and then really working up the discussion

09:42.270 --> 09:45.330
in the next video so stadium guys and up about.
