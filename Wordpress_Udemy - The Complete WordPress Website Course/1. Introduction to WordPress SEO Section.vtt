00:00.700 --> 00:05.160
Hear what is up guys and welcome to the s e o update section.

00:05.210 --> 00:05.620
OK.

00:05.750 --> 00:09.000
You can see that this is the word press corps that is coming to an end.

00:09.140 --> 00:12.930
But I thought why not just add the S O section to.

00:12.940 --> 00:15.550
Or is this the complete word press corps.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.520
So today this is January 24th.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.260
And recording this video OK.

00:20.270 --> 00:28.460
And now we're going to be talking about the CEO like how is the awards what is a CEO and how everything

00:28.490 --> 00:29.910
works with the CEO.

00:30.040 --> 00:30.470
OK.

00:30.620 --> 00:33.840
Now we can see that we now know how to set up the website.

00:33.860 --> 00:39.000
We can now build these different type of websites wed WordPress.

00:39.190 --> 00:45.290
OK and now we want to learn how to do the SEO and why SEO is so important.

00:45.360 --> 00:50.350
So SEO stands for basically search engine optimization.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.090
OK.

00:51.230 --> 00:55.920
I don't have prepaid any of the powerpoint presentations because I hate it.

00:55.920 --> 01:01.100
Seriously because if I don't like learning from the PowerPoint presentation then why would I want to

01:01.100 --> 01:02.140
teach them that.

01:02.180 --> 01:07.460
That is why I hate it and I just want to show you the real world explanations here should just listen

01:07.460 --> 01:08.070
to it.

01:08.190 --> 01:09.630
But I'm seeing right now.

01:09.740 --> 01:14.200
OK so ASIO's stands for Search Engine Optimization what it does.

01:14.270 --> 01:19.420
OK let's suppose that we have build a professional e-commerce Web site.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.020
OK.

01:20.270 --> 01:25.610
And now we want to learn we want to basically get a lot of sales to our e-commerce Web site because

01:26.230 --> 01:31.850
we want to get sales because the site creation was to get sales OK.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.900
We wanted to earn money.

01:32.900 --> 01:36.810
Obviously we are we are doing a business that gets to our own money.

01:36.830 --> 01:42.050
And in order for earning money we basically have to get more clients.

01:42.050 --> 01:44.450
We basically have to attract them.

01:44.540 --> 01:45.580
How we're going to attract them.

01:45.620 --> 01:45.990
OK.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.400
So this is called the CEO.

01:47.420 --> 01:49.850
Like you don't have to do anything.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.690
You just have to give the best content.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.830
You just have to do some of this stuff.

01:54.860 --> 01:55.240
OK.

01:55.260 --> 01:56.440
That Google recommends.

01:56.450 --> 01:56.900
OK.

01:56.990 --> 02:03.500
And if you do to your website then your website will organically come into Google and the top results

02:03.500 --> 02:06.380
so you don't have to do buy the paid advertisement.

02:06.530 --> 02:12.140
You don't have to buy the will adversion everything and everything will be organic like you don't have

02:12.140 --> 02:13.040
to do anything.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.580
Google will give your site on the number one page of results.

02:16.580 --> 02:23.340
Lets suppose that I search for like the best iPhone covers.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.470
OK.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.010
OK like this is like here.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.600
So you can see this is right here.

02:29.660 --> 02:40.040
Or if I just search for like iPhone 10 cover by online.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.020
OK.

02:41.150 --> 02:42.940
Like I want to buy iPhone 10 Khowar.

02:42.950 --> 02:47.790
You can see the iPhone 10 mobile cases cords and accessories by online.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.370
OK this is right here.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.620
This is the number one page.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.490
This is the number one website that is free here.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.090
OK.

02:53.090 --> 02:56.150
Then we have this website shop here we have this.

02:56.180 --> 02:58.060
Theres this and there are so many.

02:58.250 --> 02:58.660
OK.

02:58.790 --> 03:01.120
So this is how it works guys.

03:01.180 --> 03:01.860
OK.

03:02.020 --> 03:08.140
Google basically you get a lot of sales from Google and these are organic.

03:08.140 --> 03:10.090
You can see everything is right here.

03:10.150 --> 03:15.340
If I just open up this website it can see that I'll be redirected to this website and I can buy this

03:15.400 --> 03:17.340
iPhone 10 color from here.

03:17.350 --> 03:19.660
They can see these are right here.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.970
I can buy these covers from here.

03:22.990 --> 03:23.360
OK.

03:23.470 --> 03:31.810
So this is how basically Google works and we have to prepare our e-commerce Web site so that our e-commerce

03:31.840 --> 03:34.220
website is fully SEO optimized.

03:34.240 --> 03:39.490
Okay now you can see that there are some things that you might see there are amazing.

03:39.610 --> 03:39.910
OK.

03:39.910 --> 03:46.330
Number one is this each to PBS which is right here it is secure and the Web sites that we have created.

03:46.330 --> 03:49.080
Lets suppose that this was the first project that we were working on.

03:49.210 --> 03:49.620
Okay.

03:49.810 --> 03:52.210
And this website were not is not secure.

03:52.210 --> 03:56.090
OK so this website will not come on the number 1 page result.

03:56.320 --> 04:01.900
OK because this website does not is not secure it its website does not have its GDP as if I just add

04:01.900 --> 04:02.110
it.

04:02.110 --> 04:04.580
OK let me just go ahead and let me add it.

04:05.550 --> 04:05.920
Okay.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.870
And then I just added you will see it and it is your connection is not private and everything so we

04:10.870 --> 04:12.820
will be covering each and everything.

04:12.820 --> 04:17.760
The other thing that I focused on is that if I just open up this website you can see how fast it loads.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.180
OK.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.740
This website loads just very fast.

04:20.780 --> 04:22.990
OK you can see how fast it loads.

04:23.020 --> 04:25.800
Now this website took a lot of time to load.

04:25.990 --> 04:31.420
So these are some factors that I'm telling you right now that how you can manage them and everything.

04:31.450 --> 04:40.220
Now here if I just go down I can see that this website consists of these pages Katis sitemap and Manser

04:40.370 --> 04:48.620
authors contact us about us in these pages so it makes it like on this website is authentic will find

04:48.620 --> 04:52.870
these pages and if it has it then we find it like OK.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.060
This site is pendek.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.870
OK so this is how it works basically.

04:58.220 --> 05:05.470
OK so now you can see that we have the basic understanding of the Osseo like how we can optimize her

05:05.510 --> 05:13.210
website for the CEO and how we can make sure that our Web site comes on the one page result to really

05:13.210 --> 05:14.240
be taking this Web site.

05:14.240 --> 05:14.640
OK.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.520
You can see how we create a WB site.

05:16.580 --> 05:20.850
I'm going to be demonstrating you different tips that you can implement to your website.

05:20.960 --> 05:21.390
OK.

05:21.500 --> 05:28.050
And then after you implement it you'll see that your website will come on in the top results.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.920
Ok I'm not guaranteeing you that.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.370
OK you might see the top result or you may not.

05:33.530 --> 05:33.940
OK.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.520
So it may vary.

05:36.710 --> 05:37.300
OK.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.470
Because you have to focus on this.

05:39.500 --> 05:39.850
OK.

05:39.860 --> 05:42.670
And when you are done you have to wait for some time.

05:42.680 --> 05:42.920
OK.

05:42.920 --> 05:49.820
Because you can see that the websites that were top in the Google results they were very old web site

05:49.820 --> 05:55.630
like they were established from like three years four years and it takes some time for your website

05:55.730 --> 06:01.510
to come on the top because you have to create people created back clean instead state of web site.

06:01.660 --> 06:02.040
OK.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.990
They will promote your website and everything.

06:04.130 --> 06:07.700
And so these are done and then your website will come on top.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.030
So it takes some time guys.

06:10.040 --> 06:10.540
OK.

06:10.550 --> 06:14.690
So don't be like don't be like if you're ever upset is not coming on top or you are not getting sales

06:15.020 --> 06:17.850
in the first six months or just a year.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.200
Then be like OK I'm not getting it.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.080
I have to stop it.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.350
You have to continue it.

06:22.460 --> 06:22.850
OK.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.980
Create a lot of create add a lot of products to your e-commerce website or everything or if you have

06:27.980 --> 06:31.320
a blog then make sure to add more and more articles to it.

06:31.430 --> 06:31.830
OK.

06:31.970 --> 06:36.340
Or if you a business web site then you have to focus on the paid advertisements.

06:36.410 --> 06:40.980
OK so now you can see that in the next video we will be working up for the tapes.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.330
OK.

06:41.330 --> 06:46.670
I'm going to be telling you some tips that you have to add to your website and when you add it you will

06:46.670 --> 06:51.600
see that your website will be so amazing.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.440
So in the next video we'll be working on that.

06:53.520 --> 06:53.840
Goodbye.
