00:00.480 --> 00:02.310
Hear what is up guys and welcome x.

00:02.320 --> 00:07.830
Now in this video I'm going to show you that how can you integrate this MailChimp with your WordPress

00:07.830 --> 00:11.600
website so you can see that we created our blog that was like this.

00:11.610 --> 00:12.110
OK.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.380
We just created this.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.140
We just this vidis we just designed this whole blog.

00:16.140 --> 00:16.530
OK.

00:16.680 --> 00:20.500
So in this video I'm going to show you that how can you basically just make it for it.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.080
OK it is news later.

00:22.140 --> 00:24.310
It is your e-mail and it says newsletter.

00:24.330 --> 00:30.850
So if anyone is going to enter the e-mail then that e-mail is going to be just coming into ourself.

00:31.020 --> 00:37.640
And when we want to send our all the subscribers those who just entered their e-mail address here it

00:37.650 --> 00:38.920
should be sent.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.750
Then just one click.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.990
So I'm going to show you how can you do that.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.830
First of all what you have to do is make sure that you are in the dashboard of the MailChimp.

00:46.860 --> 00:47.200
OK.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.750
And then you have to just hit list.

00:48.750 --> 00:53.930
So in the list there will be all the list that you have so you will not be having any of the list here.

00:54.060 --> 00:59.070
And it says create lists so we need to create a list do you want to create a new list or do you want

00:59.070 --> 01:01.650
to just subdivide an existing list of crops.

01:01.650 --> 01:03.380
No I just want to create a list.

01:03.390 --> 01:03.750
OK.

01:03.870 --> 01:09.010
So let's just come here and let's just create a list so my list is going to be list name.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.550
So it is just going to show the name that I have.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.500
So my last name will be

01:19.200 --> 01:24.200
my blog subscriber.

01:24.460 --> 01:31.200
And then I have the default from email address so this is the address for people to reply to.

01:31.330 --> 01:37.030
So this address should be basically from the domain name of your e-mail address.

01:37.030 --> 01:37.770
What I mean.

01:37.930 --> 01:43.230
Let me show you is that if you just come here that you can see that in the email section.

01:43.240 --> 01:49.660
I have just created in full and complete of course dot com so I can ask how can I create this email

01:49.660 --> 01:50.840
for God's sake.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.750
How can I create it in this way.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.700
I'm going to show you guys.

01:53.710 --> 01:54.170
OK.

01:54.220 --> 01:59.300
So basically what you have to do you have to just go ahead and you have to log in to your seat panel.

01:59.580 --> 02:00.160
OK.

02:00.220 --> 02:05.110
And then what you have to do you have to basically in the portal view are just logging yourself in and

02:05.110 --> 02:07.240
then transfer a cell to the battle.

02:07.270 --> 02:10.570
So I'm just going to click here and allow me to dig into the see gallery here.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.540
I'm not going to create every e-mail separately like for S2 it should be.

02:13.540 --> 02:18.340
As to info and for complete that will be Course it to be just complete will be coarse and just creating

02:18.620 --> 02:19.660
I'm just giving you an example.

02:19.670 --> 02:20.210
OK.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.150
So we are here in the c bal OK.

02:24.190 --> 02:25.200
I am here.

02:25.390 --> 02:26.210
Yes.

02:26.230 --> 02:26.790
OK.

02:26.830 --> 02:30.510
This is the main domain name ID and Ziel dot com you guys already knew about it.

02:30.520 --> 02:30.780
OK.

02:30.790 --> 02:36.040
And now what you have to do you have to go down go down go down and you should be saying this email

02:36.040 --> 02:37.630
and that's e-mail accounts.

02:37.660 --> 02:38.070
OK.

02:38.170 --> 02:42.840
So here we can manage every e-mail account that we have.

02:42.850 --> 02:43.250
OK.

02:43.390 --> 02:47.260
So first email account that I want to create would be like my own.

02:47.260 --> 02:50.750
So this will be like 10 Zele at the rate yield dot com.

02:51.170 --> 02:51.840
OK.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.020
And you're going to enter it.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.180
We're going to intro like 10 0.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.150
At the rate I and Ziel dot com.

03:22.080 --> 03:22.380
user.

03:22.380 --> 03:24.700
So I think unlimited looks cool.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.310
So make it basically a Google gives you like 30 G-B of storage.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.750
If you buy it for dollar like five dollars per month but it is recommended.

03:33.960 --> 03:39.300
Obviously guys your e-mails will be stored on Google and your show will be from Google and everything

03:39.300 --> 03:40.050
will be from Google.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.540
So it is recommended.

03:41.550 --> 03:46.110

And then we have the MailChimp curial settings so it's just going to generate randomly so do not worry

10:36.900 --> 10:37.620
about it.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.130

11:00.140 --> 11:01.880
to our list.

11:01.970 --> 11:06.490
So you have to just remind your users that why they are receiving this email.

11:06.530 --> 11:12.710
So OK this is how it is look if you are receiving this e-mail because you are up to the number of states

11:12.710 --> 11:13.570
and this is an example.

11:13.580 --> 11:14.160
OK.

11:14.210 --> 11:18.810
And then we have the company organization so my company organization would be I tend to.

11:19.180 --> 11:25.100
OK and then I have the address and the city the board and the postal code and everything and now we

11:25.100 --> 11:32.550
have to enter my phone numbers so this is right here and then I have send contacts an opt in confirmation

11:32.550 --> 11:41.580
email and this tripe to your list so if you if you want only like people who should be the person like

11:41.700 --> 11:49.720
if they want to just look into your site or add it to your subscriber list then you want to conform

11:49.720 --> 11:56.530
so that you have just a limit of 2000 subscribers guys so you should just be like You should check it.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.120
If you just care about that.

11:58.330 --> 11:59.570
So you can do that.

11:59.980 --> 12:04.970
So now here it would be like the notification center there so you can see like daily summary.

12:04.990 --> 12:10.020
So like if anyone have tried to see a list then it's going to show the daily summary and if you like

12:10.030 --> 12:16.600
if two people subscribe to your list OK on a same day then and then at the end of the day it will just

12:16.600 --> 12:21.270
show you the daily summary and if subscribed notifications as they happen been if anyone's is trying

12:21.280 --> 12:23.670
to sell it then it'll just send you automatic.

12:23.690 --> 12:29.710
OK once I get three people who have tried to your day on single day then it'll show you.

12:29.710 --> 12:33.380
Three e-mails per day so you can just select it if you have so much time.

12:33.430 --> 12:37.540
You can still like this one and unsubscribe notifications as they happen so you can also select this

12:37.540 --> 12:41.990
like this guy just unsubscribe from the list or something like that so you just have to hit save for

12:47.950 --> 12:48.330
OK.

12:48.340 --> 12:53.250
All this means that you have no people who have signed up to your list.

12:53.260 --> 12:59.980
You can see I can just manage I can unsubscribe addresses I can just just send anyone into Krups I can

12:59.980 --> 13:05.090
just sit in here in this segment import history conduct export and delete all contact.

13:05.110 --> 13:05.600
OK.

13:05.860 --> 13:10.810
So in the ad contacts you can add a subscriber or you can just imported from like a CISPA.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.140
A lot of e-mail.

13:12.140 --> 13:15.040
So and then we also have the Sign-Up farms.

13:15.310 --> 13:24.660
So in this sign of forms it will be like like how a person can basically sign up to your specific items

13:24.660 --> 13:25.510
Ziel mailing list.

13:25.510 --> 13:26.130
OK.

13:26.200 --> 13:32.020
So please verify and deal and deal and deal dot com as a default from email address before signing up

13:32.020 --> 13:35.850
a form so you can see that we have to verify this domain name.

13:36.130 --> 13:42.130
So I'm just gonna click here and it will be like it will ask us how we want to just accept that.

13:42.130 --> 13:47.390
So is saying that send verification email so it's just going to send the verification e-mail.

13:47.410 --> 13:54.100
I'm just going to open up and open up my inbox and we should have received an e-mail address and a verification

13:54.100 --> 13:54.580
e-mail.

13:54.730 --> 13:56.620
So I haven't received it yet.

13:56.620 --> 13:57.410
I don't know why.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.810
Yes it is right here.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.390
Verify your domain before sending and it is by MailChimp.

14:01.390 --> 14:02.590
So I'm just gonna open this up.

14:02.920 --> 14:07.870
And now here I'm just going to copy this MailChimp court so I'm just going to go up here and I'm going

14:07.870 --> 14:10.370
to go do this right here and I'm going to paste it.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.840
So on pasting you just verify and it should be verified.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.700
You can see domain is verified.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.670
So now this is here.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.760
I can just manage everything.

14:18.760 --> 14:23.620
Make sure you first of all come here and you just change it so you can say you want to change your sign

14:23.620 --> 14:29.800
a form title to sign them forms and a confirmation email for your side list use the original list title

14:30.040 --> 14:33.010
you can update this text or replace it with an image.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.670
And this kind of form editor.

14:35.050 --> 14:40.870
So then we have this like this default email subject so you can also use the default email subject default

14:40.870 --> 14:41.610
from name.

14:41.610 --> 14:43.480
And we have subscribers and everything.

14:43.510 --> 14:49.470
So you can see and we have also like a farm protect your from.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.720
You can also add the like a capture.

14:53.290 --> 14:58.630
You guys already know that if I just enable it then it will ask the user to just like fill in a form

14:58.750 --> 15:04.630
like what are the images so you can just get a big example like if we just go to areas and start com.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.300
OK.

15:05.380 --> 15:07.890
And then we just go down to register now.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.740
Ok then in the register now you can see this is the capture that is coming and I have to enter this

15:11.740 --> 15:18.820
so this it will ask the user to do that so that no computers are no real boards scan basically sign

15:18.820 --> 15:20.360
up to my list too.

15:20.380 --> 15:24.600
So it just gets heavy and it's not good.

15:24.610 --> 15:26.370
So make sure that he was just accepted.

15:26.610 --> 15:26.830
OK.

15:26.830 --> 15:30.030
And then we have send a final e-mail.

15:30.140 --> 15:31.570
People who often do a list.

15:31.570 --> 15:36.700
Send them an e-mail welcoming them to the list the final e-mail can be listed in the list phone designer

15:37.050 --> 15:43.840
let users plain text or HDMI e-mails send and subscribe information to the subscribers so would have

15:43.900 --> 15:45.210
everything right here.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.710
I'm just going to come here and now hear what I'm going to do.

15:47.710 --> 15:51.040

15:57.250 --> 15:57.910

15:58.080 --> 16:00.170

16:06.070 --> 16:14.560
