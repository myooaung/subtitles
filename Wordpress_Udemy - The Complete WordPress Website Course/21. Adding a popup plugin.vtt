Let's go down.

01:21.410 --> 01:23.300

OK.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.510
So we're going to be using this plug in right now.

01:33.610 --> 01:33.910
OK.

01:33.910 --> 01:35.880
You can also go with so many plug ins.

01:35.920 --> 01:42.310
There are also the customization videos and the plug ins that you can watch them and then you can see

01:42.610 --> 01:43.760
how these plug ins work.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.160
OK so it totally depends upon you.

01:46.210 --> 01:50.290
OK what I want to do I want to install this plugin right now I'm going to come here and I'm going to

01:50.290 --> 01:50.770
hit.

01:50.860 --> 01:57.430
And I'm going to basically search pop up OK and here you should be seeing that plug in.

01:57.430 --> 02:02.680
So here we have the pop maker T.M. best rate and I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit install

02:02.770 --> 02:03.910
now.

02:07.170 --> 02:11.520
And you can see that it has been activated and is going to come here and I'm going to hit activate and

02:11.520 --> 02:13.680
this plug in should be activated right now.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.910
So after this plugin is activated we're going to make the changes.

02:18.150 --> 02:18.620
OK.

02:18.630 --> 02:23.790
I'm just going to skip because I don't on any off the newsletter.

02:23.790 --> 02:24.260
OK.

02:24.330 --> 02:24.820
There we go.

02:24.870 --> 02:27.180
We want to add a pop up right now.

02:27.210 --> 02:28.360
So what I'm going to do.

02:28.380 --> 02:29.070
I'm just going to come here.

02:29.070 --> 02:32.250
I'm going to hit add all up OK.

02:32.360 --> 02:37.790
And this probably is going to be the public needs so you can have a pop up name pop up name is going

02:37.790 --> 02:41.730
to be high or me.

02:42.010 --> 02:45.280
So you get at any of the names right here and not be visible to you.

02:45.430 --> 02:45.760
OK.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.660
And here I want to do the time.

02:47.830 --> 02:51.640
So I just basically want to get the cord off that the contact form.

02:51.640 --> 02:52.420
I'm just going to come here.

02:52.420 --> 02:56.530
I'm going to go to the contact forms right here and I want to crab discord.

02:56.530 --> 03:01.270
So the higher you hire me from I'm just going to copy this form and I'm going to just skim here and

03:01.270 --> 03:04.730
I'm going to drag it and drop a trade here so you can add anything right here.

03:04.750 --> 03:08.270
You can also add like hello world.

03:08.290 --> 03:12.230
OK let's just add hello world for right now hello world.

03:12.430 --> 03:13.020
OK.

03:13.060 --> 03:19.960
And what I want now is that trigger that how you want this pop up to open so what I want I need to trigger

03:20.070 --> 03:22.380
that how I want my papa to open.

03:22.420 --> 03:27.590
So if someone clicks then this pop up should open.

03:27.760 --> 03:28.260
OK.

03:28.270 --> 03:32.290
And this we can choose that how we want the public to be open.

03:32.290 --> 03:37.760
So link exact match link containing link begins with link and vid.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.270
So Lincoln taining can be very OK.

03:41.410 --> 03:43.570
I'm just going to come here and a tease here.

03:43.630 --> 03:44.310
Lincoln.

03:44.320 --> 03:54.970
So if my link contains hash and then hire me if my Lincoln Daines this hire me hash tag hire me then

03:55.000 --> 03:56.670
it's going to show the pop up OK.

03:56.890 --> 04:00.160
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit this OK.

04:00.350 --> 04:03.850
And what I want to do right now is that.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.770
So I don't want to add any conditions you can.

04:06.770 --> 04:10.100
Conditions are used to limit and in Whoville to see a pop up.

04:10.100 --> 04:16.880
So you can show the condition that all pages pages with selected Borst are like my Roberti media categories

04:16.880 --> 04:18.100
format and something like that.

04:18.100 --> 04:18.540
OK.

04:18.620 --> 04:24.500
So you can disable this pop up on mobile devices and you can disable this pop up on tablet devices so

04:24.500 --> 04:25.670
you can do that as well.

04:25.730 --> 04:25.950
OK.

04:25.970 --> 04:28.520
Let's go ahead and let's hit publish right now.

04:28.850 --> 04:29.280
OK.

04:29.510 --> 04:33.750
And I want to go to my Web site here.

04:34.400 --> 04:42.060
Let's just come here and close the stop and after coming to my site I want to basically added this with

04:42.100 --> 04:44.780
elementary and I'm going to add the hash tag.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.830
Hire me Dagh here.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.790
So here I want to come I want to click this

04:55.950 --> 05:00.050
and I want to add this Dilling should be hash.

05:00.190 --> 05:01.890
Hire me.

05:02.250 --> 05:02.650
OK.

05:02.820 --> 05:06.580
I want to get in here and I want to hit save.

05:06.590 --> 05:07.160
There we go.

05:07.340 --> 05:07.780
OK.

05:07.850 --> 05:15.210
Now what I want to do I just want to open this up this page right now.

05:15.230 --> 05:16.930
Iten zealot comp.

05:17.540 --> 05:17.820
OK.

05:17.850 --> 05:22.560
And now you're going to see this how would this pop up where it's OK if someone clicks this you can

05:22.560 --> 05:25.680
see this pop up is right here and it says hello world.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.700
This problem is giving.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.170
So this is outworks

05:31.580 --> 05:33.770
OK you can change the team.

05:33.770 --> 05:39.070
You can change it to be like framed botter cutting edge halo box and prize blue light box.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.550
So I just like this one.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.770
Let's go ahead and let it update.

05:42.830 --> 05:45.120
You can even customize this team if you want to.

05:45.140 --> 05:45.820
OK.

05:45.830 --> 05:46.630
I'm just going to come here.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.170
I'm going to Sri Festus.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.130
And then let's come here and let's refresh.

05:51.130 --> 05:51.630
Here you go.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.740
This is how it is looking.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.530
The light box so you can customize this as well.

05:55.540 --> 05:55.830
OK.

05:55.840 --> 06:01.810
You can also go with the cutting edge cutting edge looks pretty decent as well.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.850
If you want to go with a cutting edge you can also go with

06:08.580 --> 06:09.290
OK.

06:09.440 --> 06:15.470
So I think that this cutting edge is basically going up into our team our team so you can also customize

06:15.470 --> 06:19.640
the scene you just have to come here and it's going to take you to the customized team where you can

06:19.640 --> 06:22.700
just change the overlay setting so you can see that this is how it is looking.

06:22.850 --> 06:27.110
You can change the background color or you can change the container color or you can change the padding

06:27.110 --> 06:31.140
so it's going to basically do exactly as how it's going to look.

06:31.430 --> 06:32.860
So then we have the Bactrim color.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.630
We have the border you want the border to be and this is how you can do it.

06:36.680 --> 06:42.490
So I'm just going to come here to pop up teams OK and you can see that we have so many teams right here

06:42.500 --> 06:52.580
so you can just hit just control and edit at it at it at it and at it and at it you can see that these

06:52.580 --> 06:53.600
are here right here.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.130
So let's see how this is going to look.

06:57.140 --> 07:03.210
This bubble is going to look how this probably is going to look and how this one is going to look.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.590
This one and this one.

07:06.140 --> 07:08.410
So I basically like this one the cutting edge one.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.080
OK.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.970
What I want to do I want to overlay to be low.

07:14.410 --> 07:14.790
OK.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.200
The overlay is going to be blue

07:19.410 --> 07:26.540
that opacity should be more OK and or you can go with the overlay to be black.

07:26.890 --> 07:27.370
OK.

07:27.370 --> 07:28.780
The overlay should be black.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.390
OK the opacity should be 72 percent.

07:31.390 --> 07:33.250
You can increase the opacity.

07:33.250 --> 07:34.780
I think this much.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.090
Then we have the container.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.020
So the container or the background colors should be blue.

07:40.090 --> 07:43.190
You can go with the background colors to be white.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.210
OK.

07:44.260 --> 07:47.920
And this is the text color the text color

07:50.580 --> 07:53.070
titled settings so title can be white.

07:53.070 --> 08:01.680
Titles should be Plack or yes and the text shadow the content sitting in the corner and turning you

08:01.690 --> 08:05.030
need to manage the color so you can see that the title is black right now.

08:05.230 --> 08:14.940
And I want to go to the Condon's settings on settings should be Plack Harry go and the clothes.

08:14.950 --> 08:16.730
So the clothes button is going to be this.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.970
The padding is is this desk top pride.

08:18.970 --> 08:22.900
We have the font we have the color and then we have the background so we have the background.

08:23.740 --> 08:25.990
I just wanted the background to be

08:29.190 --> 08:33.410
full blue and the colors should be white.

08:33.930 --> 08:34.840
Let's have a look.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.250
OK.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.140
This is our papa is going to appear.

08:38.190 --> 08:39.110
OK.

08:39.420 --> 08:40.070
There we go.

08:40.080 --> 08:47.910
I just can move on with this so you can also go read the style of the border.

08:48.290 --> 08:49.250
I think

08:57.650 --> 08:58.660
the true Von

09:03.100 --> 09:05.570
get just choose none.

09:05.790 --> 09:06.840
OK.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.610
Let's have a look at everything right now so everything looks cool.

09:15.080 --> 09:15.420
Yes.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.140
OK.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.840
Now what I want to do I just want to come here and I want to hit a date.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.600
So this team is going to be updated right now.

09:23.620 --> 09:34.190
Now I want to come here to my website to refresh this and let's it you or me so you can see how this

09:34.190 --> 09:34.910
is looking.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.780
This is how my pop up is coming.

09:36.890 --> 09:38.870
So this problem is also responsive.

09:38.870 --> 09:45.220
You can see that if I did that if my screen size is changing this pop up size is also changing.

09:45.470 --> 09:45.920
OK.

09:45.920 --> 09:51.380
So you can show it on all devices and he can also just do not show it on mobile devices if you want

09:51.380 --> 09:51.530
to.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.660
OK.

09:52.670 --> 09:57.220
Now what I want to do I want to add the frame rate here in the BOP.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.050
So I'm just going to close all these stamps.

10:04.210 --> 10:05.920
OK close this one as well.

10:06.210 --> 10:11.900
ALEX Kim here let's skim here to all pop ups in the public maker.

10:12.110 --> 10:12.380
OK.

10:12.380 --> 10:20.690
And I want to go to it and here I want to paste that code that seased contact form.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.090
So I want to base that conduct from ID.

10:23.110 --> 10:24.140
OK.

10:24.250 --> 10:27.800
I want to code down and I want to update OK.

10:28.180 --> 10:32.910
And here I want to come here and I want to refresh this.

10:32.910 --> 10:33.570
Here you go.

10:33.670 --> 10:34.270
That's it.

10:34.530 --> 10:35.780
And this is how it's looking.

10:35.910 --> 10:42.270
So we have name email business name select the service Chouan your message and then said I want to add

10:42.270 --> 10:44.510
the title to be and the title would be.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.850
Hire me.

10:49.370 --> 10:49.800
OK.

10:49.810 --> 10:53.210
I also wanted to add one line so that is going to be.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.910
Please fill this form

11:00.410 --> 11:02.850
for hiring

11:12.920 --> 11:14.460
Let's come here and let's say a date.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.170
OK.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.320
Now let's come here let's refresh this page

11:23.680 --> 11:27.800
in a hurry so you can see the title The description in here it says everything.

11:27.810 --> 11:32.070
So if my screen say you just change you can see how this is this pop up is looking.

11:32.160 --> 11:35.010
OK so now we have created a pop up.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.600
We are done with everything.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.540
Now we want to do the mobile optimization.

11:38.540 --> 11:42.500
And also just disabled US pop up on mobile devices.

11:42.500 --> 11:48.060
So if someone clicks this pop up this way this burden on the mobile device you should be redirected

11:48.060 --> 11:53.130
to this page instead of opening the pop up because we don't want to open up pop up on mobile devices

11:53.160 --> 11:59.550
otherwise it would be a little bit of a mess and I don't want my viewers to be messy not that messy

12:00.010 --> 12:02.560
Ronaldo messy but messy messy normal messy.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.030
OK so thanks a lot guys for watching this.

12:05.070 --> 12:10.660
In the next video we're going to optimize the website for this mobo and also Sohlberg.

12:10.800 --> 12:15.800
I'm going to show you how can you just disable a burden on mobile devices and how can you do it with

12:15.810 --> 12:16.290
it.

12:16.350 --> 12:17.300
So stay tuned.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.270
And lie.
