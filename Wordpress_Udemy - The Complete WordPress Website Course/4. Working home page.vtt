00:00.560 --> 00:01.740
What is up guys and will come back.

00:01.740 --> 00:06.660
So now you can see that we're totally done with everything we have every page coming up.

00:06.770 --> 00:12.680
We have set it up some most important pages you can see that we have our categories coming here as well.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.570
So in this video we're going to be working up this home page you can see these are the posts that are

00:17.570 --> 00:18.200
coming here.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.570
I want to design this home page I want to make it look my LOOK LIKE HOW I WANT I WANT A slider of those

00:23.570 --> 00:27.520
like here in the above section and then here I want three sections like this.

00:27.530 --> 00:28.030
OK.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.270
And then I won the whole post to come right here.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.160
So you'll be designing this.

00:33.170 --> 00:34.540
And now let's get started.

00:34.550 --> 00:39.760
First of all what you have to do is just click here and it's layout and you can see that it will take

00:39.760 --> 00:41.900
us to a new page in here.

00:42.020 --> 00:44.640
We can edit this whole home page.

00:44.650 --> 00:45.120
OK.

00:45.140 --> 00:48.280
So we have the featured post slider right here.

00:48.290 --> 00:49.060
It's going to show.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.680
This is basically created by default.

00:51.710 --> 00:52.270
OK.

00:52.460 --> 00:57.110
What I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to just hit delete because I

00:57.110 --> 01:00.580
don't want anything right now so let's just do everything from scratch.

01:00.590 --> 01:04.760
And if we just go ahead and update it and then we go to view our page

01:08.090 --> 01:10.960
and see if this is how our page is looking.

01:10.980 --> 01:13.500
So we're going to design this page ourself right now.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.330
Let's go ahead and let's add a column right here.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.230
I'm going to hit this and I need a full column right here.

01:19.230 --> 01:21.650
And then here we have the insert module.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.930
So you guys already know about what is a module of Debbie.

01:24.990 --> 01:28.110
OK I'm going to click here and then I'm going to go to

01:31.580 --> 01:32.690
featured both sliders.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.900
Let's add a slider first.

01:33.920 --> 01:34.370
OK.

01:34.520 --> 01:40.850
And this slider is going to show the categories of all the blogging tips and the people who reviews

01:40.880 --> 01:42.040
only three categories.

01:42.050 --> 01:47.120
We are focusing on we're not focusing on so many categories so you can see that we have also posted

01:47.390 --> 01:48.730
on these categories.

01:48.740 --> 01:54.320
OK and post limit is going to be three so it's going to show only top three balls that we have right

01:54.320 --> 01:54.670
now.

01:54.770 --> 01:55.230
OK.

01:55.250 --> 01:58.380
And then we have the MXs titled correctors is going to be 50.

01:58.400 --> 02:03.910
We have the sword Metford So it's going to be we can show the most recent we can show the most popular

02:04.020 --> 02:05.520
and show the highest rated.

02:05.570 --> 02:08.450
We have the rating options in our blog post as well.

02:08.450 --> 02:11.140
Let me go to this right here.

02:11.490 --> 02:11.980
OK.

02:12.050 --> 02:18.110
And then what is the most popular most popular you can be like that has the most Common's the top rated

02:18.110 --> 02:22.240
means that has the most rated 5 star reviews on the post.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.170
So this is how you can categorize them.

02:24.170 --> 02:24.970
OK.

02:25.010 --> 02:30.860
So I'm going to show the most recent so that I get views on the most recent on top trending posts that

02:30.860 --> 02:31.510
I want to show.

02:31.580 --> 02:32.040
OK.

02:32.060 --> 02:32.920
Like top trending.

02:32.990 --> 02:34.940
So I want to show a slide or here basically.

02:34.950 --> 02:35.380
OK.

02:35.420 --> 02:39.410
And then here in the elements I'm going to design everything I want to turn it on.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.920
So I wanted to show the author's name and make sure the category name.

02:42.980 --> 02:47.460
I want to show the common name that how many how many how much Commines has been posted on that post.

02:47.630 --> 02:52.040
And then I have the reading I have the date and this is the date format and then let's go ahead and

02:52.040 --> 02:57.820
let it save and exit and I'm going to hit this a date right now and let's go to this guy right here.

02:57.860 --> 03:02.130
Let's click this logo and he and you you're going to see this is how it's looking.

03:02.150 --> 03:05.740
It is showing five recent post right here.

03:05.810 --> 03:06.220
OK.

03:06.290 --> 03:07.040
I'm going to click here.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.010
It's going to take me to the next one OK and then I click here.

03:10.010 --> 03:11.220
It's going to take me to this one.

03:11.330 --> 03:16.300
If I click here you can see three are coming OK so I think we have chosen three right here.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.900
If I click here let me click here.

03:19.220 --> 03:19.760
OK.

03:19.820 --> 03:20.060
Yes.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.850
We have chosen three posts to show.

03:21.850 --> 03:26.150
So you can see three balls start coming if you six six posts are going to appear here.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.450
And then I need to design this home page.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.520
I need to show some boxes right here.

03:30.560 --> 03:36.310
So what I'm going to do right now I am going to just add new roll.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.700
OK let's have a new rule.

03:37.730 --> 03:38.030
OK.

03:38.030 --> 03:44.980
And in the row I want to add three columns so I can add a big column right here and this one to be a

03:45.160 --> 03:45.870
call them.

03:45.910 --> 03:50.630
See I'm like this I can manage it like this so I basically need three columns.

03:50.630 --> 03:51.120
OK.

03:51.140 --> 03:56.450
And in the three columns I want to show three Dabbs for different categories so we are basically focusing

03:56.450 --> 03:58.610
on this category this category and this category.

03:58.610 --> 04:03.590
So let's open this category in all this data let me show you how these categories are appearing right

04:03.620 --> 04:04.100
now.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.940
If I just open up there you can see that we have three post here.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.770
If I open up this blogging tips we have this post here.

04:09.890 --> 04:14.990
And then in the category we have this post right here so I'm going to show all these three categories

04:15.080 --> 04:17.570
right here below section in the below section.

04:17.570 --> 04:18.750
So it totally depends.

04:18.800 --> 04:24.230
If you are focusing on so many categories you can show so many categories in these tabbed boxes in the

04:24.230 --> 04:28.820
below section as well and if you want to show most three that you want to show in the on the home page

04:28.820 --> 04:29.900
you can also show it like this.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.540
It totally depends upon you guys.

04:32.780 --> 04:33.200
OK.

04:33.260 --> 04:38.180
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to go to Ray here and then in the module I'm going

04:38.180 --> 04:39.460
to first insert

04:46.610 --> 04:47.210
the post.

04:47.300 --> 04:47.690
OK.

04:47.780 --> 04:50.170
So here in the post we can show that.

04:50.170 --> 04:56.630
So I'm going to click here post ok and then here I want to select the categories so my category is going

04:56.630 --> 04:57.170
to be

05:02.660 --> 05:10.260
all know I don't want to show all let's just click here let's just click here and let's delete this

05:10.290 --> 05:12.180
OK let's delete it.

05:12.210 --> 05:12.830
I'm going to come here.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.700
I'm going to delete it because I don't want to I don't want to show the post.

05:15.840 --> 05:20.550
I'm going to show a different one and that is yes.

05:20.580 --> 05:23.170
I want to show the post right now so I'm going to hit post right now.

05:23.190 --> 05:23.750
OK.

05:23.790 --> 05:28.080
And then here the category that I'm going to be choosing would be first apple and then the blogging

05:28.080 --> 05:29.420
tips and then the people.

05:29.430 --> 05:34.530
So I'm going to select at play here you can see that we have the post limit how many posts it's going

05:34.530 --> 05:35.700
to show in that box.

05:35.870 --> 05:39.110
So in that box it can show all the maximum Tripos we have.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.020
We want to show.

05:40.020 --> 05:40.500
OK.

05:40.500 --> 05:45.290
And it's going to display the most popular or the highest rated.

05:45.300 --> 05:50.060
So I think I would want to show the most popular that has the most comments on it.

05:50.070 --> 05:50.600
OK.

05:50.700 --> 05:51.150
So I'm good.

05:51.330 --> 05:56.430
I'm down and we have the show feature we made sure all three show categories and show Commines show

05:56.430 --> 05:57.680
rating should it and everything.

05:57.780 --> 06:03.080
So if you want to see that how your page is going to look it can just click this guy right here that

06:03.140 --> 06:05.490
is the I not the big boss but the I.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.830
So you can see this is how it's going to look.

06:07.830 --> 06:11.740
So we have Apple and it's going to show the popular post that we have right here.

06:11.940 --> 06:14.190
So you can see this has just one common.

06:14.190 --> 06:18.660
That is why it is right here and this has zero comments so it is not.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.600
So it is a nerd at below it.

06:20.610 --> 06:22.030
So this is how it's going to work.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.350
OK I'm going to go I'm here.

06:23.370 --> 06:25.790
I'm going to go to save and exit.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.460
And we're only showing three.

06:27.480 --> 06:32.790
So since we have only two categories and that that is why we cannot show more.

06:32.910 --> 06:38.720
So if we add one more post according in that category associated with that then we can show that.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.860
I'm going to insert the old and same like this.

06:40.860 --> 06:46.640
I'm going to select post right here and then here I want to select the blogging tips so blogging tips

06:46.710 --> 06:53.550
is also going to show the most popular on top so that that has the most comments on derating can be

06:53.550 --> 06:59.340
like if you want to show the highest rated you can so like them and you can also see that how many how

06:59.340 --> 07:01.090

07:04.650 --> 07:10.350
I want to go here I want to go to the polls right here and then I want to select people reviews from

07:10.350 --> 07:10.810
here.

07:10.980 --> 07:17.370
And here it's going to show the tree post and this is going to show the highest rated because the people

07:17.370 --> 07:22.450
reviews must be on the highest rated not the Commons space so this is a category assigned to that.

07:22.450 --> 07:28.710
OK I'm going to hit save and exit and let's have a look at our page right now how this page is looking

07:28.710 --> 07:33.370

I'm going to go to view say E-Trade now

07:39.460 --> 07:45.940
and let's have a look at a Web site so you can see that we have a list a slider that is showing the

07:46.600 --> 07:49.540
three most popular posts right here.

07:49.540 --> 07:53.270
And then we have the Apple category that is showing the most popular.

07:53.350 --> 07:55.000
And then we have the blogging tips.

07:55.140 --> 07:55.650

07:55.720 --> 07:59.370
That is showing the most popular with the featured image Isabel.

07:59.440 --> 08:00.960
And then we have this.

08:00.970 --> 08:03.730
People are reviews that is doing the top rated.

08:03.790 --> 08:06.440
So you can see that the free ones are coming here.

08:06.550 --> 08:12.960
OK so if I just come here and I just edit my read and I just make it full five star Ok I just go down.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.890

08:16.260 --> 08:16.680
OK.

08:16.750 --> 08:21.490
Then you can see that my reading has been added and this is going to be on the top of the page.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.140

08:23.140 --> 08:28.360
OK you can see that we have this full five star and this is now open five stars.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.000

08:30.040 --> 08:35.350
If I just come here right here again when I make it full five star then that will be coming on the top.

08:35.350 --> 08:37.100
