What is up guys and Malcolm X now in this video I'm going to be showing you that.

00:03.780 --> 00:06.530
What are the requirements for a website.

00:06.710 --> 00:07.230
OK.

00:07.290 --> 00:14.490
Like when we want to build a website we have to complete every requirement that is necessary for events

00:14.500 --> 00:18.050
or to there are two things that are required for the website.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.340
The first one is the domain name and the second one is the Web Hosting.

00:22.470 --> 00:31.740
OK so the domain name and the Web Hosting you can get for free and you can also get for like $150 as

00:31.740 --> 00:32.190
well.

00:32.390 --> 00:32.840
OK.

00:32.890 --> 00:36.470
Now why you should go over the paid one.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.700
I want to tell you this.

00:37.710 --> 00:38.030
OK.

00:38.190 --> 00:43.570
So free web hosting would be just for the learning purposes like if you want to learn it you can go

00:43.570 --> 00:47.940
to the free web hosting and then you can install WordPress in it and then you can basically learn that

00:48.000 --> 00:52.450
how everything works and how can you how to avoid press works in these.

00:52.500 --> 00:52.970
OK.

00:53.040 --> 00:59.190
And debate about hosting is used for professional purposes like when you want to just start your own

00:59.190 --> 01:02.480
company right now and you think OK I just want to start my own company.

01:02.580 --> 01:03.210
Like what.

01:03.210 --> 01:04.970
Most of the people are here for.

01:05.100 --> 01:05.710
OK.

01:05.760 --> 01:11.940
And so also you care about the data because the free web hosting servers are very slow like but you

01:11.940 --> 01:19.140
will start receiving some traffic to your website like 100 viewers per day then your site will be or

01:19.140 --> 01:26.640
your account will be suspended by the Freedom hosting and the paid web hosting like you will receive

01:26.640 --> 01:28.260
a lot a lot of viewers.

01:28.260 --> 01:33.960
Your website will not be just like suspended and your website will be live because you have paid for

01:33.960 --> 01:34.230
it.

01:34.370 --> 01:34.820
OK.

01:34.980 --> 01:37.850
That is why this is the difference between the web hosting.

01:37.950 --> 01:44.910
OK so what is a web hosting and how you can get it and how he can go with the paid of hosting and how

01:44.910 --> 01:46.480
we can go for the free posting.

01:46.550 --> 01:52.200
I am going to tell you each and everything but if you want to go with my suggestion that I would say

01:52.260 --> 01:59.450
like if you care about your data if you care about your everything then go with the paid hosting.

01:59.640 --> 02:05.250
But if you just cheer for learning purposes and you dont care if your website goes down or if your account

02:05.250 --> 02:08.640
gets just like it deleted you don't care.

02:08.820 --> 02:12.190
And then you can go get the free hosting.

02:12.510 --> 02:13.650
So lets get started.

02:13.650 --> 02:18.770
Now what is the web hosting and why is it a necessity.

02:18.810 --> 02:21.830
You can see that I am here in this Google dot com.

02:22.010 --> 02:22.310
OK.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.350
This Google dot com is called the domain name.

02:25.590 --> 02:25.960
OK.

02:26.130 --> 02:26.510
And what.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.480
Everything coming inside here is called the hosting.

02:30.480 --> 02:36.440
Like you can see this is the image if I just drag it and drop it right above here you can see Tay's

02:36.460 --> 02:41.840
slash images branding Google logo 1x and Google color and then there's this.

02:41.940 --> 02:44.770
So this is basically stored somewhere.

02:44.850 --> 02:51.080
Guys like you can see that this is the image and if I just copy this link and I just paste it anywhere

02:51.570 --> 02:57.210
and if I go to New job and then I just paste it you can see this image is going to appear because this

02:57.300 --> 03:03.060
image is stored in the hosting of the Google CEO.

03:03.340 --> 03:03.730
OK.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.250
So this is how it works guys.

03:06.340 --> 03:12.700
So you have to buy this hosting or you can go over the free one in order to get started right now.

03:12.700 --> 03:19.450
Seems like this if you just go to Facebook dot com then Facebook dot com is basically a domain name

03:19.900 --> 03:27.430
like you can get a domain name and hosting is inside of this so you can see that this is the image that

03:27.430 --> 03:28.440
we have right here.

03:28.540 --> 03:28.900
OK.

03:29.050 --> 03:33.230
If I just drag this and I just drop it right here.

03:33.310 --> 03:33.680
OK.

03:33.820 --> 03:35.230
Let me just open this up.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.610
And now if I just tried this and I just drop it right here.

03:38.770 --> 03:41.860
There you can see that this is the image that is coming.

03:41.920 --> 03:46.760
And this is the part where this image is stored and everything is coming here.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.690
You can see that this image is stored somewhere.

03:49.690 --> 03:50.630
Guys.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.110
OK.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.040
This is how the hosting works.

03:54.250 --> 03:54.670
OK.

03:54.670 --> 03:56.610
Like if I just open up any other web site.

03:56.620 --> 04:00.280
Let's just go ahead and let's open you to me.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.120
OK.

04:01.190 --> 04:02.460
I'll tell you what I mean the outcome.

04:02.650 --> 04:10.000
So you to me dot com is also a site and pay you can see that we have this image right here.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.620
So this image is stored in the web hosting if I just drag it and drag it drop it right above.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.660
You can see that it is downloading right now.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.840
But if I open a tab this image will be coming up here.

04:20.020 --> 04:26.390
So everything that is coming inside the website is basically hosted in the web.

04:26.620 --> 04:27.400
Hosting.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.380
Now it might be so confusing to you right now.

04:30.460 --> 04:36.940
But when people get started with it then people just get started you will understand it much better.

04:37.210 --> 04:42.460
So let's just go ahead and in the next video I will show you how can you basically just go with the

04:42.470 --> 04:49.050
the of web hosting and can you just start your website professionally like investing $150 for a big

04:49.070 --> 04:54.070
Web site like you can build unlimited web sites and do that web hosting and then Web Hosting will also

04:54.070 --> 04:59.980
give you like 45 day money back guarantee so that if you change your mind or if you think that you don't

04:59.980 --> 05:04.420
need hosting anymore or if you change your mind creating Web sites like you thing.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.020
No I don't want to build a web site.

05:06.190 --> 05:08.890
I will hire any developer or something like that.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.980
And I will pay him.

05:11.110 --> 05:16.030
Then you can just go ahead and get the refunds so they give you the 100 percent money back guarantee

05:16.030 --> 05:20.490
for 45 days so you can try that if you want to go with the professional model.

05:20.610 --> 05:25.390
So in the next video I'll show you how can you basically go over the pain of hosting and in the next

05:25.480 --> 05:31.840
next video I'll show you how can you go with the free web hosting and get set up video Web site and

05:31.840 --> 05:34.780
also install WordPress so stadium guys and Buh-Bye.
