01:35.540 --> 01:37.850
I'm first of all I need the product filter.

01:37.850 --> 01:39.110
So let's come here.

01:39.110 --> 01:40.630
Let's just go to the shop page right now

01:44.770 --> 01:45.220
OK.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.360
So here I want to add a budget.

01:47.370 --> 01:53.100
So this is going to be the price filter surprise filter products by price.

01:53.100 --> 01:53.760
This is the one.

01:53.970 --> 01:56.710
OK here you can just filter the products by price.

01:56.710 --> 01:57.780
A just love it.

01:57.810 --> 02:03.870
I always have it whenever I want to out a creative web so I have it right now and then I need one more

02:03.950 --> 02:05.310
added and that will be

02:13.780 --> 02:14.420
the categories.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.080
OK.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.110
So I need the product categories.

02:17.310 --> 02:20.090
I just bring it and you can see that this is great here.

02:20.090 --> 02:23.950
So we have clothing this and this and everything is coming here.

02:24.350 --> 02:25.050
OK.

02:25.190 --> 02:26.090
I'm going to add the title.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.430
So the title is going to be category's

02:34.240 --> 02:34.740
OK.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.890
And now I want to go back.

02:42.940 --> 02:44.500
Let's just add one more of it.

02:44.530 --> 02:53.160
So here I want to add the product product tag clouds so it's going to show the product tags here so

02:53.160 --> 02:57.910
you can just work for the product tags and initial all the products since we don't have any of the product

02:57.910 --> 02:58.220
tags.

02:58.230 --> 02:59.420
We haven't added them.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.450
That is why they're not appearing so I went at it.

03:01.470 --> 03:04.090
So that is why it will look empty.

03:04.210 --> 03:05.450
We don't want to do right now.

03:05.460 --> 03:08.680
I want to add the product that

03:12.580 --> 03:13.540
products right here.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.310
So this is just in line.

03:15.310 --> 03:17.510
That is why this is so confusing.

03:17.650 --> 03:21.170
I just always do it from the vigil section area here.

03:21.170 --> 03:23.310
But let's just get this right now.

03:23.340 --> 03:24.540
It's not it's not a problem.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.700
So here we have this.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.630
I want to add best selling

03:31.240 --> 03:31.880
products.

03:31.990 --> 03:32.400
OK.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.710
And then here I want to show the products that are all products.

03:36.880 --> 03:42.310
But I want it to be ordered by random so it's just going to show random products and mid-limit as best

03:42.310 --> 03:45.670
selling products so they don't know which product the person buys.

03:45.670 --> 03:46.070
OK.

03:46.150 --> 03:48.770
So then we have the number of products to show and I'm going to show three.

03:48.790 --> 03:53.430
So I just want to show it's free products right here and you can see this will show through products

03:53.470 --> 04:01.000
you can see that now we are done with the side bar and this is how our whole e-commerce space professional

04:01.000 --> 04:02.170
web site is looking.

04:02.170 --> 04:06.570
If I just go to my site you can see how this is so this is how it is.

04:06.580 --> 04:12.050
We can also create a sub menu for the categories like I showed you in the five that can lead to you

04:12.100 --> 04:17.010
because dot com so that person can just search for other categories OK.

04:17.080 --> 04:23.070
You can do that if you want to and this is how we have the home page.

04:23.150 --> 04:28.950
So now we're totally done with our creation of this website.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.130
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

04:31.130 --> 04:32.160
