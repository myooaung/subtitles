00:00.480 --> 00:04.320
What does a guy who's in Malcolm X now in this video we're going to be working at this head right here

00:04.320 --> 00:09.140
OK we want to choose a better color scheme so that we just stick to it.

00:09.150 --> 00:13.000
This is the main and the most important thing of creating a Web site.

00:13.200 --> 00:13.690
OK.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.210
You must have seen other developers and designers those who do.

00:18.200 --> 00:18.990
Who are teacher.

00:19.160 --> 00:19.410
OK.

00:19.410 --> 00:24.210
They just teach you that how can you develop a website but they do not teach you the main basics of

00:24.210 --> 00:24.840
the website.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.080
That how you say it is going to look after it.

00:28.230 --> 00:29.930
So you have to focus on one thing.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.040
Ok use three Fornes not more than that.

00:33.180 --> 00:43.640
And of abseiled use five colors or four colors or if you just listen to me then go with three colors.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.560
Do not go with more than that.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.130
OK.

00:46.230 --> 00:48.780
You can go with the four colors if you want to it doesn't matter.

00:48.780 --> 00:52.620
So what you're having Do you have to just go to the team goes to Mizer And then here you can see that

00:52.620 --> 00:57.870
we have the settings right here and here we have to go to the header and navigation and then we have

00:57.870 --> 01:00.770
to go to the header form and so here we can control the header format.

01:00.790 --> 01:05.440
That however how we wanted the header format so we can change it to be centered.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.980
We can change it to be centering in line logo.

01:08.190 --> 01:09.450
We can change it to the slide.

01:09.450 --> 01:14.890
And so if we just click here you can see it's going to slide this in and we can change it to be full

01:14.990 --> 01:15.820
screen.

01:15.830 --> 01:19.130
So if I just click here you can see it is now in the full screen mode.

01:19.130 --> 01:23.820
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go back I basically want to make it the default one.

01:24.170 --> 01:27.260
So I'm going to go back and then I want to go to the primary menubar.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.480
I'm just going to come here and here you can see that I can make it full that I can hide the logo.

01:31.490 --> 01:37.880
I can change the menu hide the logo Mxs hide the text size and the letter spacing that we want.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.320
So then we have the font I have chosen the font to be open sense.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.000
And then I have the background color.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.250
So I want to change the background color to be black.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.160
OK.

01:46.700 --> 01:54.530
A bit of like another full black and a one the text color to be this one OK.

01:54.550 --> 01:55.390
This looks cool.

01:56.270 --> 01:57.220
This looks amazing.

01:57.430 --> 01:57.690
OK.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.420
I want to make it full

02:03.260 --> 02:03.780
cool.

02:03.950 --> 02:04.260
OK.

02:04.280 --> 02:10.610
Now what I want to do I want to come here to actively color and I want it to be let's come here and

02:10.700 --> 02:12.050
let's just change it.

02:12.050 --> 02:14.180
We need to make some changes to that.

02:14.180 --> 02:15.770
It is not fully

02:18.460 --> 02:20.270
OK I think.

02:20.560 --> 02:28.700
OK now I want to just change it like this.

02:28.850 --> 02:32.270
Let's just change the text Scala to be a bit more different.

02:35.060 --> 02:38.960
Okay now it makes a bit of difference and it is looking cool.

02:39.200 --> 02:45.160
OK so then we have the backroom killer the dropdown and everything looks cool.

02:45.230 --> 02:47.490
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish right now.

02:47.630 --> 02:50.870
And now we're going to work with our builder.

02:50.900 --> 02:55.940
So I'm just going to come here and I'm going to hit Cross right now and you can see this is how our

02:55.970 --> 02:56.900
this thing is looking.

02:56.930 --> 03:02.340
Make sure that you choose your logo to be this color only.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.490
OK your logo should be having this color.

03:04.700 --> 03:10.460
So I'm just going to go to the visual builder or I can just go to the dashboard right here and then

03:10.460 --> 03:15.770
I can go to the pages all pages and then I have to go to the home page

03:19.680 --> 03:24.080
and then here I have to just come here and I have to choose.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.580
Use visual builder.

03:25.690 --> 03:30.420
So I'm just going to click here and it's going to take me to the new page where there will be the visual

03:30.420 --> 03:33.090
builder and I can edit everything.

03:33.150 --> 03:38.420
So let's wait till this is loaded and here we go.

03:38.430 --> 03:40.800
This is how the builder is looking.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.420
OK.

03:41.550 --> 03:45.960
First of all what we have to do is that we need to add something here.

03:45.990 --> 03:46.960
So I'm just going to come here.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.610
I'm going to hit add new row.

03:48.860 --> 03:49.400
OK.

03:49.410 --> 03:51.770
And here I can add anything.

03:51.930 --> 03:55.770
So I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to grab this one because I need the full width.

03:55.950 --> 03:59.670
OK so here we can add anything that that can be folded.

03:59.820 --> 04:07.080
So let's see how much options we have right here as we have so many options that we can choose post-Idol

04:07.260 --> 04:17.680
pricing table post navigation post slider shop slider and tab's testimonial toggle video video habor.

04:17.710 --> 04:23.020
So I'm just going to be moving on with the slider here and you can see slider is here but I don't think

04:23.020 --> 04:28.060
so if we need to add a slider in a column we want to make it the full That's how we are going to add

04:28.060 --> 04:28.530
it.

04:28.630 --> 04:33.940
Let's just come here let's just deleted Let's click add a new section from this guy right here the blue

04:33.940 --> 04:34.340
button.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.100
OK.

04:35.260 --> 04:37.170
And here and one the full of it.

04:37.780 --> 04:44.660
So in the full that we have full coord folded Hetter full that image folded map for when many fold porfolio

04:44.680 --> 04:47.100
for that post-Labor full forward post-Idol.

04:47.200 --> 04:54.380
And then we have the full slider so you can add a slider that will be like moving slider and there will

04:54.380 --> 04:57.820
be images coming right here and that would be great.

04:57.820 --> 05:05.030
So I'm just going to be adding a slider a here and see Slider has been added and now here I have to

05:05.030 --> 05:08.010
focus on here is two three options I have.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.320
I have the content I have the design and then I have the advanced math.

05:12.350 --> 05:17.870
So in the content I can add the sliders vidis plus icon I can move the elements.

05:17.890 --> 05:22.760
I can show arrows show controls and then I have the background so if I want to add any bag own and then

05:22.760 --> 05:28.820
I have the admin label I mean the design I can move on with the layout with the text with the title

05:28.820 --> 05:36.800
text through here we would be having the title text it would be having the body text the burden.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.480
And then we have this say using.

05:38.610 --> 05:44.370
OK we have the spacing that how much spacing we want a custom made margin and the padding and then we

05:44.370 --> 05:46.110
have the border.

05:46.230 --> 05:46.680
OK.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.720
We have the box Chatto that if you want to give any shadow.

05:49.890 --> 05:52.080
And then we have the filter's Ray here.

05:54.460 --> 05:58.440
And so you can also go then blend mode.

05:58.570 --> 05:59.110
OK.

05:59.110 --> 06:02.720
And then we have the animation that how we want anything to appear.

06:03.250 --> 06:08.890
And then we have the advance staff here we have this see SS ID that I showed you that what is this season.

06:09.070 --> 06:14.770
If you want to call anything with the burden so you cannot as a society we have Testim see assess if

06:14.770 --> 06:21.310

show the the content on mobile and show image video on mobile disable on phone tablet and everything.

06:28.510 --> 06:33.460
So you guys already know about this visibility this is used for mobile optimization.

06:33.460 --> 06:33.810
OK.

06:33.850 --> 06:38.670
So in the next video we will be working up with this whole slider.

06:39.120 --> 06:39.800
OK.

06:39.850 --> 06:42.250
