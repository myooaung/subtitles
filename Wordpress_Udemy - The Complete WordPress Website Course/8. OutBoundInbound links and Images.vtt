00:00.460 --> 00:01.870
What is up guys it won't come back.

00:01.870 --> 00:06.480
So now in this study I'm going to be telling you about the godlings in downlinks and the images.

00:06.500 --> 00:06.980
OK.

00:07.070 --> 00:11.410
So there are there is a way to basically add an image to your website.

00:11.540 --> 00:16.190
OK let's come here and let's see that this is the featured image right here that's going to come on

00:17.840 --> 00:18.930
the top.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.160
OK if I just open it up you can see this is right here.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.940
This is a poster coming here.

00:25.280 --> 00:25.680
OK.

00:25.730 --> 00:28.520
And if I just add any feature the image is going to appear here.

00:28.630 --> 00:33.560
So let's suppose that I want to add an image that is related to the WordPress website.

00:33.680 --> 00:40.620
OK so I'm going to be going up for dislike files and I'm going to be selecting this one.

00:40.820 --> 00:41.250
OK.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.130
So what's it was that I selected this one.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.090
And it's going to be uploaded right now.

00:45.260 --> 00:51.860
And let's just go ahead and let's add it so you can see that if I just add it the image will be added

00:51.980 --> 00:54.240
and everything will be done OK.

00:54.410 --> 01:01.620
But before adding this image I have to make sure that this image is also assigned with the keywords.

01:01.670 --> 01:09.290
I'm going to be selecting the title and the title is going to be WordPress website two thousand eighty.

01:09.490 --> 01:09.890
OK.

01:10.100 --> 01:15.260
And this is going to be WordPress Web site two thousand eighty.

01:15.270 --> 01:21.880
Now this WordPress Web site 2018 in the alternate text is very important.

01:21.880 --> 01:29.840
Guys the reason is that the behind the image if the image is not loading or if the server is down then

01:29.840 --> 01:36.170
this alternatve text is going to appear and Google will see this image but Google will also see this

01:36.170 --> 01:41.750
altering the text and it'll be marked as this image to be the keyword of this.

01:41.830 --> 01:44.960
And if you have an extra key word and that is good for you.

01:45.380 --> 01:49.180
So let's go out and let's hit said feature image and you can see this image is right here.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.280
If you add the description as well then it's just good for you.

01:53.300 --> 01:56.860
So I'm going to be coming here I'm going to be clicking this I'm going to be copying.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.720
I'm going to be coming in I'm going to be posting here.

02:00.670 --> 02:00.970
OK.

02:01.010 --> 02:02.900
You don't have to add anything in the caption.

02:02.900 --> 02:06.950
OK so if you want to add any caption You can add it but it totally depends upon you.

02:06.970 --> 02:07.890
I'm going to be coming here.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.250
I'm going to be clicking save draft.

02:09.260 --> 02:11.770
I'm going to be coming here and I'm going to be refreshing this.

02:12.230 --> 02:17.060
And I can see this image just right here as my featured image of my post.

02:17.200 --> 02:17.640
OK.

02:17.750 --> 02:23.220
If I just come here and I just go to inspect tell them and then you can see this images right here.

02:23.270 --> 02:28.240
Let's suppose OK let's just imagine that this image is not loading.

02:28.280 --> 02:28.550
OK.

02:28.550 --> 02:34.410
There is an error with the image like like this image is not in the server.

02:34.610 --> 02:35.000
OK.

02:35.150 --> 02:43.220
So if this image is not in the server then this will be this will not load.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.980
OK I'm going to be coming here.

02:45.980 --> 02:49.980
Let me just come here and let me just change it.

02:50.360 --> 02:50.660
OK.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.280
Now I can see this image is gone.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.630
So let's suppose that this image is gone by an error.

02:55.640 --> 03:01.110
Ok so if this error appears then WordPress website it doesn't 18 is the alternate.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.430
That is kind of up here.

03:02.450 --> 03:08.000
So make sure that you add it and it will help you a lot because it is behind the image and it will be

03:08.000 --> 03:09.590
marked as a keyword.

03:09.740 --> 03:10.210
OK.

03:10.310 --> 03:16.080
So I can see that we are doing the best keyboard stuffing if I just find it and I just search for word

03:16.080 --> 03:16.990
press.

03:17.000 --> 03:17.450
OK.

03:17.510 --> 03:19.860
You can see the word press is used so many times here.

03:20.050 --> 03:20.720
OK.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.790
And WordPress website is also here.

03:22.850 --> 03:27.730
So I am trying to rank the Wordpress Web site in my post.

03:28.010 --> 03:28.520
OK.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.770
So you can see how great it is.

03:30.980 --> 03:36.520
So now you can see that we have got the basic idea of how an image is going to work.

03:36.710 --> 03:40.590
And now let's talk about the inbound links and the outbound things.

03:40.610 --> 03:41.240
OK.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.980
So you must be seeing most of the pages.

03:45.200 --> 03:50.690
They just say like go to the second page or something like that seemed like this if I just search for

03:50.690 --> 03:52.520
Wordpress tutorials.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.010
OK.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.280
And I just open up this one.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.030
And I also open up this one.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.690
OK let's just open up this one.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.660
So now here this is the site crown and you can see it.

04:02.660 --> 04:05.000
These are the legs that are coming.

04:05.060 --> 04:05.910
OK.

04:06.170 --> 04:11.680
You can see this is a short post but still it is ranking as the most second board.

04:11.780 --> 04:12.450
OK.

04:12.450 --> 04:18.010
You can see the most common questions and are answered in our story of how install WordPress how to

04:18.010 --> 04:18.480
do this.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.760
There's this there's this and everything contains WordPress.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.300
How this is work.

04:24.620 --> 04:31.910
You can see that this link if I just click here it's going to take me to site ground but it's going

04:31.910 --> 04:34.390
to take me to a new page.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.350
OK.

04:35.420 --> 04:39.730
And that pages ranking on top that has the most internal links.

04:39.890 --> 04:40.350
OK.

04:40.490 --> 04:48.440
So this is called Basically the internal links OK or the inbound links which means that you will take

04:48.740 --> 04:53.620
your reader from your one single page to another page.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.120
Ok Bridges's.

04:55.260 --> 04:55.680
OK.

04:55.820 --> 05:00.070
So if I click here you can see the cytosine the site round's site.

05:00.360 --> 05:06.720
But I am being redirected to another page and that is related to WordPress as well.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.960
So you can see we have this this this and so many.

05:10.050 --> 05:14.290
Ok if I just click here how to optimize WordPress per prompt performance.

05:14.310 --> 05:14.910
OK.

05:14.910 --> 05:16.760
So this is all true right here.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.950
Now you can see how this is looking.

05:18.990 --> 05:30.590
This is going so amazing so this Web site has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 14 outbound links Oh

05:30.600 --> 05:32.280
sorry inbound links.

05:32.280 --> 05:38.790
So this is how it works guys and it works really very amazing if you have more inbound legs than how

05:38.790 --> 05:39.540
this is going to work.

05:39.660 --> 05:43.660
OK Google will scan this page and then Google will scan this page.

05:43.650 --> 05:47.300
They will also scan it and it will mark it as the inbound link.

05:47.310 --> 05:52.280
OK so this Google scan this link and then Google will also scan this page twice.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.300
So this will also work to create.

05:54.310 --> 05:59.020
So make sure that you just add the inbound links like let me show you a live example.

05:59.220 --> 05:59.790
OK.

05:59.940 --> 06:12.150
So you can add it like a text enabled for installation for installation of Word Press in localhost click

06:12.150 --> 06:12.680
here.

06:12.960 --> 06:20.170
OK so I'm going to make this click here a link and that will take me to a new post.

06:20.350 --> 06:22.680
OK let's suppose that this is a new post.

06:22.710 --> 06:23.030
OK.

06:23.040 --> 06:32.530
And this post has how to install WordPress in localhost.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.760
OK so I'm going to be copying this link.

06:34.860 --> 06:38.060
I'm going to be coming here and I'm going to be coming here.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.700
And I said let's come here and let's save it as a draft.

06:41.710 --> 06:46.470
And now here you can see that my this post has an inbound link.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.150
OK so that the poor is now set to good.

06:51.150 --> 06:54.030
I think it should be here.

06:54.240 --> 06:54.740
OK.

06:54.810 --> 06:55.640
I don't know what it is.

06:55.830 --> 07:01.800
So now if I just open it up it it out OK if I just come here and I just open this post up then he will

07:01.800 --> 07:08.700
see that it has for installation of forward press in localhost click here like I will come here he will

07:08.700 --> 07:14.710
click here and you will be redirected to install Wordpress and localhost post that is written by you

07:14.710 --> 07:17.500
as well and he will and he will read to Borst.

07:17.520 --> 07:25.710
This is so helpful and the CEO the Millings also the outbound links outbound links that the Web sites

07:25.770 --> 07:27.820
that those websites which are not your Web site.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.450
OK I like which is not this.

07:29.580 --> 07:34.590
So if I just want to reference something give a reference to something or if I want to just

07:37.260 --> 07:40.680
go and get the host Geter.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.140
OK posable that I want to refresh the host gator here.

07:44.190 --> 07:45.430
Host gator hosting.

07:45.450 --> 07:48.040
Go and get the host gator hosting.

07:48.040 --> 07:55.430
I just select it and I just make it bolder and I just make it to be the outbound link and I'm going

07:55.430 --> 08:00.350
to be entraining DTP colon slash slash skater come.

08:00.550 --> 08:01.060
OK.

08:01.310 --> 08:06.950
Now you can see that this post will be now made as the.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.630
I don't think so.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.080
Now it is good for you if you just add it.

08:11.090 --> 08:18.170
So make sure make sure that you also add at least one outbound link here or so that the people can also

08:18.170 --> 08:22.030
go to other Web sites that you can get for fences and it will help you a lot.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.950
You have not used the focus keyword in any subheading.

08:25.160 --> 08:25.660
OK.

08:25.820 --> 08:35.640
So you can also add it like Word Press say OK we have used the focused key word.

08:36.230 --> 08:39.780
So the keyword density is 2.6 which is over raising.

08:40.180 --> 08:41.030
OK.

08:41.180 --> 08:43.630
The focus keyword was found.

08:44.240 --> 08:51.980
So you have to make sure that you just make your keyboard a little bit less so it's going to tell you

08:52.250 --> 08:54.450
that you are using over keywords.

08:54.610 --> 09:00.780
OK so now I can see that we have removed one keyboard from here and our website looks totally OK.

09:01.010 --> 09:08.300
So keyword density should be 2.5 percent higher density means that how many how many times you are using

09:08.300 --> 09:09.460
your keyword.

09:09.680 --> 09:15.070
OK so now we have the CEO title contains the focus keyword but it does not appear in the beginning.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.840
Try move it to the beginning.

09:16.880 --> 09:22.970
How to Build a WordPress website so I'm going to be making it to be like OK that's OK.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.420
You don't you don't have to worry about it.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.090
It's just an improvement it's not necessary.

09:27.090 --> 09:27.440
OK.

09:27.620 --> 09:33.440
I don't think so if changing it will help me much better so you can see that now I have optimized my

09:33.440 --> 09:39.320
website for complete thing is OK you can see everything is completed and my website is now looking totally

09:39.320 --> 09:39.560
OK.

09:39.560 --> 09:45.890
So now you have done you are done with the on page SEO you now know how to write a post basically which

09:45.890 --> 09:48.010
was a very important US guys.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.210
And congratulations on completing this.

09:50.210 --> 09:53.420
I'm so glad that you know this.

09:53.420 --> 09:57.960
OK so now you know this you know how to work for the CEO.

09:58.240 --> 09:58.670
OK.

09:58.790 --> 10:07.130
And now I'm going to be giving you the algorithms or the factors that Google has basically interviews

10:07.220 --> 10:12.670
and say Google says that if you have it you your website will rank higher.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.730
So we're going to be tugging on that.

10:14.750 --> 10:22.180
That means the speed of the Web site that means also the SSL certificate and the mobile optimization.

10:22.190 --> 10:28.430
So mobile optimization you guys already know but it is also very important and in terms of the Web site.

10:28.580 --> 10:33.920
So in the next what you will do working up add more stuff that means the SSL and everything and also

10:33.920 --> 10:34.710
the speed.

10:34.730 --> 10:38.200
So we'll do our picking up speed and that Peter will come in the SSL.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.770
So in the next what's available working at that.

10:40.870 --> 10:41.770
Good bye guys.
