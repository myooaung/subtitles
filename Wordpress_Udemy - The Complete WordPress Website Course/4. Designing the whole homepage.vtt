02:09.010 --> 02:16.720
So what I'm going to do right now I want to say this about OK I need a shaved writer OK to make it look

02:16.810 --> 02:17.570
much better.

02:17.620 --> 02:22.150
I'm going to come here I'm going to come here and I want to go to the style and then I'm going to go

02:22.150 --> 02:22.450
down.

02:22.450 --> 02:27.700
And here it a shape divider and in the bottom and the bottom is going to be a zigzag.

02:28.090 --> 02:30.470
So it is a zigzag note.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.580
I can also add the mountain effect the mounting looks good.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.950
OK we can also go trying.

02:38.710 --> 02:40.180
We can also go with it.

02:40.220 --> 02:40.710
Tilt

02:44.140 --> 02:44.740
the car

02:47.270 --> 02:51.900
saves or the base pattern

02:54.410 --> 03:01.600
split.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.840
I think I like the mountains much better.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.240
OK.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.510
I want to go with the color.

03:05.530 --> 03:08.820
So McCullers going to be the normal color that has a background color effect.

03:08.950 --> 03:09.600
And I need it.

03:09.630 --> 03:16.590
So but it should be 100 200 from here and the height should be.

03:16.770 --> 03:18.070
I think this looks cool.

03:18.070 --> 03:23.900
Let me click here and let's see how a web site is looking so our Web site looks pretty great here.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.220
I need to hide to be a little bit smaller more

03:31.400 --> 03:33.420
OK it looks cool.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.080
I need it to be more so I needed to be 1 2 3 to 1 very little great.

03:37.220 --> 03:37.520
OK.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.860
And then we have the flip so we can also flip it if you want to.

03:41.060 --> 03:41.870
OK.

03:41.870 --> 03:45.360
This is like the mountain is down and this is the down side of the mountain.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.350
So this looks amazing too I think.

03:47.660 --> 03:47.990
OK.

03:48.010 --> 03:55.290
All I need to increase the height a bit and I need to increase the not just a crease it increase the

I'm going to hit Savery now and you can see that my head is set to be awesome.

04:03.070 --> 04:03.780
I want to go ahead.

04:03.790 --> 04:06.310

rated products or the NZL products so you can add a feature products here as well.

04:37.690 --> 04:39.590
But I think we should add the feature product.

04:39.590 --> 04:40.120
OK.

04:40.150 --> 04:42.360
So I'm just going to come here.

05:18.120 --> 05:22.660
You can also make the red if you want it to be red but dreadful and look great to me.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.180
If you go with my opinion.

05:24.240 --> 05:24.650
OK.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.340
And now let's go to.

05:26.340 --> 05:31.150
You can also it's like round edges so that the edges would be rounded.

05:31.170 --> 05:31.370
OK.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.060
I'm going to come here.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.520
I'm going to go to headline right here.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.350
And it's design this headline.

05:35.490 --> 05:37.430
So I wanted the topography.

05:37.550 --> 05:38.010
OK.

05:38.130 --> 05:42.950
The typography size is going to be bigger.

05:43.190 --> 05:43.510
OK.

05:43.520 --> 05:49.300
And the vate should be 300.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.760
It looks great.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.500
It looks great.

05:51.690 --> 05:52.030
OK.

05:52.110 --> 05:58.250
And then we have the families of family is going to be open sans OK.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.820
Now we don't have to do anything.

06:02.850 --> 06:04.850
We also want to go with the topography of this.

06:04.890 --> 06:08.730
And let's just make it make this space to be the 500.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.500
So let's make it to be 400.

06:11.550 --> 06:14.900
It looks good now it looks ok.

06:14.910 --> 06:17.800
Everything looks amazing the shape here as well.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.830
And everything looks cool so I just want to decrease the video of this as well and make it the size

06:23.280 --> 06:25.900
of this one.

06:25.900 --> 06:26.270
All right.

06:26.290 --> 06:29.060
All cool.

06:29.090 --> 06:31.090
You can see how great it is looking.

06:31.100 --> 06:36.490
And we have the foreign not so boarded but it is the sleek design the elegance.

06:36.650 --> 06:39.860
If I just make it like this you can see how it is looking.

06:39.920 --> 06:40.410
OK.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.900
Yes we don't have anything in the bottom that is why it isn't looking good.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.010
But this looks seriously great.

06:46.130 --> 06:46.890
OK.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.240
I want to come here I want to add the let's just click this guy and wince at the product so let's go

06:53.240 --> 06:55.970

06:55.970 --> 07:00.310
So here we can add the products here we can add to cardboard and we can add the elements.

07:00.350 --> 07:03.360
Elements is also a trade section I'm going to show you how this is going to look.

07:03.510 --> 07:03.710
OK.

07:03.710 --> 07:07.330
And then we have the categories so let's just bring the products right here.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.360
Let's just try to drag it and drop it down.

07:09.530 --> 07:14.390
And here we have the featured products so I'm just going to show the four column the products count

07:14.420 --> 07:15.410
is going to be for.

07:15.560 --> 07:15.970
OK.

07:16.070 --> 07:17.570
And then I'm going to go to the credit.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.730

07:39.620 --> 07:43.290
So now let's have a look at our Web site how we can make it look much better.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.170
So you can see this is how this is coming.

07:45.170 --> 07:47.930
We don't have anything in the feature products section.

07:47.930 --> 07:50.630
The reason is that we haven't added any of.

07:50.660 --> 07:56.120
We haven't made any of the product to be as featured and we wanted to do that how we'll do that we just

07:56.120 --> 07:56.690
come here.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.490
We just go to the dashboard right here and then we have to go to the products right here and then we

08:01.490 --> 08:02.880
have to head all products.

08:02.990 --> 08:07.130
And you can see that here we can make any of the product set as feature.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.860
So we need to use this thing.

08:08.870 --> 08:11.720
Okay you can see this is the story that she's featured too.

08:11.720 --> 08:16.070
If I make any of the product features if I just like this fool logo I'm just going to come here.

08:16.070 --> 08:16.960
I'm going to make it.

08:17.090 --> 08:22.940
Just click here and again see this product will be marked as featured and then that product will be

08:22.940 --> 08:24.710
coming up in this page.

08:24.710 --> 08:30.110
So let's just come here and see this you can see how this featured products for it so you can make any

08:30.110 --> 08:34.580
of the product featured and then you can featured anywhere you can make sure that you add your feature

08:39.650 --> 08:41.180
then it'll be appearing.

08:41.710 --> 08:47.780
OK I'm going to come here and this is how it is looking so I'm going to make one more and that will

08:47.780 --> 08:49.100
be the boot ninja.

08:49.250 --> 08:49.770
OK.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.720
And then we have the premium quality as well let's just set it to feature it as well.

08:54.020 --> 08:54.630
OK.

08:54.790 --> 08:55.300
Click here.

08:55.310 --> 08:57.130
And then you have to be to not just rush.

08:57.140 --> 08:57.600
OK.

08:57.710 --> 09:00.210
Let this page be loaded and then do the next one.

09:00.260 --> 09:06.260
So then we have the flying and you so on selecting this you can see every feature product they'll be

09:06.260 --> 09:07.050
coming here.

09:07.130 --> 09:12.080
If I just refresh it right now you can see four will come if I just go beyond that if I just choose

09:12.080 --> 09:12.980
for 51.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.150
OK.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.430
I just select this one.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.610
So let's suppose I just select chip your idea.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.890
OK this is right here and I just come here and I just refresh this.

09:21.890 --> 09:24.010
Then you will see only four will appear.

09:24.010 --> 09:24.900
It will not come.

09:24.980 --> 09:25.310
OK.

09:25.430 --> 09:31.630
The reason is that that we have selected the for a quantity here in the layout.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.010
OK.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.930
If I just come here and I just save it.

09:33.950 --> 09:35.110
And I just refresh it.

09:35.210 --> 09:35.520
OK.

09:35.630 --> 09:36.800
Let me just refresh this.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.900
So then it will appear.

09:39.290 --> 09:41.900
Otherwise it will appear like this.

09:42.440 --> 09:48.530
I have to refresh and then it will have the feature products from the feature section you can see they

09:48.530 --> 09:49.430
have a problem.

09:49.460 --> 09:49.980
OK.

09:50.030 --> 09:51.550
They just show two one right here.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.380
But if you click here it will show one.

09:53.390 --> 09:54.120
OK.

09:54.130 --> 09:54.760
Yes.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.970
They have the problem they will show lines.

09:56.990 --> 09:57.640
OK.

09:57.650 --> 10:01.360
I don't know why they have this problem when I use this elementary DAB.

10:01.360 --> 10:04.750
And with this product they have this problem but do not vary.

10:04.790 --> 10:10.750
If you just save it and then you open this up in this step it will come totally OK.

10:10.850 --> 10:11.770
And this will be fun.

10:11.810 --> 10:14.360
Single layouts are not very guys about this.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.350
It will be here.

10:15.350 --> 10:17.560
But when you edited it will be Vonne single.

10:17.570 --> 10:19.900
So I want to work with this one right here.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.100
The column should be five.

10:21.110 --> 10:23.540
I need five columns so I need more products.

10:23.540 --> 10:23.940
OK.

10:24.050 --> 10:28.350
And the products count is also be the five because I want to show the five products right here.

10:28.400 --> 10:28.880

10:36.470 --> 10:41.090

10:41.090 --> 10:44.830
thing and that is make sure you add a lot of products guys it works.

10:44.840 --> 10:45.690

11:00.140 --> 11:03.840
So it is just showing the sale of products that we have.

11:03.950 --> 11:07.020
So I'm just going to select the featured cars on the first.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.400

11:37.730 --> 11:43.040
You can also just choose the category and then it will exclude the category with the feature products.

11:43.070 --> 11:43.580

12:07.190 --> 12:08.820
shop for every product.

12:09.020 --> 12:13.070
And then we have this cloud factory here and then we have the feature Prague's.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.890
I am in love with this Web site.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.150

But they're so amazing and I am and I will buy it.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.770
The first thing that I like about this is that they are using the black and white color that is my favorite.

12:28.940 --> 12:32.450
And then they're using the best style ever.

12:32.450 --> 12:37.140

12:40.210 --> 12:40.510
OK.

12:40.520 --> 12:45.020
And now what we have to do we have to move another section.

12:45.020 --> 12:49.810
So now here are guys I want to add in the U.S. and that will be a call to action.

12:49.880 --> 12:55.310
OK so that will be like a feature products you can feature a product openly OK in here.

12:55.310 --> 12:56.740
I'm going to show you how you can do that.

12:56.750 --> 13:00.600
OK so first of all we have to do is that we need to open up a product.

13:00.620 --> 13:01.020
OK.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.400
So let's suppose that we need to add something about the product so let's suppose the

13:10.970 --> 13:16.710
me go to the next page which just hit this page one off two so I'm going to go to the next page and

13:19.040 --> 13:22.990
suppose this ship your idea is the product that I wanted to add something about.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.700
Let's go back and

13:28.680 --> 13:29.820
the Voula will go.

13:29.960 --> 13:30.560
OK.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.770
So let's suppose that this is the logo.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.060
This is the product that I want to add something about.

13:35.060 --> 13:39.200
So if I just open it up you can see that we have the logo.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.940
This is the product ID is the 60.

13:42.050 --> 13:42.610
OK.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.360
And then we have everything right here.

13:44.510 --> 13:44.810
OK.

13:44.810 --> 13:47.410
We have the main settings here.

13:47.450 --> 13:48.840
We have this product image.

13:48.850 --> 13:54.030
We have the product data and then we have the product short description and the reviews as well.

13:54.100 --> 13:54.470
OK.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.200
So I want to add about this.

13:56.210 --> 14:01.700
OK so I want to work with this so what I'm going to do right now I'm going to add here a new section

14:01.730 --> 14:06.000
and that will be all about this product I'm going and everything about this product.

14:06.020 --> 14:06.460
OK.

14:06.500 --> 14:10.390
So let's just click this guy right here and I want to add a new section.

14:10.430 --> 14:13.610
So there are two methods that you can do that manually.

14:13.610 --> 14:15.110
And then everything you're about.

14:15.110 --> 14:18.460
So what I'm going to do right now I am just going to go ahead.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.710
I'm just going to tell you the automatic method that you can do here.

14:21.770 --> 14:26.050
I'm just going to bring this right here that says Vuh elements and I'm going to drag it right here.

14:26.180 --> 14:26.680
OK.

14:26.720 --> 14:32.240
And then I have to select this so I need to do so like this single product page and is going to like

14:32.290 --> 14:36.710
it and the product will be vulgo.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.360
OK.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.550
This is the idea so this is the I need this is 60.

14:40.590 --> 14:40.920
OK.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.290
Let me add the 60 OK.

14:43.290 --> 14:44.790
It is not grabbing it from ID.

14:44.790 --> 14:48.730
I'm just going to search for new logo.

14:51.270 --> 14:51.540

14:51.540 --> 14:54.330
We have three right here and it's going to select this one.

14:54.390 --> 14:58.870
And you can see that everything is coming from right here.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.140
And it has grabbed everything from here.

15:01.200 --> 15:01.700

OK.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.080
We have the alignment so it should be aligned to center.

23:51.350 --> 23:52.350

23:52.370 --> 23:54.260
I want to go to style size and everything.

OK.

24:05.210 --> 24:06.860
And the in the icon.

24:06.860 --> 24:09.760
I need something about the card.

24:09.830 --> 24:11.360
So the card can be

24:14.240 --> 24:14.850
a basket.

24:14.910 --> 24:18.020
So I'm just in a search for Baskett shopping basket.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.500
This is the one OK we have this.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.360
The position should be after.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.230
So we have the icon spacing it to bid.

24:26.230 --> 24:27.880
So I wanted to increase the spacing.

24:28.130 --> 24:28.880
Ok cool.

24:28.910 --> 24:34.550
Now I have to go to the button right here and I want to work with the text colors so my text color should

24:34.550 --> 24:35.350
be white.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.320
OK.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.360
My background color should be nothing.

24:38.360 --> 24:38.700
OK.

24:38.720 --> 24:43.230
I need it to be a full transparent coil.

24:43.290 --> 24:43.940
OK.

24:44.010 --> 24:47.170
I want the border time so the border is going to be solid.

24:47.390 --> 24:47.850
OK.

24:47.910 --> 24:50.050
And the bed should be one pixel.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.590
So it looks great.

24:51.870 --> 24:52.700
OK.

24:52.770 --> 24:57.710
Now here we have the bottom radius so the bottom radius is going to be 25.

24:58.410 --> 25:01.590
Let's add it to be like 10 10 looks good.

25:01.860 --> 25:02.170
OK.

25:02.190 --> 25:05.350
We have this tray here and now we have to go to the home.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.410
So we need to add the Hoeber effects.

25:07.470 --> 25:12.630
I want to come here I want the text color to be changed and the background colors the background color

25:12.630 --> 25:20.020
would be the full black on where the correct and the border should be removed on where I want to make

25:20.020 --> 25:23.870

25:28.060 --> 25:32.190
So if someone clicks this burden the product is going to be added to the card.

25:32.210 --> 25:33.190
That is how it's going to work.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.750
Let's just make it the full width and let's see how it is looking.

25:35.750 --> 25:41.180
So we have this like here we have a two card button and everything is totally up and running.

25:41.390 --> 25:46.880
So we can verify the shape divider if you want to like be can stylist's if you want to but I think keeping

25:46.880 --> 25:48.870
it more simple looks great.

25:49.000 --> 25:49.590
OK.

25:49.610 --> 25:51.280
You can see how it is looking.
