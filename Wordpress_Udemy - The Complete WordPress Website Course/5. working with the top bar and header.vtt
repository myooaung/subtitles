00:00.560 --> 00:05.440
What is it guys and welcome x so now you can see that I have added so many posts right here.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.370
If I go to all posted he can see that every post is coming right here.

00:09.370 --> 00:09.720
OK.

00:09.850 --> 00:13.570
I have also added those images as well.

00:13.570 --> 00:17.830
So let's go to view our website and you can see that when mutilated the reconned and the pages were

00:17.830 --> 00:18.750
also created.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.660
So this is a best plug for coming here and you can see these posters coming here like this.

00:23.680 --> 00:32.050
This is how basically the post-work you can see how this is coming how this is coming how this is coming

00:32.050 --> 00:35.140
in these post are coming as a blog post.

00:35.140 --> 00:40.020
You can see this is the title right here and it says Continue reading so if I just open up there you

00:40.030 --> 00:41.550
can see how this is coming.

00:41.620 --> 00:46.330
So we have these concentrate here and a taste that you might also like.

00:46.330 --> 00:52.180
So if I just open up the category associated with this and then you will see how this is coming so you

00:52.180 --> 00:56.830
can see this is coming this is coming this is coming under the category because we have assigned the

00:56.830 --> 00:58.450
category to be a Samsung.

00:58.660 --> 01:01.580
So now in this video we're going to be creating that page.

01:01.630 --> 01:02.040
OK.

01:02.050 --> 01:06.430
And then we're going to be working up in this case of first to fall what we have to do we basically

01:06.430 --> 01:07.950
need to customize it.

01:07.960 --> 01:08.400
OK.

01:08.410 --> 01:10.650
We're going to come here and we want to customize it.

01:10.650 --> 01:16.030
We're also going to create a page for the home page and for the post-Beatles.

01:16.060 --> 01:17.490
Well OK.

01:19.510 --> 01:23.390
Let's customize and you can see that this custom Mizer is loading.

01:23.530 --> 01:30.340
So if you look at so many blogs right here you must have seen that these blogs show like this.

01:30.340 --> 01:36.190
OK we had they have some sliders right here of the post they have some post right here.

01:36.190 --> 01:39.610
They have a featured post and then they have this like this.

01:39.610 --> 01:40.230
OK.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.480
So they have the ads coming here as well.

01:42.490 --> 01:44.170
And this is how they work.

01:44.330 --> 01:47.060
And if I just hit all their post they go to the page too.

01:47.110 --> 01:51.990
So they have the main page to be the post optimized OK.

01:52.210 --> 01:56.650
But we will not be moving on with this since this is a really simple blog.

01:56.710 --> 01:59.160
You can see that the blog needs to be simple.

01:59.170 --> 02:05.350
This is the theory behind this because people are coming here for reading not that not that design but

02:05.350 --> 02:07.650
you can create the simple design as well.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.950
That is what we are going to talk about in this course.

02:10.070 --> 02:15.730
OK so first of all we want to change this to be like this since this is about the technology so I'm

02:15.730 --> 02:18.180
going to hit tech blog.

02:18.300 --> 02:18.670
OK.

02:18.670 --> 02:22.900
And this tagline is going to be the best

02:25.750 --> 02:32.390
we blog Tech Knology OK.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.710
And then we have the site I can see you probably know about site icon I'm not going to upload any of

02:36.710 --> 02:38.300
the stack on right here.

02:38.300 --> 02:42.650
OK then we have the menu so we can create some pages and assign that as menu.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.210
We'll be doing that later on.

02:44.210 --> 02:45.900
And then we have the veggie tray here.

02:45.980 --> 02:48.470
I'm going to be telling you about it later.

02:48.590 --> 02:49.490
Not right now.

02:49.730 --> 02:50.120
OK.

02:50.120 --> 02:55.160
You'll first design our page ok and then we have the general options we have Cherno signing general

02:55.160 --> 02:58.390
settings and then we have the page table right here and everything.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.000
But first what we have to do we basically need to design our home page.

03:02.000 --> 03:02.500
OK.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.390
And what we have to do we need to go to

03:08.110 --> 03:13.890
Chanterelle options here should be OK.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.980
We don't have that tray here.

03:16.210 --> 03:17.510
We just need to create.

03:17.650 --> 03:20.620
OK so what we have to do we have to just publish Okay.

03:20.830 --> 03:25.460
And we want to go to the yes to complete will be cost.

03:25.660 --> 03:29.800
And we basically need to create those pages that we created and they were also deleted.

03:29.800 --> 03:36.380
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to go to pages and then I'm going to go to add new OK and I want

03:36.380 --> 03:37.390
to add in your page.

03:37.820 --> 03:39.840
The first page is going to be my home.

03:39.850 --> 03:40.380
OK.

03:40.400 --> 03:45.700
And I'm going to hit this publish.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.360
I got it.

03:46.370 --> 03:48.060

I'm going to go to the ad you and I want to hate edit and I basically want to publish this page.

03:59.690 --> 04:01.070
So we have published this page.

04:01.070 --> 04:05.990
We also want to create a new age in that that that page will be all post bage that is going to show

04:05.990 --> 04:08.720

04:31.920 --> 04:33.950
I'm going to go to the sittings right here.

04:36.150 --> 04:39.120

04:49.950 --> 04:50.830
I'm going to hit this.

04:51.060 --> 04:54.660
And now if I view my page you're going to see this is how it's looking.

04:54.750 --> 05:01.210
And if I just go to the blog page slash blog which will be the title under the all post.

05:01.250 --> 05:01.760
OK.

05:01.770 --> 05:03.870
You can see how this is looking as well.

05:06.220 --> 05:06.700
OK.

05:06.780 --> 05:10.470
So I just basically want to edit this completely.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.330
So I want a logo right here.

05:12.390 --> 05:14.980
And we basically have to work on the header.

05:15.030 --> 05:16.850
So I'm going to go to the customized right here.

05:16.950 --> 05:20.700
Let's move on with the header the toolbar and everything.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.370
And let's design our thing.

05:22.500 --> 05:26.410
So everything is ready and we just basically wanted to design our blog.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.900
OK let's just close it and again see this is loading right here.

05:30.970 --> 05:33.930
So first of all we have to say I think you're done with tight identity.

05:33.990 --> 05:40.940
We want to go to the home page settings but we want to go to the Tabari.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.580
So first of all let's go to the Tobar.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.980
When I go to the general options right here.

05:45.580 --> 05:46.080
OK.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.450
And here we have the color right here.

05:50.490 --> 06:01.990
I'm going to choose the colors to be the background color to be a little bit of Quraysh.

06:02.160 --> 06:02.690
OK.

06:02.800 --> 06:03.570
This looks cool.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.930
And I want the border color to be nothing.

06:05.980 --> 06:07.070
I don't want any Prokosch.

06:07.090 --> 06:14.920
I'm going to just going to use the Tron spirit and the text color is going to be white right here.

06:14.950 --> 06:15.580
Cool.

06:15.970 --> 06:17.680
And the link color.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.090
It's going to be white as well.

06:21.470 --> 06:21.840
OK.

06:21.950 --> 06:24.360
And I also wanted the Hoover color.

06:24.460 --> 06:32.140
So my Holbert color is going to be a bit of black not the full black but it should be.

06:32.170 --> 06:33.340
Yes the full black.

06:33.540 --> 06:34.220
OK.

06:35.590 --> 06:37.430
Now what we want to do we want to publish it.

06:37.540 --> 06:40.660
We're going to go back here and in the content.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.690
We need to add the content right here.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.210
So first of all we need that email.

06:45.460 --> 06:46.660
So we're going to go to.

06:46.980 --> 06:47.580
Fun.

06:47.590 --> 06:48.700
Awesome Dad.

06:48.730 --> 06:50.800
I know slash icons.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.230
And I want to grab the e-mail.

06:52.370 --> 06:52.840
So

06:57.470 --> 07:01.700
let's just give him here let's just search e-mail and there we go.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.040
Have this right here.

07:03.260 --> 07:09.940
I want to copy this and I want to paste it.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.170
So this is coming right here.

07:11.180 --> 07:21.170
I want to add that info and as to dot complete WP course dot com.

07:21.380 --> 07:22.490
OK so I will tell you that.

07:22.490 --> 07:27.890
How can you create these type of emails later on because these are all so important and you should be

07:27.890 --> 07:30.710
creating the company based e-mails is not the normal e-mails.

07:30.710 --> 07:31.550
OK.

07:31.610 --> 07:34.190
You can see we have this break here.

07:34.650 --> 07:38.720
So now what I'm going to do I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish.

07:38.720 --> 07:44.450
So let's go back and then we have the social so we can also add the social links.

07:44.780 --> 07:47.780
I want to add the Facebook wants to add a hash.

07:47.780 --> 07:57.320
I said the Twitter I said that Google Plus and let's add the Instagram link LinkedIn and the YouTube.

07:57.420 --> 07:58.540
So they would go.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.340
These are coming right here.

08:02.410 --> 08:06.750
I want to do the styling right here so Schillings color is going to be white.

08:06.890 --> 08:09.760
And if someone whoever said it should be for black

08:12.570 --> 08:13.120
cool.

08:13.410 --> 08:13.780
OK.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.810
I want to come here to publish right here.

08:16.020 --> 08:19.590
And I want to go back and now we need to design this page.

08:19.590 --> 08:21.210
This is the header header section.

08:21.390 --> 08:21.820
OK.

08:21.870 --> 08:26.910
I want to come here and here it says the general setting so we have the minimal transparency and everything

08:26.910 --> 08:30.330
so you can design whether you want it to be minimal or anything.

08:30.330 --> 08:37.400
I'm just going to go with the minimal height should be a bit more cool.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.380
The weather is not full of it.

08:39.490 --> 08:44.130
The head or water bottom I don't want the water right here and cool.

08:44.170 --> 08:49.710
I want to go back KHRAIS here and here is the head of media so I can add a header background image on

08:49.740 --> 08:55.170
video as well if I want to but I want to add anything.

08:56.050 --> 09:06.740
What I want basically should be let's go back let's go back and let's go to the logo right here.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.660
So I want to add the logo right here.

09:08.690 --> 09:10.730
So let's just add any of the logo.

09:10.730 --> 09:11.690
It doesn't matter.

09:11.690 --> 09:18.890
OK I'm going to go to the select file upload file and we need the logo basically So I mean I go to the

09:18.900 --> 09:23.650
desktop and I think I should be going up with this logo so it doesn't matter.

09:23.780 --> 09:24.140
OK.

09:24.140 --> 09:26.880
I'm just going to select it.

09:26.990 --> 09:28.420
I'm going to crop it.

09:34.270 --> 09:34.930
OK.

09:35.020 --> 09:42.480
And I'm going to hit crop range and you can see that it should be added right here.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.810
A sweet.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.220
And there we go.

09:45.220 --> 09:46.620
This is coming right here.

09:46.770 --> 09:48.020
So this is very big.

09:48.250 --> 09:48.610
OK.

09:48.610 --> 09:50.480
I want to change the size of it.

09:50.540 --> 09:51.310
So

09:56.840 --> 09:58.300
let's go to the head straight here.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.860
Let's go to the logo.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.170
The max bed should be

10:09.470 --> 10:11.700
this much cool.

10:11.730 --> 10:12.780
This is looking fine.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.630
OK.

10:13.800 --> 10:19.530
Max height and max height can mean anything.

10:19.810 --> 10:20.360
OK.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.280
So we can also optimize it from Mobile.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.830
You guys already know how to optimize it from about OK.

10:28.020 --> 10:31.760
And select a logo twice the normal logos.

10:31.770 --> 10:39.270
So if you want the big logo to appear in a big screen size is coming so you can also choose a video

10:39.270 --> 10:40.120
as well OK.

10:40.170 --> 10:44.920
And then we have the menu right here we have the social menu and then we have the mobile menu.

10:45.150 --> 10:49.440
So I think we don't want to do anything right here.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.050
OK.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.390
We basically want to change the look of it.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.630
So I'm going to go to the general options and then we have the general styling.

10:55.890 --> 10:57.500
OK.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.260
How can we change this style of the header.

11:04.310 --> 11:05.480
I'm going to go to the general.

11:05.570 --> 11:06.420
And there we go.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.390
So this is the background color.

11:08.390 --> 11:09.620
I'm going to change it to be

11:22.070 --> 11:22.730
cool.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.560
This is how my hair is looking.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.890
So we were basically following the black and white team logo.

11:29.360 --> 11:35.500
The theme because I really like the black and white eight teams to say OK now we can see this is coming

11:35.500 --> 11:36.220
right here.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.570
We have or everything coming.

11:38.570 --> 11:41.300
We can also change the menu links later on we will change it.

11:41.450 --> 11:41.810
OK.

11:41.810 --> 11:47.480
Now what we have to do we have to just hit publish and he can see that our header is totally completed

11:47.510 --> 11:48.970
and it is already looking cool.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.530
So in the next video we will be working to the home page.

11:51.530 --> 11:58.100
We're going to show some of the post like post by category post by this recent post featured host and

11:58.100 --> 12:00.070
most recent viewed post and something like that.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.560
But this element toward the stadium now is an goodbye.
