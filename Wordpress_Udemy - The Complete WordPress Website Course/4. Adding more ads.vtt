00:11.320 --> 00:15.700
would be the radio buttons that would be coming so if you just go to condition right here you can see

00:15.700 --> 00:17.020
this is a radio button.

00:17.230 --> 00:18.880
And we have the fields right here.

00:18.880 --> 00:24.370
So let's just go ahead and let's go to forms right now and let's just add it to category.

00:24.370 --> 00:28.680
So I'm just going to come here and I'm I'm just going to create a new form and this will be like one

00:28.760 --> 00:29.230
name.

00:29.230 --> 00:34.350
So it is going to be like mobile devices mobile devices.

00:34.940 --> 00:35.440
OK.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.340
And I'm going to slight gaming devices I guess liked mobile phones.

00:39.350 --> 00:41.290
OK let's just look at mobile phones OK.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.090
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create new forms so the form is going to be created and you can

00:46.090 --> 00:49.590
see that it is right here and it's going to come here I'm going to hit it new layout

00:52.360 --> 00:55.870
and here I need to grab the commission so let's just say this.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.450
And I said that so here it is.

00:58.450 --> 01:04.300
I'm just going to come here and I'm going to drag it so much Raggatt to this right here.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.040
OK.

01:05.220 --> 01:10.130
And I'm going to come here and I'm going to save so he can see this is changing right now.

01:10.290 --> 01:16.330
You're going to come here and I am going to just make the save changes so let's just come let's just

01:16.330 --> 01:18.960
go to the Web site right now.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.360
Basically it lets him here to create listing and refresh it.

01:22.530 --> 01:24.560
So I'm here and I'm going to go to mobile phone.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.620
So this is right here.

01:25.660 --> 01:29.940
I'm just going to hit Mobile phones go and you can see this is great.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.720
OK so I did a mistake.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.820
I just get the spacing right here.

01:35.910 --> 01:40.050
What I have to do I have to give a comma so to separate them so I'm just going to come here I'm going

01:40.050 --> 01:41.420
to add a Kamari here.

01:41.700 --> 01:42.290
OK.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.070
I'm going to give spacing three here.

01:44.140 --> 01:45.660
I'm just going add a comma.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.630
OK.

01:48.530 --> 01:55.930
Speccing comma spacing Colma spacing OK.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.960
So you have to give comma instead of the like.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.530
Adding it purple line.

02:00.550 --> 02:01.120
OK.

02:01.130 --> 02:03.350
Now let's come here and let's reverse this.

02:05.640 --> 02:12.360
So now this is like this so it stays condition like 1 2 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 so you have to select the condition.

02:12.360 --> 02:19.100
So if a guy selects like five by 5 then this will be the condition and you can just like

02:22.360 --> 02:28.420
iPhone 5 s or like with Dan..

02:28.690 --> 02:33.400
And here is going to be the price so the price is going to be like six ninety nine and the streak can

02:33.400 --> 02:34.920
be anything.

02:34.930 --> 02:35.740
This right here.

02:35.920 --> 02:36.420
OK.

02:36.580 --> 02:42.580
I have to enter the zip code so zip code will be less and let's add the description.

02:42.630 --> 02:46.660
So that description is going to be like hello world.

02:48.020 --> 02:48.650
OK.

02:48.830 --> 02:52.890
And I'm going to go down and I also have to add an image so for image.

02:52.940 --> 02:58.730
OK I have to just enter at least 15 characters so that right here I'm just going to add an image right

02:58.730 --> 03:04.170
now and the image is going to be I almost had this one.

03:04.170 --> 03:10.170
Now let's go back let's just come here and let's this one.

03:10.480 --> 03:10.850
OK.

03:10.950 --> 03:17.890
So this is a Mac you basically let's add this like EMAC that.

03:18.180 --> 03:22.280
OK I want to come here and I'm going to hit continue right now so you can see this.

03:22.300 --> 03:28.220
I'm is going to be published and the veins are going to appear should be like that.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.250
So you can see this is just showing me the rules and guidelines and everything.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.860
And you're going to come here and I'm going to go and it is just processing and this is late here so

03:36.870 --> 03:42.660
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to view your ad listing so there's like there so there is a condition.

03:42.660 --> 03:49.050
Now this is this and this read city state country Zippos So Alice said it every day so everything is

03:49.050 --> 03:55.020
coming your guys and it is working so great and amazing So basically you have to add the map API key

03:55.080 --> 03:56.340
just to for it to work.

03:56.340 --> 03:57.570
So you have to have that.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.850
OK so I see that everything is working.

04:00.960 --> 04:07.490
We have the tags right now and the tags we can just like tags that image tags we have right now and

04:07.500 --> 04:11.530
the report's going to report everything ok.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.940
I'm like the she's the approved one.

04:14.210 --> 04:17.110
So any proof you can show anything.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.400
And it'll be like

04:21.280 --> 04:24.280
if you go down here it can be like a reply.

04:24.280 --> 04:34.180
So if I just like hello world and I just come here and I just leave it by right here I'm going to come

04:34.190 --> 04:35.330
here and I mean I had this

04:38.700 --> 04:42.300
let's just go to the ads and reports

04:46.430 --> 04:48.760
so I didn't know why it is not showing.

04:48.780 --> 04:52.860
Let's just come here and let's just sit filter OK.

04:53.000 --> 04:53.670
This is right here.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.880
You can see this is how the reporters is working.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.610
So this is I would very specifically.

04:57.650 --> 05:02.850
And also like if an ad is not approved or something like that it might appear here.

05:03.050 --> 05:03.480
OK.

05:03.590 --> 05:08.870
So then we have the importer's so important of words like you can import so many ads at once by the

05:08.870 --> 05:17.020
sea as we so let's just go ahead and let's just download the examples we filed it adds attachment so

05:17.020 --> 05:19.210
let's suppose that this is the CSP file.

05:19.470 --> 05:20.050
OK.

05:20.260 --> 05:21.480
This is the CSP file.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.780
And then I have to just import it.

05:23.830 --> 05:27.000
I'm just going to I'm here I'm going to drag it and I'm going to drop it right here.

05:27.070 --> 05:29.930
And this is right here I'm just going to go and it I'm going to upload file and import.

05:29.940 --> 05:33.470
So it's just going to import every of the ad that we have right now.

05:33.470 --> 05:34.490
So sorry.

05:34.580 --> 05:40.330
Every body sees you file containing a data of all important you say the file must be correct form to

05:40.660 --> 05:42.000
work.

05:42.220 --> 05:43.270
This should go to all ads

05:46.680 --> 05:50.520
and so you can see this is right here.

05:50.520 --> 05:54.000
This is the ad that is already created and we have a software here.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.480
So if we just go ahead and we just open this up in a new tab and see Amasias class-C press team and

06:00.480 --> 06:01.010
everything.

06:01.020 --> 06:06.120
And this is like this is how it is coming so you can just import ads like that so you can see every

06:06.120 --> 06:10.820
ad as being important and everything if I just come here you can see that we have three listing here

06:10.830 --> 06:16.800
we have the added categories and then we have the new listing popular random and even a guy can just

06:16.800 --> 06:17.910
like search here.

06:17.910 --> 06:22.750
So if a guy just want to search for like iPhone he's just going to go out and he's going to search this

06:22.780 --> 06:25.960
you can see it's a search iPhone and return it.

06:26.010 --> 06:26.810
One results.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.740
This is like a phone success or original.

06:28.950 --> 06:29.430
OK.

06:29.610 --> 06:30.270
This is like that.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.380
So you can just pretty well go ahead.

06:32.370 --> 06:36.110
You can just do it and you can see that we just install it.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.230
We just work with it.

06:37.290 --> 06:38.070
And this is done.

06:38.070 --> 06:44.100
So I am just showing you that how everything works and how you can do this and everything so you can

06:44.100 --> 06:45.630
see that we are totally done with this.

06:45.630 --> 06:48.640
You can just add so many ads for that to work.

06:48.780 --> 06:49.160
OK.

06:49.290 --> 06:50.820
So thanks a lot guys for watching this.

06:50.820 --> 06:53.730
And in the next video we'll be working on that more stuff by.
