00:00.930 --> 00:05.470
Hear what is up guys and walk marks are now in this video I'm going to show you that how can you work

00:05.470 --> 00:11.260
for the shop if you just go to shop page right now and you're going to see that we cannot edit this

00:11.260 --> 00:13.290
page down how can we ended this.

00:13.290 --> 00:19.370
You can see there is nothing that says that that visual builder or editor page or anything we cannot

00:19.400 --> 00:20.240
and it did.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.000
How can we edited man.

00:22.150 --> 00:22.900
How can we edited.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.370
I'm going to show you how can you do that.

00:24.370 --> 00:30.700
First of all what you have to do is that you need a plug in and that saves a few multi layout.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.330
OK you have to just go to at any rate here.

00:33.340 --> 00:39.350
And I think we have to basically install a layout for that so I'm just going to go to Vuh multi

00:42.190 --> 00:43.220
lecture.

00:43.400 --> 00:51.480
We're just going to just add all multi I only hope this is the plug in.

00:51.770 --> 00:58.460
It's been like a month where more than month I haven't used that plug so related products were multi

01:00.870 --> 01:04.380
Yeah this is the one product might be labeled light.

01:04.410 --> 01:06.320
This is the one that we have to work right now.

01:06.450 --> 01:10.860
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit install right now and that should be installed.

01:11.070 --> 01:15.520
I'm just going to go ahead then and I'm going to activate this so let's just activate.

01:15.990 --> 01:18.210
And so this will be activated so

01:23.160 --> 01:24.140
this is right here.

01:24.480 --> 01:24.840
OK.

01:24.930 --> 01:32.950
I want to go to the settings right now and then we can see that the shop page is now currently disabled.

01:33.030 --> 01:37.490
OK redirect redirect commers shop page to display product page for commerce.

01:37.500 --> 01:42.660
If someone goes to our shop page then we want to redirect him to another page.

01:42.660 --> 01:49.680
So if I just go to the ShopRite Now OK I just go to you right now.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.910
And then you can see that this is how it is looking.

01:53.910 --> 02:00.510
So what I want to do if someone comes to my shop page that he should be redirected to another page and

02:00.510 --> 02:05.280
that would be the product page itself so I'm just going to go to the all pages and I'm going to create

02:05.280 --> 02:05.940
a new page.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.860
Ok I have to do this in the new.

02:08.010 --> 02:10.200
I have to open up again.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.380
So let's just create a new product and that will be the shop.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.070
OK.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.930
And this we're going to name it as products.

02:16.960 --> 02:17.300
OK.

02:17.340 --> 02:18.230
The product.

02:18.220 --> 02:28.870
So here we want to go ahead and we want to publish this so you can see this should be published.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.960
It just takes some time and it will be done.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.320
You can see this is right here.

02:32.380 --> 02:37.160
I'm going to change the link of this from shop dasht due to product.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.110
So I'm just going to come here.

02:38.110 --> 02:40.880
I'm going to head product OK.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.120
I'm products and I'm going to hit.

02:43.140 --> 02:43.530
OK.

02:43.530 --> 02:49.400
So if someone comes to my shop page then you would be automatically redirected to the product.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.450
So that's what I'm saying.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.250
If I just go to settings right now.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.650
OK I have to open this up in a new way.

02:54.810 --> 02:55.580
But no problem.

02:55.580 --> 03:00.540
OK so if someone opens up my shop page then he should be redirected to the products.

03:00.590 --> 03:03.060
That is that should be ok.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.350
I have to refresh this

03:10.790 --> 03:14.250
I should be having that thing that part of it.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.820
This is the show page.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.940
So if someone comes to my shop page then he should be redirected to my shop.

03:20.220 --> 03:26.500
OK well let's just go ahead and let's refresh this I hope it invites

03:31.740 --> 03:38.490
that is redirecting me to Shaab dash to what does the show does do they just created a new page and

03:38.490 --> 03:39.920
that was the product.

03:39.960 --> 03:46.000
So if I just go to this right now and I just sit at it then you can see it should be shot.

03:46.150 --> 03:49.070
Datcha OK so it is Shabd that still we haven't edited this.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.540
I have to change this to products OK.

03:52.670 --> 03:54.190
And then I have to hit OK.

03:55.540 --> 03:55.760
OK.

03:55.780 --> 04:01.890
This is done and now I'm going to update.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.170
I hope this is done.

04:04.350 --> 04:04.620
OK.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.520
This is done right now.

04:05.630 --> 04:07.820
And now I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to visit my shop.

04:07.850 --> 04:13.790
So on visiting my shop page you will see that if anyone goes to my shop page you will be automatically

04:13.790 --> 04:16.200
redirected to my product spates.

04:16.230 --> 04:18.540
So you can see this is redirected to my products.

04:18.590 --> 04:21.800
And now I'm going to design this page with visual builder.

04:21.830 --> 04:23.460
This is how it's going to work.

04:23.600 --> 04:23.840
OK.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.610
You have to just drop this plug in multi multi-layer out and then you have to just check that.

04:27.610 --> 04:32.750
So if someone goes to your shop baggage then you should be automatically redirected to the products.

04:32.810 --> 04:33.500
This is the link.

04:33.590 --> 04:34.020
OK.

04:34.070 --> 04:36.680
So we have two pages that we have right now.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.040
OK.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.760
We have the shop and the shop.

04:38.850 --> 04:43.380
OK this one and this one but this one permalink is totally different in this one the is the default

04:43.500 --> 04:45.740
commers plug in that we can not edit.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.250
C'mon we want to edit it.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.720
So that is why I just switched to this plug in.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.480
I know what it might be so confusing to you.

04:51.500 --> 04:57.020
Let me explain that to you again if we just disable this plug in and then we go to shop Bache you will

04:57.020 --> 05:02.630
see that Freeville open this will open up a normal shop that is fully created by Vuh commerce and we

05:02.660 --> 05:05.090
cannot be edited.

05:05.280 --> 05:05.660
OK.

05:05.810 --> 05:06.850
I want to edit it.

05:07.010 --> 05:07.950
What I do.

05:08.030 --> 05:09.950
I will just install this.

05:09.980 --> 05:15.620
Multi-layer out plug in so that if someone goes to this page he will be redirected to another page.

05:15.620 --> 05:20.480
And then here I can design this page with Vuh commerce using this visual builder.

05:20.630 --> 05:21.020
OK.

05:21.140 --> 05:23.590
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to design this Fisher builder.

05:23.690 --> 05:28.510
But first I have to just go to multi-legged and I'm going to add new layouts.

05:28.520 --> 05:33.560
Then I can just let it be that I can also add a slider here I can add an image mean sure that's going

05:33.560 --> 05:33.950
to tell me that.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.050
Welcome to our shop.

05:35.060 --> 05:40.400
And we welcome you or something like that so you can see this is how we have every now and this will

05:40.400 --> 05:44.550
be my mean shop page layout.

05:44.570 --> 05:44.980
OK.

05:45.260 --> 05:48.670
So what I'm going to do right now make sure that this is selected.

05:48.830 --> 05:51.720
So we have three right here and is going to select the create one.

05:51.830 --> 05:52.210
OK.

05:52.340 --> 05:53.930
And then we have the primary color.

05:53.930 --> 05:57.580
This is like box list table columns background color.

05:57.920 --> 06:05.590
So primary color Hulver border color and border color and everything so you can see this a select product.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.640
It is going to select all the product.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.420
You can also select the product from there.

06:09.530 --> 06:09.980
OK.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.910
Like you can select seat feature product sale products or everything.

06:14.030 --> 06:15.720
I'm going to select all the products.

06:16.190 --> 06:19.020
So we have two options to basically work for this.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.500
I'm just going to show you both methods that how can you design this show page.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.190
The first one is this and the other one is using the DV builder.

06:25.190 --> 06:27.140
I'm going to show you both D'Amato is doing very you.

06:27.150 --> 06:28.890
OK.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.470
And then we have the borders.

06:30.500 --> 06:35.330
So this is the border sais we have the number of columns so I want basically four columns.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.670
OK suppose number of columns tablet.

06:37.670 --> 06:43.910
So on tablet it would show two columns in number of columns on mobile patrol one column front and order

06:43.910 --> 06:44.790
by filter.

06:44.840 --> 06:49.150
Ok so this will be enable front page anation would also be enabled.

06:49.310 --> 06:53.100
And then we have select product product query options or pay.

06:53.120 --> 06:58.860
So this will be all product all product all tags stock would be all data range would be all and everything.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.720
And now here I can just work with this.

07:01.730 --> 07:08.000
So basically we have the product image here to product image would be effect it would be zoom in.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
So how this will work is that if I bring my mouse over there then the image would be zoomed OK and the

07:14.000 --> 07:16.580
image size is going to be

07:19.310 --> 07:21.990
the medium medium size should be the image.

07:22.030 --> 07:25.200
Okay like 300 by 300 and then we have the product ideal.

07:25.230 --> 07:26.910
So product title would be text.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.760
Ok the font family would be like open translation shoes.

07:30.810 --> 07:31.160
Okay.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.010
And then we have the font size right here.

07:33.090 --> 07:36.810
We have the color the color and then we have the product price.

07:36.820 --> 07:42.560
So product prices here at two card is here and we also have to add two cards and so on we have this

07:42.610 --> 07:49.600
right here this classes that we can use so this is the background color I think I do know why I cannot

07:49.600 --> 07:50.860
see it and it is going to go ahead.

07:50.860 --> 07:57.750
I'm going to make the background color to be the brown full brown ok and I'm going to make descaler

07:57.750 --> 07:58.890
to be white.

07:59.010 --> 07:59.910
So let's see that.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.140
What is this.

08:01.140 --> 08:04.540
Is this a background color or whatever so we'll just wait for this later on.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.240
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit publish right now so you can see this is published.

08:09.240 --> 08:09.680
OK.

08:09.750 --> 08:15.020
Now what I have to do I have just come here and I have to copy this copy this code right now from here.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.430
Well Robert Rubin what is open.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.170
I'm going to come here.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.940
I'm going to capias copy.

08:21.050 --> 08:22.380
Come gum.

08:22.430 --> 08:24.210
Come on.

08:24.770 --> 08:30.800
And so here and this is the products page that is the page that we have created our self and we are

08:30.800 --> 08:33.080
going to design it so I'm just going to open this up right now.

08:33.110 --> 08:43.410
And here I am going to you working up with I'm going to add a code here basically.

08:43.490 --> 08:43.950
OK.

08:44.280 --> 08:48.590
Let me show you how this is going to work and how can you then edit it completely.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.890
So this is loading.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.400
We have to wait for some time.

08:51.450 --> 08:53.790
And you guys just are going to be shocked.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.870
OK you guys are going to be like oh my Or this is so amazing.

08:56.910 --> 09:00.830
I'm just going to add a full row here and then I'm going to add a code.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.520
So in the code I'm going to add this chord.

09:03.580 --> 09:10.380
OK let's add this and let's paste it and you can see that it should be here.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.270
So we have to wait for some time.

09:12.270 --> 09:15.150
So this is done MMD you can see how this is look.

09:15.160 --> 09:20.990
So this is looking like this showing one of three results the fold starting show.

09:21.110 --> 09:26.510
Bert Bates you can see how this is looking if pring memos here the image is increasing and this is what

09:26.520 --> 09:27.090
it is looking at.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.840
We have ADD to card are done as well.

09:34.490 --> 09:38.210
So you can see how everything is looking and it is looking pretty well.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.780
We have also the pagination right here.

09:40.790 --> 09:41.210
OK.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.450
And it is also showing the products right here.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.480
So we have.

09:44.520 --> 09:48.740
The default that this one that says I'm disordering.

09:48.860 --> 09:53.150
And then we have the short default per page so you can select how many you want to show.

09:53.150 --> 09:59.950
So let's just save it right now and let's just open this page up so if we just go to seven Kambli that

09:59.960 --> 10:04.460
will be course dot com slash shop then it's going to redirect us to the products page.

10:04.460 --> 10:04.930
OK.

10:05.150 --> 10:10.430
So this is because of this that we have the settings in here that if someone goes here then we have

10:10.430 --> 10:10.740
this.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.190
This is how our shop page is looking.

10:13.340 --> 10:19.850
OK we have showing one of 12:23 results and we have the fault sure Burbidge So I'm just going to select

10:19.880 --> 10:23.360
15 to 15 products per page right now.

10:23.650 --> 10:24.050
OK.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.010
This is how it is working.

10:25.010 --> 10:29.930
So this is very you can select it to be like default a show all products per page and it's going to

10:29.930 --> 10:35.370
show all the products so you can see every product is being shown this is how it works.

10:35.420 --> 10:39.790
And if I choose default then it's going to show the 12 products I think or the 16.

10:40.120 --> 10:44.380
Then if you go to the page 2 then you can see that it's going to take us to page two.

10:44.540 --> 10:49.770
And this is how it is working so we have the order by as well that how you want the sorting to be.

10:49.940 --> 10:55.040
So this is our ad breaks and everything looks pretty Velle I think and this is diesen date.

10:55.160 --> 10:59.450
At least the previous version of the show page that we were using.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.340
I know it looks super awesome guys this looks so great.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.340
OK so now we have to work with this burden right here you can see this is right here.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.930
This does not look good.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.710
So what I'm going to do right now I am just going to go to this right here.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.440
I'm going to go down and take the burden.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.770
I want to change this to be the brown.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.990
So I see this to be Brown as well.

11:21.380 --> 11:21.890
And

11:26.450 --> 11:27.570
this is the whole vernacular.

11:27.630 --> 11:27.970
OK.

11:28.070 --> 11:32.050
So if I bring my mouse here OK this should be OK.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.760
This should be brown.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.250
This should be read here.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.490
This is a background color.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.130
This is the background color you can see.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.330
So I'm on the background color to be brown.

11:41.480 --> 11:41.910
OK.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.870
And I want the actual color to be right.

11:45.080 --> 11:45.670
OK.

11:45.680 --> 11:51.140
And if someone hovers over it OK then if someone hovers over there then the background covert color

11:51.500 --> 11:55.740
will be basically it will turn to white.

11:56.030 --> 11:58.000
The background color is going to be black.

11:58.210 --> 11:58.670
OK.

11:58.730 --> 12:00.020
So this is our work.

12:00.140 --> 12:05.040
OK we have this and I'm going to change the foreign tapes to be 17 pixel.

12:05.900 --> 12:11.360
OK let's just go ahead and let's update our beat and now let's come here and let's refresh this so I'm

12:11.360 --> 12:16.610
just going to go to this default product space so you can see this is how my product page will be.

12:16.670 --> 12:23.650
I can see how this is looking OK we have a totally up and running add two card Britain.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.200
Ok this is how it is looking.

12:25.200 --> 12:29.570
Everything works pretty well and the whole effect is also working.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.710
OK so you can just go with a fun family.

12:34.710 --> 12:40.980
I'm just going to go with open sounds and the font size so you can just choose it to be 11 pixels if

12:40.980 --> 12:42.400
you need it to be shorter.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.270
And then you get to go ahead and let's hit this date.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.930
So let's get here and let's just for the first test and test it out.

12:48.930 --> 12:51.960
So basically you're going to test at how it is looking.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.580
So we have this raid here.

12:53.610 --> 12:58.080
This right here this right here this is how the two card Britain is looking OK.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.460
And everything is looking pretty well here.

13:05.140 --> 13:09.590
So instead of this at two card button I just want to bring the read more button.

13:09.610 --> 13:10.210
OK.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.680
I'm just going to drag it down below here.

13:12.990 --> 13:14.020
The product price.

13:14.020 --> 13:17.610
And here I'm going to just delete this add to card.

13:17.620 --> 13:23.040
Let's just come here and let's just make the changes so for this I need the background color to be brown.

13:23.560 --> 13:23.950
OK.

13:23.950 --> 13:25.440
And this should be white.

13:25.880 --> 13:26.550
OK.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.670
I'm going to come here and on the Hoover.

13:28.690 --> 13:35.230
I need the background color to be brown and I need this to be this and this should be by

13:38.050 --> 13:44.240
so how this will work is that it will take them to the product page not it will directly add to the

13:44.240 --> 13:44.620
cart.

13:44.630 --> 13:47.550
So let's just delete it and you can see this is how it is.

13:47.570 --> 13:53.360
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to hit the rate now and let's just come here and let's refresh

13:53.360 --> 13:55.790
this page to test that how it's going to look.

14:02.130 --> 14:07.410
So you can see this is how it is looking we have the buy now button and if someone clicks here you can

14:07.410 --> 14:13.010
see he's directly redirected to that and we are also not showing that arrow there.

14:13.140 --> 14:17.650
So you can see how this is looking this is looking pretty cool pretty well pretty awesome.

14:17.910 --> 14:22.690
Ok if you just go back to the shop again OK.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.080
And then you can see how that is looking.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.230
So this is the normal button.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.020
OK.

14:28.170 --> 14:30.950
I'm just going to change the color of that on Hoover.

14:30.960 --> 14:35.400
I'm just going to make sure that if someone brings his mouse then the colors should be turned to black.

14:35.610 --> 14:36.000
OK.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.510
So let's come here and let's just go ahead and let's it a.

14:39.510 --> 14:43.010
So I hope that you guys do know about the whole witing effect.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.590
That how it works.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.030
OK.

14:45.180 --> 14:46.710
So this is our shop basically.

14:46.830 --> 14:50.830
If I bring them out here you can see that the color is changing.

14:51.030 --> 14:52.590
And this works pretty well.

14:52.590 --> 14:53.460
I'm just going to go ahead.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.110
I'm going to make sure that it is 11 pixels.

14:57.150 --> 14:57.510
OK.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.750
So I want to make it a bit shorter.

14:59.760 --> 15:04.850
So let's go from here and let's just for this.

15:04.880 --> 15:10.230
So here now you can see this is now a bit smaller and it looks pretty cool.

15:11.350 --> 15:11.670
OK.

15:11.950 --> 15:17.050
So we have so much things that we can bring in we can bring in the Autour the product table the product

15:17.050 --> 15:24.760
image product price product EXOR product content category product dogs to S.K. you start Carneades stock

15:24.760 --> 15:27.880
status read more button and the line break.

15:27.880 --> 15:31.610
So this is what you can bring.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.520
I think I should also bring a line break here.

15:34.680 --> 15:40.410
So this should be like it would give more spacing here and indeed there is no spacing.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.350
So I just want to add the line break.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.560
I'm just going to go ahead I'm going to hit a beat right now and let's see if there is some spacing

15:46.560 --> 15:48.900
down below.

15:48.970 --> 15:50.510
So let's wait till this is done.

15:50.520 --> 15:54.490
Ok now I'm going to go ahead I'm going to rephrase dissipates so let's see how much spacing we have.

15:54.490 --> 15:56.280
So this is just like this.

15:56.290 --> 15:56.970
OK.

15:56.980 --> 16:02.160
We have this is how the line break is we have every line break here and this is how this worked.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.960
And so you can have it if you want to.

16:04.170 --> 16:05.250
OK.

16:07.290 --> 16:09.970
But I will be just from doing it because it doesn't look good.

16:09.990 --> 16:11.010
I'm just going to go ahead.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.260
I am going to just

16:17.980 --> 16:25.530
OK let's come here and let's just sit up date and let's just read first so you can see how this is looking

16:25.900 --> 16:26.340
OK.

16:26.520 --> 16:31.010
What I want to do right now more in that is the

16:35.660 --> 16:36.960
product displayed Burpy.

16:36.980 --> 16:43.160
So this is showing twelth products Burpy so you can see only we have 12 products so you can just control

16:43.160 --> 16:45.350
that how many products you want to show here.

16:45.350 --> 16:47.450
OK so this is how you can work with it.

16:47.450 --> 16:51.920
Now what I want to do right now is that I need to show a sidebar.

16:52.040 --> 16:52.580
OK.

16:52.580 --> 16:56.140
That is important because I want my site to look amazing.

16:56.210 --> 17:01.040
So what I'm going to do right now I'm just going to come here and I'm going to make it's just like this

17:01.460 --> 17:02.360
just like this.

17:02.360 --> 17:02.750
OK.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.680
So we have this is turned to like this.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.860
And here we can add the sidebar.

17:06.890 --> 17:09.040
So I'm just going to add new module.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.380
And here I'm going to search for sidebar.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.270
OK.

17:12.620 --> 17:13.500
This is right here.

17:13.550 --> 17:17.250
And here you can either bring your sidebar here or you can bring his side right there.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.260
So it totally depends.

17:18.260 --> 17:22.180
I think I'll just remove it from here.

17:22.320 --> 17:27.210
Well just remove it and let's change this size to be like it should be here.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.080
The big board should be here.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.440
Let's just bring it to here.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.860
And the sidebar should be here.

17:31.860 --> 17:37.160
So I just wanted the say bird to be on the left side not in the right right.

17:37.290 --> 17:41.880
Because mostly e-commerce sites do have the sidebar on the left side so I'm just going to grab the sidebar

17:41.880 --> 17:42.420
right now.

17:42.450 --> 17:43.070
OK.

17:43.140 --> 17:48.510
Just go to sidebar so the sidebar will be here.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.230
OK.

17:49.260 --> 17:53.910
You can see how this is looking so cool guys so amazing.

17:54.120 --> 17:54.780
OK.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.630
We have the background image so if you want to add a background.

17:57.900 --> 18:01.380
We have the content so you can select which side bar you want here.

18:01.380 --> 18:05.010
I just want us to like the site better than all that type of body that we have.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.270
OK.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.630
I'm going to go to design right now and we have the layout.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.450
So show borders praetor.

18:10.460 --> 18:11.420
I'm is going to remove it.

18:11.430 --> 18:15.520
I don't want to show the water separator and the orientation is left.

18:15.540 --> 18:16.970
We have the facts straight here.

18:16.980 --> 18:21.800
The title text the body takes the sizing the spacing the border and everything so I didn't think so

18:21.810 --> 18:26.470
if you need to just style or sidebar a bit and everything looks pretty cool.

18:26.490 --> 18:26.850
OK.

18:26.970 --> 18:34.680
What I wanted to add above here I just want to add a thing that says Welcome to our shop or a call to

18:34.680 --> 18:35.200
action.

18:35.340 --> 18:35.700
OK.

18:35.850 --> 18:42.830
So what I'm going to do for Dad I am just going to come here and I'm going out in U.S. So this will

18:42.830 --> 18:43.970
be a full.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.800
It will get hotter.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.300
So this is the fourth hattery that I have added.

18:48.350 --> 18:57.170
And I just need an image so the image is going to tell me that what he is so I need the image you are

18:57.210 --> 18:59.470

18:59.600 --> 19:01.790

19:02.300 --> 19:09.100

19:20.350 --> 19:21.780
You can see how this is looking.

19:21.910 --> 19:29.760
I just want to come here to text right now and I'm going to hit the wall come to our shop.

19:30.230 --> 19:30.700
OK.

19:30.780 --> 19:31.950

19:32.070 --> 19:35.370
Now here I would just want to grab this right above.

19:35.370 --> 19:38.950
So it should be above their OK.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.790
This is like this.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.740
I just wanna create this Fitbit not like this.

19:44.750 --> 19:50.000

19:51.620 --> 19:56.410
I want to go to the speccing spacing.

19:56.570 --> 19:56.940
OK.

19:57.050 --> 19:59.360
And let's give the padding from the top and the bottom.
