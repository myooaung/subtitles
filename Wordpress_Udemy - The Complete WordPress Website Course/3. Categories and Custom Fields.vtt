WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:05.610
Hear all these guys and Malcolm X and now you can see that in the video we were fed our settings and

00:05.610 --> 00:08.220
in this video we will be working up in this whole lab said OK.

00:08.220 --> 00:12.120
So as you can see that in the premise video we removed the toolbar.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.150
Say this site is Beldon more press.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.160
And here is the thing and here is also the Wordpress logo.

00:17.190 --> 00:18.040
So I removed it.

00:18.150 --> 00:22.330
And now if you want to go to the dashboard we just have to type W.P. dash admen.

00:22.380 --> 00:22.840
OK.

00:22.980 --> 00:27.510
We have to ride this and then we have to hit enter and it's going to take us to the new page where here

00:27.510 --> 00:30.040
we can edit our whole website.

00:30.200 --> 00:30.610
OK.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.490
So you can see everything is right here.

00:32.490 --> 00:37.750
I'm just logged my logged in here and this is just pictures coming from the Krevin dot com.

00:37.950 --> 00:42.280
OK so now we first we have to do is that we have to the for you.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.190
We work for the settings right now.

00:44.340 --> 00:44.740
OK.

00:44.790 --> 00:48.400
So you can just design your website completely from here and everything.

00:48.540 --> 00:52.340
But now what we have to do is that we have to work with the ads.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.810
And if you're going to add the advertisement.

00:54.990 --> 01:01.250
OK what is the first thing that we always add and that is the categories.

01:01.260 --> 01:01.680
OK.

01:01.770 --> 01:08.490
So whether we want to add products whether we want to add post whether we want to add the media the

01:08.490 --> 01:16.100
media none at no I'm sorry the portfolio we always add the categories and these categories where it's

01:16.170 --> 01:17.530
exactly the same.

01:17.650 --> 01:19.090
All of the post category.

01:19.190 --> 01:19.560
OK.

01:19.620 --> 01:20.220
So let's get started.

01:20.220 --> 01:22.650
First of all we have to enter the name right here.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.760
The name is going to be

01:29.960 --> 01:35.210
phones mobile phones.

01:35.650 --> 01:40.380
OK I'm here I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to add in categories so let's just add a category

01:40.380 --> 01:40.890
very fast.

01:40.890 --> 01:41.820
OK.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.960
I'm just going to add one more and that will be electronics

01:48.850 --> 01:49.930
electronic devices

01:54.000 --> 01:59.280
gaming devices gaming devices we have right now.

01:59.490 --> 02:05.180
And then I want to what you say properties

02:08.090 --> 02:11.620
so you can also create a whole property based website as well.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.090
OK.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.880
I just have to trade subcategories of property like the area of ideas you can create the category or

02:17.880 --> 02:18.590
something like that.

02:18.600 --> 02:24.690
And then you can even assign them like if anyone wants to search area by use and then you can even create

02:24.690 --> 02:26.930
a website for it like property base.

02:26.940 --> 02:30.820
It can also create a Web site like whole gaming devices based there.

02:30.990 --> 02:37.770
You just sell the gaming stuff where you just sell the gaming CD's like gaming accessories like if you

02:37.770 --> 02:38.730
have xbox one.

02:38.730 --> 02:45.730
Just like I want to sell the Xbox controller like I have an extra and I just want to sell it.

02:46.050 --> 02:49.120
You guys already know that they are so much expensive.

02:49.260 --> 02:50.360
So this is what I mean.

02:50.490 --> 02:51.020
OK.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.180
We have everything right here.

02:53.310 --> 02:57.240
Just one more one more.

02:57.580 --> 03:02.940
And that will be like cars cars and bikes.

03:03.180 --> 03:05.130
So we have these categories right now.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.090
Now we're going to go out and I'm going to hit on new category.

03:07.170 --> 03:10.530
And you can see these categories are right here and running.

03:10.530 --> 03:14.510
So you could see that if we just let's just go ahead and let's just review all this.

03:14.500 --> 03:22.370
So in the end U.S. we can just ride the ad OK but will not add the advertisement from here.

03:22.470 --> 03:26.540
OK because this is the page where only admin can add.

03:26.590 --> 03:27.890
Ok not a user.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.920
So you guys already know that how a user can add and video.

03:31.950 --> 03:37.700
OK if you just come here in here to post an ad he'd just come here and he's created listing.

03:37.770 --> 03:44.000
So he's like the categories so it is bikes cars electronic devices game devices mobile phones properties

03:44.010 --> 03:44.940
he just like dead.

03:45.060 --> 03:50.130
And then he added Sergei's This is how it works and if you're so amazing you know one can see no one

03:50.130 --> 03:52.960
can tell that this website is based on wordpress.

03:52.970 --> 03:53.550
OK.

03:54.020 --> 03:58.860
I know you don't have to build a website like this but if a client say like and he has a small budget

03:58.890 --> 04:03.480
and he just want to go with the press and he can build anything this website is so amazing guys like

04:03.690 --> 04:05.110
me don't have to do anything.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.180
Just go ahead you just add the categories and then you just leave it.

04:08.190 --> 04:13.400
And then clients can come in this year and then they can just pose the advertisement and that's all.

04:13.590 --> 04:14.020
OK.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.850
So you have to make some changes like here you have to change.

04:16.860 --> 04:19.930
I told you you can change it in the settings.

04:20.100 --> 04:20.540
OK.

04:20.670 --> 04:26.610
So then you have the all ads so the all ads you're going to see all the advertisement that you're having

04:26.610 --> 04:26.780
now.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.440
So it's a test title.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.800
This is the ad that we take that we added.

04:30.810 --> 04:32.310
This is the image that is coming.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.000
Is my first classified ad.

04:34.020 --> 04:36.040
I'm just going to go in and I'm going to remove this ad.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.260
So just we have only one.

04:38.490 --> 04:39.160
OK.

04:39.300 --> 04:39.690
We have.

04:39.690 --> 04:44.880
And now we have the form so let's just come here to the forms right now and Thursday's formally Owch

04:44.970 --> 04:47.760
allow you to create your own custom add to it.

04:47.790 --> 04:54.300
Each one is essentially a container for all your fields and can be applied to one or all of your categories

04:54.300 --> 04:54.820
or pay.

04:54.870 --> 05:00.780
So if I just come here and I just add a new form then here you can see make it should be farm name farm

05:00.780 --> 05:03.200
description and available categories.

05:03.210 --> 05:06.770
And then I can just go ahead and I can just select that so let's just go ahead.

05:06.960 --> 05:11.880
And what it means that if someone comes here and he just like that like bikes so we can create a new

05:11.880 --> 05:17.610
form for like bikes like what is the model of the bike or what is it being like.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.050
OK let's just create it.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.010
And let me show you this will be like bike in car from

05:26.160 --> 05:28.180
OK here.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.090
I'm just going to like this and this.

05:30.090 --> 05:30.650
OK.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.780
And this is the active I'm going to go in and I'm going to create new foam.

05:33.870 --> 05:37.200
So this is like here in here I can create my phone.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.890
OK I'm just gonna come here.

05:38.980 --> 05:41.050
I had this.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.450
When I come here to form right now I'm going to come here.

05:45.390 --> 05:50.130
And I'm going to just added the family out.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.380
So here we have this.

05:51.450 --> 05:51.750
OK.

05:51.760 --> 06:00.390
It's a title required price required street city state country Postal Code Description and everything.

06:00.420 --> 06:00.860
OK.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.500
So what I wanted to add one more.

06:02.610 --> 06:03.000
OK.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.790
So I just want to add a region size feedback currency does want to add this.

06:09.890 --> 06:13.370
So here let's suppose that I want to add I'm like a model.

06:13.370 --> 06:15.920
It's like what is the model of the bike in car.

06:16.190 --> 06:19.660
And vending was destroyed basically.

06:19.790 --> 06:20.300
OK.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.530
I'm sorry guys I do Stemmer a lot sometimes.

06:22.670 --> 06:26.180
OK so what I have to do here is the available feels that is coming.

06:26.180 --> 06:26.700
OK.

06:26.810 --> 06:31.730
I just have to go to the custom field and I and I just want to add a new field so this will be like

06:31.820 --> 06:34.170
a model and there are registered date.

06:34.180 --> 06:39.750
So the feeling is going to be model and the field tooltip.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.020
This is basically called a tool.

06:41.050 --> 06:43.960
So like if I just hold my mouse you're here it's gives a tool.

06:44.030 --> 06:48.650
OK here it's going to be when.

06:49.150 --> 06:54.770
So you can just add it like your bike manyfold.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.820
I think this is basically called the model and the manufacture date or something like that.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.190
And then we have the field type.

07:00.190 --> 07:04.180
So it is going to be like text box dropdown text area radio button checkbox.

07:04.180 --> 07:05.840
See you guys already know.

07:05.840 --> 07:09.060
I just wanted to be like text box so this will be like an input box like this.

07:09.080 --> 07:09.500
OK.

07:09.620 --> 07:13.640
And I'm just gonna go in and I'm going to have a create new field so this field is going to be created

07:13.640 --> 07:14.090
right now.

07:14.120 --> 07:20.300
I'm just going to come here and let's just go to basically to do it and I did it and it is this one

07:20.300 --> 07:20.930
right here.

07:21.010 --> 07:25.080
I'm just going to I'm here in I'm going to rephrase this so this is refreshed right now.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.360
And here we should be having this.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.440
Yes this is right here.

07:27.440 --> 07:28.270
It's a model.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.560
You're going to come here and I'm going to add fields to Fomalhaut So this right here I'm just going

07:33.560 --> 07:39.300
to go ahead and I'm going to bring this right here so that I'm the person also has to give his model.

07:39.300 --> 07:45.170
So because this is important and if you're going to go in and I'm going to say so now here if anyone

07:45.170 --> 07:49.180
is going to come up and he just add it like bike.

07:49.220 --> 07:55.780
So on the bike he just go to dispraise and then we ask him one more thing and this is called the model.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.170
So this is important guys.

07:57.290 --> 07:58.150
This is so important.

07:58.160 --> 08:04.850
You you just have to ask more questions like this and for like cars if you just come your way just go

08:05.250 --> 08:08.080
and you can see here we will ask them the model.

08:08.090 --> 08:09.190
So this is how it works.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.580
We just go down go back sorry and we just come here to

08:18.400 --> 08:19.350
the mobile phones.

08:19.360 --> 08:27.430
So in the mobile phones you can create a new listing or create a new custom field that can be like the

08:27.430 --> 08:33.100
condition like radio or conditions so you can just show your condition that what is the condition like

08:33.280 --> 08:36.790
one by ten two by ten three by ten for about 10.

08:36.790 --> 08:43.000
So this is you can add it like four more user input and then when a user will come they will just easily

08:43.000 --> 08:43.760
understand this.

08:43.780 --> 08:47.780
And you you don't have to add everything in this in the description.

08:47.830 --> 08:51.160
Everything will be here on the sidebar that says model and everything.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.770
So this is you can make it required as well.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.750
You guys already know how to make it required.

08:55.870 --> 08:56.350
OK.

08:56.410 --> 09:00.240
Like just clicking here and saving the changes and that will be marked as required.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.670
So it works OK.

09:03.050 --> 09:05.600
So now you can see that we are totally done with this.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.840
So thanks a lot guys who are watching this Stadion and Bebai.
