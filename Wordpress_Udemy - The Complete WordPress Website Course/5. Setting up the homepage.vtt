00:47.870 --> 00:49.850
OK.

00:50.030 --> 00:54.490
And here you can see that we can customize our whole web site.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.010
OK.

00:55.010 --> 00:59.240
So first thing we have to just come here to the home base setting and then we have to go to the aesthetic

00:59.240 --> 00:59.600
Bage.

00:59.630 --> 01:05.110

01:41.160 --> 01:45.820
and you can see that my web site is basically based on a Boggs layout.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.130
So if you want to create a very safe like this you can also create it.

01:49.140 --> 01:54.660
But nowadays people don't create these type of say the box layout to make sure that you use this one
